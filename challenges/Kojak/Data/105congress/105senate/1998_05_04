Mr. President, I want to say once again how much I \nappreciated the cooperation that I received from Senators on both sides \nof the aisle last week. I think last week was a very good week for the \nSenate. We completed the NATO enlargement debate, and I thought it was \na good debate. I thought the Senate showed a great deal of seriousness \nand maturity in the way they handled the final phases and cast their \nvotes on Thursday night.\n  We also completed action on the supplemental appropriations bill, \nwhich has gone to the President. That way, we will have the funds we \nneed for the defense of our country and to assist with natural \ndisasters that have hit any number of States over the past few months.\n  Also, on Friday, we did have debate on the workplace development \nbill--all debate except for the final 1 hour. All amendments were \nhandled. I believe there were five or six amendments that had been \npending. So Senator Jeffords, Senator DeWine, and others did a good job \ngetting that debate done on Friday. We will pick that bill back up at \n4:30 on Tuesday. There will be 1 hour of debate, followed by final \npassage on the Workplace Development Act at 5:30 on Tuesday.\n  Following morning business this morning, the Senate will begin \nconsideration then of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform and restructuring bill, \nfor debate only. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor to \noffer opening statements and debate this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4143-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4143-S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRS REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as a member of the Finance Committee, once \nagain, last week I found the hearings on IRS enlightening, in fact, \nhorrifying. We had witness after witness come in and put their own jobs \nand reputations on the line--if they were IRS employees--to talk about \nthe protection system of mismanagement and misconduct within IRS. We \nhad small businessmen come forward and talk about businesses being \nraided--in one instance, I think by 64 gun-carrying IRS agents and U.S. \nmarshals--when they had done nothing wrong. We heard great detail about \nthe efforts that have been gone to by management to protect misconduct.\n  Finally, we heard of targeting of political officials or public \nofficials for audits or for, in one case, an effort to show that this \nperson had been laundering money, and it was not true. Senator Howard \nBaker, the great former majority leader, came before the committee and \ntold what he had experienced--by the way, even though he was under a \nlot of pressure not to do so.\n  We clearly have a culture of intimidation and misconduct at the IRS. \nIt is not something that has just developed; it has been growing and \ngetting worse for the past 15 years. We need serious IRS reform. The \nHouse-passed legislation made a major step in the right direction last \nyear, but we have found a lot more abuses. We have come up with more \nthings that need to be done to make the IRS genuinely representative of \nwhat the people expect them to be--that is, to do their job, which is \nnot easy, and to protect the truly hard-working and honest IRS agents \nwho are doing their jobs every day, some who came forward and pointed \nout where problems have been.\n  We have learned a lot and have come up with some good legislation. \nThere will be some relevant amendments that will need to be offered and \ndebated and voted on. I hope we can come to an agreement that will not \nallow this bill to become one that is attacked by poison pills or cause \nits delay or destruction. The American people want this IRS reform. I \nthink to get off in a debate of unrelated issues--whether it is trade \nissues, many of which I may be for, or health issues, or whatever--\nwould be a big mistake. We ought to have a good debate this Monday and \nTuesday. We ought to complete this IRS debate by Wednesday or Thursday \nnight, at the latest. We were able to get our job done last week. I \nhope we can do it again this week.\n\n  Now, in addition to those bills, on Thursday or Friday we may try to \ntake up a couple of other issues. It will depend on how the debate \ngoes. The agriculture research conference report is\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nsomething we might try to get up Thursday night or Friday, or not later \nthan next Monday. We also have pending before us a number of other \nimportant bills, including the higher education legislation and nuclear \nwaste. So there are a number of bills that are waiting.\n  Again, I ask for the cooperation of the Senators on both sides of the \naisle to work with the chairman of the Finance Committee and ranking \nmember to get an agreement on how we can proceed. Let's have a good \ndebate, relevant amendments, and let's complete this job.\n  Even the President, who originally resisted IRS reform, on his radio \nshow Saturday said what has been happening at IRS is outrageous and \nthat we should act on this legislation and get it to him as quickly as \npossible. I hope we will move forward, now that we have him involved in \nthis effort, and complete this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I note that there are no Senators waiting to speak. I \nbelieve the managers of the legislation will be here at noon. From now \nuntil noon will be a period of morning business.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4143-5", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to visit about a couple of things \nthis morning. First, I want to talk about the highway bill that is in \nconference between the House and the Senate. It is now May 4, 1998. The \nhighway bill, or a piece of legislation people commonly refer to as \nISTEA (the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) was \nsupposed to have been completed last year, but it was not. The highway \nbill was extended until May 1, and then the authorization for the \nhighway bill expired.\n  We are now on May 4 without highway legislation that is authorized, \nand the highway officials and Governors around the country are \nwondering, appropriately, what is going to happen to this highway bill? \nWith what authority can I obligate money? What about the projects we \nhave to do in our States to build roads and repair bridges?\n  I don't blame State and local highway officials and others who are \nrightly furious with the Congress that it has not gotten its work done. \nIt is a shame, in my judgment, that almost a year after the legislation \nshould have been done, not only was the legislation not done, but we \nhave already had an extension and that has expired. Now, here we are \nwith no highway bill at all.\n  I ask those who run this Congress and those who are convening the \nconference on the highway bill, let's decide to get this thing done. \nThis isn't rocket science; it is building highways. We know how to do \nthat. If the political will doesn't exist to do what is necessary to \nreach a compromise on a highway bill, then I suppose that those who run \nthe Congress should say to the Governors and the highway commissioners, \n``We can't be counted upon to do this work.''\n  I hope in the coming days people will understand the urgency of this. \nI come from the State of North Dakota, and we have a relatively short \nconstruction season. It is not fair to our States for this Congress not \nto do its work on time. We should do it, it ought to be done, and it \nought to be done soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4144-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4144-S4145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOBACCO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk for just \na moment about the tobacco legislation that is to be brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. My understanding is that we will consider, in the \nnext perhaps month, the tobacco legislation that was enacted by the \nSenate Commerce Committee, of which I am a member.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee considered a comprehensive tobacco \nbill. We passed it, and the vote was 19 to 1. The legislation is \ncontroversial, to be sure, and the tobacco industry has now ratcheted \nup an enormous amount of money and energy directed at trying to kill \nthe bill.\n  I thought it would be interesting to read into the Record a few \ncomments here and there dealing with the tobacco companies and why they \nare so interested in killing this tobacco legislation. We will see an \nenormous amount of money spent on advertising to try to kill this \nlegislation.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, chaired a task force \non the issue of tobacco and created a piece of legislation. He has done \na wonderful job, in my judgment, dealing this with issue, and the \nSenate could well take its cues from the work Senator Conrad has done. \nIncidentally, the Senate Commerce Committee took much from the \nlegislation Senator Conrad introduced in the Congress.\n  The reason we are concerned about the tobacco issue is the targeting \nof teenagers in this country to get them to smoke. I have said before \non the floor that almost no one reaches age 30 and wonders, ``What more \ncould I do to fulfill my life?'' and decides they should start smoking. \nAlmost no one reaches majority age and says, ``Gee, what am I \nmissing?'' and concludes what they have really missed is, they have not \nsmoked and they need to start smoking cigarettes. The reason they don't \narrive at that answer is that by that age, they know that cigarettes \ncan kill you.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 to 400,000 people a year die in this country \nfrom smoking and smoking-related causes, and the only future customers \nfor tobacco are kids. The only conceivable future customers for \ncigarettes are children, and that is why many in this country, myself \nincluded, believe it is important for us to say to the tobacco \nindustry, ``Never again shall you target America's children to addict \nthem to tobacco, addict them to nicotine. We won't allow it.'' That is \nwhat the tobacco legislation is all about.\n  What did the tobacco companies know, and when did they know it about \nthe subject of nicotine? We are now hearing a lot of testimony and \ndiscussion about that. Tobacco companies have been at the forefront of \nnicotine research in the last several decades. In fact, the tobacco \ncompanies, since the early 1960s, claimed that nicotine was not \naddictive and anyone who smokes makes a free choice to smoke.\n  By the 1960s, however, all of the reports we are now seeing, \nincluding confidential memoranda and data from a tobacco company, \nshowed us they had developed a very sophisticated understanding of \nnicotine pharmacology and they knew very well that nicotine was \npharmacologically addictive. The release of internal tobacco company \ndocuments makes it clear. They realize the impact and significance of \nnicotine.\n  In 1963, a British American Tobacco document said:\n\n       Nicotine is by far the most characteristic single \n     constituent in tobacco, and the known physiological effects \n     are positively correlated with smoker response.\n\n  In 1969, a draft report to the Philip Morris board of directors said:\n\n       In the past, we at R is research and development--\n     have said that we're not in the cigarette business, we're in \n     the smoke business. It might be more pointed to observe that \n     the cigarette is the vehicle of smoke, smoke is the vehicle \n     of nicotine and nicotine is the agent of a pleasurable body \n     response.\n\n  In a memo from 1978, Brown & Williamson, signed by H.D. Steele says:\n\n       Very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, \n     i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.\n\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\n\n  That is a tobacco industry paper.\n\n       There is little doubt if it were not for the nicotine in \n     tobacco smoke, people would be less inclined to smoke than \n     they are to blow bubbles or to light sparklers.\n\n  M.A.H. Russell, 1974.\n  1983, Brown & Williamson:\n\n       Nicotine is the addicting agent in cigarettes.\n\n  1983, Brown & Williamson:\n\n       Raleigh and Belair smokers are addicted to smoking. . . . \n     They smoke primarily to reduce negative feeling states rather \n     than for pleasure. Given their low income, smoking represents \n     a financial drain on family resources. Saving coupons for \n     household items helps reduce guilt associated with smoking.\n\n  How about the health effects of tobacco? What do the tobacco \ncompanies know about that?\n  The vice president of a tobacco company, in 1963, said:\n\n       At best, the probabilities are that some combination of \n     constituents of smoke will be found conducive to the onset of \n     cancer or to create an environment in which cancer is more \n     likely to occur.\n\n  That is ``at best,'' he says. That is a fellow who helps run a \ntobacco company.\n  1970, lung cancer experiments that were done by the general manager \nof research prepared for the managing director of Gallaher Electronic \nTelegraph:\n\n       One of the striking features of the Auerbach experiment was \n     that practically every dog which smoked suffered \n     significantly from the effects of the smoke either in terms \n     of severe irritation and bronchitis, pre-cancerous changes or \n     cancer.\n\n  A top research official for the American Tobacco Company, 1970:\n\n       [W]e believe the Auerbach work proves beyond reasonable \n     doubt that fresh whole cigarette smoke is carcinogenic to dog \n     lungs and therefore it is highly likely that it is \n     carcinogenic to human beings.\n       [T]he results of the research would appear to us to remove \n     the controversy regarding the causation of human lung cancer \n     . . .\n\n  How about tobacco companies targeting kids?\n  1981, Philip Morris, a report from a researcher to the Vice President \nof Research and Development at Philip Morris. He says:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, \n     and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke \n     while in their teens. At least a part of the success of \n     Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was because \n     it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck \n     with it as they grew older.\n\n  Teenage smokers. A memorandum from the tobacco industry:\n\n       To improve our ability to forecast future trends, this \n     report examines the demographics and smoking behavior of 14-\n     17 year old smokers.\n\n  This is a company now that is doing detailed research on 14- to 17-\nyear-old smokers. ``Forecasting future trends,'' that means ``they're \nour customers. We're interested in them. We want to keep them \nsmoking.''\n  One company was concerned because their share of teenaged smokers \ndeclined while the share of teenagers who purchased a competitive brand \nincreased. That concerned the company a great deal.\n  Another tobacco industry statement:\n\n       It is important to know as much as possible about teenage \n     smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is \n     tomorrow's potential regular customer. . . . it is during the \n     teenage years that the initial brand choice is made.\n\n  And that is the statement from a tobacco company.\n  Now, the consequences of tobacco smoking are quite clear. Tobacco is \na legal product, and in my judgment shall and will be legal in the \nfuture. But it is not a legal product for children. An industry that \nhas record profits and has targeted children, because it believes that \nchildren are its future customers, is an industry that, in my judgment, \nis sadly out of touch with its responsibilities.\n  The U.S. Senate and the Congress has a responsibility to take up the \ntobacco bill. We passed it out of the Senate Commerce Committee now \nnearly a month ago under the leadership of Senator McCain. I noted \ntoday in the newspapers that Senator McCain indicated that, I believe \nhe said $50 to $100 million is to be spent by the tobacco industry to \ndefeat efforts in Congress to pass a comprehensive tobacco bill.\n  I hope the American people take note that this industry is the same \nindustry which said tobacco is not addictive when in fact they knew it \nwas addictive. They were saying we are not targeting children when in \nfact they were targeting children.\n  I hope the American people understand, as well, that when the tobacco \nindustry launches a massive effort to try to derail the efforts of the \nCongress to pass a comprehensive tobacco bill, the American people have \nthe capability in this system of ours to make the difference. They can \nweigh in. They can make their views known about whether or not they \nbelieve this Congress shall pass a piece of legislation to stop this \nindustry from targeting America's children and from trying to addict \nAmerica's children to cigarettes.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, is on \nthe floor. I would like to yield to him as much time as he consumes to \ndiscuss another issue, and at the conclusion of his remarks, it is my \nintention to follow up on the issue he is going to discuss. Let me \nyield the time that he consumes to Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank you very much, and my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, for this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4144-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4145-S4147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AGRICULTURE DISASTER IN NORTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have come to the floor this morning to talk about a \ndisaster that is happening in my home State, but it is receiving very \nlittle attention. People who are watching and my colleagues might \nrecall that last year we had a set of disasters in North Dakota that \nhad tremendous national publicity and national attention.\n  We had the worst winter in our history, followed by the most powerful \nwinter storm in 50 years, followed by the worst flood in 500 years; and \nin the midst of that, fire broke out that destroyed much of downtown \nGrand Forks, ND. It was really almost apocalyptic. But this year we \nhave another disaster occurring, and it is receiving very little \nattention. I call it the ``stealth disaster,'' because it is really \nflying below the radar screen. There are almost no national stories, no \nnational attention. In fact, I believe very few people know this \ndisaster is occurring. But it is occurring and it is an extraordinary \ndisaster that is hurting the farmers of my State.\n  We are in a wet cycle. This wet cycle has bred disease, disease that \ncost us about a third of our crop last year. That, coupled with very \nlow prices, has meant that our farmers are not cash-flowing.\n  I was just home during a series of farm meetings and in each and \nevery stop was told we will lose perhaps 3,000 farmers this year in \nNorth Dakota. We only have 30,000. So losing 3,000 in 1 year would \nreally be quite extraordinary.\n  But these farmers are facing a cash-flow crunch as a result of bad \npolicy, as a result of low prices, as a result of this incredible \ndisease that has broken out. And again, this is a disaster of really \nstaggering proportions in that it gets very little attention, and there \nis very little the Federal Government is prepared to do.\n  It is very interesting, if you have a disaster like this. Last year \nwhen this disaster occurred, or these sets of disasters occurred in \nNorth Dakota, and we searched to find if there was Federal help, we \nfound that indeed there was. The SBA rushed to help. The Federal \nEmergency Management Agency was there. The Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Program was there with CDBG funds. There was a marvelous, \nmarvelous response that has helped the devastated communities recover.\n  But now we have a different kind of crisis and a different kind of \ndisaster. And when we look for assistance, we find there is virtually \nnone. What you will find is, about the only thing that is available is \nlow-interest loans.\n\n  Now, additional debt for those who can't cash flow because of a \nterrible outbreak of disease and because of low prices and because of \nweak farm policy, saying ``Take on more debt,'' doesn't sound like a \nvery good deal. But that is exactly what we are faced with, because we \nno longer have a disaster program for farmers; it doesn't exist. The \nonly thing we have is low-interest loans; that is it. When farmers \nexperience a disaster, the Federal response is to help them go further \ninto debt. It doesn't make much sense.\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\n  We have a circumstance that is, as I described, dramatic. I brought \nthis chart to show what has happened to North Dakota farm income. I say \nit was washed away in 1997. In 1996, this chart shows the farm income \nof our State, $764 million; but in 1997, farm income in our State was \nreduced to $15 million. That is divided among 30,000 farmers. That \nmeans the average net income per farm in North Dakota in 1997 was only \n$500. That is a reduction in income of 98 percent from 1996 to 1997. \nThat is a disaster.\n  Let me go to the next chart that shows farm income from 1996 to 1997, \nquarter by quarter, so that my colleagues can see the pattern. In 1996, \nyou could see it was about equivalent from quarter to quarter, but, \nboy, we came to the end of the year, 1996, and look what happened to \nfarm income. It fell off the table. I guess in this case we can say it \nfell off the chart. That is a 98 percent reduction, a farm income of \nonly $15 million in the entire State for the entire year, divided among \n30,000 farmers. As I say, that is only $500 apiece.\n  It is no wonder everywhere I go farmers are saying to me, ``We have a \ndisaster.'' It is not just farmers. In community after community, the \nbankers are taking me aside and saying, ``Senator, there is something \nradically wrong with farm policy.'' There is something radically wrong \nwith our disaster programs when farmers can go through these 5 bad \nyears of this incredible wet cycle, and disease develops, and low \nprices come on to the market, and there is nothing to help these \nproducers. They are going to be washed away every bit as much as the \nresidents of Grand Forks were washed away by the flood waters last \nyear.\n  Some will say North Dakota is a marginal area; when you have bad \nweather, you will get hurt. I brought this chart to show the Red River \nValley. The Red River Valley has the richest farmland in the world. The \nRed River Valley used to be the bottom of a great lake, Lake Agassiz. \nThousands of years ago, when the lake was there, it built up \nextraordinarily rich soil. When you come to the Red River Valley of \nNorth Dakota, you see the richest farmland anywhere in the world. In \nplaces it is 8 feet thick, an incredible lode that is so rich.\n  When I was growing up, we were told there had never been a farm \nfailure; there had never been a crop failure in the Red River Valley, \never. These last 5 years have seen extraordinary developments, because \neven in the Red River Valley, the richest farmland in the world, farm \nincome is down precipitously. You can see from 1996 to 1997 farm \nincome, the richest farming area in the world, down 62 percent.\n  Now the next chart, North Dakota is a place that produces wheat. \nIndeed we do. We are typically the No. 1 or No. 2 wheat-producing \nState. Look what happened to the total value of the spring wheat crop. \nThis shows from 1993 to 1997, the crop was about $1 billion in value; \nin 1993, it declined somewhat; in 1994, came up handsomely; in 1996, it \nwas approaching $1.3 billion. Look what happened last year--a 41 \npercent decline.\n\n  It wasn't just the wheat crop. The No. 2 crop in North Dakota is \nbarley. Of course, those who are listening probably know that barley is \nused to feed animals. It is also used to brew beer. The barley crop, \nsame pattern: You saw a pretty good increase from 1993 to 1996, and \nthen a steep decline in 1997.\n  Some have said this is just a blip, this is just a blip in terms of \nprices. Yes, you have the disease problem. Hopefully, that will pass at \nsome point. But it is disastrous when you lose a third to 40 percent of \nthe crop in one year because of disease and then, on top of that, you \nhave very low prices. That leaves farmers in an incredibly vulnerable \nposition. Some have said, on the price front that is just a blip.\n  I thought I would bring along this chart that shows prices from 1996 \nthrough 1997, month by month, because if you look at that chart, it \ndoesn't look like a blip. In fact, the only blip that occurs is right \nhere, a period of high prices when we were debating the farm bill. At \nthat point, people were told, ``We have reached an era of permanently \nhigh farm prices because of export demand; farmers can count on a \nperiod going forward of high prices.'' You can see how long that \nlasted. That lasted about 90 days. Instead, prices started coming down. \nBoth wheat and barley--you can see the wheat prices in blue, the barley \nprices in red, on the chart, and both of them, from the time we debated \nthe farm bill, have gone down, down, down.\n  This represents a disaster to the thousands of producers in North \nDakota who rely on agricultural income to sustain themselves. We have a \ndisaster occurring, and there needs to be a response. I don't think we \nwant to see washed away 10 percent of the farmers in 1 year--and that \nis this year. I can tell you, Mr. President, next year is going to be \nfar worse unless conditions change, unless prices firm up, unless there \nis a Federal response, unless the disease problem changes. And, \nunfortunately, once you get into a wet cycle, these diseases continue \nas long as the wet cycle does. The result is devastating, absolutely \ndevastating. I fear that we will face a true calamity next year unless \nthere is a Federal response.\n  In closing, Mr. President, a troubled agricultural economy is \ndangerous for rural communities and for our entire Nation. The \nimportance of a strong agricultural economy and the maintenance of a \nrural infrastructure was perhaps best summed up by William Jennings \nBryan when he said, ``Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and \nyour cities will spring up again as if by magic, but destroy our farms \nand the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.''\n  William Jennings Bryan was right. Agriculture is right at the core of \nthe strength of the American economy. North Dakota is in the first \ntrench. We are the first ones to experience the defects of a national \npolicy that was put in place in 1996. But I alert my colleagues that \nunless we take action, others will follow. When they have a disease \nproblem, when they face low prices, they will see enormous economic \npressure on farm producers, and they, too, will be in a position to \nlose a significant chunk of their farm families.\n  That is a tragedy for our State. I believe it is a tragedy for our \nNation. I hope very much my colleagues are listening and will \nunderstand, just as we responded to a more visible disaster last year, \nwe must fashion a Federal response to this stealth disaster that is \noccurring this year.\n  I alert my colleagues that I will be coming to the floor on a regular \nbasis to bring this matter to their attention in the hopes that we can \nfashion a stronger national policy. So while North Dakota is suffering \nthis year, we might prevent other States from experiencing what we are \nfacing in 1998.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to congratulate the \nSenator from North Dakota on a clear and persuasive presentation of \nwhat is not just a North Dakota problem, but a national problem. The \nUnited States is blessed beyond the imaginings of William Jennings \nBryan by the degree to which a very small farm population provides the \nmost ample diet the world has ever known for a global nation.\n  I might say--and it won't come as a surprise to my friend from North \nDakota, but not everybody would know--that New York State is a wheat-\ngrowing region. In 62 counties, I think we have commercial wheat grown \nin 50. There are parts of the western areas of the State where if you \ntravel along the Erie Canal, at the level where it is raised above the \nsurrounding land looking north and south, you could be in North Dakota \nlooking at the wheat fields. Those prices affect ours, too. The Senator \nis right to think that the '96 legislation should be revisited in terms \nof the economic realities facing those farmers, upon whom we all \ndepend, because we eat that bread and drink that beer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. I am \nhonored to serve with him on the Senate Finance Committee. My wife and \nI were just telling a colleague the other night that sometimes we have \na chance to have dinner with the Senator from New York, and we always \nfeel that it is a privilege because it is like a seminar. There are \nvery few people that have the knowledge bank of the senior Senator from \nNew York. It is an honor to be able to serve with him on the Finance \nCommittee. He has reminded me on more than one occasion that New York \nis a major agricultural, producing State as well.\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n  I just say to my colleague that our experience with the changes that \nwere made, in terms of eliminating a disaster program for agriculture, \nis a very bitter pill because now we are experiencing the disaster. The \nonly assistance is low-interest loans. When you have persons that \naren't cash flowing, to say that the only help we can extend to you is \nfor you to go deeper into debt, that doesn't seem like much in the way \nof a helping hand. And it is so totally opposite to what we experienced \nlast year with those extraordinary natural disasters that I think it is \nimportant to bring it to the attention of my colleagues. This year we \nare about to lose--in North Dakota alone--10 percent of the farmers. In \none year. And next year will be far worse, unless we take action.\n  I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will add a historical note here \nbecause it suggests the global reach of what might seem to be local \nproblems. I think it is widely agreed that it was the arrival of wheat \nfrom western New York in Liverpool through the Erie Canal that led to \nthe repeal of what the British called the ``corn laws''--the British \nuse the term ``corn''; we use the term ``wheat''--which kept the \ntariffs on wheat so that the vast landlords could remain the vast \nlandlords. American wheat was so much less expensive that the British \ndecided to cease all that and become an industrial nation. And then two \ngenerations later, it was the arrival in the Baltic of wheat from North \nDakota, South Dakota, and Kansas. The prices were such that the local, \naristocratical, landed gentry of Prussia simply could not compete. The \nnext thing you know, you have enormous emigration from that part of the \nworld to the United States through Ellis Island. These are not small \nevents.\n  The price of food is a very important matter. It is a tribute to \nAmerican farmers that we don't think much about it any longer because \nit has become relatively stable. I can speak to the fact that when we \nbegan the War on Poverty, under President Johnson, we used as a measure \nthe ``city workers food basket'', which was designed by the Department \nof Agriculture and measured what is necessary to raise a family of 4 in \nthe city. We said a family needed 3 times that number. Well, this \nquickly became hopelessly out of date because the price of food kept \ngoing down. Now the price will go up. If those prices crash now, prices \nwill rise later. The Senator is on to something important, and I thank \nhim, as one Member of this body.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from New York. Mr. President, I might \nconclude by saying that I was looking at the chart here. While North \nDakota suffered a 98 percent reduction in farm income from 1996 to \n1997, New York suffered a 44 percent reduction in farm income from 1996 \nto 1997, one of the worst hit in the country. So North Dakota, \nunfortunately, leads the pack. We are at the top of the chart in terms \nof States losing farm income. Unfortunately, the State of New York is \nalso in that top tier. In fact, they ranked fourth in terms of \nreduction and tied for third, actually, with 44 percent reduction in \nfarm income. So I am certain the producers in your State are suffering \nas well. We have had the double whammy--not only of low prices, but low \nprices coupled with this unprecedented outbreak of disease. That is \ncreating a crisis and we simply must respond. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4145-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4147-S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Terry, Michael A. \nUdell, and Barry L. Wold.\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Eric Thorson of the Finance \nCommittee staff also be granted floor privileges during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the need for this Internal Revenue Service \nrestructuring legislation is clear. Last summer, the National \nCommission on Restructuring--following an extensive review of the IRS--\nissued a report to revamp the agency.\n  Last September, the Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings \nregarding practices and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service, \nwhich raised even more startling problems that have been festering \nwithin the IRS for years.\n  Following these hearings, the agency's new Commissioner, Charles \nRossotti, released a report that validated the concerns we raised, and \nhe made a commitment to reform the Service. Likewise, in response to \nthese hearings, the House considered and passed an IRS restructuring \nbill in November, and the Finance Committee began the new year with a \nseries of five hearings on restructuring, which included testimony from \npast IRS Commissioners. Those restructuring hearings were followed with \nwhat can only be considered the most in-depth IRS oversight hearings \never, which concluded only last Friday. Throughout this extensive \neffort at oversight restructuring, my colleagues and I have been \nworking on the legislation before us today. Our staffs have been \nmeeting. There have been countless hours, late nights, and early \nmornings spent to develop a restructured bill that is strong, thorough, \nand workable. I appreciate these efforts. I also compliment the House \non its swift action on the earlier version, and recognize the very \neffective leadership of Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer. \nTheir efforts provided a solid foundation for restructuring the agency, \nand made it clear that Congress is ready to respond to the demands of \nthe American people and reform the IRS. That, again, became clear when \nthe Senate Finance Committee voted 20 to nothing in support of the \nlegislation which we are about to consider--legislation that takes a \nmajor step toward changing the way that the IRS does business with the \nAmerican people.\n  I call this legislation a major step because it provides greater \nprotections and reforms that were included in the House bill. It goes \nmuch further than the House bill, offering powerful provisions to \ncorrect the abuses and inefficiencies our extensive investigation and \noversight efforts have uncovered. But I also want to refer to this \neffort as a step, because I believe reform of the IRS must be an \nongoing process. It must be a process of continued vigilance, \nconstructive hearings, and cooperation between Congress and the \nexecutive branch. But anyone who reads all this legislation proposes \nwill realize that it is a strong product of a collective effort. If \nthis legislation were a collegiate athlete, it would be considered a \nblue-chip recruit. While it is not perfect, it is ready to play and \nincludes numerous provisions that strengthen taxpayer protections. It \nmakes IRS employees more accountable, provides enhanced oversight, \ngives the Commissioner the tools necessary to bring the IRS into the \nnext century, and offers greater due process to taxpayers who are \ntrying to comply with our complex tax laws.\n  The legislation pending before us today allows Commissioner Rossotti \nto eliminate the current national office, regional office, and the \ndistrict office structure of the IRS. It gives him the authority to \nreplace these antiquated management models with operating units that \nwill directly serve particular groups of taxpayers, better meeting \ntheir needs and making the agency much more efficient and user \nfriendly.\n  Commissioner Rossotti should be complimented on his tremendous work \nand managerial skills. His plan to restructure the agency is as bold as \nit is necessary, and this legislation gives him the authority he needs \nto move forward.\n  One of the major concerns we've listened to throughout our oversight \ninitiative--a theme that repeated itself over and over again--was that \nthe taxpayers who get caught in the IRS hall of mirrors have no place \nto turn that is truly independent and structured to represent their \nconcerns. With this legislation, we require the agency to establish an \nindependent Office of Appeals--one that may not be influenced by tax \ncollection employees or auditors. Appeals officers will be made \navailable in every state, and they will be better able to work with \ntaxpayers who proceed through the appeals process.\n  We heard a lot about the need for independence in our hearings. \nAgency employees themselves made it clear that there is no dependable \nand consistent mechanism in place to represent taxpayer interests. Just \nas this bill will give the appeals process greater independence, it \nwill also make the Office of Taxpayer Advocate as well as local problem \nresolution officers more independent. In the future, the Secretary of \nTreasury, rather than the Commissioner will appoint the National \nTaxpayer Advocate. And the Taxpayer Advocate will be just that.\n  Criteria to fill this position will include that the Advocate must \nnot be an IRS employee two years before and five years after holding \nthis position. In addition, this bill provides the Advocate with much \ngreater discretion to issue an assistance order to help taxpayers.\n  In an effort to ensure that independent review and accountability \nbecome part of the IRS culture--top to bottom--our legislation creates \na nine-\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nmember IRS Oversight Board--a board composed of six experts from \nvarious professional fields in the private sector, the Commissioner, \nthe Secretary of Treasury, and a representative of IRS employees.\n  As we heard in our oversight hearings, one of the key elements \nmissing in the current agency is a powerful influence independent \nenough from management and the senior executive corps that it can \nmonitor and hold managers and executives accountable for their actions, \nand the actions of their employees. Under our legislation, the \nOversight Board will have broad responsibility and will ensure that the \nIRS has procedures in place to carry out its mission.\n  In order to help prevent the types of abuses disclosed in our Finance \nCommittee hearings, the Board will have ``big picture'' authority over \nlaw enforcement and collection activities. While the Board may not \nintervene in particular taxpayer or employee cases, it will have access \nto information in order to help prevent the types of abuses that are \nbrought to the Board's attention. If the Commissioner does not respond \nto issues raised by the Board, the Board may contact the chairmen of \nthe tax writing committees.\n  We discovered in our hours and hours of testimony from IRS employees, \nand in the countless letters we received, that part of the intimidating \nculture of the agency is sustained by the fact that they feel there are \nno independent protections for them if they report wrong-doing. I was \nmost disturbed to find in our investigation that there is a dangerous \nkill-the-messenger syndrome within the agency. Over 50% of employees \nservicewide believe that management does not communicate honestly with \nthe rank-and-file. Fifty-four percent were adamant that there is \ndistrust between management and employees.\n  When asked if there is adequate protection from retaliation against \nemployees who report misconduct, 72% either disagreed, strongly \ndisagreed, or did not care to comment. More than one in four indicated \nthat they believe management fails to treat employees with respect. And \n30% strongly disagree that, ``Disciplinary actions are applied fairly \nto employees.'' If we are to have an agency that the public trusts and \nthat the employees are proud of, these statistics must change.\n  In an effort to do this, our legislation eliminates the IRS Office of \nChief Inspector. It transfers its full time equivalents to a new \nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. There have been too \nmany allegations that the current IRS Office of Chief Inspector does \nnot have sufficient independence from the IRS to adequately fulfill its \nobligation. Likewise, the current Treasury Inspector General, which \nlacks resources and has experienced problems of its own, does not \nprovide seamless oversight over the IRS.\n  This change is one of the most important distinctions between the \nHouse bill and the Senate bill, and it is of critical importance.\n  Our bill creates a new Treasury IG for Tax Administration which will \nhave greater independence than the IRS Chief Inspector. This provision \nis supported by Commissioner Rossotti, and will create a structure \nwhere the new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will not allow \noversight to fall through the cracks, and will provide a seamless check \non how tax laws are being administered.\n  This new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will provide independent \ninvestigations of alleged IRS employee misconduct without management \ninterference. The new Treasury IG will also respond in a timely manner \nto requests to investigate or audit made by the Commissioner or the IRS \nOversight Board.\n  I believe that an intimidating edge now exists in the current \nmanagement structure. The statistics I've just disclosed confirm that \nthis is true.\n  One of the problems is that the Commissioner does not have the kind \nof authority that is necessary to eliminate those managers who \ncontaminate the culture of the agency. And the Commissioner does not \nhave sufficient authority to hire those who will work toward making the \nkinds of changes that are necessary. This legislation gives the \nCommissioner the tools he needs to hire top-flight managers who are \nexperts in their field.\n  It gives him the wherewithal to transform the agency's workforce by \nproviding bonuses and other incentives, and to sufficiently discipline \nemployees whose inappropriate actions are a plague on the agency.\n  As we have seen--even this past week--the Finance Committee has \ndisclosed egregious conduct by IRS employees. We have received \nthousands of letters relating the same.\n  They have come from taxpayers and agency employees, alike. The \nstories we have heard are outrageous, as is the fact that many of those \nwho perpetrate these abuses do so without consequence. This will not \nstand. Our bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if it is \nproven that the employee failed to obtain required authorization to \nseize a taxpayer's property, committed perjury material to a taxpayer's \nmatter, or falsified or destroyed documents to conceal the employee's \nmistakes with respect to a taxpayer's case.\n  This legislation allows terminations to take place if an IRS employee \nengages in abuses or egregious misconduct. Conditions for which an \nemployee can be dismissed include, but are not limited to, assaulting \nor battering a taxpayer or other IRS employee, violating the civil \nrights of a taxpayer or other IRS employee, or breaking the law, \nregulations, or IRS policies for the purpose of retaliating or \nharassing a taxpayer or other IRS employee.\n  Our legislation also allows an employee to be fired for willfully \nmisusing section 6103 authority to conceal information from Congress.\n  With this legislation, we show that we mean business. An environment \nthat allows employees guilty of these kinds of behaviors to continue to \nwork within the system is not acceptable to me, the Finance Committee, \nor to the American people. We have heard enough excuses. And \nCommissioner Rossotti agrees that enough is enough!\n  One of the most troubling issues raised in our September hearings was \nthe widespread use of enforcement statistics to evaluate front line IRS \nemployees and their supervisors.\n  Subsequent reports by the IRS Chief Inspector substantiated our \nfindings that the agency was, in fact, illegally evaluating employees \nbased on enforcement statistics. Then, in our hearings just last week, \nwe heard that such evaluations continue. In my mind, Mr. President, \nthis mocks Congress. It demonstrates that the IRS believes it is above \nthe law. It is indicative of a culture that believes that if it will \nsimply hold on long enough oversight and accountability will go away \nand the managers and executives who have made careers out of bending \nthe law can get back to business as usual.\n  The bill pending before us strengthens the law against this. It \nprohibits the use of enforcement statistics to evaluate any IRS \nemployee, not merely front line collection employees and their \nsupervisors. And the new Treasury IG would be required to report on \nwhether the IRS is abiding by the law.\n  Each of the measures I have outlined thus far demonstrates just how \nserious we are in our effort to change the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Each will go a long way towards protecting the taxpayer and honest \nemployees who are working to make the IRS a true service-oriented \nagency. But we don't stop here. We offer much more in the way of \ntaxpayer protections. We shift the burden of proof to the IRS if the \ntaxpayer maintains records, cooperates with the agency, and provides \ncredible evidence to the court. In addition, the IRS will have the \nburden of providing a taxpayer's income if it uses arbitrary statistics \nto determine that income.\n  This legislation also allows taxpayers to recover attorney fees and \ncosts from the date the taxpayer rightfully appeals an audit, and it \neliminates the $110 per hour cap on recoverable attorney fees. \nTaxpayers should not be forced to litigate if the IRS is unreasonable. \nIn order to level the playing field, if the agency forces a taxpayer to \nlitigate and go to trial, our bill allows a taxpayer to recover all \nattorney fees and costs from the time the taxpayer makes a qualified \noffer if the amount of the court judgment is equal to or less than the \ntaxpayer's offer.\n  Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill if the IRS is \nunreasonable. Beyond this, our legislation includes various provisions \nwhich allow taxpayers\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nand third parties to recover against the IRS for civil damages. It also \nestablishes procedures for third parties to have erroneous liens \nremoved from their property.\n  Another major taxpayer protection in this legislation is our \nprovision to strengthen innocent spouse relief. This legislation \noverhauls the current innocent spouse relief which is wholly \ninadequate.\n  We do this by limiting a spouse's tax liability to the proportion of \nhis or her income reported on the tax return, or returns, in question. \nAs a result of concerns raised by members of the Finance Committee, \nrelief would not be available in cases of fraud, or if the IRS proves \nthe taxpayer claiming innocent spouse relief had actual knowledge of an \nitem giving rise to the tax liability.\n  Some of the most tragic stories our committee heard concerned \ninnocent spouses whose economic lives have been ruined by the \nunrelenting pursuit of IRS collections officers.\n  What we propose here are needed changes--changes that will bring a \nsemblance of sanity to the current system and protect honest spouses \nwho, under no circumstances, should be held accountable for the \nliabilities of their former spouses just because they are easier to \nfind or more vulnerable to intimidation. Many of the innocent spouses \nwe listened to in our hearings--and many of the letters I have reviewed \nsince--told us how they have been placed under terrible burdens because \nof interest and penalties that continue to grow as their cases age.\n  Again, with this legislation, we do something about that. We make \nnecessary and important changes to how penalties and interest are \napplied. In order to prevent IRS employees from arbitrarily using \npenalties as leverage against taxpayers, our legislation requires non-\ncomputer determined penalties to be approved by management. \nFurthermore, each notice to taxpayers which includes a penalty or \ninterest must specify how the amount was calculated. Our legislation \ndisallows the imposition of the failure-to-pay penalty while the \ntaxpayer is in an installment agreement.\n  It allows the taxpayer to designate deposits for each payroll period \nrather than using the first-in-first-out--``FIFO''--method that results \nin cascading penalties.\n  Under this bill, if the IRS does not provide a notice of deficiency \nwithin one year after a return is timely filed, then interest and \npenalties will be suspended until 21 days after demand for payment. Of \ncourse, this increased protection--as all increased protections--are \nmeant to protect honest taxpayers.\n  We will not excuse those who evade their responsibility or cheat on \ntheir income tax returns. These protections exclude the failure to \nfile, failure to pay, and penalties related to fraud.\n  Increased protections for honest taxpayers will also affect due \nprocess. This was one of the glaring issues raised in our IRS hearings.\n  Currently there is a woeful lack of protection in this area, \nparticularly during collection activity, where the IRS is the judge and \njury, and where some agency employees take a cavalier approach to \nissuing a notice of lien, levy, or seizure of a taxpayer's home, \npersonal belongings, or business property. In order to ensure due \nprocess to taxpayers, our bill requires the IRS to provide 30-days \nnotice to a taxpayer before it may issue a notice of lien, levy, or \nseizure.\n  If the taxpayer requests a hearing, all collection activity must \nstop. If the taxpayer disputes the findings of the appeals officer, the \ntaxpayer may petition the tax court for relief.\n  Our legislation requires the IRS to implement a review process under \nwhich liens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor who \nwould review the taxpayer's information, verify that a balance is due, \nand affirm that a lien, levy, or seizure is appropriate under the \ncircumstances, including the amount due and the value of the asset.\n  Failure to follow these procedures, under our legislation, would \nresult in disciplinary action against the revenue officer and his or \nher supervisor. We also require the Treasury Inspector General to \ncollect this information and annually report to the tax writing \ncommittees of Congress.\n  On those occasions when the IRS makes seizures, the agency will be \nrequired to follow certain procedures and provide an accounting to the \ntaxpayers. It is unbelievable that the IRS does not currently provide a \nreceipt to taxpayers when their property is seized and sold.\n  Revenue Officers have incredible discretion. As such, this bill \nrequires the IRS to implement a uniform asset disposal system for sales \nof seized property to prevent revenue officers from conducting sales.\n  It would prohibit the IRS from seizing real property used as a \nresidence if the unpaid tax liability is less than $5,000. Also, a \nprincipal residence or business property would only be seized as a last \nresort.\n  In the area of examination, our bill expands the attorney-client \nprivilege to other tax practitioners to the extent such communications \nwould be privileged between an attorney and his client.\n  It limits IRS authority to require the production of computer source \ncode and establishes a number of protections against the disclosure and \nimproper use of trade secrets and confidential information of any \ncomputer software program or source code that comes into the possession \nof the IRS as part of an examination of a taxpayer.\n  The legislation allows taxpayers to bring an action to quash all \nthird-party summonses by informing the taxpayers of such summonses \nbefore the IRS contacts the third party.\n  Beyond these important changes, this legislation introduces several \nother measures to protect the taxpayer. It is surprising how long some \nIRS cases remain open and how long some taxpayers remain in the \ncrosshairs of the agency. This is accomplished when the IRS pressures \ntaxpayers, often by threatening them, to waive the 10-year statute of \nlimitations on collection. Mr. President, 10 years is long enough, and \nto protect these taxpayers, our bill would prohibit waivers of the \ncollection statute. It would also make it easier for taxpayers, who \ndispute the amount of their tax liability or can't pay the full amount, \nto compromise with the IRS or enter into installment agreements.\n  The legislation that we introduce today also provides taxpayers with \nan enhanced mechanism to appeal an audit, request early referral to \nappeals, and request alternative dispute resolution. It includes \nvarious routine requirements, including an explanation of the reason \nfor denial of a refund and annual statement to taxpayers regarding the \namount remaining on their installment agreement.\n  The bill also requires IRS notices to include the name and phone \nnumber of an IRS employee the taxpayer should contact to resolve any \nissue on the notice.\n  In order to protect innocent taxpayers who are improperly labeled as \n``illegal tax protesters,'' this bill will, out and out, prohibit such \ndesignation. It will also take an important step towards helping \nCongress simplify the law by requiring the Joint Tax Committee to \nprepare a complexity analysis on tax legislation.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this is a very thorough, comprehensive \npiece of legislation. It is extremely important. There is no question \nthat it is well worth the wait. When our hearing began last September, \nan agency employee made a complaint that lodged itself in my mind, one \nthat I have not been able to forget. He said, ``If the true number of \nincidents of taxpayer abuse was ever known, the public would be \nappalled. If the public also knew the number of abuses covered up by \nthe IRS, there would be a taxpayer revolt.''\n  What we bring with this important legislation is a new era of \nopenness to an agency that for too long has been able to operate beyond \nthe view of Congress.\n  We bring a new era of accountability to an agency marked by a culture \nthat protects even the most lawless employees from the consequences of \ntheir actions.\n  We bring a new era of efficiency and modern management to an \norganizational structure that dates back to before the industrial age.\n  We bring forward a promise of hope to honest taxpayers and valued \nemployees who have waited too long. With this legislation, Commissioner \nRossotti will be able to transform the IRS, provide accountability, and \nestablish much-needed taxpayer protection.\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\n Americans, for the first time ever, will have a tax collection agency \nmarked by a sincere dedication to service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise, in the first instance, to \ncommend our chairman for his commitment to restoring public confidence \nin the Internal Revenue Service and for the legislation he has so ably \ncrafted and now so succinctly set forth in the opening statement of \nthis debate, which I think will probably consume the better part of the \nSenate's time for this week.\n  He, of course, stood on the shoulders of giants, you might say. In \nthe report of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal \nRevenue Service, ``A Vision for a New IRS,'' which was a statutory \ncommission established in 1996, and which reported in June of 1997--\nchaired by our distinguished and gallant committee member Bob Kerrey, \nJ. Robert Kerrey, whom I will ask to manage this legislation in the \ndays ahead, he having been the principal author here, along with his \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle, Senator Chuck Grassley, \nCharles Grassley, ``Chuck'' to his friends. They anticipated the work \nwe did, although I don't think they could have anticipated some of the \nthings we encountered in those hearings. Those two Senators have been \nindefatigable in their endeavor to transform the IRS into a consumer-\nbased agency.\n  As two rounds of hearings held by the Finance Committee illustrate, \nthere is much room for improvement at the IRS. There is much room for \nimprovement in almost any of our Government agencies, but few, other \nthan the Social Security Administration, so directly affect the \ncitizenry, and none other has the capacity to be punitive, to extract \nresources, to impose fines. There is no other agency such as this. It \nis extraordinary, the fact that we have paid so little attention to the \nmanagement of the Service.\n  The Internal Revenue Service was created in 1862 in the \nadministration of President Lincoln, at the time when an income tax was \nestablished to help finance the Civil War. President Lincoln signed the \nCivil War Income Tax Act into law July 1, 1862. However, it was not \nuntil last September, nearly a century and a half later, that the full \nFinance Committee exercised its oversight jurisdiction, and no credit \ncan be too great to be given Senator Roth as the new chairman for this \neffort.\n  It is our duty to know what is going on in this large public agency. \nIt has more than 100,000 employees. In 1997, it collected $1.5 trillion \nand processed 210 million tax returns. We get used to these numbers, \nMr. President, but to give a sense of dimension, 1 billion minutes ago, \nJulius Caesar ruled the Roman Empire. If that is what 1 billion minutes \nis, think what 1.5 trillion minutes would be.\n  Some, mind you, contend that the IRS is out of control and somehow \nshould be abolished. In truth, we simply need to get it under control \nand shaped in the mode of modern management.\n  Last November, the Senate took an important first step to getting the \nagency in such a working mode by unanimously confirming Charles O. \nRossotti as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. We have previously, for \ngenerations, had tax lawyers as the Commissioners. They were superb tax \nlawyers, gifted and committed, but not necessarily managers for the \nmanagement problem that needed to be addressed. And particularly not \ntechnologies. The Service had a huge problem bringing itself along into \nthe computer age. Vast amounts have been spent with systems that do not \ninteract well. And now, of course, we have the year 2000 problem, which \nall agencies of Government face. All activities you can imagine \ncompounding that earlier difficulty.\n  Commissioner Rossotti has already made a visible difference. He has \nput in motion a plan to modernize the agency by reorganizing according \nto type of taxpayer, such as the individual payer, the small business, \nthe large corporation, or the exempt organization, of which there are \nso many, rather than according to the simple organization of regional \noffices that do everything.\n  In addition to establishing programs to improve the treatment of \ntaxpayers, such as problem-solving days and extended telephone service, \nCommissioner Rossotti has done two things very specifically addressed \nto the concerns of the Finance Committee. He has appointed former \nComptroller General Charles Bowsher to conduct an independent review of \nthe IRS internal Inspection Service. It was remarkable that the \nComptroller General, after 15 years of dealing with the Congress' often \nunfortunate demands on the General Accounting Office, came back to \npublic service to do this. A more qualified person you could not \nimagine.\n  Secondly, and again an achievement of some considerable measure, Mr. \nRossotti has persuaded Judge William Webster, formerly the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, and prior to that the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, to look into the activities and the operations of the \nCriminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  This is, obviously, a troubled branch of the agency. We do not \nassociate the Internal Revenue Service with men in body armor carrying \nautomatic weapons, breaking into offices and telling everyone to \nfreeze, if you will. Yet, we heard testimony that could not be doubted \nthat just such things are happening, and they need to be very carefully \ncontrolled and obviously have not been. How widespread that behavior \nis, we do not know. But we will learn from Judge Webster, and not a \nmoment too soon.\n  The legislation before us represents a second major step. It would \nestablish an Internal Revenue Service oversight board consisting of six \nprivate citizens, a representative of the IRS employees' union, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of the IRS itself. The \nboard will be responsible for certifying the strategic direction and \ngoals of the agency, while the Commissioner will continue to manage all \nday-to-day operations. The Finance Committee specifically voted to \ninclude the Secretary and a union representative on the board, making \nthe composition of that board identical to that of the House bill \nreported out of the Committee on Ways and Means, which passed the House \nof Representatives by an extraordinary vote of 426-4.\n  But now it should be clear in anticipation of some amendments, not \nnecessary but in anticipation of the possibility, it should be clear \nthat if this board is to have any stature within the Government and \nwith the public, the Secretary of the Treasury must be on it. That is \nbasic management practice. As Senator Breaux aptly stated during the \nFinance Committee markup, it is also far better to have the union \nworking cooperatively on the inside rather than working in opposition \non the outside.\n  I would also point out that the bill includes a number of provisions \nto create flexibility for the Commissioner in the area of personnel. In \nrecognition of the great disparity between the salary structures in \nGovernment and those in the private sector on parallel activities, the \nlegislation provides a streamlined process by which the Commissioner \ncan appoint up to 40 individuals designated critical technical and \nprofessional positions for up to 4-year terms at an annual compensation \nequivalent to the pay of the Vice President, currently $175,400.\n\n  The Commissioner can go out and find this person to do this \nparticular job and make it a 4-year appointment. Persons who obviously \nare in the private sector will come into Government at not too large a \nsacrifice, and for most it would be a considerable one. I do not want \nto use the word ``sacrifice''--lachrymose, perhaps--just a large \nreduction in income for the kinds of persons that will be sought after, \nbut not so large that they cannot manage the transition.\n  Other provisions will permit the establishment of a new performance \nmanagement system focused on individual accountability and will allow \nfor the creation of an award system to provide incentives for and \nrecognition of individual group and organizational achievements. \nAdditional measures call for the termination of IRS employees for \nviolations committed in connection with the performance of their \nofficial duties.\n  The bill contains two provisions of special interest to this Senator, \nthe\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nfirst of which Senator Kerrey and I particularly supported, and Senator \nRoth mentioned in his opening statement. It would require the staff of \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an analysis of complexity \nand administrability issues associated with all pending tax \nlegislation.\n  Many of the problems faced by the IRS arise from the Tax Code itself. \nOne of the clearest visions of the National Commission on Restructuring \nthe Internal Revenue Service was simplification of the tax law which \nsays it is necessary to reduce taxpayer burden and facilitate improved \ntax administration. One has to note, regrettably perhaps, that our \nproposal for simplification goes on some 511 pages. This is a pattern \nwe have gotten into which we ought to avoid.\n\n  If enacted, and this bill will be enacted, it will be the 64th public \nlaw to amend the Internal Revenue Code since the great Tax Reform Act \nof 1986. In 1986, led by Senator Packwood, we greatly simplified the \nCode. We lowered tax rates, we broadened the base, we got rid of all \nmanner of absurdities and irrational provisions in the Code.\n  The core group, as we called ourselves, would meet each morning in \nSenator Packwood's office and talk about the day's plans. It would be \nmy particular job to provide a reading from the Wall Street Journal. I \nwould find--never failed--an advertisement somewhere in the Journal of \nthat day talking about mountain sheep or billy goats, or what have you, \nin which it would say ``losses guaranteed.'' Such were the provisions \nof the Tax Code at that time--you made money by investing in activities \nthat lost money. We cleared all that out, or thought we did, and we \nbrought rates down and hoped they would stay there.\n  This will be the 64th law since that time amending and complexifying. \nI recall last year we passed a bill, 802 pages, called the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, and the only copy on the Senate floor was here at \nthis desk. The copy for the chairman was spirited away to be examined \nin the Budget Committee for violations of the Byrd rule, as I recall. \nAnd Senators would come up and ask the Senator from New York if there \nwere certain provisions in the bill. They had no way of knowing because \nthere was no copy on the floor.\n  This sort of analysis will take time to do it, but 20 years from now \nwe may look back and think that one of the most important provisions \nthat was contained in this measure was the report by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation of the complexity of a tax measure, and how well, \nin fact, the IRS could handle its administration. Because if we failed \nto simplify the Code, we failed to address the heart of this problem. \nComplexity contributes to taxpayer frustration, obviously, and to tax \nevasion, as well.\n  We look forward to working with the chairman to try to reduce tax \nevasion, which is a much larger matter than we have tended to assume.\n  Commissioner Rossotti, in his testimony before the Finance Committee \non Friday, stated that tax evasion is now at an estimated $195 billion \na year. If we were to do no more than collect half the taxes now owed \nand deliberately not paid, our revenue situation would be profoundly \nchanged. And that can be done, and I think Commissioner Rossotti \nintends to at least attempt it. We are talking about laws here. If we \nare a nation of laws, not only do taxpayers have rights, but they have \nresponsibilities. Both should be pursued with energy and effectiveness.\n  A second provision has to do with the so-called year 2000 problem or \nthe century date change, as Commissioner Rossotti terms it. The IRS has \nhad some well-publicized difficulties with its computer modernization \nefforts. These problems have been exacerbated by programming changes \nrequired by the Taxpayer Relief Act last year and by the year 2000 \nproblem.\n  It is beginning to sink in that we have a real problem here. Our \nmajority leader and the minority leader are much to be congratulated. \nWe have now created a special committee on this matter with our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Bennett, as the chairman. This is not \na problem in the ordinary sense, a difficulty to be looked after or \nendured. No. The General Accounting Office testified before us \nSeptember of last year that the computer conversion problem could be \ncatastrophic. The whole system could crash. We are not alone in this \nregard. The IRS is just another large information center dependent on \ninformation processing which it cannot do if the computers are not \nchanged in time. The adjustments are not that complicated but the \npressure of time is extraordinary.\n  I recently had the occasion of introducing the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, our distinguished Chairman Arthur \nLevitt, who was nominated for a second term. We were talking while we \nwere waiting for the hearing in the Banking Committee to begin. He \nmentioned this issue and said that for the banks and such he is \nresponsible for, if they do not get this done it is terminal. Not just \nthat the profits drop a bit or some activities can't survive--it is \nterminal.\n  The Defense Department has unimaginable difficulties. They will get \nit done or they hope they will get it done, or our missiles won't be \naimed in the right direction, things like that. And the Commissioner \nhas asked that some of the provisions in this bill be delayed not for a \nlong time but until after the year 2000 so he can have the year 2000 \nproblem solved before he puts in these new provisions. It is a very \nreasonable, orderly, sane recommendation and we would be disorderly not \nto heed it. He has already sent us a six-page letter that tells us when \nhe can have this provision in place, when he can have that provision in \nplace. He knows what he is talking about. I hope we will listen.\n  Two final points: The bill requires the Joint Committee and the \nTreasury to study the issue of taxpayer confidentiality. We must strike \na balance between taxpayer privacy on the one hand and the ability of \nGovernment to function on the other. In our hearings we have had a \nmatter where IRS officials, faced with specific charges, will often \nseem evasive or unresponsive in their answers. What they are doing is \nresponding to the law that forbids them to discuss things they know, \nbut which are confidential. Some balancing of that is in order, and I \nhope we can see it brought about.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a comment on the cost of the legislation. \nThrough the ingenuity of the chairman, we have fully funded this \nmeasure for the first 5 years of its operation. It is underfunded by \n$10 billion in the second 5 years. We hope to do something about this. \nI think it is unseemly of us to bring tax reform legislation to the \nSenate and fully ignore the fact that we aren't paying for it. We can \npay for it; it is not an impossible sum, and it is surely incumbent \nupon the committee and the managers of the legislation to see if we \ncan't find that extra $10 billion.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to; yes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I want to make it clear that it is the intent of the \nchairman to fully pay for both the first 5 years and the second 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. I am not surprised. We pay our bills--or we ought \nto pay our bills. As I said, it would be unseemly to bring a measure of \nthis kind to the floor saying, ``Let's manage these matters better,'' \nand not manage to pay for it. That is welcome news, and the Senator has \nmy cooperation on that, to be sure.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am going to ask Senator Kerrey to manage \nthe legislation on our side. As I said, he was co-chairman of the \nNational Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. \nTheir superb report, ``A New Vision for the IRS,'' which was issued \nlast June--11 months ago--has led to the work we are doing now, which \nwe bring to the floor with pride and with the expectation that we will \nbe successful.\n  On that note, sir, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from South \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak for such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan of New York, and the chairman, Senator Roth of Delaware, for \ntheir excellent work on this legislation and for bringing this to the \nfloor.\n  I rise today to express my qualified support for this legislation \nthat is long\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\noverdue, the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act. When I say \n``qualified,'' that qualification is primarily over the question of \npaying for this legislation in full. As a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, it is a matter of great importance to me. I am very \nheartened that Chairman Roth has expressed very clearly on the floor \nhere today that there will, in fact, be offsets sufficient to pay for \nthis legislation not only during the first 5 years but the remaining 5 \nyears as well. I look forward to reviewing those offsets, of course. \nBut I am very heartened by that, because I think that is a key \nunderlying requirement for this body to responsibly take up IRS reform \nlegislation.\n  The road bringing us to this day has been long indeed. It was, after \nall, in the fall of 1995 that the legislation was enacted calling for \nthe establishment of a commission on restructuring the IRS. Nearly 1 \nyear ago, this commission submitted its report to Congress.\n  After a period of congressional hearings and negotiation, compromise \nlegislation was agreed upon by President Clinton, Secretary of Treasury \nRubin, and the minority leadership of both Houses of Congress. With \nthis support, it is not surprising that the House passed H.R. 2676 last \nNovember by an overwhelming margin of 424-6. The administration, since \nthat time, has appointed former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster \nto review the practices of the IRS and its Criminal Investigation \nDivision. I think that is a very important and responsible step on the \npart of the administration, which is consistent with the direction and \nconcerns expressed by both the House and the Senate.\n  It has been frustrating that it has taken so long to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. During the State of the Union Address at the \nbeginning of the year, President Clinton called for passage of this \nbill as his first item of business. One week later, the majority leader \npledged that IRS reform would be considered on this floor by March 30. \nOnce again, unfortunately, the Senate did nothing. We spent days \ndebating such items as renaming airports, but there was no action on \nthis critical legislation. March 30 came and went, and so did an even \nmore significant date for over 100 million Americans, and that was \nApril 15, tax day. As the American people met the deadline for filing \ntheir tax forms, the Senate had not yet taken this legislation up on \nthe floor.\n\n  Finally, after much delay, this measure has reached the Senate floor. \nIt has often been said that, ``It is better late than never.'' This \nweek's Congressional Quarterly, a respected nonpartisan political \npublication, observes that one reason for the delay may have been a \ndesire to raise campaign money. I certainly hope that was not the case. \nI believe that this legislation could, in fact, go a long way toward \naddressing many of the fundamental organizational problems that we see \nin the IRS today. That agency, as we all know very well, has antiquated \ncomputer systems, customer service phone lines that typically have busy \nsignals, and many other operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, we \nhave all heard about the large number of complaints about overzealous \nenforcement, rude service, and simple inability to get a clear answer. \nThese are problems that clearly must be addressed.\n  Of course, it should be recognized that during the course of Senate \nhearings, the IRS was not in a position to refute individual cases \nbrought before the committee because of their confidentiality \nrestrictions, and so the ``rest of the story,'' as is sometimes heard, \nwent untold. Nonetheless, it is clear, both through hearings and \nindividual complaints to our respective offices, that there have been \nabuses. There is no room for that, and there ought to be zero tolerance \nfor that abuse.\n  This bill will create an IRS governance and oversight board, which \nwill be charged with overseeing the long-term strategic and operational \nplans for the agency. Personnel policies will be made more flexible. \nExpanded use of electronic filing will become a significant goal, with \nthe hope that by the year 2007 only 20 percent of the tax returns will \nbe filed on paper.\n  Additionally, this bill will expand taxpayer rights. The burden of \nproof in Tax Court proceedings will lie with the IRS rather than with \nthe taxpayer. Penalties will be allowed for IRS collection activities \nthat negligently violate the Internal Revenue Code. Relief will be \ngranted to spouses who are innocent of an underpayment filed on a \nreturn. Taxpayers will be granted expanded confidentiality protection \nas well as explicit notice of their rights.\n  One of the more overlooked provisions of this bill, however, is \nperhaps one of the most important. The bill states--albeit in a sense \nof the Congress, nonetheless an important expression of the point of \nview of this body--that front-line IRS technical experts should be \nheard during congressional consideration of tax legislation in an \neffort to avoid additional complexity to the Tax Code. It has been \nCongresses and Presidents, after all, not the IRS, that have been \nresponsible for creating a Tax Code which is overly complex and \ndifficult to enforce.\n  In a sense, the IRS has been an easy target for this whole debate, as \nhas always been the case, I suppose. Few people like an agency \nresponsible for collecting taxes.\n  We must instead recognize, however, that a great deal of the \nresponsibility for this problem rests on the doorstep of Congress \nitself. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, for example, while an \nexcellent piece of legislation in very many respects, contains hundreds \nof new tax provisions, most of which increased the complexity of the \nTax Code. We have in this debate the remarkable inconsistency of those \nwho decry the complexity of the Tax Code on the one hand, but never \nmiss an opportunity to worsen the situation by supporting every \nconceivable tax provision complication that comes along.\n  I do have a serious reservation already expressed at the outset, and \nthat is the Senate version of the bill as it now stands is expected to \ncost the Treasury $19.3 billion over the next 10 years. The proposed \noffsets are nearly $10 billion short of paying for this cost, meaning \nthis bill, until it is amended, is in violation of the pay-as-you-go \nrules in the Budget Act, and costing three times the cost of the House-\npassed IRS reform legislation. As a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I believe it is extremely important that we maintain the \nbudget discipline that has brought us the first balanced unified budget \nin three decades, and not jeopardize even as worthy a cause as this. I \nlook forward, again, to reviewing the chairman's offers that he will \nraise later on in this debate.\n  Additionally, I would be remiss if I failed to point out there are, \nin fact, a great number of IRS employees who deserve to be recognized \nfor the exemplary service they provide for this Nation. Although I have \ncertainly heard my share of complaints about the IRS, I have also heard \nfrom constituents who relate their stories of problems they have had. I \nam also very much aware of IRS employees who go about their duties \nevery day as public servants in a professional and competent and able \nmanner. We in Congress must be careful not to use too broad a brush in \nthe heat of this debate. The vast majority of IRS employees are good \nand capable public servants with a tough job on their hands. The fact \nis that fact has been lost as we listened to one side of the story, one \nside that does indeed, however, need to be corrected.\n  But I think it is important for us to go about this debate and \nrecognize that on the one hand elected officials have created a complex \nTax Code, though we want aggressive tax collection in order to address \nthe problem of tax evasion in this country, which costs the taxpayers \n$100 billion a year in uncollected taxes, an unfair tax on those \nAmericans who fairly and legally pay their taxes. So on the one hand we \nwant the IRS to be aggressive about making those collections, but on \nthe other hand we also want an IRS with a human face on it that \nrecognizes that intimidation and overaggressiveness has no place. This \nis a fine line to walk--a line that has been crossed in numerous \ninstances about unfortunate situations with the IRS--but one that is \ndifficult to walk in some instances.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the debate on this legislation. It \nis a positive step forward in our efforts to create a tax system that \nis simpler and less burdensome on taxpayers. We cannot rest with the \ndebate on this bill, however, since the more difficult and more complex \njob lies ahead. To truly resolve this problem, we will need to\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\nget to the ultimate source, which is the complexity and the difficulty \nof the Tax Code itself, and there the guilty party is not the IRS but \nthe Congress itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, April 15, the day on which we pay our annual tribute \nto the IRS, will never be one of the happiest days on the calendar for \nAmericans. It is a time in which all of us are required to pay that \nwhich we owe to the Federal Government by way of the tax system that \nwe, as Members of the Congress, have imposed upon the American people.\n  We have heard in the past few days a number of the abuses that have \nbeen foisted upon the American public, and I will speak to those issues \nin more detail in a moment. In the meantime, we have an opportunity to \npass a reform and restructuring piece of legislation which, as a member \nof the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased to support and endorse, \nand I hope we can get this to the President for his signature as soon \nas possible.\n  Many of us believe that it would have been possible to have passed \nthis legislation last year so that the benefits that are provided in \nthis legislation to the American taxpayer could have been available in \nthe early part of this year before this year's tax collections went \ninto effect. Nevertheless, we do have an opportunity to move forward on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Reform of the IRS is not a partisan issue. In my judgment, by acting \nquickly on this legislation, we can provide some much-needed \nprotections and service improvements to the American taxpayers.\n  I think it is fair to acknowledge that the problems with the IRS are \nnot of recent origin or vintage. They have existed for many years. But \nit does seem to me that the timing for change is most fortuitous an \nopportunity for us to pass a broad, far-reaching IRS reform bill in a \ntime when we have a Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. \nRossotti, who has a unique and, I believe, highly qualified background \nto help us implement these changes.\n  Mr. Rossotti, unlike his distinguished predecessors, is not a man \nwith a tax or an accounting background, but brings a distinctive \nbusiness perspective. Many of the problems of the IRS deal with \nfundamental change of structure, so I believe that his background \nprovides a unique opportunity, combined with this legislation, to \nproduce the kind of changes which will benefit the American public and \nwhich Democrats and Republicans alike are prepared to embrace.\n  Already, in the few short months that he has served as our \nCommissioner, he has demonstrated a commitment to reform and change, \nand I believe that is highly encouraging.\n  Our responsibility as Members of Congress, in my view, is to give \nCommissioner Rossotti the tools that he needs to do the job, and the \nlegislation before the Senate today does just that. Thanks to the \nleadership of Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, \nthe public today is more aware than ever of the types of abuses we need \nto correct in the IRS.\n  Last week's hearings in particular reveal that the agency is in \nserious need of reform. I think all Americans were truly shocked and \noutraged by the testimony that we heard.\n  The task of collecting taxes is always a difficult one, but little, \nif any, circumstances would dictate the strong-armed, police-style \ntactics that we listened to last week were necessary in dealing with \nthe taxpayers who testified before the Finance Committee.\n\n  The IRS, like any other agency, should attempt to use the least \nintrusive, the least confrontational method available to carrying out \nits duties.\n  Having said that, the abuses that we heard last week, I think, \nengendered the justifiable outrage by all of us, but there are those \nwho are part of our country who are involved in criminal and other kind \nof nefarious activities, and so we must, at the time we reform this \nagency, not deprive the agency of the ability to move against those who \nare truly involved in either criminal conspiracies or other kind of \nactivities in which they are underpaying their taxes.\n  Each of us who pay our taxes on time as required--and that is the \nvast majority of the American people--will suffer the consequences if \nchanges that we bring into the system makes it more difficult to \ncollect from those who would evade the taxes.\n  The consequence of that course of action will mean that all of us \nwill pay more, not less, as a result of failing to collect taxes that \nare lawfully due pursuant to the IRS Code. So we clearly need to be \nmindful of that.\n  That testimony, nevertheless, I think was shocking to most Americans \nand certainly to the members of the committee where dozens of armed, \nflak-jacketed agents raided well-established businesses and \nindividuals. This clearly appears to be an agency, at least in respect \nto those circumstances that we were informed about last week, that is \nout of control. Nothing that we heard, assuming that there was a tax \nliability owed by the taxpayers who testified, justified that kind of \negregious conduct.\n  That kind of conduct gives a bad name to those 100,000 IRS employees \nwho are decent, law-abiding citizens. They are our neighbors. They are \nour friends. They are involved in the civic culture of our community. \nThey are involved in Little League and all of the other activities that \nmake up a community. But this kind of conduct is egregious, it is \nunacceptable, and it cannot be allowed to continue.\n  I believe that the chairman and the committee have produced a strong \nbill that will give the Commissioner the tools he needs to make real \nreforms in the IRS possible. I would like to spend a couple of minutes \naddressing several of those reforms.\n  Establishing an IRS oversight board to provide input and oversight \nfrom the customers of the IRS, the American taxpayer, in addition to \nthose who have responsibility for enforcing the Code, I believe, \nbroadens the perspective of the oversight, and I fully support that \nprovision.\n  Providing some kind of continuity for the Commissioner, as this \nlegislation provides a 5-year term, I think is important for the \nstability and management of the agency. If, as I suspect, many of the \nagency's problems are deep-seated, institutional and cultural in \nnature, it is very difficult for an IRS Commissioner, no matter what \nhis enthusiasm or her enthusiasm for reform might be, to make those \nkinds of changes in a couple of years. It takes a longer period of time \nto turn around a bureaucracy that is as large and encrusted as the IRS.\n  It will strengthen the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate by ensuring \nthat the taxpayer advocate is truly independent from the IRS \nbureaucracy and increasing the ability of the taxpayer advocate to \nprovide relief to taxpayers.\n  We have sought in the past, by establishing such an office, to \nprovide that kind of assistance to the American taxpayer, but I believe \ncandor requires us to acknowledge that we have fallen short of the \nmark, because the perception, if not the reality, is that the taxpayer \nadvocate of the past is still part of the IRS structure, and the \nindividual who holds that position looks to his or her future--the IRS \nitself--and therefore has been reluctant to aggressively intervene on \nbehalf of the American taxpayer who has a legitimate grievance or issue \nto raise.\n  It will enhance oversight of IRS activities by strengthening the \nTreasury Inspector General Office. We heard much in the last week about \nemployees who have complained about misconduct on the part of some of \ntheir coemployees, reporting this misconduct only to be ignored. \nHopefully, a more effective oversight responsibility on the part of the \ninspector general's office will provide assurance that those comments \nand concerns--shared, as I have indicated, by the vast majority of \nemployees of the IRS who are responsible, dedicated public servants \nwho, as we were abhorred by what we heard, they, too, are greatly \ntroubled by that kind of misconduct on the part of the few employees \nwho engage in that type of excessive conduct.\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\n  This legislation requires the IRS to use fair and equitable treatment \nof taxpayers as a basis for employee evaluation.\n  Mr. President, one of the ongoing concerns in my own State has been \nthe so-called quota system. This Congress has in the past attempted to \nsend a message indicating that the quota system can no longer be used \neither to evaluate employees or as part of a collection tool.\n  Unhappily, notwithstanding those earlier directions from the \nCongress, we found last year as we were beginning our discussion of the \nreform measures in the Finance Committee that indeed, in the district \nin Nevada, such quotas were in fact being used, although they were not \ndescribed as quotas. From all appearances, those who are part of the \nevaluating process could, in my judgment, have reached no other \nconclusion but that their performance would be judged by the amount of \nmoney that would be extracted from each taxpayer who came to the office \nby reason of some conflict or disagreement as to the amount of revenue \nthat the taxpayer owed.\n  A quota system is inherently wrong and unfair because it engenders a \nconfrontational attitude. That is to say, the IRS revenue officer looks \nat the taxpayer not as a consumer, one who has a problem that needs to \nbe addressed, but basically as an individual that the revenue agent \nmust collect a certain amount of taxes from in order to be evaluated \npositively by his or her superiors for purposes of tenure or promotion \nwithin the system.\n  I have to say that once we called this practice to the attention of \nthe Acting IRS Commissioner at the time, he was forceful in his \ndenunciation, as is Mr. Rossotti, our new director. But, nevertheless, \nnotwithstanding directions from the past, these quotas were still \nthere. That needs to be changed. And I believe that we provide not only \nthe specifics, but the tenure in this legislation that directs that to \nbe accomplished.\n  This legislation establishes goals for increased electronic filing, \nwhich offers benefits to both the taxpayers and the IRS. If there is a \npart of this cloud that has a shining moment, it is in the system that \nhas been created that allows for telefiling. It is a system available \nto millions of taxpayers, a paperless system that allows the taxpayer \nto get his or her refund, if one is due, much quicker than the old \nprocess. It relieves an enormous paperwork burden on the part of the \nIRS. So it is a win-win, a win for the taxpayer and a win for the IRS. \nI am pleased to see that more taxpayers are availing themselves of \nthis. And electronic filing also provides simplification for the \ntaxpayer as well as for the IRS, and that practice has increased as \nwell.\n  By shifting the burden of proof in certain cases where the taxpayer \nhas cooperated with the IRS in providing all documentation to a tax \ncase, again, it has the effect of leveling the playing field for the \ntaxpayer in an issue of dispute or controversy with the IRS.\n  Expanding the opportunity for taxpayers to recover reasonable costs \nand attorney's fees when a taxpayer prevails over the IRS--this, too, \nlevels the playing field and is in the essence of fair play.\n  Enhancing the ability of taxpayers to recover civil damages when they \nare victims of IRS abuse or negligence--this provision that we have \nadded to the code treats taxpayers more equitably by eliminating \ninterest rate differentials between many overpayments and underpayments \nso that the taxpayer is treated as the IRS is treated for purposes of \ninterest payments that may be due as a result of money owed to the \ntaxpayer.\n\n  The bill that we have before us provides relief from certain \npenalties when a taxpayer is making a good-faith effort to pay past due \ntaxes.\n  This legislation enhances due process rights prior to seizures and \nlevies and improves the ability of taxpayers to take advantage of \n``offers in compromise'' and installment agreements.\n  This legislation increases disclosure to taxpayers of reasons for IRS \nactions, including providing reasons for denying a refund and clearly \ninforming taxpayers of their rights during audits or other IRS \nprocedures, thereby making the process less mystifying and secretive \nbut more open and understood by the American taxpayer.\n  It requires all IRS correspondence to identify by name, phone number, \nand address, and to provide the IRS contact regarding the \ncorrespondence, and to require the Joint Tax Committee to analyze the \nchange in tax complexity of legislation being considered by the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, there is plenty of blame to spread around regarding \nthe many problems with the IRS. It is certainly clear that for far too \nlong a culture has existed within the agency that views the taxpayer as \nthe adversary rather than as the customer. Overcoming this taxpayer-\nhostile culture is not something that we can accomplish instantaneously \nthrough legislative fiat, but I believe if we give Commissioner \nRossotti the tools he needs to do his job, problems in this agency can \nbe resolved and long-entrenched attitudes can be changed.\n  Most of the more than 100,000 employees of the IRS are conscientious \npublic servants dedicated to doing their job in a fair, impartial, and \neffective manner. With strong leadership from the top, increased \ntaxpayer protections and increased flexibility to reward employees who \ndo their job well and to, conversely, penalize those who do not, I \nthink, are what this agency needs before it can be turned around.\n  The IRS will never be the most popular Federal agency. But if, by \npassing this legislation, we ensure that honest, hard-working taxpayers \nare treated fairly and with respect by the IRS, we will have made a \nmajor improvement. I do not mean to suggest that by simply passing this \nlegislation we will solve every problem with the IRS. Of course, that \nis not the case.\n  A great part of the problems with the IRS rests with this body, the \nCongress itself. The code is extraordinarily complex, difficult to \nadminister, ambiguous in parts, uncertain in terms of its intended \nconsequence. With every good intention Congress has had, for many, many \nyears the IRS Tax Code has become more complicated, not less so. I want \nto be clear that I supported the changes in the Tax Code that were part \nof the balanced budget agreement last year. But last year's tax bill is \na good example of the code becoming more complex.\n  While I believe that there were many solid policy reasons for every \nprovision of last year's bill, no one can argue that last year's \nlegislative enactment will provide for tax simplification. It has made \nthe code more complex. And in recent weeks on the floor of this \nChamber, we have heard proposals being offered on behalf of some of the \neducational issues that have been debated that will make the code even \nmore complicated.\n  The bill before the Senate today will, however, provide great \nimprovements in the management of the IRS. And until such time as we \ncan provide for a simpler Tax Code that can be more effectively \nadministered, we have a responsibility to provide the necessary tools \nso that the code can be more fairly enforced and implemented.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this legislation and hope the \nSenate will pass this bill in the near future.\n  I note that the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska joins us \non the floor and undoubtedly will have much to say. I would like to pay \ntribute to him and his congressional counterparts for the years that \nthey spent as part of a review of this Tax Code, the testimony they \nheard, the stories that were told to them. The genesis for this reform \nlies largely with the action of the distinguished senior Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Kerrey. I acknowledge that. All of us ought to be \ngrateful.\n\n  He and Senator Grassley and others, in a bipartisan way, during the \ninterim, took the many hours out of their time to canvas some of the \nmore outrageous and objectionable provisions of the code, some of the \npractices that have occurred over the years, the injustices that have \noccurred. The legislation that they framed, which is the basis for \naction today, moves us a long way in the direction of reform.\n  The American people ought to be very grateful to him, Senator \nGrassley, and others, for their efforts in moving this reform along the \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI address the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of this \nbill that\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nwe have been addressing since noon, H.R. 2637, the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. By passing this \nlegislation, Congress will take an important step in reforming what \nmany Americans believe to be the most feared agency in the United \nStates.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee for the \ntremendous effort he made last year to begin some oversight hearings. \nWe heard earlier today those may be the first oversight hearings in the \nhistory of the IRS, an IRS that was formed during the Civil War.\n  The hearings that we heard last year were frightening, revealing, and \nto most of the American public, not surprising, unfortunately. We \nlearned a lot from that process. It provided emphasis and timing to be \nable to do the reform bill that we are presently debating, a reform \nbill that will bring a little bit of a sense of security to the honest \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Last year I had so much interest in the hearings that were going on \nthat we arranged for each day's hearings to be on our web site, the web \nsite for my office, each day. Those were available within 24 hours. We \nhave also been taking the hearings that were just held and getting them \nposted on the web site so they would be accessible to every American in \nthe United States. I think that access to that will lend more urgency \nto the work before the Senate today.\n  The bill before the Senate today, and I appreciate the very detailed \nexplanation that Chairman Roth gave earlier this afternoon, this bill \nwill first overhaul the IRS organizational structure; secondly, it will \nprovide necessary protections for American taxpayers; and third, it \nwill require greater accountability from the IRS employees.\n  I will talk about that in a little more depth. First, the IRS Reform \nAct will overhaul the organizational structure of the IRS. In order for \nany organization to perform its function well, it is necessary for it \nto know what that function is, to know its mission. When I was in the \nWyoming State Legislature, I worked with a number of agencies as they \nimplemented strategic plans. We passed a bill that forced each of them \nto say what they do and how we could tell if they got it done. I think \nthat is key to anything in government. There is no bottom line, but \nthere is a mission.\n  I watched that process as they did it in the State. We heard from \ndirectors, from the agencies, and we heard from the employees as it got \ndown to their level on what they do and how we could tell if they got \nit done. I have to say I was so pleased, there were employees that came \nforward and said, ``My job shouldn't exist. It doesn't fit with what we \nsay we are doing.'' It is my earnest hope that every one of those \npeople were promoted, not eliminated.\n\n  It worked so well in our State that we were able to get our budget \nbalancing process down to a record 3 weeks and then to 13 days. I was \npretty excited when I got elected to come back to Washington. I thought \nthat was one of the things that the Federal Government could do--have a \nmission process. But when I got back here, I was excited to find that \nit already existed. We have a Government Performance and Results Act. \nIt requires every Federal agency to have a mission statement, to have \ngoals, to define them, so that they are measurable and prioritized, and \nthen to see that the goals match up with the budget so they are \nspending the money on what they said they would.\n  As a result of my excitement over that act, I got copies of a number \nof agencies I was interested in to see what they said they were doing \nand how we would know if they got it done. One of those agencies was \nthe IRS. Something else I did was to go on a field trip to those \nagencies and let them explain to me, through their government \nperformance and results, what it was they thought they were doing. It \nwas an interesting trip to the IRS. I will admit to say they were \nextremely cooperative and had a lot of insights they were willing to \nshare with me on problems they have and solutions they are arriving at.\n  One of the things that I asked about was when a taxpayer calls in and \nasks a question about their taxes, how do they know they can rely on \nthat? I want to tell you there isn't a good answer to that. I have \nasked for written confirmation when that answer is given so you can put \nthat with your tax records and then show that to the agent if you are \naudited.\n  We talked about having error notices that are easier to read. I don't \nknow how many people have received an error notice, but they are \ncomputer-generated letters, and the computer-generated letter generates \na series of codes that might be the reason you are being audited. You \ncan take those series of codes and you can look in an extremely long \ndocument that comes with the letter and see what the range of \npossibilities are on what may have been done wrong and what is not \nright. It is computer generated. The computer is spewing out a series \nof letters. It could at least transform those letters into the exact \nwords from the text of what those possibilities are. We are suggesting \nthey ought to tell you what the problem is that brought you up for an \naudit.\n  There are also problems with dollar thresholds. I remember when one \nof my clients--and I am the only accountant in the U.S. Senate--one of \nmy clients, on a $3 million report, was told they were off by 58 cents. \nIt took 3 months and about nine letters to get that straightened out. I \nsuggest that when the IRS sent that very first letter they had already \nused as much money as they had the possibility of correcting--58 cents. \nIt turned out they had made a mistake in their addition--58 cents.\n  Then there is the problem of random audits. The IRS has been randomly \nauditing people in extreme detail. No reason showed up for the need for \nthe audit. It was to get an estimate of how many dollars they might be \nmissing. Those people were required to produce more documents than if \nthey had been chosen for an audit. They had to find the documents for \nevery single line of their audit. What would it achieve? It would give \nus a better state of how much money is not being collected. It wouldn't \ncollect a dime. We have asked for that process to be stopped, and we \nhave been told it is, but you will hear numbers still brought out about \nthe possibility that we are doing random audits.\n  I congratulate the new Commissioner. The new Commissioner brings a \nmanagement perspective instead of a tax perspective to an agency that \nneeds some management perspective. He has already changed some of the \nphone overflow so that people who may not have as heavy a work load can \nbe answering questions. He is looking at a lot of things that need to \nbe done.\n  I have to admit that Congress has a big task ahead of it because part \nof the problem is the Tax Code itself. It is too cumbersome, too hard \nto understand, too many provisions, too many exceptions, too many \ninterpretations.\n  So it is up to Congress to take a look at the Tax Code and the \nAmerican taxpayers to demand that we take a look at that Tax Code. We \nhave to decide if it is going to be a Tax Code of policy or just one of \ncollecting money. So far, we say it is a tax policy. But we really \nhaven't taken the step of sitting down and determining tax policy and \nwhat we are trying to achieve. We always jump to the solution without \nagreement on the problem. I think the voters would buy and be excited \nover a clearly defined problem. They would hope for a solution.\n  We talk about the American dream. We talk about strong families. We \ntalk about home ownership. We talk about health care for everyone. We \ntalk about the need and importance for investment and savings. We take \nabout the role that small business plays as the backbone of our economy \nand the economic hope and dream for individuals across this country. In \nthe land of freedom, we hide taxes. And it gets worse. We double tax \nsome people. I ask you, with the exception of home ownership, where are \nthose things reflected in the Tax Code?\n  Stronger families? No, we penalize marriage. We discourage parents \nfrom raising their own children. We only give big corporations a health \ncare tax break. We don't even give the same break to individuals paying \ntheir portion of health care. We tax investment and interest and at an \nescalated rate, unearned income. Our current tax system discourages the \nsmall, the beginning businesses, particularly those beginning in the \nhome, which brings us back to families. America has become\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nthe home of the ``tax trap,'' and the IRS gets to spring it. Let's see, \nthe way the tax trap works is, the harder you work, the more taxes you \npay. The more taxes you have to pay, the longer and harder you have to \nwork. You end up with more work, and Washington ends up with more \nmoney. I don't think that is how our forefathers saw the system \nhappening.\n  We in Congress have to make filing easier, and that means less forms, \nthat means less instructions, that means less chance of making a \nmistake, and that means less chance of an audit.\n  When I was at the IRS on the field trip, I asked about paperwork \nsimplification--a major effort by the Federal Government. We have to \nreduce the amount of paperwork Americans have to do. Well, I want to \ntell you how they told me how that is rated. The IRS generates more \npaperwork than the other agencies combined; 75 percent of all \nGovernment paperwork comes through the IRS.\n  We had some suggestions for ways the tax forms could be a little \neasier to fill out. A couple of those required adding another line so \nthat you knew how the number got from here to here. Can't do that. The \nway the Paperwork Reduction Act works is, to get any credit under \npaperwork reduction, you have to remove lines from the tax forms or any \nother Government form, regardless of whether that makes it more \ndifficult or not. That will give you a little explanation why the EZ-\n1040 form--the simplest form we are supposed to fill out--has a 33-page \ninstruction manual. You have to be a lawyer to read the detail to \nfigure out what to put on this ``simplified'' tax form. That is not \nright. But that is why we have it.\n  The Paperwork Reduction Act only gives credit for taking lines off \nthe form, not for building millions of pages of explanation for the \nlines that you do not understand. I thought of an ``Enzi Form 1040,'' a \n1-page form. It would still provide the auditing capability that the \nIRS would need. It can be done if we go to tax policy and if we get \ntogether and work on simplification.\n\n  Now, the IRS reform bill makes some important structural changes, \nwhich I believe will help to focus the agency's mission. This \nlegislation creates a separate board to oversee the management and \noperations of the IRS. This board would include six private life \nexperts, who will bring their collective private sector experience to \nsuch tasks as reviewing and approving the agency's strategic plans and \nbudget requests. The board would also have big picture authority over \nIRS enforcement and collection activities. Board members would not, \nhowever, be permitted to intervene in particular tax disputes. \nMoreover, in order to ensure the agency's autonomy from improper \ninfluence, these board members would be governed by conflict of \ninterest restrictions. I believe this new board, which will be \ncomprised largely of people with experience in the private sector, will \nhelp the agency better meet the needs and concerns of the agency's \ncustomers--the American taxpayer.\n  Secondly, the IRS reform legislation provides important safeguards \nfor the American taxpayers. For too long, the IRS has actively filled \nthe roles of judge, jury, and executioner in collection actions against \ntaxpayers. This Reform Act would shift the burden of proof from the \ntaxpayer to the IRS in most court proceedings, as long as the taxpayer \nintroduces credible evidence relevant to determining his or her income \ntax liability. It would also place the burden of proof on the IRS in \ndetermining whether penalties should be imposed. The bill expands a \ntaxpayer's ability to collect attorney fees when the IRS brings \nunwarranted action against them and allows taxpayers to recover civil \ndamages when an IRS employee is negligent in collection actions. \nTaxpayers may also recover attorney fees in civil actions against the \nIRS when the IRS engages in unauthorized browsing or disclosure of \ntaxpayer information. It would also provide substantial relief for \ninnocent spouses in collection actions based on past joint returns by \nallowing spouses to be liable only for tax attributable to their \nincome.\n  Many of the taxpayer provisions in the IRS Reform Act are a direct \nresult of the abuses uncovered last year by the Senate Finance \nCommittee hearings. Many people were shocked to learn that a number of \nthe due process protections Americans take for granted in other legal \nproceedings do not apply to actions involving the IRS. The bill \ncorrects many of these injustices. Once this bill becomes law, the IRS \nwill be required to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days before the \nService files a notice of a Federal tax lien. A taxpayer would then \nhave 30 days to request a hearing by IRS appeals. No collection \nactivity would be allowed until after the hearing. The taxpayer would \nlikewise be able to petition the Tax Court to contest the appeals \ndecision. Finally, the communications privilege now granted only to \nattorneys would be extended to accountants and other tax practitioners. \nThis charge would provide taxpayers with the necessary confidentiality \nin communications with their tax preparers, whether or not they are \nlicensed attorneys.\n  I hope this reform activity will spread to some of the other \nagencies. We have people across America who are living in fear of the \nGovernment that they vote for, that they pay for, that is supposed to \nbe working for them--people who really want to do the right thing, but \nare afraid to ask the right questions for fear that question will be \nused to penalize them, for fear that question will put them in the \npublic spotlight and embarrass them. It isn't just the IRS; the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is one that a number of small \nbusinesses live in fear of asking a question about: Is it pollution? \nHow do I stop it? Can I clean it up and spend the money myself and not \nbe penalized?\n  OSHA is another one of those, where the small businessman lives in \nfear of asking the right question for fear it will result in a penalty \nand not an answer. Sometimes they are not even allowed to give an \nanswer, but they are allowed to penalize.\n  So what we are talking about in this bill is allowing the taxpayer to \nask his accountant the right question to see if that is what he really \nowes and not have that become a road map for the IRS for future action. \nI believe these changes will help rein in many of the intimidation \ntactics used to target the unsuspecting taxpayers.\n  Thirdly, and lastly, the IRS reform bill will bring and demand \ngreater accountability from the more than 100,000 employees who work \nfor the Internal Revenue Service.\n  It requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, \nphone number, and address of the IRS employee whom the taxpayer should \ncontact regarding the notice. Imagine that--being able to talk to the \nperson that knows the problem. Moreover, this bill requires the IRS to \nmaintain complaints of any employee misconduct on an individual \nemployee basis. This won't be just the IRS. Each person will have \naccountability. It will prohibit the IRS from labeling individual \ntaxpayers as ``illegal tax protesters'' and maintaining lists of these \nindividuals. The IRS will also have to disclose to taxpayers in simple \nterms the criteria and procedures for selecting taxpayers for audit. I \nbelieve this will decrease the ability of the IRS to target innocent \ntaxpayers and innocent small businesses for audit.\n  Mr. President, the IRS Reform Act will go a long way in reforming our \nGovernment's tax collection practices. By returning customer services \nand accountability to the IRS, this legislation helps ensure that the \nAmerican taxpayers are treated with the decency and respect they \ndeserve.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for the hearings that he held to \nlend emphasis to the need for this bill and the desire to have this \nbill.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has been made to get this \nbill moving through the process this week and look forward to the \ndebate that we will have on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS Restructuring \nand Reform Act of 1998.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming for his \nexcellent statement about the need for this legislation. All of us \ninvolved in this over the years, including the distinguished chairman, \nhope the debate that we are having will be constructive and\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nlead to enactment and passage by this body as quickly as possible after \nconference with the House and the signature of the President for \nsubstantial new powers, and the reason to believe that this change in \nthe law will improve the quality of service that every single American \ntaxpayer gets, and cause all of us to want to make certain that this \nbill passes as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we begin debate on today--the Internal \nRevenue Service Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998--will touch the \nlives of every taxpaying American. The law which authorizes the federal \nagency known as the IRS to collect taxes affects more Americans than \nany other.\n  Before I discuss what is in this legislation I must offer praise to \nseveral who have played key roles in developing the bill before us \ntoday. First among them is Senator Bill Roth, Chairman of the Senate's \nFinance Committee. Chairman Roth's enthusiasm for protecting American \ntaxpayers who fear this agency, his desire to make certain the \nCommissioner of this agency has the statutory authority to manage it, \nand his willingness to accommodate the ideas of all members of his \ncommittee made it possible to produce a unanimous vote of support.\n  Likewise, Senator Moynihan, our ranking member stood steadfastly with \nour Chairman to make certain our rhetorical excesses did not lead to \nchanges in the law which would have the perverse effect of increasing \nthe tax burden on law abiding Americans who experience no difficulty \nwith the IRS. One of the most difficult judgments we have to make is to \nseparate the legitimate and constructive complaint from those who \nsimply do not want to pay their taxes. To paraphrase H.L. Mencken: \n``Injustice is not so difficult to bear as people say; it is justice \nthat is difficult to bear.''\n  In addition I want to thank Senator Richard Shelby, Chairman of the \nTreasury Postal Subcommittee of the Senate's Appropriations Committee. \nHis support in 1995 for the creation of the National Commission of \nRestructuring the Internal Revenue Service--along with Congressmen Jim \nRoss Lightfoot and Steny Hoyer--was in response to the IRS having \nwasted $4 billion of taxpayers' money on a failed investment known as \nTax Systems Modernization.\n  Mr. President, I also want to praise the work done by Congressman Rob \nPortman, who was my co-chair of the National Commission.\n  Congressman Portman and I became partners in this year long effort \nduring which we received extensive input from American taxpayers and \nexperts on the IRS and tax system, holding 12 days of public hearings \nand spending hundreds of hours in private sessions with public and \nprivate sector experts, academics, and citizen's groups to review IRS \noperations and services. In addition to holding three field hearings in \nCincinnati, Omaha, and Des Moines, the Commission met privately with \nover 500 individuals, including senior level and front-line IRS \nemployees across the country.\n  Mr. President, let me also congratulate the men and women who served \non the National Commission beginning with Senator Grassley and \nCongressman Ben Cardin who cosponsored the House legislation. Together, \nwe worked hard to ensure this effort remained bipartisan and bicameral. \nRestructuring this agency so that taxpayer satisfaction becomes \nparamount at the new IRS by making certain this agency initiates \ncontact with a taxpayer only if the agency is prepared to devote the \nresources necessary for a proper and timely resolution of the matter is \nnot a partisan issue. Americans of all political persuasions are \ndemanding we change this law.\n  Finally, I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to Secretary of \nthe Treasury Bob Rubin and President Clinton. While our early \ndisagreements about governance were getting public attention, Secretary \nRubin was making substantial changes in the operation of IRS in \nresponse to the National Commission's work. Most notable was the \ndecision to break with precedent and nominate a person with business \nand management experience to be the IRS Commissioner, Mr. Charles \nRossotti.\n  The last time this law was changed was in 1952 in response to the \nproblem of widespread fraud and allegations of bribery. This time a key \nreason for taxpayer frustration with the IRS is the lack of appropriate \nattention to taxpayer needs especially when compared with service from \ncomparable private sector financial institutions. To increase customer \nservice without causing a deterioration in the IRS's ability to collect \nthe taxes Congress has directed the agency to collect is not as simple \nas it appears. Multiple changes are needed.\n  The key areas where this legislation makes changes are in executive \nbranch governance and management of the IRS, Congressional oversight of \nthe IRS, personnel flexibilities, customer service and compliance, \ntechnology modernization, electronic filing, tax law simplification, \ntaxpayer rights and financial accountability. Each add to a whole which \nI believe will be noted by taxpayers as improving the service they \nreceive and reducing the abuses they report.\n  As we debate this legislation remember that the IRS collects 95% of \nthe tax revenue this Congress uses to pay for spending this Congress \nhas authorized. Last year we appropriated $7 billion to the IRS to \ncollect $1.6 billion. This represents less than half of one percent of \ntotal revenues and makes the U.S. Tax collection agency the most \nefficient amongst all our industrial competitors. We would not be \ndebating this bill if we believed that we could not do better, but it \nis useful to understand the challenges presented to the IRS and to give \nthis agency credit for the successes it has achieved.\n  Mr. President, it is also useful to remember that a majority of \nAmericans (including those who testified before the National \nCommission) believe that when it comes time to apportion blame, \nCongress is more at fault than the IRS. And, given our enthusiasm for \nconstantly changing the tax code and inconsistent oversight, the \nAmerican people have figured this one out right.\n  The just passed Education IRA bill for K-12 expenses, would be the \n64th tax law added to the books since 1986 and will add significantly \nto the nearly $75 billion spent annually by taxpayers in an effort to \ncomply with the tax code. It is also an example of how Congress passes \ntax law without considering the cost of administering this new tax law \nand its real impact on the American taxpayers it is supposed to help.\n  The prospects are dizzying. I am not on the floor to argue the merits \nof this legislation, but I would like to discuss instead the facts of \nits results. This legislation allows for tax-free withdrawals from \neducation accounts for room and board, uniforms, transportation \nexpenses, or supplementary items or services, but only if these things \nare required or provided by the school. So this new law will not only \nrequire families to have a pretty sophisticated understanding of the \nlaw before they take their money out but will require the IRS to become \neven more invasive in their efforts to make certain that parents can \njustify their expenditures with detailed records.\n  Anyone who expresses surprise that the IRS will be asking taxpayers \nto submit busfare receipts and clothing bills with their tax returns is \nnot paying attention to the connection between the tax law and the \nactions of the IRS.\n  And the confusion does not end there, because when the bill sunsets \nin 2002, we will have established three separate rules governing \neducation savings accounts. This year, we have education savings \naccounts that can be used for higher education but not K through 12. \nNext year and through the year 2002, we have different rules which \nallow tax-free withdrawals from these accounts. After 2003, K through \n12 withdrawals could be made, but only from the contributions and \nearnings from 1999 and 2002.\n  So how will the taxpayers know what they are to take out is tax free? \nHow will the IRS know and how will the IRS attempt to explain these new \nrules to taxpayers, and who will understand them? Indeed, will anybody \nunderstand them? But that is the challenge the IRS will face. We pass a \nlaw; they have to write the changes in the code; they have to \ndisseminate those changes to the taxpayer; and then they have to judge \nwhether or not the taxpayer is abiding by the new rules and abiding by \nthe new code as written, as dictated by changes in the law that we have \njust passed.\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\n  There are no shortages of examples of actions taken by Congress to \nchange our tax laws that result in increased burdens on the American \ntaxpayers coupled--and I say it again. It isn't just an increased \nburden on the taxpayer, but every change we make in the tax law says to \nthe IRS: We want you to invade even more and find out more of what the \nAmerican people are doing before you allow this tax break to occur.\n  I urge citizens, if they are in doubt--we have the bill itself. That \nis what we are debating, a change in the law--Title VI of this law, \nthis bill before us today, is called Technical Corrections. Now, most \nof these technical corrections are to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nAnd lest anybody think I am down here taking a shot at someone who \nvoted for it, I voted for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. With an \ninterest in saying that we balance our budget, I voted for the bill. \nBut all the provisions and technical corrections are technical \ncorrections as a consequence of confusion in the law, and that \nconfusion increases the burden on the taxpayer, increases their \nrequirement to go to accountants to figure out what the Tax Code is, \nand increases the likelihood when there is a dispute between the IRS \nand the taxpayer, the taxpayer is going to come to us with a complaint \nabout the invasive nature of the IRS.\n  I urge citizens to read what is called ``Explanation of Provision'' \nin the Finance Committee report, the much smaller document that is \navailable to citizens as they follow this debate, especially those who \nare staff of Members on the floor. Read the ``Explanation of \nProvision.'' You get an understanding of the difficulty that the \nAmerican people are having and why they are right to conclude that, in \nspite of our rhetoric, we have created many of the problems they \nexperience with the IRS.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to go briefly through the provisions \nof this proposed new law to make the point that Congress has finally \ngot the message from the American people. With the enactment of this \nlegislation, we will make dealing with the IRS much easier than it has \nbeen in the past.\n  The first of the four titles is the most relevant. Title I, Mr. \nPresident, deals with executive branch governance and management of the \nIRS. In addition to directing the IRS to revise its mission statement \nto provide greater emphasis on serving the public and meeting the needs \nof taxpayers, there are five major changes in this title that deserve \nattention.\n  First, the IRS Commissioner would be directed under law to \nrestructure the IRS by eliminating or substantially modifying the \npresent law three-tier geographic area structure and replacing it with \nan organizational structure that features operating units serving four \ngroups of taxpayers with similar needs.\n  Mr. President, this three-tier structure was created in 1952, and \nwhat the Commissioner has proposed to do is follow the lead, the \nrecommendation, of the Restructuring Commission to organize by four \nfunctional categories--that is to say, individual taxpayers, small \nbusinesses, large businesses, and the tax-exempt sector.\n  Under this structure, each unit will be charged with end-to-end \nresponsibility for serving a particular group of taxpayers. Today, each \nof the 33 district offices and then 10 service centers are required to \ndeal with every kind of taxpayer and every type of issue. The proposed \nplan would enable IRS personnel to understand the needs and problems \naffecting and protecting groups of taxpayers and better address those \nissues.\n  I am going to digress a bit and talk about an amendment that is going \nto come before this floor to knock out a provision that would have on \nthe nine-member oversight board a member of the Treasury Employees \nUnion or someone who represents a large number of employees. This \nprovision is why there needs to be a Treasury employee representative \non there. This will require significant personnel changes. This is not \nan easy thing for the Commissioner to do. We, I think, are quite \ncorrect in putting in statute that we want him to do that, that we \ndirect him to either eliminate or substantially eliminate this three-\ntier system. But this will require significant personnel structuring. I \nbelieve we need to have that representative on the inside of the tent \nwhen these decisions are made. It is much more likely that a \nsatisfactory result will occur.\n  So my colleagues will understand, both Congressman Portman and I \nsupport this. And support for the idea came from a number of other \npeople who have gone through this, most notable of which is Australia. \nWhen they restructured their tax collection agency, they found lots of \npersonnel issues that were surfacing, and they made the decision early \non. They testified that it was a sound decision to put that employee \nrepresentative on the governing board.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am in the Chamber now, and I wanted to make it clear \nto the Senator that I am learning a lot as I hear him go through the \nbill, and I hope the Senator will take his time in explaining the \nprovisions. This is an important piece of legislation, and I just want \nto make that clear out of courtesy.\n\n  Please go forward with the arguments. I am learning in the Chamber.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate it. I thank the Senator.\n  The present-law structure impedes continuity and accountability. I \nemphasize this. This is one of the big complaints to the Restructuring \nCommission and the hearings that Senator Roth had. We heard repeatedly \nfrom taxpayers that they just didn't know what was going on; something \nwould start and stop. They did not get continuity and accountability \nunder present law.\n  For example, if a taxpayer moves--let's say a taxpayer decides that \nthey would rather live in Omaha, NE, than Portland, OR--a logical move, \nit seems to me. They decide they want to go from Oregon to Nebraska. \nResponsibility for the taxpayer's account would move to another \ngeographical area. It would transfer to the Nebraska area. Every \ntaxpayer is served by a service center in at least one district. So in \naddition to the new service area, there is a new service center. Thus, \nmany taxpayers have to work with different offices on the same issue. \nThus, again, they fail to provide the continuity. They fail to provide \nthe accountability that everybody expects when they are dealing with \nany private sector organization.\n  The proposed structure would eliminate many of these problems. Not \nonly would this proposed structure eliminate that problem, but it is \nmuch more likely the Commissioner is going to be able to come to us \nwith some real exciting changes. For example, by putting all small \nbusinesses together, I believe it is likely--every other tax \ncommissioner that talked to us about this said that its likely the \nCommissioner will come and say, We have got 35, 40, maybe 50 percent of \nour small businesses that are paying no taxes but they are spending $1 \nbillion or so, they are spending a lot of money, complying. We can \nreduce the cost of compliance without reducing the amount of money \ncoming in to us by simply exempting a significant number of people.\n  Likewise, if there is a huge difference between the problems faced in \ncollecting taxes from individuals, most of whom have withholding \naccounts--and 99 percent of the American people who have withholding \ncomply with the Tax Code. They are the easiest to collect taxes from. \nThey are just trying to figure out what the amount is so they can get \nit paid in an expeditious fashion to factor it into the family budget. \nWhereas a large business, $600,000 to $1 million or more, they have a \ncomplicated set of circumstances, much more labor intensive, much more \nlikely to have accountants and lawyers, and so forth, working with \nthem.\n  What the Commissioner is proposing to do is get rid of this three-\ntiered structure, and what we have done with this legislation is \nincorporate it into law.\n  Let me say the chairman and I have had many disagreements about the \ntiming of this thing. The Senate has made substantial improvements to \nits bill, and this is one of them. This is an area where we have \nsubstantially improved what the House passed by incorporating the \nrecommendation of the Restructuring Commission to knock\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nout this three-tiered system and go to a functionalized system. I \npredict that for small business, large business, as well as nonprofit, \nthey are going to find a big improvement in the way they get services \nfrom the IRS. I think we are going to find happier customers and we are \ngoing to find ourselves with an IRS that costs even less on a unit \nbasis than it currently does.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  Another major change made by this law, Madam President, is the \ncreation of a new executive branch oversight board. This bill sets up a \nnine-member, public-private board to oversee the IRS in the \n``administration, management, conduct, direction and supervision of the \nexecution and application of the internal revenue laws.'' There are \nsome specific references to what is not covered in this legislation, \nwhat this board would not be doing. It is not expected to be \nmicromanaging. It will not be given information about taxpayers' \nreturns, except in unusual circumstances where they need to know. They \nare not going to be involved in procurement. They are not going to be \ninvolved in personnel issues. There are lots of things that are \nspecifically excluded. They are going to be subject to all the \nconflict-of-interest laws that any executive branch appointment would \nbe. All these things have been laid out in the legislation and are \nworth reviewing by Members who are wondering how this new oversight \nboard is going to operate.\n  Specifically, Madam President, the board will review and approve \nstrategic plans for the IRS, review the operational functions of the \nIRS--including plans for tax administration systems modernization, \nreview and approve major reorganizations and review operations of the \nIRS to ensure the proper treatment of taxpayers.\n  Madam President, we tried to avoid what I think is a common mistake \nwhen creating boards like this, and that is to specify precisely what \neach member has to be in order to be nominated. What we did was we set \nout a half a dozen or so different areas that we think are important, \ndifferent knowledge bases that we think are important in order for this \nboard to be able to do its job, and we give the President a substantial \namount of authority to make those decisions. We stagger the appointment \nterms so that eventually you get to a point where everybody is on a 5-\nyear term. They can be extended for 5 years. We stagger the Chair as \nwell. I think we have created an administrative structure that will \ndramatically increase the accountability and will make it much easier \nfor us in Congress to do good oversight of the IRS.\n  This title I also, Madam President, establishes a 5-year term for the \nCommissioner of the IRS. That has been discussed before. We need \nincreased continuity. Both the Commissioner and the Assistant Treasury \nSecretary, who has principal first line authority over the \nCommissioner, have, over the last 10 years, been on the job somewhere \nlike an average of 2 or 3 years. This presents serious continuity \nproblems. We establish a 5-year term for the Commissioner and we \nrequire the Commissioner to have demonstrated ability in management. \nThis title also gives the Commissioner a great amount of flexibility in \nhiring those persons necessary to administer and enforce the Nation's \ntax laws.\n  Another important part of title I is the way that this title beefs up \nand makes more independent, the taxpayer advocate. Later, if the floor \nis vacated, I may come down here, I may stand here and read the various \nprovisions in this part of title I. Colleagues need to understand that \nthis taxpayer advocate is going to be completely different than the \ncurrent taxpayer advocate. The bill gives the IRS oversight board input \ninto the selection of the taxpayer advocate. It limits prior and future \nemployment of the advocate with the IRS, and gives the advocate broad \ndiscretion to provide relief with regard to taxpayers. It provides a \nproblem resolution system with local taxpayer advocates who report \ndirectly to the national taxpayer advocate.\n\n  Currently, we have a thing called a taxpayer advocate. We are going \nto have a national taxpayer advocate and I guarantee every single \nMember is going to find that this taxpayer advocate provides a much \ndifferent kind of service, much more independent service than with what \nwe are currently dealing. The advocate is required to report to \nCongress on a variety of compliance problems, identify those repetitive \nproblems that may be there as a result of the code, may be there as a \nresult of the law.\n  This is a very, very powerful new position, Madam President. I thank \nSenator Breaux of Louisiana. He is the principal author of this change. \nI would put it second on the list of things that the Senate changed in \nthe House bill that are substantial improvements. My guess is \nCongressman Portman and the others on the House side, Chairman Archer, \nwill accept these changes. Senator Breaux made it a point to figure out \nhow to better help taxpayers with a complaint about their treatment by \nthe IRS. This section is a substantial improvement.\n  Another improvement was made by the chairman, which establishes a \nnew, independent Treasury inspector general for tax administration \nwithin the Department of Treasury. Currently, we have two. We have an \ninspection division in the IRS; we have an IG over Treasury. We still \nhave an IG at Treasury under this new law, but we move the IG for tax \nadministration over to Treasury. We leave the audit function in the \nIRS. There will be two IGs. The IG for Treasury will be responsible for \nTreasury items and the tax administration IG will be responsible for \nthe IRS. It is a big improvement over the current status quo. We have \nhad difficulty finding out who is responsible, going to point the \nfinger back and forth as to who had the authority. This makes it clear \nwho does and who does not have the authority for doing IG reports and \ninvestigations of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  As the committee report notes, Madam President, this will give the \nIRS Office of the Chief Inspector ``sufficient structural and actual \nautonomy from the agency it is charged with monitoring and \noverseeing.'' That is the goal. It is the hope of the chairman, and \nindeed the hope of the entire committee, this provision will improve \nthe quality as well as the credibility of IRS oversight.\n  Madam President, in title II we deal with an arcane issue that I \nconsider to be quite important, and that is the issue of electronic \nfiling, where the potential for increasing efficiency and decreasing \ncomplaints is substantial. Indeed, I envision the IRS in this \nlegislation being the first of a long line of Government agencies \nmigrating from the old world of paper transactions to the new world of \nelectronic commerce. Indeed, my vision also includes the law enabling \nthe Commissioner to establish rules and regulations so the private \nsector has a substantial opportunity to compete for businesses from the \ncustomers who it is already handling. We had some very exciting \ntestimony in this regard from the IRS in the National Restructuring \nCommission about what the private sector is doing already to try to \nhelp taxpayers reduce the cost to comply with the tax law.\n  It is very important to point out that for most American taxpayers, \nif not all American taxpayers, the largest bill they pay every year is \ntheir tax bill. It is important for them to understand what that tax \nbill is and to get it paid for in an efficient fashion in order for \nthem to do financial planning for their families.\n\n  I hope that this electronic filing provision, by stating the goal of \npromotion of electronic filing and setting a long-range goal of 80 \npercent of all tax returns by the year 2007, will make it more likely \nthat taxpayers, as they migrate to this electronic field of commerce, \nwill have lower costs and an easier time of complying.\n  Title III is a portion that has been given a lot of attention. As I \nsaid at the beginning, there are lots of parts to this overall whole. \nThere is no question that taxpayer rights are important. Senator \nGrassley and Senator Pryor, while he was still in the Senate, were sort \nof alternating chair and ranking members of the Subcommittee on Finance \nthat dealt with a piece of legislation called the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights I, Taxpayer Bill of Rights II. This is effectively Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights III. Also, I want to call attention to the fact that for an \nentire year, Congressman Portman, who was my cochair of this \nCommission, steadily made me a convert of the need to extend additional \npowers to taxpayers. There are lots of them in this title III.\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n  The goal of this change in the law is to reach a point where all \ntaxpayers are presumed to be law-abiding citizens who just want to know \nthe amount of their tax so they can pay, rather than presuming that all \ntaxpayers are criminals or cheats. But the goal is also to preserve the \nimportant law enforcement functions of reducing the threat of drugs, \nmoney laundering, and fraudulent commercial transactions. None of us \nwant to change the law and then find out 2 years later that we made it \neasier for drug dealers, money launderers, and commercial cheats out \nthere to do business as a result of decreasing the power of the \ncriminal investigation division of the IRS. We must also make certain \nthat the IRS has the authority and the resources to go after those \ncitizens who intentionally avoid paying taxes. We need to make certain \nthe IRS has the full force of law to leverage against them.\n  Madam President, there are seven provisions in title III that are \nworthy of comment at this time. First is the burden of proof. Once a \ndispute reaches Tax Court under this new law, the burden of proof in a \ncivil case shifts from the taxpayer to the IRS. There are a lot of \nconcerns expressed about this from the standpoint of actually \nincreasing the cost to complying taxpayers. We have limited the \nopportunity for this shift. I think it is a responsible provision in \nthe legislation, and I am hopeful it will be retained as is.\n  Second, the bill increases the leverage of taxpayers in civil \nproceedings by expanding the authority to award costs and certain fees \nand increasing potential civil damages for collection actions.\n  A lot of people on the administration side, not this administration \nbut who administer tax law, were concerned about this provision. I \nthink it is a terribly important provision if we are going to try to \nget to a point where, when collection notices are send out, the IRS \nknows with certainty they are going to be able to devote enough \nresources to be able to get the collection, because very often what \nhappens is they send a collection notice out, start an action, and then \nthey don't have enough resources, they stop, it drags on for years and \nyears and years, and that is where you end up with taxpayers spending \nan enormous amount of money trying to comply with something the IRS, at \nthe end of the day, finds out they didn't think was much of a case \nanyway.\n  This will, I think, create a healthy amount of constraint on the IRS \nfrom sending collection notices out knowing there is an expanded right \nof action and expanded right, as well, to collect civil damages if \nnegligence can be proved.\n  Third, the bill provides significant relief for what are known as \n``innocent spouses'' and for taxpayers who are unable to manage their \nfinancial affairs because of disabilities.\n  Fourth, the bill gives the taxpayer new protections against the \npiling on of interest and penalties.\n  Fifth, title III contains protections for taxpayers subject to audit \nor collection activities.\n  Sixth, this title requires better disclosures to taxpayers. One of \nthe most important things we heard repetitively was that the taxpayer \nsimply didn't know what the case was, didn't understand what was going \non. This requires the IRS to make full disclosure so that the taxpayer \ncan better accommodate the needs of the IRS.\n  Seventh, the bill authorizes establishment of low-income taxpayer \nclinics. This is very important. There are an awful lot of Americans \nwho simply don't have the resources to either hire a private sector \nindividual or to do it themselves. They are confused about it. Our law \nought to always be written so that everybody has a shot at the American \ndream, and they should not be precluded from achieving that American \ndream because they don't have enough resources to understand how the \nIRS works.\n  Title IV of this legislation deals with congressional accountability. \nMost of the changes which the Senate Finance Committee has made in the \nHouse bill have made the legislation better. I indicated several of \nthem already. However, I don't believe title IV represents an \nimprovement over the House bill.\n  The goal of congressional oversight must be to overcome two \nsubstantial barriers that the Restructuring Commission found. Barrier \nNo. 1 is that the IRS has 535 members of its board of directors, many \nof whom don't know what the IRS does or what the budget is. It is easy \nto complain about what the IRS does, but the IRS gets inconsistent \nsignals--we want you to go out and collect the taxes; we don't want you \nto be too aggressive; we want you to be more aggressive, less \naggressive; Congress changes, new Members come on board with new ideas, \nand it is inconsistent oversight that comes as a consequence of all \nthese kind of changes.\n  The second barrier is that the Commissioner, now required to have \nmanagement expertise, when he or she comes to Congress with their plan \nof what they want to do, they have to go to six different oversight \ncommittees--three in the Senate and three in the House.\n  What the Commission found repeatedly--again, remember, we started \nthis whole thing with Senator Shelby and I saying $4 billion wasted on \ntax system modernization is a call for action. One of the things we \nheard both from public sector and private sector people is that if you \ncan't get shared consensus about where it is you want to go with \ntechnology--as the man said, any road is likely to take you there--you \nare apt then, as a consequence, to make mistakes.\n  It is this increased activity from all the different congressional \noversight committees that may have good intentions but also may make it \ndifficult for us to achieve consensus. We recommended in our bill and \nthe House-passed bill that some kind of super-oversight occur on a \nbiennial basis with these consolidated committees. It may be the \nFinance Committee can simply change its internal rules. I made a \nrecommendation last week in the Finance Committee. It may be there is \nsome way we can deal with that. But let's not pass a bill which \nrestructures the executive branch and then doesn't restructure anything \nwe do. Remember, if you ask the American people who the problem is, 70 \npercent say it is Congress. We write the laws and determine what kind \nof oversight IRS gets, and one of the problems is inconsistent \noversight. My hope is we can take a look at title IV and look for ways \nto strengthen the congressional oversight.\n\n  There is a tax complexity analysis in title IV which I consider to be \nterribly important. I cited earlier the example of the education IRA. \nThere was no discussion of the impact upon the taxpayers, no discussion \nof complexity analysis, no attempt to measure whether or not the IRS is \ngoing to be more invasive or less invasive. There was no cost analysis \ndone at all.\n  The Commissioner is not at the table when the tax laws are written. \nUnder this new law, the Commissioner will be empowered to comment. It \ncould be the President stands up and has some new tax law idea--HOPE \nscholarships, for example. It could be ``Senator Blowhard'' giving a \nspeech about some new idea that he or she has. Whoever it is who has \nsome change in the Tax Code, typically it is designed to give an \naudience some sense of, we are doing something without spending any \nmoney. We have to be very careful that we don't, in the process of \ndoing something that is earning a round of applause, do something that \nwill increase the cost to the taxpayer to comply, as well, Madam \nPresident, as increasing the invasiveness of the IRS.\n  I appreciate very much there is a tax complexity analysis and the \nCommissioner is given new authorities to comment on tax bills, but I \nbelieve we can go a bit further in increasing the oversight and the \naccountability of the Congress. In title VI, as I said, these are \nmostly what are called technical corrections, but it is a real window \ninto this problem of tax complexity.\n  I don't know what the vote was--maybe the Senator from Minnesota \nremembers--but there was a big vote on the Balanced Budget Act, with 80 \nvotes. I voted for it. We passed this thing, issued press releases, \n``The budget is balanced.'' Most of these technical corrections in \ntitle IV deal with the complexity that we created and the confusion \nthat we created. It is an effort to clarify what we tried to do last \nfall.\n  I want to point out that the members of the Finance Committee and the \nstaff\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\nof the Finance Committee, both on the majority and minority side, have \nscrubbed this section very carefully to ensure that all the provisions \nin this title are appropriate and relatively noncontroversial. We have \nnot added new loopholes or some new, special provision. These are only \ntechnical corrections that clarify what we intended to do mostly, as I \nsaid, in 1997.\n  In brief, these are the provisions of the bill that we are \nconsidering today. I no doubt will have plenty of opportunity to come \ndown again and describe some further detail that is in this proposed \nlaw. I will end as I began, by praising the outstanding leadership and \nwork of Senators Roth and Moynihan as well as the longstanding work on \ntaxpayers' rights performed by Senator Grassley. With the 426-to-4 vote \nlast fall by the House of Representatives and the support of President \nClinton, we should be able to change the law and achieve our objective \nof giving the American people an IRS that is more user friendly and \ncustomer oriented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from \nNebraska. He has really led the way on this issue. He is well known for \nhis outspokenness as a Senator, and he has been outspoken on this \nquestion long before the rest of us.\n  I think we will pass this bill this week. I think it will be a very \nstrong, bipartisan effort. Senator Kerrey mentioned Senator Grassley \nand Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, but on any one piece of legislation \nor any one issue, at least it is my view as a Senator, you need a \nSenator who is a catalyst, you need someone who is out there ahead of \nother people, who is willing to be very outspoken and push very hard. \nThe Senator from Nebraska has done just that.\n\n\n                      TAX RETURN FILING EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, let me just say to the authors of \nthis legislation, and I thank them for their fine support, I will have \none amendment that is terribly important to my State of Minnesota.\n  Last year, we were hit by floods that had a devastating effect on our \ncommunity. I think people all over the country know about Grand Forks \nand East Grand Forks and other communities. Last year, we said to \npeople who were struggling because of what happened that we would \nextend the time for them to file their tax returns, and when they had \nto pay their taxes. We also were willing to forgive them on the \ninterest they would have to pay for late filing and late payment.\n  This time around, this past year, just a few months ago, we were hit \nwith tornadoes that were just devastating to communities like Saint \nPeter and Le Center and a number of other different communities. I \ncould list many. What we have now in the bill is the assurance from \nlast year that Minnesotans who have been hit by tornadoes, communities \nthat have been hit by tornadoes, can again extend the filing of their \ntax return and when they make their payments, but we don't have any \nprovision that would allow them forgiveness on the interest.\n  I will have an amendment that will give them forgiveness on the \ninterest payment. It will be a huge help to people who have really been \nthrough it, colleagues. I think there will be strong support for this. \nWhat I will essentially say in this amendment, for the next year what \nwe will do is for all citizens across the country, including \nMinnesotans who have been hit with these disasters, that they will, No. \n1, have an extension again on the filing and payment of tax; and for \nthose that have been personally affected--not everyone, because the \ncost runs up--but for those personally affected, they will again be \nforgiven the interest on this payment.\n  It is not a huge expenditure. We will have an offset. I say to \ncolleagues it is terribly important to a lot of people in Minnesota and \nI think a lot of people around the country. I hope this amendment will \nbe approved. I think other colleagues will come to the floor with \nsimilar amendments. We can do this together, Democrats and Republicans, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I am trying to make sure we get help to \npeople.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act. This is a much stronger and much \nmore effective bill because of the time that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, has taken to thoroughly \ninvestigate problems at the agency and identify meaningful solutions. I \nwant to commend him for his work.\n  The politically easy thing to do would have been to rush the original \nbill to a vote, as many on the other side tried to do on numerous \noccasions. But by taking the time to do the job right, we have a much \nbetter bill. For one thing, we now have far stronger provisions to \nprotect innocent spouses. The legislation would ensure that innocent \nspouses are responsible only for their own tax liability.\n  Madam President, it was two and a half months ago that I came before \nthe Senate to discuss the plight of a constituent of mine, a woman who \ndivorced in late 1995. She paid her taxes in full and on time during \nthe last two years of her marriage, but her husband apparently did not. \nThe IRS ultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse \ndid not pay. It did not aggressively pursue the tax bill with him.\n  After two weeks after hearing from my constituent, I sent Chairman \nRoth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform bill, and on \nthat short list was a recommendation to make innocent-spouse relief \neasier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, or at least \nto all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill.\n  So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused \non the issue of innocent-spouse protection and has included provisions \nthat better protect my constituent and women across the country in \nsimilar situations.\n  The Finance Committee has improved upon the bill in other ways, too. \nFor example, it would suspend interest charges and penalties after one \nyear if the IRS fails to notify a taxpayer of a deficiency. Without \nthat provision, taxpayers can find that penalties and interest started \naccruing years before they were ever made aware that there was a \nproblem with their tax returns.\n  The bill would make the Taxpayer Advocate's office independent of the \nagency to ensure that it represents the taxpayers' interest, not just \nthe agency's interest. It would give the IRS Commissioner the statutory \nauthority he needs to restructure the agency. It would hold IRS \nemployees accountable for their actions by requiring the agency to \nterminate employees who commit perjury, falsify documents, or violate \nthe rules to retaliate against a taxpayer. It would make the offers-in-\ncompromise program more fair to taxpayers. And it would ensure due \nprocess in collections activities.\n  These are important things--changes worth taking the time to make. We \nhave got to try to get things right. Too many past attempts to rein in \nthe IRS have come up short, and once Congress's attention turns to \nother things, the agency has gone back to business as usual.\n  This is a good bill. It deserves an ``aye'' vote. But let us be under \nno illusion that even a good reform bill will solve the myriad problems \nthat exist. Our nation's Tax Code, as currently written, amounts to \nthousands of pages of confusing, seemingly contradictory tax-law \nprovisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless that reform is \nfollowed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the Internal Revenue \nCode, problems with collections and enforcement are likely to persist. \nIf the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it does not matter what kind of \npersonnel or process changes we make at the agency. Complexity invites \ndifferent interpretations of the tax laws from different people, and \nthat is where most of the problems at the IRS arise.\n  Replacing the existing code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would \nfacilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive \nIRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to \nlobby for complicated tax loopholes.\n  There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are \npending before Congress: a flat-rate income tax; a national sales tax, \nthe Kemp Commission's simpler single-rate tax. Each has its passionate \nadvocates in Congress and around the country, and any\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\none of these options would be preferable to the existing income-tax \nsystem.\n  So why, many people will ask, have we not been able to settle on one \nof them and act on fundamental tax reform? The answer is that, while \nthere is overwhelming public consensus in favor of an overhaul of the \nTax Code, a public consensus has yet to emerge in favor of a sales tax \nover a flat tax or some alternative. And given President Clinton's lack \nof support for fundamental tax reform, it is likely to take a public \nconsensus, the likes of which we have not seen in recent years, to \ndrive such a tax-overhaul plan through Congress, past the President, \nand into law.\n  Steve Forbes made tax reform the central theme of his campaign for \nthe presidency two years ago. He carried Arizona in the Republican \npresidential primary, in large part because his tax plan resonated \namong the people in my state. Yet he failed to win the nomination, and \nneither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole pursued the issue with as much \npassion or conviction. And it will take a national campaign to build \nthe kind of consensus that will be needed to move forward with \nfundamental tax reform, which is probably the most momentous \nundertaking of the century.\n  The IRS reform bill, Finance Committee hearings about taxpayer abuse \nby the IRS, the Kemp Commission's recommendations in favor of \nfundamental tax reform, new proposals to sunset the IRS Code, and the \ndebate that sponsors of the flat tax and sales tax have taken on the \nroad in recent months, will all help to move the discussion forward.\n  In conclusion, we can pass an IRS reform bill to try to rein in the \nIRS and make sure that it treats taxpayers fairly, reasonably, and \nrespectfully. But let us not fool ourselves. The IRS cannot be faulted \nfor a Tax Code that is too complex and filled with contradictory \nprovisions.\n  Until the Tax Code is simplified, problems in one form or another are \nlikely to persist. We must use this opportunity to begin the debate \nabout fundamental tax reform.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4147-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4197-S4198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JAMES C. HORMEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today with a little bit of \nsense of sadness to bring to my colleagues' attention the nomination--I \nguess I will add, and indignation--the nomination of James C. Hormel to \nbe U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. As is the case too often up here, the \nnomination has been put on the shelf, held by a ``hold'' at the request \nof a few Senators.\n  Before I talk about the reasons for the ``hold,'' I want to talk \nbriefly about the history of the nomination and some facts about the \nnominee, Mr. Hormel, and his background.\n  Last fall, following a hearing on his nomination, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee voted 16 to 2 in favor of Mr. Hormel. This vote \ntook place November 4, 1997. Originally, it was a voice vote. It was \napproved. That means by unanimous vote. Two Senators then requested to \nhave a recorded vote and went on record in opposition. So it was a 16-2 \nvote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is a very strong \nvote.\n\n  The nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar. And despite the \nfact that the Senate confirmed every other Foreign Relations Committee \nnominee before the close of the first session--some 50 nominees in \ntotal--Jim Hormel's nomination was left languishing because of \n``holds'' placed on it by a few Senators.\n  Madam President, that such a distinguished and qualified nominee \nwould face opposition is on its face hard to understand.\n  Jim Hormel is first and foremost a loving and devoted father of five \nand a grandfather of 13. His entire family has been unfailingly \nsupportive of his nomination. And people who know him well say he is \ndecent, patient and a very gentle person.\n  Madam President, I was very moved by a letter from Alice Turner, \nformer wife of James Hormel, a letter written to the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, supporting her ex-husband's nomination. And I quote:\n\n       I have known Jim for 46 years and for ten of those years I \n     was married to him . . . I grew to understand the terrible \n     prejudice and hatred that he knew he would have to face . . . \n     and is facing as he goes through the difficult process this \n     nomination and its opponents have put him through . . . I \n     share with you these personal things because I gather his \n     personal ethics have been questioned. If anyone on this earth \n     could come close to judging that it would be me. He is a \n     wonderful father, grandfather and friend . . . Jim Hormel has \n     given enormously to his family, his community and to this \n     country. He is just asking to be allowed to give one more \n     time. This is a good man. Give him a chance.\n\n  End of quote to Senator Lott.\n  His professional credentials are equally impressive. He is an \naccomplished businessman. He serves as chairman of Equidex, an \ninvestment firm, and he serves as a member of the board of directors of \nthe San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.\n  He has also spent time as a lawyer and as an educator. He served as a \ndean and assistant dean of students at the University of Chicago Law \nSchool. In addition, he currently serves as a member of the board of \nmembers of his alma mater, Swarthmore College.\n  Let me just give my colleagues a sampling of the kind of \norganizations he served on, impressive in its breadth as well as its \ndiversity. In addition to his support for Swarthmore and the University \nof Chicago, he has provided resources and assistance to the Virginia \nInstitute of Autism, Breast Cancer Action, the American Foundation for \nAIDS Research, the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro \nCollege Fund, the NAACP, the Institute for International Education, the \nHuman Rights Campaign Foundation, Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish \nFamily and Child Services, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the \nSan Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the San \nFrancisco Symphony.\n  Many of these organizations have honored him with awards. His \ncommitment to public service and his commitment to the cause of human \nrights came together when he was named as a member of the United States \ndelegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995. \nAnd there he helped the United States press its case for improved human \nrights in nations as diverse as China, Cuba, and Iraq.\n  Finally, he was nominated in 1977 to serve as an alternative \nrepresentative on the U.S. delegation to the 51st General Assembly.\n\n  There is an irony because on May 23, 1997, the same U.S. Senate that \nopposes his nomination, not letting us have a vote, unanimously \nconfirmed James Hormel to represent this country at the United Nations.\n  Madam President, it seems clear to many of us why some Senators do \nnot want to allow a vote on James Hormel's nomination. It is because \nJames Hormel is gay. In a queer, unquestionable case of discrimination, \nthese Senators refuse to let the full Senate vote on a qualified \nnominee because of his sexual orientation. Surely, the U.S. Senate does \nnot want to be party to this kind of discrimination.\n  James Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be encouraged \nto engage in public service. He is intelligent, civic-minded, generous, \nand he is a person of proven accomplishment who wants to serve our \ncountry. We need people like him in public service. We cannot afford to \ndrive him away because of his sexual orientation.\n  So, Madam President, this is a matter of simple fairness. We have \nbefore us a qualified nominee, with broad support, approved by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. We should at least be allowed a vote on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. If people have concerns, let them express \nthem. Let us have a debate, and let us address them, but let us give \nJames Hormel a chance. Let us have a vote.\n  So I call on the majority leader to schedule a vote on James Hormel's \nnomination. I call upon those who have a hold to allow the nomination \nto reach the floor. If other Senators wish, let us debate the \nqualifications. But it is wrong to prevent the Senate from having an \nup-or-down vote on this nomination.\n  Some of the Senators who have holds on this nomination claim that it \nis not\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nbecause he is gay. They claim it is because of his views on certain \nissues involving gay rights or something to that effect. The truth is, \nI do not know exactly what their objections are.\n  But there is a more important truth. If Senators disagree with this \nnomination, let them come to the floor. Let us debate this out in the \nopen. That is what the tradition of the U.S. Senate about deliberative \naction is all about. So I challenge my colleagues who have holds on \nthis nomination to come to this very floor, explain why they believe \nJames Hormel is unfit to become an American Ambassador because he \nhappens to be gay. Let other Senators and the American people judge on \nthe merits of this argument.\n  The issue is a very simple one. We have a qualified nominee who was \nresoundingly approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is \nentitled to a vote. And as a United States Senator, I am entitled to \ncast my vote for him.\n  Madam President, I have language which would be a sense of the Senate \nto express the intention of the Senate to consider the nomination of \nJames Hormel as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg, that the Senate \nwould make clear its intention to consider this nomination before a \ncertain date and to vote. I will not bring this amendment up on this \nbill. But this is an amendment that I will bring to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate on another bill. It is time for us to speak up. It is time \nfor us to deal with what is an injustice.\n  Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues from California, \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. And I will work with other \ncolleagues as well.\n\n  Let me just conclude by reading on this matter--and I say to my \ncolleague from Arkansas, I have just one other matter in morning \nbusiness to cover, and I shall be brief--from the Fort Worth Star-\nTelegram, ``Senate Should Be Allowed To Vote.'' In an editorial calling \nfor Republicans to let the Senate vote on James Hormel, the Fort Worth \nStar-Telegram writes:\n\n       Conservatives, like Sens. Gordon Smith of Oregon and Orrin \n     Hatch of Utah take him at his word and support his \n     nomination. Some others, harking to conservative groups that \n     are part of the GOP constituency, do not. Yet they say the \n     issue is not his sexual orientation. If it is not, then the \n     Senate should be allowed to vote, yea or nay. If sexual \n     orientation actually is the issue, then the Senate needs to \n     take a look at itself in the mirror.\n\n  I repeat that. ``If sexual orientation actually is the issue''--I say \nthis to the majority leader. I call on the majority leader to bring \nthis matter before the Senate for a vote. I quote the Fort Worth Star-\nTelegram, the conclusion:\n\n       If sexual orientation actually is the issue, then the \n     Senate needs to take a look at itself in the mirror.\n\n  We will not know until we have this nomination out on the floor. And \nwe must do that. I hope the majority leader will take action. I have an \namendment that I will bring to the floor if that is what is necessary. \nI think it is time for all of us to speak up.\n  Madam President, I just have one other matter that I want to cover in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4197-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4198-S4199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just briefly speak to one major \npublic policy question that we will deal with in the U.S. Senate. I \nwant to talk about something that has happened in the past couple of \nyears which has had a major impact on the lives of people in Minnesota \nand across the country. I think people are scratching their head and \ntrying to figure out when we had a referendum on this or when we voted.\n  The topic is all the ways in which large insurance companies are \ndominating managed health care plans, all the ways the pendulum has \nswung so far in the other direction. Many citizens that need the care \ncannot get the care they needed.\n  Jenna Johnson is only 15 years old. She suffers from cerebral palsy, \nseizures and a deteriorating condition called dystonia, which causes \nher to lose most of the muscle control in her body. She takes multiple \nprescription medications, undergoes countless hours of physical \ntherapy, and relies on special medical equipment to live her life. Her \ntreatments have nearly broken her body, colleagues, but her spirit and \ndetermination remain firmly intact.\n  In the spring of 1966 Jenna's dystonia worsened. She was fragile from \nweight loss caused from the 22 pills she took daily to combat her \nsymptoms. The medication caused serious side effects, ranging from \ndamage to her stomach lining to psychotic episodes. The Johnsons found \na specialist, a world-renowned pediatric surgeon in Pittsburgh that was \nan expert in treating conditions similar to Jenna's. He had the \nexpertise in testing and surgery to place an internal pump and catheter \nto deliver medication.\n  To make a long and very painful story short, this procedure was \nJenna's only hope. She was slipping away before her parents' eyes.\n  Minnesota is a great health care State. We have the University of \nMinnesota. We have the Mayo Clinic. Many people from other States--\nDelaware, Nebraska or Arkansas--quite often are referred to our State. \nBut in this particular case, the expert that could help was a pediatric \nsurgeon in Pittsburgh. The doctor was out of the plan and out of the \nState and the Johnsons were out of luck.\n  The request for the procedure was immediately denied. After an \nappeals process of more than 30 days and countless visits to local \ndoctors and letters to doctors in Pittsburgh and the HMO, the Johnson's \nplan finally allowed Jenna to undergo the procedure.\n  It is wrong, Madam President, when a sick child and her family have \nto spend all of their time and energy fighting their health plan to get \nthe care their child needs.\n  Let me just simply say that, again, Jenna has had to struggle with \nthe illness. Again, the Johnsons had to try to figure out how to get \nadditional help. And again, after many appeals, the care was first \ndenied and finally given care.\n  I want to simply point out what has now happened is that the Johnsons \nhave been switched to another HMO and they have been told that any \nadditional care that Jenna might need will be denied outright. Any \nadditional care this courageous 15-year-old young woman will need will \nbe denied. They are out of luck. The Johnson's family is at their wit's \nend. Jenna's family has joined several HMOs and they can still not find \none that will provide the most basic of medical needs without dealing \nwith an overly burdensome corporate review.\n  Now, let me just quote Jenna's mother, if I could, because I think \nthis gets to what we are dealing with. Her mother, Cynthia, stated, \n``Why, at a time of crisis, is emergency medical care denied? . . . If \nmy daughter should have another emergency, what will we do?''\n  She feels vulnerable. She wants to get the care for her daughter, and \nbecause of the current situation in our country, she can't do it.\n  Now, Madam President, the pendulum has swung way too far. We talked \nabout containing costs. Fine. But where is the protection for \nconsumers? What happens to families that are dealing with chronic \nillnesses? What happens to families that need specialty care? What \nhappens to families who are trying to get the best possible care for \ntheir children?\n  We have now moved to a system in our country which is increasingly \ncorporatized and bureaucracized, where the bottom line has become the \nonly line. We need to make sure that there is some protection for \nconsumers.\n  I think there are three issues, and I will summarize them: One, who \ngets to define ``medical necessity?'' It is outrageous that doctors, \nnurses, nurse practitioners and nurse assistants, who know what needs \nto be done in treating a child like Jenna, or an adult, today find \nthemselves unable to provide the kind of care they thought they would \nbe able to provide to people when they were in medical and nursing \nschool. They should be making the decision.\n  Secondly, it is just outrageous--we are talking about something \ncalled point-of-service option; people find themselves moved from one \nplan to another, from one year to another, and all of a sudden you have \nseen a doctor or have been to a clinic with your children and you are \ncanceled out. You no longer have an option of being able to see a \ndoctor or a clinic that has taken care of you and your children for a \ndecade plus. All the trust, all the rapport, all of what makes for good \nmedicine, goes out the window.\n  Finally, we have to make sure that if we are going to pass a strong \nPatient\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nProtection Act we have offices of consumer affairs in every State. They \nare independent with ombudsman that can be advocating for people. \nFamily USA has done some fine work on this. It is not just an 800 \nnumber for people to call. People need to call a number, there needs to \nbe an office that is there for consumers, where people can say, ``I was \ndenied care, what do I do,'' and you have a skillful person that can be \nthere as an advocate for people.\n  I am saying to my colleagues, especially my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, I don't know how many days we have left, probably \nfewer than 50 days or thereabouts. We have to get going on this. We \nhave to get going on this.\n  We have an important effort on the floor this week, bipartisan \neffort, which I think reflects some very fine work. But overall we have \nnot been doing a lot. We have not been doing a lot about making sure \nthere is good health care for people. We have not been doing a lot by \nway of being there for consumers. We have not been doing a lot by way \nof making sure that children come to school at age 5, kindergarten, \nknowing the alphabet, knowing colors, shapes and sizes, knowing how to \nspell their name, having been read to, and ready to learn.\n  We have not been doing much by way of making sure that we move toward \nsome system of universal health care coverage. There are over 40 \nmillion people that are uninsured. There are other families that are \npaying more than they should pay. There needs to be some income \nprotection for them. What about a package of benefits for every citizen \nin the country comparable to what we have? What ever happened to the \nbattle cry that we should pass legislation to make sure the people we \nserve have as good a health care as what we have? What about the strong \npatient protection?\n  I have a bill called the Healthy Americans Act, which I am \nintroducing this week, which is a strategy to move toward universal \ncoverage and says to Arkansas, Nebraska or Minnesota, if you agree to \nthe national framework, there will be Federal grant money available to \nyou to reach universal coverage. You decide how you want to contain \ncosts. You decide how you want to deliver the care. We have to move \ntoward that system of care. We haven't done that. We are not there on \nhealth care. We are not there on investment in children and education. \nWe are not there on strong consumer protection, and we are not there on \na lot of issues that are very important to working families and \ncommunities.\n\n  This issue of whether or not the U.S. Senate is on the side of big \ninsurance companies or the consumers will be a litmus test for all of \nus. After we get done with this bill, let's get a lot of this \nsubstantive legislation on the floor. My hope is--and I will finish on \nthis--that I won't have to have an amendment calling for a vote on \nJames Hormel, but rather will bring that to the floor and make sure we \ndo that as well.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4198-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4199-S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE GROWING THREAT OF CHINA TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, the headlines in last week's \nnewspapers ought to bring pause to this body and to all of us as \nAmericans. The Washington Times, on Friday, had the headline ``China \nTargets Nukes at U.S.'' The inside part of that article, on a graphic, \nit says ``China's Long-Range Missiles,'' quoting a CIA report last May \nthat ``13 of China's 18 CSS-4 missiles are now targeted at cities in \nthe United States of America.''\n  This report was followed by a report in the Washington Times today, \nheadlined ``U.S. Firms Make China More Dangerous: Technology Aid Helps \nMissiles Reach America.'' I will say that again. ``Technology Aid Helps \nMissiles Reach America.'' This was also reported in the New York Times, \nanother major newspaper in the United States. These stories are based \non a new CIA report released last week that noted that 13 of China's 18 \nlong-range strategic missiles have single nuclear warheads aimed at \nU.S. cities. These missiles, with a range of over 8,000 miles, prove \nconvincingly that China views the United States as its most serious \nadversary. This is further proof, I believe, that the current \nadministration's policy of so-called constructive engagement has \nfailed, and failed terribly, as China continues to go this route, as \nChina continues to take provocative actions and actions that seriously \nendanger the security of the United States. It is important to note \nthat these missiles are in addition to China's 25 CSS-3 missiles, with \nranges of more than 3,400 miles, and its 18 CSS-4 missiles, with ranges \nexceeding 8,000 miles, and its planned DF-31, with a range exceeding \n7,000 miles.\n  Until last year, China lacked even the intelligence, and certainly \nthey lacked the technology necessary to manufacture boosters that could \nreliably strike at such long distances. In fact, it is reported that in \na launch test of the boosters, their technology failed to launch the \nboosters three out of five times. That is a 60-percent failure rate. \nLikewise, they were years from developing the space technology \nnecessary to launch multiple, independently targetable reentry \nvehicles, otherwise known as MIRVs, multiple warhead missiles. Now they \nare only years away, if not months, from having such technology.\n  Some time ago, I participated in a firing-line debate on the campus \nof the University of Mississippi. During that debate, when the issue of \nnational security was raised, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nreassured the audience of thousands, and the nationwide television \naudience of millions, that we need not be concerned about China's \ncapability to launch missiles that might place American cities at risk. \nHe said, in fact, it would be a couple of decades before China was \nanywhere near having the technology that could place the United States \nand American citizens at risk. Well, now we find that because of our \nown aid, and because of our own technology transfers to China, already \nwe are seeing these missiles targeting American cities, and that this \nadvanced technology is very much now at their disposal.\n\n  How did China get this technology? Two U.S. companies--the Loral \nSpace and Communications Company and the Hughes Electronic Company--are \nunder investigation by the State Department following a classified \nPentagon report that concluded that the two companies illegally gave \nChina space expertise during cooperation on a Chinese commercial \nsatellite launch. This report concluded that ``the United States \nnational security has been harmed.''\n  Here are the details: In 1996, during the course of an investigation \nof a Chinese rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellite, scientists \nallegedly shared with their Chinese counterparts a report explaining \nthe cause of the accident, which turned out to be an electrical flaw in \nthe flight control system. This system is similar to those used on ICBM \nlaunch-guidance systems.\n  In February, with the investigation of this incident underway, \nPresident Clinton permitted Loral to launch another satellite on a \nChinese rocket and to provide the Chinese with the same expertise that \nis at issue in the criminal case, officials have said. A senior \nofficial said the administration recognized the sensitivity of the \ndecision but approved the launch because the investigation had reached \nno conclusions, and Loral had properly handled accident launches. The \nadministration, he said, still could take administrative action against \nthe companies if they were found to have violated export laws in their \nearlier dealings with the Chinese.\n  Another company--Motorola--is also involved in upgrading China's \nmissile system. The chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Space \nand Technology received word from an unnamed official from Motorola \nthat they, too, have been involved in upgrading China's missile \ncapability. Interestingly, this executive claims the work is being done \nunder a waiver--a waiver granted from the Clinton administration--thus, \ncircumventing all of the bans and restrictions on such technology \ntransfers. This technology was supposed to be controlled, restricted. \nMadam President, trade in missile and space technology to China was \nsupposed to be severely restricted under the sanctions related to the \ncrackdown of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has implemented a give-give\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nstrategy of appeasement, which has weakened or eliminated most of these \nrestrictions.\n  Politics must not supersede national security concerns. Why did this \nadministration make such an incredible and risky decision? Loral has \nnumerous business deals with China. Loral has close ties to the White \nHouse. Its chairman and chief executive officer, Bernard Schwartz, was \nthe largest individual contributor to the Democratic National Committee \nlast year. Motorola's involvement and ties with this administration are \njust now being investigated. This raises serious questions and puts a \ndark cloud over these dealings, particularly in light of the CIA report \nindicating China is now targeting American cities.\n  In addition to legally getting this technology through these waivers \nfrom the current administration, China has twice violated its agreement \nto follow the principles of the missile technology and control regime. \nYet, under this administration's policy of appeasement, the \nadministration is asking China to sign on to the missile technology \nregime. This is like stacking new promises on top of broken promises \nand then calling it progress. It is important to note that China's \ninclusion in the missile regime would allow even greater technology \ntransfers to be made, thus, putting more Americans at even greater \nrisk.\n  Madam President, most importantly, China continues to repress and \noppress its own people, in violation of international law. The latest \nState Department Report on Human Rights in China shows that China is \nstill a major, if not the major, offender of internationally recognized \nhuman rights in the world today.\n  This report from our own State Department notes that China continues \nto engage in ``torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent \nCatholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of \nethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang and, of course, \nabsolute intolerance of free political speech or free press''--from our \nState Department report.\n  These are not new charges. The tragedy is not that we are hearing \nthese charges repeated; the tragedy is that we continue the same policy \nthat has allowed these kinds of repression and repressive practices to \nexist. We continue along the same line as if everything is fine. Human \nrights abuses, religious persecution, forced abortion, and slavery are \nall raised at the staff level, with only token concern expressed by \nsenior officials in this administration.\n  In addition to this report from the State Department, there are well \ndocumented abuses. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New \nYork has indicted two Chinese immigrants for the sale and marketing of \nhuman body parts. I raised this allegation at a speech that I gave at \nthe Fulbright Institute on the campus of the University of Arkansas in \nFayetteville, with many visitors there from outside the State of \nArkansas, and their disbelief and skepticism was expressed to me that \nthis in fact was factual.\n  Well, it is factual. It is beyond dispute that two indictments have \nbeen brought down regarding the sale of human body parts and harvesting \nof these body parts from Chinese prisoners with the full cooperation of \nthe Chinese Government, and in some instances U.S. businesses. In this \ncase, U.S. industry is alleged to have provided the Chinese Government \nwith a dialysis machine to assist the harvesting of organs in their \nprison hospitals.\n  On the policy of appeasement--the administration calls it \n``constructive engagement''--I think indisputably today a policy of \nappeasement to the Chinese Government is obviously failing. According \nto a report in the Washington Post on Friday titled ``U.S.-China Talks \nMake Little Progress on Summit Agenda,'' the United States, we find, is \ngetting few concessions from China relating to the inspection of \ntechnology that we share with them; we are getting few concessions on \nlimiting proliferation of technology to third-party states like Iran; \nand we are getting few concessions on the most important issue of all--\nthat of human rights conditions, particularly in Tibet.\n  As the President prepares to travel to China, as he prepares to \ncontinue this policy of so-called ``constructive engagement,'' we find \nthat even as we seek concessions in line with international norms, that \nwe meet a stone wall. Our only token concessions are the release of \nhigh-profile prisoners. Despite this very obvious failure, we continue \nto give, and give under the guise of ``constructive engagement.''\n  We have provided key technology that puts our own country at risk. We \nhave set up a hot line that reaches from the White House to China. We \nhave begun assisting China in its efforts to gain membership into the \nWorld Trade Organization, even as our balance of trade with China \nreaches new levels, new highs. Yet we try to orchestrate their efforts \nto get into the WTO. We dropped our annual push for a resolution \ncondemning China's human rights record at the United Nations. This is \nsomething we have done year in and year out. We called upon the \nUnited Nations to condemn the abuses that are ongoing in China. This \nadministration has dropped even that kind of symbolic gesture that has \nbeen a part of our foreign policy.\n\n  We failed to do that in spite of the adoption of the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution asking this administration to do that. And we \ncontinue to provide China most-favored-nation status. In return for \nthis, we have witnessed the release of three--we have witnessed the \nrelease of three--high-profile prisoners of conscience from China's \nprisons, three out of the thousands upon thousands of political and \nreligious dissidents currently held in Chinese prisons.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that we need to \nimmediately respond in two ways. First of all, the Senate should \nimmediately pass the 8 House-passed bills on China, bills that the \nHouse of Representatives adopted on huge bipartisan margins, by huge \nmargins last year, usually from 350 votes to 400-plus votes on these \nvarious bills, short of denying most-favored-nation status but at least \ntaking targeted measures to tell this repressive government in Beijing \nthat the United States is serious when it announces its concerns about \nthe abuses that are ongoing in China. Eight bills--ten bills passed the \nHouse. Two of them we have adopted in the Senate, but eight continue to \nlanguish without action.\n  I asked our majority leader. I talked with him. He has given positive \nindications that we will bring these eight House bills to the floor for \na vote in the U.S. Senate prior to the President's trip to Beijing in \nJune.\n  These bills include H.R. 2195 regarding slave labor, which passed the \nHouse by a vote of 419 to 2. H.R. 2195 was designed to keep slave-labor \nproducts out of the United States, authorizing needed funding for \ngenuine enforcement of the ban on slave-labor products, calling upon \nthe President to strengthen international agreements to improve \nmonitoring of slave-labor imports. If it passed by this overwhelming \nmargin in the House, I suspect if we had an opportunity to vote on that \nin the Senate, it would pass by an equally large margin. It is \nsomething we need to do before the President travels to China.\n  H.R. 967, the ``Free the Clergy'' bill, which passed the House on \nNovember 6 of last year by a 366 to 54 margin: H.R. 967 targets those \nCommunist officials who engage in religious persecution, banning their \ntravel to the United States by prohibiting the expenditure of any U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars in support of their travel and subjecting it to a \nPresidential waiver allowing them to be denied their visas. I think \nthat is a simple step, a very modest step, that we should, that we \nmust, do to ensure that United States statements of concern about \nreligious persecution in China have some validity--even the denial of \nvisas, travel opportunities, for those officials in China who continue \nto practice and implement the policy of religious persecution.\n  H.R. 2570 regarding forced abortions passed the House on November 6, \n1997, with a 415-to-1 margin, yet the Senate these many months later \nhas not yet had an opportunity to vote on this bill. This bill, H.R. \n2570, targets those Communist officials involved in forced abortion \nsterilization, banning once again their travel to the United States. I \nthink that, once again, is a very modest move. It is about the most \nmodest\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nmove that we could possibly take regarding Communist government \nofficials who are implementing a policy of forced abortion and \nsterilizations in China today and prohibiting them from traveling to \nthe United States.\n\n  H.R. 2358 on human rights monitors passed the House by a 416-to-5 \nvote. It would increase six-fold the number of U.S. diplomats at the \nBeijing Embassy assigned to monitor human rights.\n  I visited China in January. I know firsthand how short-handed our \nState Department officials and diplomatic officials are and how limited \nthey are in their ability to monitor the ongoing human rights abuses in \nChina. If we are to have the knowledge, if we as a body are to have the \ninformation that we so desperately need, these human rights monitors \nare needed. In addition, the new law will add at least one human rights \nmonitor to each U.S. consulate in Communist China.\n  H.R. 2232 on Radio Free Asia passed the House by a 401-to-21 margin \nand would fund a 24-hour-a-day broadcast throughout Communist China in \neach of the major dialects spoken in China. This Radio Free Asia bill \nwill allow the truth of freedom to penetrate Communist China. And, in \nfact, the truth will set them free. And, as we are allowed to give the \nstory of freedom and the story of democracy, the democracy movement, \nwhich was so alive almost 9 years ago on Tiananmen Square, will be \nalive and evident again in China. It passed by an overwhelming margin.\n  H.R. 2605 on World Bank loans passed the House by a 354-to-59 margin. \nThis bill would direct U.S. representatives at the World Bank to vote \nagainst below-market subsidies for Communist China. This is far short \nof denying MFN. I have heard all of the arguments against denying MFN \nin China. Indeed, this is not a blunt instrument. This is a very sharp \nscalpel, a very small instrument that can be used, simply denying \nsubsidized loans by the American taxpayer to the Government of \nCommunist China, which continues to practice these horrendous abuses \nagainst their own people.\n  H.R. 2647, the People's Liberation Army companies, corporations--\ncompanies and businesses and enterprises owned and operated by the \nPeople's Liberation Army, which passed the House by a vote of 405 to \n10, would require the Defense Department, the Justice Department, the \nFBI, and the CIA to compile a list of known PLA commercial fronts \noperating in the United States and would authorize the President to \nmonitor, to restrict, and to seize the assets of and ban such PLA \ncompanies within the United States.\n  For my colleagues, I would say these are companies predominantly \nowned and operated by the military of Communist China. These companies \nshould not be free to operate and to trade freely in the United States. \nSo this would authorize our various agencies--the Defense Department, \nJustice Department, FBI, CIA, and so forth--to monitor, to provide a \nlist and authorize the President to restrict and seize the assets of \nsuch companies.\n  H.R. 2386, this legislation, passing by a vote of 301 to 116, \nprovides that the United States shall help Taiwan to develop and deploy \nan effective theater missile defense system. It has been obvious by \nsome of the actions and some of the statements of the Beijing regime \nthat they had designs on free Taiwan. This would simply be a step in \nensuring that Taiwan would be able to defend themselves against any \novert military action by the mainland Chinese Communist government.\n  The second step I believe that we should take as a body, the Senate \nshould support the resolution that I introduced on releasing the \nremaining dissidents in China. Senate Resolution 212, which I \nintroduced on April 22, last month, with six cosponsors, has been \nreferred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and expresses the \nsense of the Senate that at the upcoming United States-China summit the \nPresident should demand the release of all persons remaining imprisoned \nin China and Tibet for political or religious reasons.\n  I hope that as our President journeys to China these most important \nissues--human rights, religious persecution, weapons proliferation--\nwould not be relegated to staff level discussions but, in fact, the \nPresident himself would elevate them and would ensure that these issues \nbecome the primary focus of our relationship with China and that \nprogress on these fronts is directly linked to the trade opportunities \nthat China seeks. This resolution states that in the upcoming proposed \nsummit between President Clinton and President Jiang of China, \nPresident Clinton should demand the immediate and unconditional \nrelease, consistent with established principles of human rights, of all \npersons remaining in China and Tibet for political or religious \nreasons.\n  It says, secondly, the President should submit a report to Congress \nas soon as possible after the proposed summit in China concerning his \nprogress in securing the release of persons imprisoned in China and \nTibet.\n  Third, it says one prisoner released into exile does not change the \nfundamental flaws within the Chinese judicial and penal system.\n  Fourth, it states that the U.S. policy of granting concessions to the \nChinese Government in exchange for the release of high-profile \nprisoners is an offense to the thousands of dissidents remaining in \nprison.\n  I, as all Americans, rejoice and am thrilled at the release of any \nprisoner of conscience in China. Wang Dan's release, I am glad for \nthat. Wei's release, I am glad for that. But I also know that the \nrelease of a handful of well-known dissidents is no substitute for \nchange in the fundamental policy of the Chinaese Government, which \ncontinues to be one of repression and persecution of those who would \nraise their voice for freedom or raise their voice for their own \nconscience.\n  And then the resolution states that the President should not offer to \nlift the sanctions imposed on China after the 1989 crackdown in \nTiananmen Square, and those measures should not be reversed until we \nsee substantive and real changes in the policies of the Chinese \nGovernment. I am not anti-Chinese. I was thrilled while I was in China \nto meet scores of individuals in China who are going about their daily \nlives making a living. I was glad to see the progress in moving toward \na market system. I was glad to see the churches that are, though \nregulated stringently by the government, filled to the brim every \nSunday. I was glad to see the Buddhist temples, though, once again, \nstrictly regulated by the government, seeking to operate and continuing \nto operate. But I was chagrined to see that the government's \nfundamental policy towards its own people has not changed, that their \nconcept of freedom is not that which is embedded in the founding \ndocuments envisioned by our Founding Fathers and appreciated and \nadmired and accepted by the international community all over this \nworld.\n\n  This is not a case of the United States seeking to impose its ideas \nof democracy upon another culture. It, rather, is seeking to have our \ncountry, as it always has, reflect in our foreign policy the underlying \nvalues of freedom that are not American but are human, that transcend \nevery national boundary, that transcend every culture and society and \nare fundamental for basic respect of human dignity and human rights.\n  It is that, I think, President Reagan had in mind when he spoke of \nthis country as a shining city on a hill, a nation that could be \nadmired and respected the world over because of a foreign policy, \nreflected in its attitude and in its policies toward our neighbors \naround the world, of fundamental respect for human rights. It was \nalmost 9 years ago when the massacre at Tiananmen occurred--June 8 and \nJune 9, almost 9 years ago. Those students, hundreds of them that were \nmassacred, looked to the United States as its emblem, as its symbol of \nfreedom in the world. It was Lady Liberty that they erected that stood \nthere in Tiananmen Square day after day, week after week, testimony to \nthe desire of Chinese people for greater freedom. Now it is our time to \nstand with them. It is time for our President as he journeys to China \nto take this stand forcefully and to elevate this as the primary \nreason, the primary purpose in his journey to that important nation in \nthe world. And as he is willing to do that, this body will stand with \nhim. I hope, once again, that the Senate will adopt the House-passed \nbills, that we will adopt the sense of the Senate, and in so doing we \nwill arm the President with the forceful opinion of the American people \nthat fundamental change needs to take\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\nplace in the Chinese Communist government in its attitudes and its \npolicies toward its own people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I recently introduced S. 1968, the \nTelephone Privacy Act. This bill, which has bipartisan support, has \nnothing to do with Linda Tripp or anybody else.\n  I first proposed legislation regarding telephone privacy in 1984 when \nit was revealed that Charles Wick, who was head of the United States \nInformation Agency, had tape-recorded President Reagan and President \nCarter and several Cabinet officials 84 times without their knowledge.\n  Can you remember when you were a kid and you used to listen to \ntelephone conversations? The announcer would call somebody or somebody \nwould call in because they had the answer to a question, and you would \nhear beeping in the background. In those days, that was a sign that you \nwere being recorded. Somewhere along the line, that practice was \ndiscontinued. Today, you can tape-record your very best friend and not \ntell that friend and hand it to all three networks for use on the \nevening news and no federal crime has been committed.\n  Not too long ago, Attorney General Reno testified before the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce, on which I \nsit. At that time, we were working on this bill, and I asked her about \nit. She said, ``Well, Florida already has such a law that makes it a \ncriminal offense to tape-record a conversation without telling \nsomebody.''\n  I said, ``How long have they had the law?''\n  She said, ``Since around 1970.''\n  I said, ``Were you the prosecutor in Dade County at the time that \nhappened?''\n  She said she was.\n  I said, ``Well, how did you feel about the bill when it was being \ndebated?''\n  She said, ``I favored it.''\n  As usual, Congress doesn't get the message until after the States \nhave acted--16 States have already enacted legislation almost identical \nto S. 1968 , and here we sit still allowing people to invade our \nprivacy, the most fundamental privacy when people have their guard down \nthe most, by tape-recording conversations which can later be used for \nany purpose they choose. It is not an offense, and it ought to be.\n  I hope that some of my colleagues who may be listening will go back \nand look at my full remarks that were entered in the Record at the time \nI introduced that bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4202-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE AND GRAND JURIES\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, on a separate matter, I want to inform \nmy colleagues that I am also working on legislation that will require \nprosecutors, before they ask for an indictment, to also give the grand \njury any exculpatory evidence they may possess.\n  Prosecutors, as I previously outlined in some detail, have such an \nadvantage, such an upper hand. Some of it is legitimate, and some of it \nis not. As one New York judge said, ``A grand jury will indict a ham \nsandwich'' if the prosecutor asked them to.\n  I had a prosecutor tell me one time, ``This is the best grand jury I \never saw; it indicted everybody I asked them to indict.'' Of course \nthey indicted everybody. They are putty in his hands.\n  I will just give you an illustration of the kind of case that I am \ntrying to get at.\n  Let's assume that you are a prosecutor and you are getting ready to \nask the grand jury to indict somebody for capital murder. Assume \nfurther that all the testimony that has been taken in that case said \nthat the man who pulled the trigger and committed the murder was \nwearing a green jacket.\n  Assume further that the prosecutor has had information come to him \npersonally, though it has never been presented to the grand jury, that \nit was, in fact, a red jacket.\n  I am making a rather extreme case here, but I ask you, in the spirit \nof elemental fairness, do you believe that the prosecutor, before he \nasks somebody to go on trial and possibly end up in the electric chair, \nis beholden in any way to tell the grand jury of totally exculpatory \nevidence that he may have in his possession?\n  There is a Supreme Court decision, the name of which I forget, in \nwhich the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the prosecutor is absolutely \nunder no compulsion to tell the grand jury of any exculpatory evidence \nin his possession. If that isn't a betrayal of everything that we \nAmericans believe, including fundamental fairness, if that is not a \nbetrayal of everything I was taught in law school, I cannot think of a \nmore egregious case.\n  Madam President, one of the reasons we have not had these debates in \nthe past is because the crime rate in this country was soaring. And \neverybody was in a put-them-in-jail and throw-away-the-key mode. But I \nwanted my colleagues to stop and just reflect for a moment. God knows, \nI am not suggesting any guilty person should go free, but you heard \nthat old story: Better that 1,000 guilty people go free than one \ninnocent person be convicted.\n  I did not do very much criminal trial work when I practiced law. I \nused to take maybe one case a year just so I would have to stay boned \nup on what the Supreme Court had ruled on, mostly rules of evidence and \ndefendants' rights. And, yes, I defended a man one time that in my own \nmind I felt sure was guilty and the jury acquitted him. That sounds \nterrible to a lot of people who do not understand the criminal justice \nsystem. Everybody is entitled to a trial.\n  So all I am saying is the crime rates are coming down. People ought \nto be in a little more circumspect mood about what the Founding Fathers \nmeant. The most important thing I said in my former remarks a moment \nago about the bill I am introducing today is that the law is supposed \nto be a shield as well as a sword. It is supposed to protect the \nliberty of people in this country as well as to prosecute the guilty. \nIt also has an obligation to defend and free the innocent. So that is \nall these proposals I am making are calculated to do; keep a firm \ncommitment to our elemental belief in fairness, in the rights of the \ninnocent and, yes, to prosecute and convict the guilty.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before I begin talking about an \namendment I intend to offer on the piece of legislation we will \nconsider this week dealing with the IRS, let me say that the Congress \nDaily this afternoon indicates the Senate majority leader says ``the \ncompromise tobacco bill developed by Commerce Chairman McCain may not \nbe the base bill considered by the Senate when it takes up the tobacco \nissue. . .''\n  I am quoting:\n\n       When asked whether he plans to bring the McCain bill to the \n     floor, Lott said: ``I am referring to a bill; it could be \n     McCain, a version of McCain, it could be something else.''\n\n  Again, I was quoting.\n  I would hope that Senator Lott, the majority leader, would understand \nthat when the Senate Commerce Committee marks up a piece of legislation \nand passes it with only one dissenting vote, a piece of legislation \nthat is embraced by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, that that would not be work that is discarded as we move to \nbegin consideration of a comprehensive tobacco bill.\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n  There is a reason for a committee system in the Congress, and that is \nto work through committees to develop a proposal, and bring that \nproposal to the floor of the Senate. I would be very disappointed if \nthe majority leader intends one way or the other to bring a piece of \nlegislation to the floor which is vastly different than that which was \npassed out of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\n  Again, I know there is a tremendous amount of lobbying going on in \nthis town and around the country by the tobacco industry to try to \nresist and fight this kind of tobacco legislation. I understand that \nand I understand why they are doing that. Literally hundreds of \nmillions--billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars are at \nstake. But we must, it seems to me, in discharging our responsibility, \npass a comprehensive tobacco bill. A good start in doing that would be \nto take the piece of legislation that we have drafted and marked up in \nthe Senate Commerce Committee and bring that to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In response, I think, to the aggressive initiative around this \ncountry by the tobacco industry, some are saying, ``Maybe we ought to \nback off. Maybe we ought to not be quite as aggressive.''\n  The fact is the origin of the tobacco legislation comes from our \ndetermination to see that this industry stops targeting America's \nchildren. And if someone thinks that they have not targeted America's \nchildren, then I say read the evidence. The Supreme Court has just \nruled in a manner that requires thousands of pages of evidence to be \ndisclosed. That evidence from the tobacco industry itself demonstrates \nthat the only source of new smokers has been to addict America's \nchildren.\n  Smoking is legal. Tobacco use is legal, and will remain legal in this \ncountry. But it is not legal and should not be legal to attempt to \naddict America's children. That is why a comprehensive tobacco bill \nneeds to be brought to the floor of the Senate. I urge the majority \nleader in the strongest terms possible to use the process that we have \nstarted here in the Senate, bring to the floor the piece of legislation \nI and others, with the leadership of Senator McCain, have developed, \nand use that as a starting point on the Senate floor to deal with \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4202-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4203-S4204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the agenda for the Senate this week will \nbe to discuss the bill that deals with the Internal Revenue Service. \nAmong other things, this piece of legislation creates an Internal \nRevenue Service oversight board to help take a look at the management \nof various things with respect to the running of the IRS.\n  I spoke last week about hearings on IRS misconduct and abuse. I \nindicated that, while I think the IRS has many good people who work \nvery hard to collect the taxes that our laws require to be collected in \nthis country, it is clear from the hearings that there have also been \nabuses that ought never be tolerated. I commend the Chairman for \nholding last week's hearings. We must use these hearings as the \noccasion to understand what went wrong and make sure it never goes \nwrong again. The American people don't ever deserve an IRS that is not \nfully accountable and an IRS that in some cases will harass and badger \ntaxpayers in ways disclosed during the hearings last week.\n  Let me just tackle one other aspect of the Internal Revenue Code and \nthe behavior of the IRS. The IRS is required to collect the taxes \nneeded to run the Government. Now the question is from whom does the \nIRS collect the amounts that are due? The people who go to work every \nday? The families that make a salary at work, and when they earn that \nsalary, they have withholding taken out of their paychecks. Their taxes \nare sent to the U.S. Government. They don't have a choice. There is no \nflexibility. They work, they receive a paycheck, and they have \nwithholding.\n  But there are others doing business in America that are not quite so \ncompliant. We need an IRS that cares about what they are doing as well \nand makes sure they pay their fair share of the tax load in this \ncountry. Let me give you an example. In a recent year, we had a study \ncompleted by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative \nwatchdog of Congress. One of the GAO's main findings was that 46 \npercent of the largest foreign-based multinational firms--that is, \nfirms with over $100 million in assets--are transacting hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of business in this country and paying zero in \nincome taxes to our country. That is right--not 10 percent or 5 percent \nor 1 percent, they paid zero in income taxes to this country.\n  Now how, you ask, would a company based overseas do business in \nAmerica, do tens of billions of dollars' worth of business, earn \nbillions of dollars' worth of profit and pay zero in taxes? I mentioned \n46 percent of the largest companies with over $100 million in assets \npaid no taxes; 74 percent of all foreign-based corporations in the U.S. \npaid nothing, zero, in Federal income taxes. Let me say that again: 74 \npercent of all foreign-based corporations doing business in the United \nStates paid zero in Federal income taxes to this country. How do they \ndo it? Something called transfer pricing.\n  It is not only the foreign-based corporations, incidentally, that \nhave a problem here. Most corporations that are doing business all \naround the globe are finding ways to minimize their tax burden through \ntransfer pricing. Of course, not all of them do that. Many corporations \npay exactly what they owe and do the best job they can of accounting \nfor it.\n  But transfer pricing means that you overprice an import into the \nUnited States in order to inflate the cost of goods sold, and therefore \nreduce, if not wipe out, their profit here. Or the alternative would be \nto underprice something you are exporting to another country in order \nthat your subsidiary in the other country earns a very large income \nwhich would be subject low or no taxes in the other country. Because \nyou priced it so low as you exported it here in this country, you end \nup making no money.\n  Let me give you an example of how this works. There are a couple of \nprofessors employed at Florida International University. Their names \nare Simon Pak and John Zdanowicz. I have met them. They have done a lot \nof interesting work on the issue of transfer pricing. It is a \nByzantine, complicated area of tax law, so complicated that very few \npeople pay any attention to it. Yet billions and billions of dollars of \ntax avoidance occur every single year. ``U.S. Government is Cheated out \nof $42.6 Billion in Tax Revenues in 1997, Study Reveals.'' Pak and \nZdanowicz recently released a study showing a conservative estimate of \ntax loss during 1997 due to abnormal pricing in international trade was \n$42.6 billion.\n\n  Let me give some examples. Tweezers--everybody knows what tweezers \nare. Tweezers are tiny little things you buy at the drugstore for $1, \n$2, or $3. Tweezers were imported from Switzerland at $218 each. Now, \ndid somebody really pay $218 for a pair of tweezers? Sure--a U.S. \nsubsidiary of a foreign-based corporation. The foreign-based \ncorporation sells the tweezers at $218 apiece, and they are a \ncontrolled U.S. subsidiary. They can never, ever make a profit, if they \nso desire. So whatever that corporation decides to do in the United \nStates, they control their pricing back and forth. They will do a lot \nof business, make a lot of profit, but by overpricing tweezers to the \ntune of $218 apiece, they will never pay an income tax to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  So they can come here and they can compete against a U.S. business \nthat doesn't do business in 10 countries, just does business here, and \nwhen they make a profit, they must pay a tax.\n  How about bulldozers? Everybody knows what a bulldozer is. You drive \ndown the road and see a construction project, you can identify a \nbulldozer at first glance. It is one of the biggest things you will \nsee. Bulldozers exported to Belize for $551. Does anybody know where \nyou can buy a $551 bulldozer?\n  Let me go through some of the rest of the examples. Safety razor \nblades, $13 a piece. Television antennas--everybody knows what a \ntelevision antenna is--$1,738 from the United Kingdom. Venetian \nblinds--most everybody has priced venetian blinds at some point. This \nwould be a company that sold venetian blinds abroad and sold\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\nthem at a price that guarantees they can't make a profit here. They do \nit through controlled companies, so it is not real, just the way they \nprice their transactions. Venetian blinds, 3 cents. How about a \ntoothbrush for $18? Or better yet, a tractor tire shipped to France for \n$7.65?\n  All of this represents tax avoidance in sophisticated swindles \ndesigned to prevent the U.S. Government from taxing a profit as they \nwould do with a domestic corporation.\n  The reason I mention all of this sophisticated tax avoidance that is \nthat it is almost impossible to detect. When you have companies--a \ncompany wanting to do business in this country, in most cases it will \nbe a large foreign-based corporation that creates a U.S. subsidiary.\n  They will do business with their own subsidiary. And to try to \nconstruct their transactions back to some reasonable market prices is \nlike trying to connect two plates of spaghetti together. It is \nimpossible. Yet, that is what the IRS is attempting to do. It doesn't \ndo very well; can't do very well. Enforcement here is abysmal. In fact, \ndepending on who you ask, the tax avoidance per year is $40 billion, \nsome say $25 billion, and some say $15 billion. There has been a study \nthat says $4 billion and the IRS says only $1 billion. What is the \ntruth? The truth is that it is far more than $1 billion or $4 billion \nthat the IRS and Treasury are talking about. It is far closer to the \nnumbers put together by Professors Pak and Zdanowicz.\n  Well, I will speak more about the amendment at some point during this \nweek when I offer it. The amendment I will offer is very simple.\n  The amendment I will offer is to say the newly established IRS \nOversight Board will review whether the IRS has the resources needed to \nprevent tax avoidance by companies using unlawful transfer pricing \nmethods. In order to enable the board to carry out this duty, IRS shall \nconduct a study relating to its enforcement of transfer pricing abuses \nby multinational companies. Specifically, the IRS will review the \neffectiveness of current enforcement tools used by the IRS to ensure \ncompliance under Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code and determine \nthe scope of nonpayment of U.S. taxes caused by both foreign and U.S.-\nbased multinational firms operating in the United States.\n  Then the Board will report back to Congress its findings on the IRS \nenforcement of transfer pricing abuses and make recommendations for \nimproving IRS enforcement tools.\n  I understand what the response to this is by corporations who are \nengaged in tax avoidance by transfer pricing. I understand what the \nresponse is by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue \nService. Corporations will say: Well, none of this goes on, this \ndoesn't happen. The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury \nDepartment will say: It happens, but we have done such a great job \nthere is very little tax avoidance.\n  But, of course, neither is true. The fact is that we have a very \nserious problem in this area, one that needs to be corrected, and it \nwill not be corrected with the current enforcement method used by the \nInternal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. As we talk now \nabout how to recast the Internal Revenue Service, develop new \nprocedures, develop new protections for taxpayers, develop an IRS \noversight board, I am asking that the Internal Revenue Service and the \nTreasury Department--especially at the direction of this new oversight \nboard--take a fresh, new look at this issue and try to determine how we \ncan do better.\n  In America, when someone decides to begin to do business and risk \ntheir capital in order to hold themselves out to do business and earn a \nprofit, when and if they earn that profit, they must pay an income tax. \nThe reason for that is, we tax profits and we tax income in order to \npay for our common defense, in order to build roads, and do a whole \nseries of things in this country that we need to do together. But we \nhave some who do business in this country that pay no taxes. I \nespecially point to the foreign-based multinational firms. The GAO \nreport says they come to this country and approximately 74 percent of \nthem doing business here pay no U.S. income taxes. Those who are \nlistening to this will be surprised to learn that the brand names they \nare well familiar with every single day, often the brand names on \nforeign products sold in the U.S., mean that someone has done a lot of \nbusiness here, made a lot of profit here, and ended up paying zero in \nincome taxes. In my judgment this means they are unfairly competing in \nthis marketplace.\n  U.S. businesses with whom they compete in this marketplace, if they \nare doing so only in the U.S., must pay a tax on their income, and so, \ntoo, should foreign-based corporations doing business in the United \nStates through their subsidiaries.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

A bill to amend the Federal rules of Civil Procedure, \nrelating to counsel for witnesses in grand jury proceedings, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the grand jury due process act\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I am today introducing legislation \nwhich will remedy a longstanding injustice in our criminal justice \nsystem by granting to grand jury witnesses the right to the presence of \ncounsel when testifying before the grand jury.\n  In our legal system, the right to counsel is fundamental. Every \nperson, no matter how guilty or innocent, deserves to have an advocate. \nSo fundamental is this right to counsel that it was recognized by the \nfounders and enshrined in the sixth amendment to the Constitution. \nAlong with the right to an impartial jury, public trial, and the right \nto confront witnesses, it is a universal element of fundamental \nfairness recognized by every civilized system of justice. Lawyers may \nnever be popular, said William Shakespeare in Henry VI, Act III Scene \nII: ``The first we do, let's kill all the lawyers.''\n  But lawyers are a necessity. No one in his right mind wants to \nconfront the judicial system without the benefit of a lawyer.\n  The Anglo-American criminal justice system has given us more freedom \nand better justice than any country in the history of civilization. The \nrights of American citizens evolved over centuries of English and \nAmerican history are now enshrined in the Bill of Rights and are the \nstandards of freedom and liberty all over the world. We must not allow \nthose rights to be eroded. No American would claim that our system is \nperfect, nor do I so claim. I am convinced beyond a doubt that our \nsystem has serious flaws, one of which most people are probably not \neven aware and many might find hard to believe in this day and age. A \nwitness summoned before a grand jury has no right to the presence of \nhis lawyer in the grand jury room. Depriving anybody of the right to \ncounsel is fundamentally wrong. No person should be required to face \nany part of the criminal justice system without the presence of his or \nher lawyer if he or she chooses.\n\n  Think of it this way. Police have absolutely no right to question an \narrestee without his lawyer in the room unless the individual waives \nthat right. The police even have a constitutional duty under the \nMiranda decision to advise people of their rights to a lawyer, even \nthough anybody who has watched television in the last 35 years ought to \nknow that they are entitled to a lawyer. If the police fail to observe \nthis constitutional requirement, the statement by the accused is \ninadmissible in court.\n  But when an ordinary citizen is called before a grand jury, no \nlawyer--no lawyers are allowed to be present. The prosecutor and the \ngrand jury have the unlimited ability to question the witness, who is \nnot even under arrest, without an attorney present. This gross \ninconsistency can only be described as Byzantine, an anachronism.\n  I have never been one to say that criminal defendants have too many \nrights. They have no more than the Constitution entitles them. In this \ninstance, however, a criminal defendant has more rights than the \naverage ordinary citizen called before a grand jury. A criminal \ndefendant cannot be questioned without a lawyer present, and he or she \nmay invoke his or her right not to testify under the fifth amendment \nprivilege against self-incrimination.\n  But a witness, a witness in the grand jury room who may later become \na target under criminal investigation, has no such rights. He or she \nmust testify fully and truthfully, no matter how burdensome or \nembarrassing or impertinent or irrelevant the questions may be, and \nwithout the assistance of counsel. The rules of evidence which normally \nrequire that questions be relevant and material do not apply in the \ngrand jury room. On the contrary, so-called ``fishing expeditions'' \nhave become commonplace. No matter how irrelevant or outrageous the \nquestions, the witness must answer.\n  Madam President, I ask you or any American to consider whether, if \nyou or your son or daughter were served a subpoena to testify before \nthe grand jury on a criminal case, even though the grand jury is \nsupposedly investigating somebody else, would you want the right to \nhave your own lawyer in the room? Would you feel the process was a fair \none if you were told that you were not legally entitled to have a \nlawyer present? What if you or your loved one were called before the \ngrand jury for a second, third, or fourth time? Would you begin to feel \nthat you might be under suspicion for something? And would you feel \ncomfortable answering endless questions without your lawyer present?\n  The grand jury is the only circumstance I can imagine in life where a \nfree person does not have a complete legal right to hire a lawyer and \nhave that lawyer accompany him in any kind of proceeding. No matter how \nserious the matter under consideration, no matter what the question--\nfrom the most complex matter of tax accounting to the most personal, \nintimate family concerns--no matter how hazy your recollection might \nbe, you have no right to a lawyer before the grand jury. The grand jury \nroom is the one and only room in the courthouse, the very temple of \njustice, where the proceeding is entirely one-sided.\n\n  Under existing law, there could be a sign on the grand jury room \nsaying, ``No lawyers allowed.'' The Government has as many lawyers as \nthe Treasury can pay. The witness has zero. Notwithstanding that he or \nshe may be there against his or her will, notwithstanding the power of \nthe grand jury and the prosecutor to indict, a witness before a grand \njury is defenseless. He or she has no friend in the room. Surely, \nnobody feels so alone as a grand jury witness, knowing that the weight \nof the Federal criminal justice system rests on his or her every word. \nGive the wrong answer, you can be accused of perjury, obstruction of \njustice, or any other of a number of crimes. If you refuse to answer, \nyou can go directly to jail without benefit of a trial, being held in \ncontempt.\n  Madam President, I ask you to consider, What kind of atmosphere is \ncreated in this one-sided proceeding? Is it one of fairness or is it \none of intimidation? Bear in mind that there is no limit on the number \nof times a person may be called to testify before the same grand jury. \nIn recent news reports--we have all read them--some people have been \ncalled to testify for the fifth or sixth time--no lawyer allowed--\nbefore the same grand jury. If you were in this position, or a member \nof your family were, how would you feel about being called for the \nsixth time to testify without your lawyer present? Would you feel \nthreatened or intimidated? And this kind of proceeding not only does \nnot provide justice and fairness, it doesn't even provide the \nappearance of justice and fairness, which is essential if citizens are \nto have confidence in our criminal justice system.\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n  This system needs changing. The bill I am introducing is a modest \nproposal to give some balance to a very unlevel playing field. The main \npurpose of the original grand jury was probably helping in the \ncollection of taxes. These ancient roots precede even the right to jury \ntrial, because in the earliest times, trial was by ordeal. The accused \nwas required to put his hand in boiling water or was tested by \ndrowning. Needless to say, there weren't very many acquittals.\n  The grand jury has always symbolized the power of the criminal \njustice system to bring any person before the bar of justice. No one is \nbeyond the power of the grand jury to seek evidence and to indict if \nthere is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. \nEven before the right to trial by jury was secured, English grand \njuries had power to investigate and to accuse. Composed of ordinary \ncitizens, grand juries had the power to compel any person to appear and \ngive testimony or evidence. Historically, the grand jury was a \nguarantor of liberty--a guarantor of liberty.\n  The courts have often stated that the grand jury has a dual function. \nListen to this. The courts have said that the grand jury has a dual \nfunction, ``to clear the innocent, no less than to bring to trial those \nwho may be guilty.'' The grand juries exist ``as a means of protecting \nthe citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it comes from the \ngovernment, or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity.''\n  We just saw what private enmity is when somebody tried to set up \nHoward Baker in a tax fraud case.\n  The Founding Fathers so respected the institution that they enshrined \nthe right to indictment by a grand jury in the sixth amendment to the \nConstitution. Here it is:\n\n       No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or \n     otherwise infamous crime, [and that has been interpreted many \n     times to mean a felony] unless on presentment or indictment \n     of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval \n     forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of \n     War or public danger * * *.\n\n  That is amendment 5 to the Constitution. The grand jury should be \nboth a sword and a shield, a powerful tool in the hands of prosecutors \nand a defender of liberty by protecting against meritless or \noverzealous prosecutions.\n  In colonial America, a grand jury in Boston helped signal the \nbeginning of the end of colonial government when the jurors refused the \nGovernment's request to indict the Stamp Act rioters. In modern times, \nhowever, the grand jury has become almost exclusively a sword and not a \nshield. Examples of the grand jury as a shield are hard to come by. In \nshort, we have allowed the protection intended by the founders to take \na 180-degree turn.\n  The Supreme Court has conceded that the grand jury does not always \nserve its intended purpose of protecting the innocent. This is what the \nSupreme Court said in U.S. v. Dionisio:\n\n       The grand jury may not always serve its historic role as a \n     protective bulwark standing solidly between the ordinary \n     citizen and an overzealous prosecutor.\n\n  Those were the words of Justice Douglas. Douglas said in dissent in \nthat case--he was much more explicit:\n\n       It is, indeed, common knowledge that the grand jury, having \n     been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the \n     government, is now a tool of the Executive.\n\n  Despite its ancient origins, the grand jury remains one of the most \ncontroversial aspects of our judiciary system. Most States have \nabandoned or abolished grand juries in favor of the filing of \ninformation by prosecutors. That is the way we do it in my home State \nof Arkansas. Many would argue that the grand jury is an anachronism \nwhich costs more than it is worth. In one of the most famous critiques \nof the institution, the Chief Judge of the State of New York stated \nthat most grand juries would ``indict a ham sandwich'' if the \nprosecutor requested it.\n  While some have argued for eliminating the grand jury, I am not one \nto second-guess the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Rather, I believe \nwe should make the system work as intended--as a protector of freedom--\nby reforming the grand jury system so as to ensure due process of law \nfor all concerned.\n  In the 1970s, there was considerable debate in Congress over the \nmerits of the grand jury following revelations of abuses of the system \nunder the Nixon administration. There has been no serious congressional \ndebate over the grand jury system for over 10 years. The time for that \ndebate has come.\n  Over 30 years ago, the Supreme Court said in Gideon v. Wainwright \nthat counsel must be appointed for those who cannot afford a lawyer \nbefore any criminal trial in which a prison sentence may result.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a logical extension of the sixth \namendment to the Constitution, as well as the fifth amendment's promise \nof due process of law. Granted, a witness before a grand jury is not \nunder immediate threat of indictment, but most of them are there \nagainst their will, and they are certainly looking over the abyss.\n  Let me emphasize that my bill, although a departure from historical \npractice, is still a modest proposal. This bill would not in any way \nchange criminal procedure except for allowing a witness' lawyer to be \npresent in the grand jury room. The lawyer would not be allowed to \nspeak to the jury or to examine witnesses. He or she would be able to \nadvise his or her client and no more.\n  Allowing the mere presence of a witness' lawyer will in no way \ndisrupt or slow the grand jury proceedings. What it might do is to \ndeter a prosecutor from doing something improper simply because he \nknows there is no other lawyer watching. It may give a witness some \ncomfort to be able to ask his or her lawyer for advice before answering \na complex question. That right is provided today, but the witness has \nto go outside the courtroom to see his or her counselor because the \ncounsel is not allowed in the grand jury room.\n  My bill will thus allow for grand juries to operate more smoothly and \nefficiently, reducing the need to stop proceedings so the witness can \ngo out of the room and talk to his or her lawyer.\n  This bill goes to the very reason lawyers exist.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nmy colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, to submit a concurrent \nresolution expressing the sense of Congress with respect to \ndocumentation requirements for physicians who submit claims to Medicare \nfor office visits and other evaluation and management services.\n  In May of last year, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \nreleased revised Medicare documentation guidelines for evaluation and \nmanagement (E/M) services. The guidelines were intended to provide \nphysicians and claims reviewers advice about preparing and reviewing \ndocumentation for E/M services. They were also expected to improve the \nquality of medical records and continuity of patient care.\n  It is clear now, nearly eight months after the guidelines were \nimplemented, that the guidelines' intent has not been fulfilled. Rather \nthan improving the quality of patient care, the new E/M guidelines have \ncaused patient care to suffer.\n  I have received hundreds of letters from physicians in my state of \nNew Jersey telling me that they spend so much time trying to figure out \nhow to bill Medicare under the new guidelines that they have little \ntime left for their patients. There are 42 choices a physician must \nconsider before selecting the proper E/M code for a given service. \nThese kind of highly complicated and excessive billing guidelines force \nphysicians to spend less time with their patients and more time on \ntheir charts. The result is a diversion of the physicians' attention \naway from patient care and medical decision-making. Even the American \nMedical Association (AMA), who helped draft the guidelines, warns that \nthey may impose an undue burden on physicians that may detract from \npatient care. These concerns have prompted the AMA to commit to make \nchanges in the guidelines that address concerns about their complexity.\n  The resolution I rise to submit today expresses the sense of Congress \nthat HCFA should postpone its plan to implement the documentation \nguidelines and continue consultation with physicians organizations on \nhow to reduce the complexity of E/M guidelines. The resolution also \nexpresses the sense of Congress that HCFA should conduct a pilot study \nof any documentation requirements prior to their implementation to \nassure that they contribute to, rather than detract from, quality \npatient care.\n  It is well settled that adequate documentation is necessary to assure \nquality and appropriateness of Medicare services. It is also needed to \nprevent waste, fraud and abuse. However, we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to ensure that strategies to address these issues not \nresult in burdensome requirements that interfere with patient care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4208-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4209-S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SPECTER AMENDMENT NO. 2336\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 2676) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nrestructure and reform the Internal Revenue Service, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n                          TITLE ____--FLAT TAX\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Mr. President, I rise to announce my cosponsorship \nof Senator Bumpers' ``Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of \n1998.'' My support for this legislation is based on four important \nprinciples:\n  First, this bill promotes tax fairness. Mail order businesses \nunfairly benefit from their unique status. They can engage in \ninterstate commerce--sell products to customers in any state of the \nnation--but are not responsible for collecting state and local sales \ntaxes.\n  This places state and local businesses, which have no choice but to \ncollect sales tax on the merchandise they sell, at a severe competitive \ndisadvantage. This is especially damaging to small businesses, which \nare the backbone of our nation's economy. Over the last five years, \nFlorida businesses with less than 20 employees have created 71 percent \nof all new jobs in the state--775,000 in total. Our bill will put main \nstreet merchants on the same competitive footing as mail order \nbusinesses.\n  Second, this bill protects consumers. It prevents them from \nexperiencing an unexpected and unwelcome tax surprise. Many mail order \nshoppers are unaware that most states are empowered to assess a sales \ntax on the purchase of goods sold across state lines. They are \nsurprised when states like Florida come around to collect sales tax due \non particularly expensive goods.\n  Third, this bill preserves states' rights. Mr. President, there is no \nstate right that is more fundamental than the right to decide how to \nraise revenue. Because the federal government has not protected this \nright, Florida currently loses an estimated $168.9 million each year in \npotential revenues. Nationwide, states have lost more than $3.3 billion \nas a result of Washington's handcuffs. If we are determined to make \ngood on our promise to return more power and responsibility to states \nand local communities--and I think we must be--it makes no sense to \ndictate how Governors and legislators raise money. That's their job, \nnot ours.\n  Mr. President, state officials from across the nation are asking for \nour help. But don't take my word for it. Ask the National Governors \nAssociation, which once again passed a resolution supporting this kind \nof federal legislation at its Winter 1997 meetings.\n  Finally, this bill provides fairness to mail order firms. Most \ncompanies with nationwide sales of less than $3 million are exempt. The \nact gives companies the option of collecting a single blended rate for \neach state rather than the myriad of different state and local rates. \nOut of state companies only have to file tax returns once per quarter. \nAnd states participating in the Act must establish a toll-free number \nfor out-of-state companies to obtain information and forms.\n  Mr. President, it is time that the federal government remove the \nstraitjacket from states and restore to Governors and state legislators \ntheir power to raise revenue. I commend Senator Bumpers for his efforts \nto preserve states' rights in these important fiscal matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4214-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE CAMPBELLSVILLE UNIVERSITY LADY TIGERS: 1998 MID-SOUTH \n               CONFERENCE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nremarkable season recently completed by the Lady Tigers of \nCampbellsville University, located in the town of Campbellsville, \nKentucky. While many are more familiar with the Kentucky basketball \ndynasties built in places like Louisville and Lexington, Campbellsville \nhas a pretty impressive run of its own going.\n  Nationally ranked all year, the Lady Tigers completed their regular \nseason with a record of 21-7. Winning both the Mid-South Conference \nRegular Season and Tournament titles earned Campbellsville an automatic \nbid to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) \nchampionship tournament in Jackson, Tennessee. This is the ninth \nconsecutive season that Campbellsville has qualified for the national \ntournament.\n  The Lady Tigers opened the NAIA national tournament by defeating Big \nState Conference Tournament Champion LeTourneau University 95-56 in the \nfirst round and then defeated Oklahoma City University in the Second \nRound by a score of 69-51. The Lady Tigers were finally stopped in the \nquarterfinals by four-time defending National Champion, Southern \nNazarene University of Oklahoma, in a heartbreaker, 72-67.\n  Throughout the season, the Lady Tigers were led by Mid South \nConference Player of the Year Shannon Wathen, and All-Conference \nteammates Julie Jeffries and Farrah Sullivan. Together, this senior \ntriumvirate combined to average over thirty nine-points and fifteen \nrebounds per game. Post-season honors were also bestowed on Coach Donna \nWise, who has led Campbellsville to nine consecutive national \ntournament births and ranks second in wins among active NAIA coaches \nwith 475.\n  Mr. President, Coach Wise has built a national powerhouse women's \nbasketball program in Campbellsville, a small town in Central Kentucky. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations to Coach \nWise, her players, and everyone associated with the Campbellsville Lady \nTigers on another great season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4214-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4214-S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 1180, ENDANGERED SPECIES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to talk about S. 1180, the Endangered Species Act reauthorization \nbill, and why I have decided to cosponsor it at this time.\n  As our colleagues know, this bill was passed by the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee last fall, and it is currently on the calendar, \nready for consideration by the full Senate. I have been slow to \ncosponsor S. 1180 because of some reservations I had--and still have--\nabout the bill. I will talk in more detail about those reservations \nlater.\n  However, I am absolutely convinced that the current Endangered \nSpecies\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nAct is not only a dismal failure at saving species, but is actually \nworking against that goal. Furthermore, everyday we tolerate this \ndefective law, its unfair and unnecessary burdens increase on citizens \nand the economy. Yet at the same time, the American people continue to \nbelieve that conserving fish and wildlife species for the enjoyment of \nfuture generations is the right thing to do and I agree. They want to \nmake changes to the law, but don't want to see the Endangered Species \nAct thrown out.\n  That's why for the last three years, my colleague and friend from \nIdaho, Senator Kempthorne, has been working mightly to improve this \ncomplex law. He has held hearings, built coalitions, drafted and re-\ndrafted language to correct the problems while still advancing the \ngoals of the Endangered Species Act. I congratulate him, as well as our \nother Senate colleagues who have worked with him to produce this bill.\n  S. 1180 would make some positive reforms to the current system. It \nwould re-focus the process on actually saving species. It would create \nopportunities and benefits for people who are affected by the \ngovernment's actions in these areas.\n  For example, the bill emphasizes sound science--instead of politics--\nto guide actions taken to conserve and recover species. It requires \nindependent peer review for listing and delisting decisions, and for \nthe establishment of a biological recovery goal in a recovery plan. \nSpecific time limits would have to be observed, and States and local \ncitizens would have a larger role in the process.\n  I believe these provisions and others would make significant \nimprovements in our current process, to the benefit of both our \nwildlife and our citizenry. While additional corrections could be made, \nthose who drafted this bill believe that a more comprehensive overhaul \nof ESA is not going to pass this Congress. I tend to agree with that \nassessment and am willing to pursue the strategy of trying to pass \nthese reforms now as a foundation for further reforms in the future. \nThat is the message I would like to send with my cosponsorship of S. \n1180.\n\n  Having said all that, Mr. President, I cannot endorse each and every \nprovision of this legislation. I will be supporting amendments that \nwill change or add to the bill in a number of areas.\n  For instance, while I support S. 1180's stated goal of providing \nincentives to promote voluntary habitat conservation by private \nlandowners, I am very concerned about what the bill as a whole will \nfail to do in the area of protecting private property rights.\n  This is no small matter. The right to own and use property goes to \nthe very heart of our American democracy. It was so important to our \nfounding fathers that they enshrined the protection of private property \nin the Constitution's Bill of Rights.\n  It is equally important today. Yet our federal government has \nincreasingly ignored these rights. President Clinton rejected the \nConstitution's guarantee outright when he pledged to veto any \n``compensation entitlement legislation'' intended to strengthen \nAmericans' private property rights. Representatives of this \nAdministration have even suggested that the idea of private property is \nan outmoded notion.\n  Nowhere is the Administration's hostility to private property rights \nmore evident than in the area of endangered species regulation. Let's \ntake a look at Secretary Babbitt's ``no surprises'' policy, for \nexample. The basic idea is that if landowners surrender control over \nthe use of part of their property for ESA purposes, then the federal \ngovernment will let them use the rest of it without interference. To \nput it another way, Secretary Babbitt proposes that you pay the \ngovernment for the right to use your own land. By comparison, the \nConstitution of the United States promises that if the federal \ngovernment wants your land used a certain way, the federal government \nhas to pay you for it.\n  Mr. President, even more outrageous than Secretary Babbitt's program \nis the fact that many landowners think it's actually a pretty good \ndeal. How oppressive and tyrannical has ESA regulation become, when \ncitizens are willing--even eager--to give up their property and their \nconstitutionally-protected right to compensation, just to get the \ngovernment to leave them alone?\n  I applaud S. 1180's goal of reducing regulatory burdens and improving \nthe certainty and finality of government action in protecting \nendangered species. It is bad policy to require the American people to \nsacrifice their constitutionally-protected rights for any federal \nprogram--even this one. I would like to see S. 1180 strengthen and \nprotect the Fifth Amendment right to compensation. I will vote for \namendments and or legislation that strengthens our citizen's private \nproperty rights.\n  Private property rights are not the only critical issue that concerns \nme in this legislation. I also had hoped that S. 1180 would directly \naddress the issue of water rights, and specifically deny that any of \nits provisions create an express or implied federal water right.\n  Mr. President, the paramount natural resource issue for the American \nWest is the sovereignty of the states over the water that flows and \nexists within their borders. It is easy to say that all we need to do \nis remain silent on this issue and all will be well. In fact, however, \npreserving state water sovereignty is not so easy. The reality of how \nfederal water rights are created, or not created, requires that we \nspeak to the question in legislation.\n\n  The appropriation doctrine is the water law of western states and has \nas its central premise that the first person to claim a water right has \npriority on its use over those water claimants who assert claims at \nlater dates. In the arid West, this principle lies at the very heart of \nour economy. It is the ability to allocate this precious resource \n(water) for uses that allows us to exist.\n  It is for this reason we westerners become particularly agitated when \nthe federal government tries to disrupt this principle or to ``take'' \nour water. Does this legislation create a federal reserved water right? \nThere are those who would say ``no,'' and there are those who would \npress to assert such a right.\n  It is for this reason that this legislation should clearly state the \nCongress' intent. For the record, this Senator does not intend for the \nendangered species reauthorization legislation to create a federal \nreserved water right. This is why I believe S. 1180 must state clearly \nthat no implied or express federal water right is created in this \nlegislation. I will support and vote for such an amendment.\n  With these areas of concern in mind, I am also inclined to support a \nshorter term of reauthorization than S. 1180 provides. As I mentioned \npreviously, it is my goal to build additional improvements on the \nfoundation laid by this legislation. Accelerating the opportunity for \nCongress to re-open the issue would only advance that goal.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me repeat my endorsement for the goals \nthat Senator Kempthorne and the other supporters of this bill set out \nto ahieve in reauthorizing the Endangered Species Act. I think the bill \nwill make improvements that are critical to ongoing ESA efforts in my \nstate and elsewhere in the nation, and amendments in the areas I have \ndiscussed today will enhance those improvements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4214-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4215-S4216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VERMONT'S FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the week of May 4, 1998 is Public \nService Recognition Week. It is a time to applaud the tremendous \nefforts and accomplishments of government employees, and to educate the \npublic about the far reaching capabilities and services provided by \ngovernment employees. It is also a time for public servants to remind \nourselves why we chose to serve society through careers in public \nservice.\n  This year's theme is ``Working for You, Working for America'', \nhighlighting the commitment of public employees to work for the benefit \nof each individual, and for the collective benefit to improve the \nquality of life across our great nation.\n  In Vermont, over 6,000 members of our workforce are federal \nemployees. We provide technical assistance to farmers, respond to \ndisasters, manage forest land, and deliver mail. We administer federal \nfunds to provide educational benefits, housing assistance, job \ntraining, and school breakfast and lunch programs. We process social \nsecurity survivors benefits, veterans\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\ncompensation, and small business loans. We are the faces of \ngovernment--caseworkers, nurses, administrators, law enforcement \nofficers. Day to day, our jobs are rarely front page news. We are on \nthe front line and behind the scenes, working hard to resolve problems \nand make systems more effective.\n  Yet during this one week of the year, we hope to let people know how \nwe touch their lives. We'd like the media to highlight the successes: \nthousands of tax refunds processed on time, hundreds of packages \ndelivered the night before Christmas, dozens of checks issued for crop \nassistance after a spring flood, thousands of affordable housing units \nfor the elderly and disabled, and upkeep of a hiking trail from one end \nof the state to the other providing unparalleled vistas.\n  Federal employees tout years of experience and commitment, investing \nthemselves to bring about positive change. Continuously striving to be \nmore efficient, more effective and more customer-service oriented, \npublic servants care, and know government has a role to empower \ncitizens to make life better. Federal employees contribute to our one-\nof-a-kind democracy. I rise to salute Vermont's federal employees . . . \nyou truly make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ``IT'S MY FIGHT, TOO''\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nwomen, men, and their families who are fighting the scourge of breast \ncancer. As many of my colleagues may remember, last Spring, I submitted \nS. Res. 85, with my fellow Senator from New Hampshire, recognizing the \nfamily and friends of breast cancer patients in the struggle to cope \nwith this disease. The Senate passed my Resolution by unanimous consent \nand expressed their overwhelming support for individuals who provide \nstrength and support for loved ones fighting breast cancer. I come to \nthe floor today to again note the importance of this expression and to \nrecognize a very important organization in my home state of New \nHampshire that is spreading this message to breast cancer patients \nacross the country.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that in 1998, 178,700 new cases \nof invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United \nStates and 1,600 cases will be diagnosed among men. These numbers more \nthan triple in size when you consider the family and friends who are \nalso impacted by the disease. With each and every one of these cases \ncomes family and friends who are looked upon to provide the caring and \nloving needed to overcome such a terrifying disease.\n  The Northeast Health Care Quality Foundation, in Dover, New \nHampshire, has done an excellent job of expressing this notion to the \npeople of New Hampshire and beyond. With their campaign titled, ``It's \nMy Fight, Too,'' the Foundation has let individuals afflicted with \nbreast cancer know that they are not alone in their struggle. It is \nimportant for the family to understand that their feelings are shared \nby others in their same situation and that they should find strength in \nnumbers.\n  Awareness campaigns like ``It's My Fight Too,'' are extremely \nimportant to foster an environment where support for both the \nindividual with breast cancer and their family and friends is \nencouraged. Awareness is the key to allowing people to understand and \nidentify with those suffering around them. We can all, as community \nmembers, provide support and strength to those in need.\n  As Mother's Day approaches, the Northeast Health Care Quality \nFoundation will be holding their annual event to recognize the \nimportant women in our lives who may or may not be suffering from this \ndisease but who never the less, need to know that breast cancer is not \njust a women's disease but a struggle that can be fought by all of us \ntogether. Their event, ``Family and Friends Against Breast Cancer, It's \nMy Fight Too, A Night of Hope, Song and Love'' will bring people from \nacross the Northeast together to express the same support the Senate \nexpressed with the passage of S. Res. 85. I commend the efforts of the \nNortheast Health Care Quality Foundation and encourage organizations \nacross the country to follow their leadership and example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4216-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4216-S4217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKER MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to remember the American \nworkers who have suffered injuries or died while at the work places in \nmy home state of Minnesota and across the country.\n  As my colleagues may know, since 1989 the unions of the AFL-CIO have \nrecognized April 28 as ``Worker Memorial Day'' to commemorate the \nmillions of workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths that occur each \nyear. In addition, many unions throughout the world now mark April 28 \nas an ``International Day of Mourning.''\n  In Minnesota, AFL-CIO affiliates commemorated Worker Memorial Day \nwith a wide variety of events around the state. This past Tuesday at \nnoon, members of Minneapolis and St. Paul building trades met near the \nState Capitol in St. Paul to remember workers who have been killed or \ninjured in the job. A bell tolled once for each local construction \nworker who died in the past year of job-related causes.\n  In Grand Forks, the Northern Valley Labor Council and the Grand Forks \nBuilding and Construction Trades Council placed Workers Memorial Day \nstickers on their clothing at work. Statewide, a ``Minnesota's \nWorkforce Minute'' Message about Workers' Memorial Day aired several \ntimes over the 29 stations of Minnesota News Network's Lifestyle \nNetwork.\n  Lastly, the Minnesota Department of Transportation and local unions \nin the Twin Cities and St. Cloud participated in a number of Worker \nMemorial Day activities including the broadcast of a Workers Memorial \nDay message from the Metro Division Engineer over the MnDOT Public \naddress and radio communication systems. This message preceded the \nobservance of a moment of silence at 2 p.m.\n  Mr. President, this year also marks the 28th anniversary of the \nenactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In 1970, President \nNixon signed legislation which created the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration (OSHA) to establish and enforce labor standards \nand the National Institute for Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) to \nconduct research investigations.\n  At the Department of Labor bill signing, President Nixon underscored \nthe goal of this historic legislation. President Nixon noted how the \nbill's enactment, ``. . . Represents in its culmination the American \nsystem at its best: Democrats, Republicans, the House, the Senate, the \nWhite House, business, labor, all cooperating in a common goal--the \nsaving of lives, the avoiding of injuries, making the places of work \nfor 55 million Americans safer and more pleasant places.''\n  Mr. President, the goal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act is \nto prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the workplace. \nThrough statistics provided by the Department of Labor it appears as \nthough the intent of this Act has achieved some level of success. \nUnfortunately, these numbers are still too high.\n  According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 6,000 \nworkplace fatalities in 1996, the lowest level in five years. There \nwere 6.2 million workplace injuries or illnesses among private sector \nfirms with more than 11 or more employees, about 400,000 fewer than in \n1995. In my home state alone, 92 Minnesotans lost their lives, and \n138,000 suffered injuries or illnesses on the job in 1996.\n  I have always supported employers and employees in their effort to \ncreate safe and healthy work places without cumbersome federal \nregulations. Workers are a business' most valuable asset and they \ndeserve safe and healthy work places that will enable them to better \nperform their jobs. Safe working environments, achieved by restoring \ncommon sense and cooperation among workers, job providers and the \nfederal government, result in smart business.\n  I strongly believe we need to continue to promote better safety and \npublic health standards. One way this can be accomplished is through \ncomprehensive reform of the Federal regulatory process. For this \nreason, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 981, the ``Regulatory \nImprovement Act of 1997'' sponsored by Senator Carl Levin, one of the \nleading health, safety and environmental experts in the Senate.\n  In my view, legislation such as the Regulatory Improvement Act of \n1997\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\nwill ensure a more open and accountable regulatory process which will \nimprove our health, safety and environmental protections while reducing \nthe regulatory burden on those subject to those laws. It will not \ncompromise health or safety protections. I recently wrote the Majority \nLeader urging that this legislation receive consideration on the Senate \nfloor, and I am hopeful that we will have a debate on how to best \nensure safe and healthy work places in the coming weeks.\n  On each Workers Memorial Day, I urge my colleagues to remember those \nAmerican workers who have lost their lives or were injured on the job. \nCongress, the Administration, labor and business, must work together as \nthey did nearly 30 years ago, to ensure that there are adequate \nprotections to prevent unnecessary injuries and fatalities in the \nfuture and improve the lives of all of our nation's workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4216-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE FLOYD COUNTY EMERGENCY AND RESCUE SQUAD: THIRTY YEARS OF \n                 VOLUNTEER SERVICE IN EASTERN KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nanniversary of the Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad. Thirty \nyears ago this week, this squad of volunteers was formed to help the \npeople of Eastern Kentucky in times of emergency and disaster, and have \nbeen doing so ever since.\n  The Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad was founded in April, \n1958, as a result of a tragic accident in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in \nwhich a school bus plunged into the Big Sandy River, killing 26 \nstudents and the driver. As a result of this tragedy, dozens of \ncommunity members came together to form the Squad and the late Graham \nBurchett became the first Captain, a position he held for twenty years.\n  Since that time, over 300 community members have served on the \nSquad--doctors and lawyers, coal miners and factory workers--people \nfrom all walks of life have worked side-by-side in volunteer service to \ntheir community. The Squad operates without any public support. The \nmembers are all volunteers and all their equipment is paid for through \nprivate donations and grants.\n  The Squad currently maintains a roster of thirty active members and \ndozens of reserve members. The Squad is called on for auto extrication, \nwater rescue and drowning recovery, lost or missing persons, and \nassistance to coal mine rescue teams. In the last month alone, they \nhave assisted in the evacuation of flood victims, recovered a drowning \nvictim and have assisted on four auto accidents.\n  Despite the fact that the Squad must labor mightily for every dollar \nthey get, they have managed to secure ultra-modern equipment, and are \ncalled frequently to assist in recovery activities outside the county \nand even outside the state.\n  Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues will join me in offering our \ncongratulations to Captain Harry Adams, Co-Captain Richie Schoolcraft, \nTreasurer and Secretary Brian Sexton, First Lieutenant Derek Calhoun \nand Second Lieutenant Lee Schoolcraft and all the volunteers of the \nFloyd County Rescue Squad. They carry on the Squad's rich tradition of \nvolunteering their time and risking their lives to help the people of \ntheir community, and they are all worthy of our admiration and \nthanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/04/senate-section/article/S4217-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4217-S4220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROTOCOLS TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OF 1949 ON THE ACCESSION OF \n                POLAND, HUNGARY, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC\n\n  (The text of resolution of ratification to the Protocols to the North \nAtlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic as agreed to by the Senate on April 30, 1998, reads as \nfollows:)\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO DECLARATIONS \n                   AND CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic (as \n     defined in section 4(7)), which were opened for signature at \n     Brussels on December 16, 1997, and signed on behalf of the \n     United States of America and other parties to the North \n     Atlantic Treaty, subject to the declarations of section 2 and \n     the conditions of section 3.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATIONS.\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) Reaffirmation that united states membership in nato \n     remains a vital national security interest of the united \n     states.--The Senate declares that--\n       (A) for nearly 50 years the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) has served as the preeminent organization \n     to defend the territory of the countries in the North \n     Atlantic area against all external threats;\n       (B) through common action, the established democracies of \n     North America and Europe that were joined in NATO persevered \n     and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of \n     democratic government in Europe and North America throughout \n     the Cold War;\n       (C) NATO enhances the security of the United States by \n     embedding European states in a process of cooperative \n     security planning, by preventing the destabilizing \n     renationalization of European military policies, and by \n     ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the United \n     States in European security affairs;\n       (D) the responsibility and financial burden of defending \n     the democracies of Europe and North America can be more \n     equitably shared through an alliance in which specific \n     obligations and force goals are met by its members;\n       (E) the security and prosperity of the United States is \n     enhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that \n     may threaten the territory of NATO members; and\n       (F) United States membership in NATO remains a vital \n     national security interest of the United States.\n       (2) Strategic rationale for nato enlargement.--The Senate \n     finds that--\n       (A) notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of \n     Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United \n     States and its NATO allies face threats to their stability \n     and territorial integrity, including those common threats \n     described in section 3(1)(A)(v);\n       (B) the invasion of Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, \n     or their destabilization arising from external subversion, \n     would threaten the stability of Europe and jeopardize vital \n     United States national security interests;\n       (C) Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, having \n     established democratic governments and having demonstrated a \n     willingness to meet all requirements of membership, including \n     those necessary to contribute to the territorial defense of \n     all NATO members, are in a position to further the principles \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the \n     security of the North Atlantic area; and\n       (D) extending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, and the \n     Czech Republic will strengthen NATO, enhance security and \n     stability in Central Europe, deter potential aggressors, and \n     thereby advance the interests of the United States and its \n     NATO allies.\n       (3) Supremacy of the north atlantic council in nato \n     decision-making.--The Senate understands that--\n       (A) as the North Atlantic Council is the supreme decision-\n     making body of NATO, the North Atlantic Council will not \n     subject its decisions to review, challenge, or veto by any \n     forum affiliated with NATO, including the Permanent Joint \n     Council or the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, or by any \n     nonmember state participating in any such forum;\n       (B) the North Atlantic Council does not require the consent \n     of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, or any other international \n     organization in order to take any action pursuant to the \n     North Atlantic Treaty in defense of the North Atlantic area, \n     including the deployment, operation, or stationing of forces; \n     and\n       (C) the North Atlantic Council has direct responsibility \n     for matters relating to the basic policies of NATO, including \n     development of the Strategic Concept of NATO (as defined in \n     section 3(1)(F)), and a consensus position of the North \n     Atlantic Council will precede any negotiation between NATO \n     and non-NATO members that affects NATO's relationship with \n     non-NATO members participating in fora such as the Permanent \n     Joint Council.\n       (4) Full membership for new nato members.--\n       (A) In general.--The Senate understands that Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic, in becoming NATO members, \n     will have all the rights, obligations, responsibilities, and \n     protections that are afforded to all other NATO members.\n       (B) Political commitments.--The Senate endorses the \n     political commitments made by NATO to the Russian Federation \n     in the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which are not legally \n     binding and do not in any way preclude any future decisions \n     by the North Atlantic Council to preserve the security of \n     NATO members.\n       (5) NATO-Russia relationship. The Senate finds that it is \n     in the interest of the United States for NATO to develop a \n     new and constructive relationship with the Russian Federation \n     as the Russian Federation pursues democratization, market \n     reforms, and peaceful relations with its neighbors.\n       (6) The importance of european integration.--\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n       (A) Sense of the senate. It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) the central purpose of NATO is to provide for the \n     collective defense of its members;\n       (ii) the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe is a fundamental institution for the promotion of \n     democracy, the rule of law, crisis prevention, and post-\n     conflict rehabilitation and, as such, is an essential forum \n     for the discussion and resolution of political disputes among \n     European members, Canada, and the United States; and\n       (iii) the European Union is an essential organization for \n     the economic, political, and social integration of all \n     qualified European countries into an undivided Europe.\n       (B) Policy of the united states. The policy of the United \n     States is--\n       (i) to utilize fully the institutions of the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe to reach political \n     solutions for disputes in Europe; and\n       (ii) to encourage actively the efforts of the European \n     Union to expand its membership, which will help to stabilize \n     the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       (7) Future consideration of candidates for membership in \n     nato.\n       (A) Senate findings. The Senate finds that--\n       (i) Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that \n     NATO members by unanimous agreement may invite the accession \n     to the North Atlantic Treaty of any other European state in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area;\n       (ii) in its Madrid summit declaration of July 8, 1997, NATO \n     pledged to ``maintain an open door to the admission of \n     additional Alliance members in the future'' if those \n     countries satisfy the requirements of Article 10 of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty;\n       (iii) other than Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, \n     the United States has not consented to invite, or committed \n     to invite, any other country to join NATO in the future; and\n       (iv) the United States will not support the accession to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the invitation to begin \n     accession talks with, any European state (other than Poland, \n     Hungary, or the Czech Republic), unless--\n       (I) the President consults with the Senate consistent with \n     Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States (relating to the advice and consent of the \n     Senate to the making of treaties); and\n       (II) the prospective NATO member can fulfill the \n     obligations and responsibilities of membership, and its \n     inclusion would serve the overall political and strategic \n     interests of NATO and the United States.\n       (B) Requirement for consensus and ratification.--The Senate \n     declares that no action or agreement other than a consensus \n     decision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the \n     national procedures of each NATO member, including, in the \n     case of the United States, the requirements of Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States \n     (relating to the advice and consent of the Senate to the \n     making of treaties), will constitute a security commitment \n     pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (8) Partnership for peace.--The Senate declares that--\n       (A) the Partnership for Peace between NATO members and the \n     Partnership for Peace countries is an important and enduring \n     complement to NATO in maintaining and enhancing regional \n     security;\n       (B) the Partnership for Peace serves a critical role in \n     promoting common objectives of NATO members and the \n     Partnership for Peace countries, including\n       (i) increased transparency in the national defense planning \n     and budgeting processes;\n       (ii) ensuring democratic control of defense forces;\n       (iii) maintaining the capability and readiness of \n     Partnership for Peace countries to contribute to operations \n     of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe;\n       (iv) developing cooperative military relations with NATO; \n     and\n       (v) enhancing the interoperability between forces of the \n     Partnership for Peace countries and forces of NATO members;\n       (C) NATO has undertaken new initiatives to further \n     strengthen the Partnership for Peace with the objectives of\n       (i) strengthening the political consultation mechanism in \n     the Partnership for Peace through the Euro-Atlantic \n     Partnership Council;\n       (ii) enhancing the operational role of the Partnership for \n     Peace; and\n       (iii) providing for expanded involvement of members of the \n     Partnership for Peace in decision-making and planning within \n     the Partnership;\n       (D) enhancement of the Partnership for Peace promotes the \n     security of the United States by strengthening stability and \n     security throughout the North Atlantic area;\n       (E) the accession to the North Atlantic Treaty of new NATO \n     members in the future must not undermine the ability of NATO \n     and the Partnership for Peace countries to achieve the \n     objectives of the Partnership for Peace; and\n       (F) membership in the Partnership for Peace does not in any \n     way prejudice application or consideration for accession to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (9) Regarding payments owed by european countries to \n     victims of the nazis.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that, in future \n     meetings and correspondence with European governments, the \n     Secretary of State should\n       (i) raise the issue of insurance benefits owed to victims \n     of the Nazis (and their beneficiaries and heirs) by these \n     countries as a result of the actions taken by any communist \n     predecessor regimes in nationalizing foreign insurance \n     companies and confiscating their assets in the aftermath of \n     World War II;\n       (ii) seek to secure a commitment from the governments of \n     these countries to provide a full accounting of the total \n     value of insurance company assets that were seized by any \n     communist predecessors and to share all documents relevant to \n     unpaid insurance claims that are in their possession; and\n       (iii) seek to secure a commitment from the governments of \n     these countries to contribute to the payment of these unpaid \n     insurance claims in an amount that reflects the present value \n     of the assets seized by any communist governments (and for \n     which no compensation had previously been paid).\n       (B) Definition.--As used in this paragraph, the term \n     ``victims of the Nazis'' means persons persecuted during the \n     period beginning on March 23, 1933 and ending on May 8, 1945, \n     by, under the direction of, on behalf of, or under authority \n     granted by the Nazi government of Germany or any country \n     allied with that government.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is \n     subject to the following conditions, which shall be binding \n     upon the President:\n       (1) The strategic concept of nato.--\n       (A) Policy of the united states toward the strategic \n     concept of nato.--The Senate understands that the policy of \n     the United States is that the core concepts contained in the \n     1991 Strategic Concept of NATO (as defined in subparagraph \n     (F)), which adapted NATO's strategy to the post-Cold War \n     environment, remain valid today, and that the upcoming \n     revision of that document will reflect the following \n     principles:\n       (i) First and foremost a military alliance.--NATO is first \n     and foremost a military alliance. NATO's success in securing \n     peace is predicated on its military strength and strategic \n     unity.\n       (ii) Principal foundation for defense of security interests \n     of nato members.--NATO serves as the principal foundation for \n     collectively defending the security interests of its members \n     against external threats.\n       (iii) Promotion and protection of united states vital \n     national security interests.--Strong United States leadership \n     of NATO promotes and protects United States vital national \n     security interests.\n       (iv) United states leadership role.--The United States \n     maintains its leadership role in NATO through the stationing \n     of United States combat forces in Europe, providing military \n     commanders for key NATO commands, and through the presence of \n     United States nuclear forces on the territory of Europe.\n       (v) Common threats.--NATO members will face common threats \n     to their security in the post-Cold War environment, \n     including--\n       (I) the potential for the re-emergence of a hegemonic power \n     confronting Europe;\n       (II) rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver \n     these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles, or other \n     unconventional delivery means;\n       (III) threats of a wider nature, including the disruption \n     of the flow of vital resources, and other possible \n     transnational threats; and\n       (IV) conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic \n     disputes, or the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n       (vi) Core mission of nato.--Defense planning will affirm a \n     commitment by NATO members to a credible capability for \n     collective self-defense, which remains the core mission of \n     NATO. All NATO members will contribute to this core mission.\n       (vii) Capacity to respond to common threats.--NATO's \n     continued success requires a credible military capability to \n     deter and respond to common threats. Building on its core \n     capabilities for collective self-defense of its members, NATO \n     will ensure that its military force structure, defense \n     planning, command structures, and force goals promote NATO's \n     capacity to project power when the security of a NATO member \n     is threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members. This will require that \n     NATO members possess national military capabilities to \n     rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain \n     operations for extended periods of time, and operate \n     jointly with the United States in high intensity \n     conflicts.\n       (viii) Integrated military structure.--The Integrated \n     Military Structure of NATO underpins NATO's effectiveness as \n     a military alliance by embedding NATO members in a process of \n     cooperative defense planning and ensuring unity of command.\n       (ix) Nuclear posture.--Nuclear weapons will continue to \n     make an essential contribution to deterring aggression, \n     especially aggression by potential adversaries armed with \n     nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. A credible NATO \n     nuclear deterrent posture requires the stationing of United \n     States nuclear forces in Europe, which provides an essential \n     political and military link between Europe and North America, \n     and the widespread participation of NATO members in\n\n[[Page S4219]]\n\n     nuclear roles. In addition, the NATO deterrent posture will \n     continue to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any potential \n     aggressor about the nature of the response by NATO members to \n     military aggression.\n       (x) Burdensharing.--The responsibility and financial burden \n     of defending the democracies of Europe will be more equitably \n     shared in a manner in which specific obligations and force \n     goals are met by NATO members.\n       (B) The fundamental importance of collective defense.--The \n     Senate declares that--\n       (i) in order for NATO to serve the security interests of \n     the United States, the core purpose of NATO must continue to \n     be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO \n     members; and\n       (ii) NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis, engage in other \n     missions when there is a consensus among its members that \n     there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO \n     members.\n       (C) Defense planning, command structures, and force \n     goals.--The Senate declares that NATO must continue to pursue \n     defense planning, command structures, and force goals to meet \n     the requirements of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty as \n     well as the requirements of other missions agreed upon by \n     NATO members, but must do so in a manner that first and \n     foremost ensures under the North Atlantic Treaty the ability \n     of NATO to deter and counter any significant military threat \n     to the territory of any NATO member.\n       (D) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, the President shall submit to \n     the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives a report on the Strategic Concept of NATO. \n     The report shall be submitted in both classified and \n     unclassified form and shall include--\n       (i) an explanation of the manner in which the Strategic \n     Concept of NATO affects United States military requirements \n     both within and outside the North Atlantic area, including \n     the broader strategic rationale of NATO;\n       (ii) an analysis of all potential threats to the North \n     Atlantic area (meaning the entire territory of all NATO \n     members) up to the year 2010, including the consideration of \n     a reconstituted conventional threat to Europe, emerging \n     capabilities of non-NATO countries to use nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons affecting the North Atlantic \n     area, and the emerging ballistic missile and cruise missile \n     threat affecting the North Atlantic area;\n       (iii) the identification of alternative system \n     architectures for the deployment of a NATO missile defense \n     for the entire territory of all NATO members that would be \n     capable of countering the threat posed by emerging ballistic \n     and cruise missile systems in countries other than declared \n     nuclear powers, as well as in countries that are existing \n     nuclear powers, together with timetables for development and \n     an estimate of costs;\n       (iv) a detailed assessment of the progress of all NATO \n     members, on a country-by-country basis, toward meeting \n     current force goals;

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following \nconvention transmitted to the Senate on May 1, 1998, by the President \nof the United States: Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public \nOfficials in International Business Transactions (Treaty Document No. \n105-43). I further ask that the convention be considered as having been \nread the first time; that it be referred with accompanying papers to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that \nthe President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on Combating Bribery \nof Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (the \n``Convention''), adopted at Paris on November 21, 1997, by a conference \nheld under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD). The Convention was signed in Paris on December \n17, 1997, by the United States and 32 other nations.\n  I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, interpretive \nCommentaries on the Convention, adopted by the negotiating conference \nin conjunction with the Convention, that are relevant to the Senate's \nconsideration of the Convention. I transmit also, for the information \nof the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to \nthe Convention.\n  Since the enactment in 1977 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \n(FCPA), the United States has been alone in specifically criminalizing \nthe business-related bribery of foreign public officials. United States \ncorporations have contended that this has put them at a significant \ndisadvantage in competing for international contracts with respect to \nforeign competitors who are not subject to such laws. Consistent with \nthe sense of the Congress, as expressed in the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1988, encouraging negotiation of an agreement \nwithin the OECD governing the type of behavior that is prohibited under \nthe FCPA, the United States has worked assiduously within the OECD to \npersuade other countries to adopt similar legislation. Those efforts \nhave resulted in this Convention that once in force, will require that \nthe Parties enact laws to criminalize the bribery of foreign public \nofficials to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in \nthe conduct of international business.\n  While the Convention is largely consistent with existing U.S. law, my \nAdministration will propose certain amendments to the FCPA to bring it \ninto conformity with and to implement the Convention. Legislation will \nbe submitted separately to the Congress.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention, and that it give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                  William J.
