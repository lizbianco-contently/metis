Mr. President, this morning, under a previous order, the \nSenate will debate the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to \nthe Daschle amendment, with a vote occurring on the motion at 10 a.m.\n  Following that vote, the Senate will continue consideration of the \nvery important agriculture appropriations bill, with the hope of \nfinishing the bill as soon as possible this evening, or as early as \npossible this week. And I am very proud that my senior colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, will be doing his usual very good job in \nhandling this important bill. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall \nvotes throughout today's session of the Senate, with the first vote at \n10 a.m.\n  For the remainder of the week, it is hoped the Senate will complete \nseveral important appropriations bills--at least agriculture, HUD-VA, \nand legislative. That would be a very positive movement and would give \nus an opportunity to address other important issues.\n  Members are reminded that we have the second in the Leader Lecture \nseries this evening. I will be honored to introduce our former majority \nleader, Senator Baker. That will be held tonight at 6 p.m. in the old \nSenate Chamber.\n  Also, on Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, there will be a Joint \nMeeting of Congress in the House Chamber to receive an address from the \nPresident of Romania.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to our lecture series session this \nafternoon with Senator Baker. I know it will be interesting and, as \nusual, filled with good wit and good humor, and will be very \ninformative about his views of the Senate and where we have been and \nwhere we are going. The next speaker in the leader series is scheduled \nto be Senator Byrd of West Virginia. I believe it is in September.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the leader would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was listening to the leader's outline for the \nremainder of the week and the proposals, and I had not heard the \nscheduling of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I know that the leader \ntalked with the Democratic leader. I was wondering if he could give us \nany further information about what the scheduling prospects would be \nfor that very important piece of legislation, particularly since the \nHUD appropriations has that as an amendment on it. What could the \nleader tell us about the prospects of going to a debate on this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been indicating all year that the Senate was going \nto take this issue up, and beginning June 18 I sent suggested unanimous \nconsent agreements to Senator Daschle. He and I talked yesterday. We \nare working together on that issue. We fully expect that probably early \nnext week we will turn to this issue. We have not worked out the exact \ntime or the exact procedure. But we had a good discussion yesterday, \nand we will continue to have that discussion.\n  I would like for us to do it where we have the Patients' Bill of \nRights as the issue that is pending, with Senator Kennedy's bill as one \nof those, obviously, that would be offered, and the task force bill \nthat has been put together by Senator Nickles, and others, and not tie \nup appropriations bills. We have the people's work to do. The \nappropriations bills keep the Government running. They fund our farm \nprograms, they fund our veterans programs, they fund our housing \nprograms, they fund our parks and Interior, Commerce, State, and \nJustice. The Senator knows the list. So we need to go ahead with those \nappropriations bills, and then we will turn to the Patients' Bill of \nRights in a reasonable period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed with my \nleader time so that I can make a statement with regard to the committee \nhearings on the investigation with regard to the satellite exports to \nthe People's Republic of China.\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I am going to provide an update on the \ninvestigations that have been proceeding by four of our committees into \nthis U.S. policy toward satellite exports. We have not reached any \nfinal determinations. I want to emphasize that. The good counsel is \nthat we have made some progress. We are learning some things, but there \nis a good deal more work that needs to be done. I believe the \nIntelligence Committee has an open hearing scheduled tomorrow. Senator \nCochran's subcommittee has hearings scheduled I believe next week. So \nwe will continue this. We are going to be thorough and we are going to \nbe cautious. We should not jump to conclusions.\n  In this connection, I recently came across the following statement \nfrom 1989 concerning the Bush administration's decision to allow export \nlicenses for three United States satellites: ``Allowing these launches \nis not in the best interests of our country or of our relationship with \nChina. It casts a long shadow that distorts beyond recognition what the \nUnited States ought to represent to our own people and to the people \nfighting for democracy in China.'' This statement was made by then-\nSenator Al Gore. He obviously has changed his position.\n  What we have to examine is whether the policy of allowing the export \nof U.S. satellites as implemented by the Clinton-Gore administration \nadequately protects American national interests.\n  Let me start with the bottom line. Senate investigations have only \nbegun. Lack of cooperation from the Administration has hampered our \nefforts. Thirteen hearings with 32 witnesses have been held by four \ncommittees. I have met with the committee chairmen and other members of \nour informal task force on China. At this point, five major interim \njudgments can be made based on what we already know.\n  First, the Clinton administration's export controls for satellites \nare wholly inadequate. They have not protected sensitive U.S. \ntechnology. National security concerns are regularly downplayed and \neven ignored.\n  Second, in violation of stated United States policy, sensitive \ntechnology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China. \nWe know what the case is.\n  Third, China has received military benefit from United States \nsatellite exports.\n  Every day, there continues to be additional information that comes \nout in this area.\n  In fact, in today's Washington Times, there is a news article that \nsays ``U.S. Technology Builds `Bridge' for China Missile.''\n  Fourth, the administration has ignored overwhelming information \nregarding Chinese proliferation, and has embarked on a de facto policy \ndesigned to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions \nunder U.S. proliferation law. We have a statement from White House \nofficial to that effect.\n  Finally, new information has come to light about China's efforts to \ninfluence the American political process. This new information should \nremove all resistance to naming an independent counsel to investigate \nthe evidence and the allegations.\n  The administration has failed to fully cooperate with the Senate \ninvestigation, even though they have indicated that they would, and \nthere is still time for that. But on May 22, 1998, along committee \nchairmen of jurisdiction, I sent letters requesting administration \ndocuments from the White House, the Departments of State, Commerce, \nDefense, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. On June 1, 1998, \na letter was sent to the Department of Justice requesting documents. On \nJune 2, 1998, a letter was sent requesting documents from the Customs \nService. On June 12, 1998, Senators Shelby and Kerrey sent letters \nrequesting information from eight Governmental agencies and the White \nHouse as part of the Select Committee on Intelligence investigation.\n  The letters I joined in sending requested documents in three areas: \nFirst, all issues associated with the export of satellites to China, \nincluding waivers of U.S. law governing such exports and the decision \nto transfer control of satellite exports from the Department of State \nto the Department of Commerce; second, issues associated with China's \nproposed membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR; and \nthird, information on Chinese proliferation activities which indicate \npossible violations of U.S. laws.\n  A significant amount of documents have been provided concerning some \nareas of satellite exports--particularly from the White House and \nparticularly on the presidential waivers allowing satellite exports. \nBut virtually no information has been provided concerning the transfer \nof export controls from State to Commerce--from the White House or any \nother agency. And virtually no information has been provided on Chinese \nmembership in the MTCR, or on Chinese proliferation activities in \nviolation of U.S. law.\n  A review of executive branch compliance with our document requests \ndemonstrates how limited the cooperation really has been.\n  Until Friday of last week, the Department of Commerce only provided \nan initial limited set of documents. More has been promised, but the \nresponse has again glacial and incomplete. The documents they have \nprovided contain redactions that limit their utility, quite frankly.\n  The Department of Justice has provided nothing to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, and has insisted on reviewing virtually all \ndocuments provided by any other Government agencies--significantly \nslowing down the process in this area.\n  The Department of State has provided also virtually nothing. \nClassified documents, according to a July 2, 1998, letter, would not be \nprovided to the Congress. Instead, documents could be read only at the \nDepartment of State. Given that far more sensitive information is \nroutinely provided for the use of the Senate in Senate spaces, this can \nonly be seen as bureaucratic obstruction.\n  The White House has not responded to the Intelligence Committee. \nNeither has ACDA, Customs, or State. Defense and Commerce have only \nprovided limited information.\n  The White House initially declassified some documents concerning \nwaiver decisions in June, but has provided nothing since then.\n  The Department of Defense has provided only a very limited number of \ndocuments.\n  The Customs Service has provided nothing other than a June 23, 1998, \nletter stating that they would not meet our June 15, 1998, deadline, \nbut we haven't gotten that information as of yet.\n  After a review of the Clinton administration's compliance with our \nrequests for information, it is hard to escape the conclusion that \ndelay has become the standard operating procedure. Once again, it is \ngoing to make it difficult for us to get the information we need so we \ncan make a clear determination about the damage that has been done with \nthis technology transfer. After an initial show of good faith by the \nadministration, we have not had a lot more cooperation since then.\n  We will be forced to consider other measures to compel enforcement. I \ndon't plan to move nominees of these non-cooperative agencies until our \nlegitimate oversight requests are honored. We are actively examining \nthe possibility of subpoena options. It is becoming increasingly \ndifficult to continue with the very productive hearings that we have \nhad without this cooperation.\n\n  Now, I would like to address the five points I raised earlier in some \ngreater detail. Again, these are preliminary conclusions and we are \nseeking additional information.\n  First, the Clinton administration's export controls for satellites \nare simply inadequate. There has not been adequate protection of \nsensitive U.S. technology. National security concerns are regularly \ndownplayed and even ignored. Hearings before several committees have \ndetailed the shortcomings in the development and implementation of \nexport controls of satellites.\n  For example, a senior official of the Defense Trade and Security \nAdministration testified before the Committee\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\non Governmental Affairs on June 25, 1998, that ``over the past six \nyears, the formal process to control dual-use items has failed in its \nstated mission--to safeguard the national security of the United \nStates.''\n  Transferring the control of satellite exports from the State \nDepartment to the Commerce Department in 1996 really resulted in \ndramatic changes. According to the General Accounting Office testimony \nbefore the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 10, 1998, \nthe transfer reduced the influence of the Defense Department. It \neliminated Congressional notification. It exempted satellite exports \nfrom certain sanctions. Technical information is not as clearly \ncontrolled, leading to uncertainty on the part of aerospace companies \nand to more technology transfer than previously allowed.\n  Testimony on July 8, 1998, before the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, has established that the \nDepartment of Defense monitors are not required to be present at \nsatellite launches. This is directly contrary to previous \nadministration claims. No statute, policy, or regulation requires U.S. \nGovernment monitors.\n  At least three U.S. satellites have been launched in China with no \nU.S. monitors present. No one in the U.S. Government knows what \ntranspired at these launches or if U.S. laws and policies on technology \ntransfer were followed. No one in our Government is even attempting to \nexamine what occurred at these unmonitored satellite launches. Looking \nat these unmonitored launches, I think, would be a critical element of \nthe next phase of our investigation.\n  Today's satellite export control system relies on the good will of \nthe Commerce Department, a department which has repeatedly demonstrated \nits willingness to ignore national security concerns on satellite \nexports. This is an area where we need to take a close look at how we \nare going to proceed in the future and what is going to be expected of \nthe Commerce Department.\n  For example, Commerce has unilaterally removed items subject to \ninteragency license review without notice to other affected agencies. \nCommerce has also refused to send approved licenses to Defense so \nofficials there can evaluate the final product. When it involves \nsatellites and technology, clearly the Defense Department should be a \npart of this process.\n  Second, sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been \ntransferred to China. In at least two cases, U.S. companies analyzed \nChinese launch failures and communicated with Chinese officials. In \n1995, Hughes analyzed the ``APSTAR 2'' launch failure. Commerce now \nconcedes that this analysis should have been subject to State and \nDefense Department reviews before a Commerce official gave it to the \nChinese. Commerce only provided the report, concluded in 1995, 2 hours \nbefore a Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International \nProliferation hearing on July 8 of this year.\n  The 1996 Loral launch failure is the subject of a Justice Department \nreview for possible illegal transfer of technology. Compliance with the \nlaw is the province of the Justice Department. So we are looking into \nthe impact on American national securities. It is very important that \nthe Justice Department complete that work.\n  I agree with three assessments by three elements of the State and \nDefense Departments that China derived significant benefits from their \ntechnical exchanges with U.S. companies after the Long March crash in \n1996, exchanges which are likely to lead to improvements in the \nreliability of their ballistic missile, and especially their guidance \nsystems. So we have to be concerned very much about this transfer.\n  Third, China has received military benefit from U.S. satellite \nexports. There is a division within the executive branch agencies over \nhow much China has benefited. But there seems to be agreement that \ncertainly some benefit was derived.\n  The New York Times has reported that U.S. satellites are being used \nby the Chinese military for its internal coded communications. \nAdministration officials concede that China is using American-made and \nexported satellites for their military communications. This is a clear \nand uncontested military benefit for China. The New York Times also \nreports that an additional satellite export that could enhance the \nChinese military's ability to eavesdrop on phone conversations is under \nreview by the Clinton administration.\n  The administration has ignored overwhelming information regarding \nChinese proliferation and has embarked on what appears to be a de facto \npolicy to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions \nunder our U.S. proliferation law. For instance, on June 11, 1998, the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations heard testimony from the former director \nof the Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency. The \nClinton administration has used ``almost any measure'' to block \nintelligence judgments that China had transferred missiles to \nPakistan--a clear violation of U.S. law that requires the imposition of \nsanctions. Intelligence analyses ``were summarily dismissed by the \npolicy community.''\n\n  According to the testimony, the intelligence community is ``virtually \ncertain that this transfer had taken place . . .'' I am convinced, \nafter a personal investigation, that it did take place, and it was a \nvery dangerous for Pakistan to be receiving these missiles. Why has \nthat been the case, and why hasn't the administration been willing to \ntake actions providing sanctions where clearly that information has \nbeen provided?\n  Finally, new information has come to light about China's efforts to \ninfluence the American political process. This new information should \nremove any doubt about the need for an independent counsel in this \narea.\n  It has already been reported that FBI Director Freeh has indicated \nhis view that an independent counsel should be appointed. It is time to \nrenew attention on the Attorney General. It is time for an outside, \nimpartial investigation by an independent counsel into the serious and \ncredible charges of direct Chinese Government financing or involvement \nin the 1996 elections. We have very good committees that are working \ntogether in a bipartisan way and looking into these very important \nquestions. I urge them to continue to do so, and to do it in a calm and \nmethodical way. It is essential that we get cooperation from the \nadministration to provide the additional information that we requested, \nthe additional evidence. And we will carry out our constitutional \nresponsibilities. Nothing less should be expected of us.\n  In view of the inquiries we had about how these are proceeding, what \ninformation we have been getting, what is outstanding, and also what is \nour plan, as far as future hearings, I thought it was important that I \ngive some review of what has transpired.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in light of the statements that have just \nbeen made and the time consumed by the majority leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that each side have 10 minutes to debate the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have the opportunity to discuss, \nin greater detail, the remarks just made by the distinguished majority \nleader. Let me just say that our interest, too, is to have a bipartisan \nreview of the actions taken with regard to the technology transfer in \nChina. But I do hope that it will be bipartisan. The majority leader \ngave what I would view to be a pretty partisan report this morning with \nregard to the allegations pending on this particular matter, and I will \nhave a very thorough response to the majority leader at some point \ntoday. I do believe that the issue warrants our review. As he said, \nthis is a constitutional responsibility, but it also warrants \nobjectivity and very thoughtful and careful consideration of the facts. \nMany of the reports the distinguished majority leader cited were \nallegations that have yet to be proven, allegations reported--he \nmentioned the New York Times on a number of occasions--allegations \nreported, citing unidentified sources, and what I would consider to be \nvery questionable sources with regard to the information reported in \nsome cases. So we are going to have to be very careful about the \ndistinction between allegation and fact, the distinction between what \nhas actually occurred and what is reported or what is\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\nalleged to have occurred. So I hope that we can do that, as he noted, \nin a bipartisan way, thoroughly and very carefully examining the facts \nand coming to some conclusion prior to the time we issue any reports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8088-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8090-S8091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE TOBACCO AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the next few minutes we will have an \nopportunity to revisit an issue that many of us hoped would not have \nbeen rejected last month. The amendment before us is the so-called \nMcCain managers' amendment to the comprehensive tobacco bill reported \nby the Commerce Committee. The only significant change is the Lugar \namendment to repeal the tobacco quota and price support programs is \nremoved.\n  There were many complaints about how loaded up the tobacco bill had \nbecome. The amendment we are discussing this morning has none of the \nextra provisions dealing with taxes and drug abuse. Each day that we \nwait, 3,000 kids start to smoke; 1,000 of them will die prematurely of \ntobacco-related illnesses. Tobacco companies are targeting 12-, 13- and \n14-year-old children as replacement smokers to fill the shoes of the 2 \nmillion smokers who quit or die each year. We have all heard the facts. \nTobacco-related disease kills 400,000 Americans each year.\n  So today's tobacco amendment, the McCain managers' amendment, is \nsimply designed to deter teen smoking without raising all of the other \nissues that surfaced during the debate. We had hoped very much that we \ncould modify this amendment before its consideration today. Our \nRepublican colleagues and the leader chose to oppose our unanimous \nconsent request to change the amendment. We were going to modify the \nlegislation to make it a straightforward authorization.\n  I will tell my colleagues that the modified amendment will be offered \nat a later date on another bill. We will be content to have the vote on \nthe point of order on this amendment and then we will, as I have noted \nbefore, revisit this question on several occasions.\n  I am disappointed that our colleagues, for whatever reason, have \nchosen not to allow us to modify our amendment at this time. I hope no \none will be misled. Their actions reflect their willingness to make \ndifficult choices on tobacco legislation targeted at teenage smokers.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. So we will have an \nopportunity to vote on it. We can vote procedurally and we can \nobfuscate the question, but we will come back, and we will come back \nagain and again over the course of the coming months, to offer \nlegislation that will not be subject to any points of order. So we may \nbe delaying that vote, but we will eventually have that vote.\n  I think it is critical that everyone recognize what a very important \nmoment this is. The attorneys general are meeting as we speak. There is \nvery likely to be an agreement dealing with past actions on the part of \nthe tobacco industry. The question is, Can we deal with future ones, \ncan we anticipate similar actions and establish public policy that will \nprevent the tobacco industry from targeting teenage smokers? That is, \nin essence, what we are attempting to do here with advertising \nrestrictions, with research, with an array of disincentives to teenage \nsmokers that otherwise will not be part of any agreement. It takes \nlegislation.\n  So, Mr. President, this will be our opportunity to do that. I know \nthere are other Senators who wish to speak, and I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There is a time-honored tradition here which has been \nviolated, at least in my concern, where a person who offers the \namendment usually is afforded the opportunity to modify it, and that \nwas not afforded to our leader last evening.\n\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that even if we have an attorneys \ngeneral agreement that basically deals retrospectively with what has \nbeen achieved in the past but will not provide the kind of preventive \nprograms that are so important to discourage teenagers from smoking, it \nwill not strengthen the Food and Drug Administration to be able to take \neffective action in terms of certain advertising programs for youth and \nwill do very little in terms of discouraging children from purchasing \ncigarettes because of an increase in price? Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that one of the reasons he continues to press this is \nbecause even if there is an attorneys general agreement, that it is \nretrospective rather than prospective?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts says it very well. That \nis as succinct a description of the problem as I have heard. The \nattorneys general may help address past problems, the retrospective and \nvery serious concerns that have been raised in court cases throughout \nthe country. The problem, then, becomes, how do we avoid those problems \nin the future? And what every attorney general has said is the only way \nyou can do that is to establish new public policy that strengthens \nregulatory controls on tobacco, ends advertisements that target kids, \nexpands our research efforts, increases the price of tobacco to deter \nyouth from falling prey to the smoking habit, holding tobacco companies \naccountable for accomplishing youth smoking reduction targets, that is, \nlet's put into place strategies that reduce teen smoking. Permanently. \nThis must happen prospectively. What the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid is exactly right. It s a question of whether or not we can \nsuccessfully put into place laws that preclude any further abuses by \nthe tobacco industry. We must act now to stop the industry from any \nfurther use of covert strategies such as those that, thanks in large \nmeasure to the work of the attorneys general, are now common knowledge.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, because I see others in the Chamber, of \ncourse, those kinds of inflictions of addiction are continuing among \nthe young people in this country today without this action.\n  My final question is this: Is it the Senator's purpose in providing a \nsubstitute, if he had been able to do that, or make the modification \nlast night in the time-honored tradition of this body, would the \nSenator's modification basically have addressed the objections which \nwere made to the earlier consideration of the tobacco proposal? I \nunderstood that is where they were directed. So if the measure had been \npermitted to be modified, that effectively the kinds of procedural \nissues and questions that have been raised would effectively have been \nattended to and we would have on the floor of the Senate a real \nopportunity to address the substance of the amendment?\n  Of course, I think, myself, they both have become interchangeable, \nbut I am just interested in what is the leader's viewpoint on that \nissue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question. \nWe are in an interesting position here. The Republican majority will \nargue that the pending amendment violates our budgetary rules, and on \nthe basis of that violation, they will vote against the amendment and \nvote against the motion to waive the point of order on the budgetary \nrules.\n  Last night, we offered to change the amendment to accommodate the \nbudgetary rules, and we were denied the opportunity to change that \namendment. So here you have the Republican majority objecting to our \namendment based upon budgetary rules, but unwilling to allow us to \nchange the amendment so that it conforms to budgetary rules. So the \nquestion then becomes, What is the basis for the real opposition? The \nbasis for the real opposition, one could only assume, is that they \nsimply do not want to pass meaningful tobacco policy that takes aim at \nthe array of serious policy concerns the Senator addressed in his \nearlier question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator saying the vote which we are about to take \nis one where there will be objection to the Senator's motion on \nprocedural grounds, and yet the Senator was not afforded the \nopportunity to correct any procedural problems?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So, in other words, I recall a gentleman I worked for in \nIllinois by the name of Cecil Partee, who\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nused to say, ``In politics, for every position you take there is a good \nreason and a real reason.'' So the good reason many Republicans will \noppose our amendment is that because procedurally it is inartful or \ndoesn't comply with the rules; the real reason is they don't want to \ngive the leader a chance in any way to correct his amendment so we can \nmove to a vote that really has accountability for tobacco companies. Is \nthat not the case?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is correct. My answer, stated, \nI think, prior to the time the Senator from Illinois came to the floor, \nwas simply to say: We will have that opportunity on other bills. We \nwill not be precluded from having an opportunity to offer a tobacco \namendment that conforms to budgetary rules in some other context on \nsome other piece of legislation in the not too distant future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator to yield for one other question. So the \ntobacco companies on this next vote would really want your motion \ndefeated; is that not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The tobacco company's vote would be a ``no'' vote. That \nis correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8090-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8091-S8106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 2159, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2159) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle amendment No. 2729, to reform and structure the \n     processes by which tobacco products are manufactured, \n     marketed, and distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco \n     products by minors, and to redress the adverse health effects \n     of tobacco use.\n       Motion to waive section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act with respect to consideration of Amendment No. 2729.\n\n\n           Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 2729\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act with respect to the Daschle amendment, No. 2729.\n  The distinguished Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Democratic \nleader's request was that there be 10 minutes equally divided, or 10 \nminutes on each side? Although 10 minutes has already been used in \ndebating the amendment, does that count? I am curious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator he has 10 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to anyone listening to this \ndebate, you would think that those who want the big spending bill that \nis in the guise of helping children stop smoking--you would think they \nhave not had an opportunity on the floor of the Senate to present their \ncase. If one would take this discussion and say that is the only \ndiscussion we have had on the so-called cigarette tax bill, that would \nbe one thing. But my recollection, without checking the record, is that \nwe have debated this issue for 4 weeks. Is that not correct, I ask the \nchairman of the subcommittee? Four weeks of floor time, with scores of \namendments and so many hours of debate that I am assuming even the \nAmerican people who watch C-SPAN wondered, ``How much longer are you \ngoing to discuss this?'' Now we come to the floor on an appropriations \nbill that everybody knows has to be passed and signed by October 1 or \nwe close down all of agriculture in America, and up comes the cigarette \nbill and a debate starts: ``The Republicans don't want to let us \nvote.''\n  I don't know anything about the lack of ability to amend the \namendment, but I do know this. This amendment is for real in terms of \nits budgetary impacts. As a matter of fact, if this were on the bill \nwhen it came out of committee, it would be subject to a point of order \nand the whole bill would fall. That is how important it is, because it \noverspends what is allocated to the Subcommittee on Agriculture by $8 \nbillion. I wonder how many eight billions of dollars over the \nallocation which keeps this new balance we can have around here? Can we \nhave eight or nine of them this year and say, ``It is such wonderful \nlegislation that we just ought to break the rules of the budget?''\n  I will acknowledge the Budget Act says you can waive the Budget Act, \nso I am not critical of those who try to waive it. But I am wondering \nwhether or not, when we wrote that Budget Act and said you can waive \nit, whether we had in mind breaking a 5-year balanced budget that was \nin place for the first time in 40 years because along came some \nlegislation that people thought was very, very interesting and \nimportant?\n  Let me repeat. There are some who are going to say this is just a \nprocedural vote, it isn't meaningful, and Republicans have pulled this \nout of the bag like a rabbit pulled out by some kind of a person that \npulls tricks. There is nothing to that. Mr. President, $8 billion is a \nlot of money. I think the American people understand $8 billion. And \nthis is $8 billion in new direct spending that will be charged to this \nsubcommittee on its agricultural bill for all of agricultural programs, \nincluding research, in the United States. It could cause the bill to \nfail so that those on the other side of the aisle can have yet another \nchance to debate an issue which has been debated for 4 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I am glad the majority leader raised the point of \norder under the Budget Act. It is absolutely right. It is correct. It \nis substantive. As a matter of fact, had he not raised it, there would \nhave been a chorus of Senators here to raise it because it is so \npatently in violation of the 5-year budget agreement that we just \nentered into last year wherein we told the American people it is a \nfirst in 38 years and how proud we are that we are in balance. Then \nalong comes the President who says don't spend a nickel of the surplus \non anything but Social Security. Then we come with bills like this, and \nthere goes $8 billion of the surplus here. I don't know what is going \nto happen on the next bill when they have more of this. So, frankly, I \nbelieve we ought to sustain the point of order.\n  I repeat, it is real, it is fair, and it is timely. They have had, \nthose who want this gigantic $875 billion new expenditure plan over the \nnext 25 years--that is what the bill before us, the big bill, was--\nanyone who wants that, they had their debates for 4 weeks and lost. Do \nwe want to start over again on an appropriations bill? And then who is \ngoing to be claiming we didn't get our business done, we couldn't get \nthe appropriations finished by October 1? Who is going to be doing \nthat? The President and the minority party. And this is just one more \ninstance where it is their fault we don't get it done, not our fault.\n  We ought to pass this appropriations bill and do this in due course \nif there is another opportunity presented by the Senate. If not, they \nhave had their day in court, it seems to me. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to vote against the \nmotion made by the Democratic leader to waive the Budget Act. This is \nan amendment that is almost the biggest program in the entire bill that \nis contained in the agricultural appropriations bill that is before the \nSenate. We don't have the authority as an Appropriations Committee to \nwrite the legislative language to create a program of this kind, and \nthat is what the Democratic leader and his cosponsors on his side of \nthe aisle seek to do.\n  There is funding in the bill, Senators should know, for the Food and \nDrug Administration's program targeted to dealing with the problem of \nunderage smoking. Mr. President, $34 million is appropriated in the \nbill for the FDA's\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nprogram to deal with that, and that is consistent with the existing \nlegal authority which this committee has to operate under and respect.\n  Supporting the Budget Committee chairman's appeal to the Senate, I \nurge Senators to vote ``no'' on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time on the Democratic side \nhas expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to Daschle amendment No. 2729. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Harkin will have an amendment in \njust a moment. He is on his way over. I thought it might be appropriate \nto get the debate started and to have a discussion about the essence of \nthe amendment. It will be simply a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \ncalls upon the Senate and the country to respond to the problem we find \nin agriculture today.\n  Most of America prospers with an economy that is striking for its \nperformance and success. On Wall Street, on Main Street, in the suburbs \nof America, and in virtually every segment of our country the economy \nis as strong as it could possibly be. Wall Street has exceeded their \nexpectations manyfold. The number of housing starts is up. The number \nof new businesses created is way up. The number of people employed has \nbeen dramatically improved upon in the last 5 years. We now have over \n14 million Americans who have new jobs.\n  So while the overall economic picture is extremely bright and \nencouraging, with no end in sight, the Federal Reserve Board continues \nto argue that its circumstances are that they don't see any need to \nchange; they won't increase the interest rates. While all that is \nhappening, there is a segment of our economy that continues to get \nworse and worse and more and more bleak.\n  While most of America prospers, our farmers and ranchers in rural \ncommunities are now in a crisis. While we recognize the geographic \ndifferences that exist, there are some areas where you might suggest \nthat crisis is avoided. Some in agriculture today--rice farmers and \ncotton farmers--are generally happier than they have been on other \noccasions. But across the Great Plains, down into Texas, well into the \nDakotas, across into Montana and the West, down into the Southeast, \nevery time I go home, we see increasing evidence of serious economic \nalarm.\n  This crisis rivals now the worst of the farm crisis in the 1980s in \nsome parts of our country. Farm income is down dramatically in South \nDakota and across the country. It has fallen in 32 States. It is down \nby 30 percent in more than one-fifth of the country today. The problem \nis low prices. In 1998, the average net farm income for Great Plains \nfarmers is expected to be near the poverty line for a family of four.\n  Let me make sure everybody understands that.\n  A farmer in the Great Plains who is on the farm today working \nactively as a producer--the average farmer today--will actually see his \nor her income at the official poverty line for a family of four.\n  Here we are experiencing one of the greatest booms in modern day on \nWall Street in virtually every segment of the economy, and yet our \nfarmers and ranchers are the ones experiencing an unbelievable economic \nand financial crisis that equals, if not exceeds, anything they have \nhad in the past.\n  Farm debt is now $172 billion. That, Mr. President, is the highest it \nhas been in 13 years. We have to go all the way back to the time when \nfarmers rolled their tractors into Washington to find a time when farm \ndebt was as high as it is today at $172 billion. Overall farm income \nnationwide is down $5.2 billion since 1996.\n  So we have seen a precipitous decline in farm income. We have seen an \naccompanying increase in debt rivaling anything we have seen in my \nlifetime, going all the way back to the farm crisis of 1985. And that \nis our current circumstance. Do you call that a crisis, when a family \nof four is trying to eke out a living on a farm, or a ranch, is at the \npoverty-line income, when debt has gone up by $172 billion, when we \nhave seen the precipitous decline in farm income in just the last 2 \nyears of $5.2 billion?\n  Mr. President, that translates into losses that go beyond farms. In \nfact, we are told that we could see a loss of 100,000 jobs in rural \nAmerica as a result of the problems in the agricultural sector--100,000 \npeople. Why? Because farm income has plummeted, debt has gone up, and \nthe economy continues to worsen.\n  So there is no doubt that this isn't just a farm issue, it is a rural \nissue of enormous magnitude. The ripple effect is clearly now in \nevidence.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest admiration and affection and \nrespect for the current Presiding Officer. He and I have worked \ntogether and come from the same part of the country. I appreciate his \nsense of humor. But in some ways you have to have a sense of humor to \nlook at the Freedom to Farm Act today. Freedom to Farm, in my view, is \nwhat is responsible in large measure for what has happened. It has \ndestroyed the safety net for our country's family farmers. Many of us \npredicted on the day that it passed that this would be what we would be \nfacing. In fact, going back to a quote I made the day that the bill \npassed, I said at the time: ``I think the Senate has made a very tragic \nmistake. This fight is not over. We will come back.''\n  Well, we are back. I wish we didn't have to be. But we are back. We \nare back because we have no choice now. The crisis is upon us. Some of \nus could have predicted it. The fact is that it has happened. Without \ndelving into all the reasons why it happened, at least right now, I \ndon't think with the figures I have just stated for the Record that \nanyone can deny that it is happening. What else can you say about a \nfamily farm that is experiencing poverty-level income? What else can \nyou say about an income overall in the economy, the farm economy, that \nhas projected a $172 billion debt, the highest since 1985? What else \ncan you say about just 2 years of lost income, now $5.2 billion?\n  Mr. President, there is no question we are in a crisis. The question \nis now, what do we do? Frankly, after a great\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\ndeal of debate internally, most of us have concluded that it isn't our \npurpose now to completely reopen the debate on the Freedom to Farm Act \nand revisit each and every one of the areas that we think need \nimprovement. That is something we will have to save for another time. \nWe are in a crisis. We are in an emergency. Because we are in an \nemergency, we don't have the luxury of saying let's just take our time, \ngo back and review everything, and rewrite everything that we believe \nmay be causing these problems. Rather, what we decided to do, Mr. \nPresident, is simply this:\n  First, let's offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that recognizes \nthe seriousness of the problem, and as clearly, and hopefully in a \nbipartisan manner, say: ``We want to respond. We hear you. We are \nempathetic. We agree the situation is very serious, and we are going to \nrespond.'' That is the purpose of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3127\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, and as a \ncosponsor of the resolution, I send it to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) for himself and \n     Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3127.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Findings:\n       In contrast to our Nation's generally strong economy, in a \n     number of States, agricultural producers and rural \n     communities are experiencing serious economic hardship;\n       Increased supplies of agricultural commodities in \n     combination with weakened demand have caused prices of \n     numerous farm commodities to decline dramatically;\n       Demand for imported agricultural commodities has fallen in \n     some regions of the world, due in part to world economic \n     conditions, and United States agricultural exports have \n     declined from their record level of $60 billion in 1996;\n       Prolonged periods of weather disasters and crop disease \n     have devastated agricultural producers in a number of States;\n       Thirty-two of the fifty States experienced declines in \n     personal farm income between 1996 and 1997;\n       June estimates by the Department of Agriculture indicate \n     that net farm income for 1998 will fall to $45.5 billion, \n     down 13 percent from the $52.2 billion for 1996;\n       Total farm debt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion, \n     the highest level since 1985;\n       Thousands of farm families are in danger of losing their \n     livelihood and life savings;\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that \n     emergency action by the President and Congress is necessary \n     to respond to the economic hardships facing agricultural \n     producers and their communities.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, many of our Republican colleagues have \nsaid that high prices and robust trade would keep the farm economy \nstrong. I agree. I don't think there is anyone who disagrees with that. \nHigh prices and robust trade go hand in glove. The problem is, we don't \nhave either. Prices across the board have plummeted to the lowest \nlevels they have been in more than a decade. Livestock prices and grain \nprices are at such a point that no one can survive today. No one can \nsurvive on prices that farmers are receiving at the local elevator--no \none. They are at the levels that farms received when the Presiding \nOfficer and I were born. The same levels that farmers were getting when \nwe were born are the prices farmers are getting today. Could we survive \non that kind of an income as Senators, as members of the Senate staff? \nCould anyone on Main Street survive on prices they were getting in \n1947, in my case? We know the answer to that.\n  This last week, an amendment was offered which was introduced by the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts, and our very \ndistinguished colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, exempting farm \nproducts from sanctions. We could have added a lot of things to that. \nBut the Senator from Kansas said--and I had a discussion, and we \nagreed--that it was better to get something done than to use it as a \nvehicle for more proposals that we wish could get done.\n  So on a bipartisan basis, I think unanimously--if not unanimously, \nalmost so--the Senate went on record in favor of lifting the \nagricultural sanctions that have existed now for some time.\n  The right thing to do--and I am very proud that on an overwhelming \nbasis we sent as clear a message on trade with that vote as we could. \nNow I hope we will send just as clear a message on domestic solutions. \nIf we can do it on trade, as the Senator from Kansas has noted, we \nought to do it on price. And while there is no question that trade can \nhave a positive effect on price, I think one would have to argue \nvociferously, and I don't think ever conclusively, that whatever \nchanges we make on price related to trade will not be short term. It \nwill be very, very difficult to see any short-term, immediate \nrepercussions based on trade, although for long-term purposes it is \nexactly what we need to do. We need to find ways to market our products \nabroad. We need to find ways to be competitive and to see that those \nmarkets open up. For us to shoot ourselves in the foot at the very time \nwhen farmers need those markets is the absolute worst thing we can do.\n  So, Mr. President, the trade piece is the right piece for the long \nterm. The problem is, we have short-term needs that will never be \naddressed by trade. So here we are, back to correct the failed policies \nthat have crippled rural America, back to recognize that we have to \ntake some actions on this particular bill.\n  The amendment that we now have before us recognizes the plight of the \nfamily farmer in America. It says that we are on your side, we \nunderstand your situation, and that we must act on a solution. That \nsolution will be the subject of additional amendments that we will lay \nout over the course of the next period of time. It will remove the cap \non marketing loans and extend the loan term. We require mandatory price \nreporting for livestock. We want to require labeling of imported meat. \nWe want to target emergency assistance for victims of multiple-year \ndisasters. The alternative is to do nothing. All Senators should ask, \nall Senators really need to ask is this: Would they accept a 30 percent \ncut in their income as thousands of farmers have? Do they want rural \nAmerica to survive? Do they value the whole societal fabric that family \nfarmers bring to rural America today?\n  We have to recognize and respond to this crisis and help farmers in \nrural communities, help at least in part by restoring a small segment \nof the agricultural safety net, create a more open and fair marketplace \nwhere a safety net isn't even necessary, and give farmers an \nopportunity to share in America's prosperity.\n  That is what we hope to do. We wish we could do it outside the \ncontext of an agriculture appropriations bill. That would be my choice. \nWe have been unable, at least to date, to get markups and votes in the \ncommittee, taking legislation from the Agriculture Committee to the \nSenate floor. And so our choice is left to this, to offer amendments on \nthe best second vehicle we could have. The agricultural appropriations \nbill is a bill that has to pass.\n  We will work with the distinguished manager, and there is no better, \nI might add, than the manager of this particular bill. We will work \nwith him to see that we have the opportunity to pass this legislation \nand do what we must to assure that farmers have the resources they \nneed. I cannot think of a more important issue than this. I cannot \nthink of a better time than this for us to respond.\n  I hope that on a bipartisan basis we will see fit to pass this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think it is a good idea that at the \nbeginning of this debate on agriculture appropriations we acknowledge \nthere are some serious problems in the agriculture sector of our \neconomy. There is no quarrel with that, and on both sides of the aisle \nI think Senators are prepared to acknowledge that we have an obligation \nto understand this fully and to do what we can within the constraints \nof the Budget Act and the constraints of the law. We appropriate funds \nto make sure that the Department of Agriculture has the resources to \ntake all appropriate action to help deal with these problems.\n  We realized when we began work on the agriculture appropriations bill \nthat we did not have enough money to do everything we would like to do \nfor\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nrural development, for nutrition assistance, for agriculture research, \nfor export promotion, and the wide range of activities that go into the \nprograms administered by the Department of Agriculture and the related \nagencies that are funded in this bill.\n  It is a bill that was fully supported by Members on both sides of our \nsubcommittee and in the full Committee on Appropriations. We didn't \nhave a dissenting vote anywhere along the way for the appropriations \nbill that we brought to the floor and that is pending before the Senate \nright now. We have tried to make sure that every possible effort is \nmade, as we deal with the question of how much money to put in one \naccount or the other, to do the best possible job that we could, and I \nthink this bill is going to pass that test.\n  We were glad to have the strong and helpful support of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, who is the senior \nDemocrat on the Appropriations subcommittee for the Department of \nAgriculture, and other Senators who worked with us as well. This sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution, if Senators will notice, outlines a number of \nthings that are suggested for changes in either current law or the \nefforts that the administration could take to help deal with this \nproblem which the distinguished Democratic leader outlined.\n\n  It may very well be that we can make some changes to this and have a \nbipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That would be my hope, and I \nsuggest to Senators that we make that effort.\n  Since we have just seen this proposed resolution, I am hopeful that \nwe can set it aside, take some time with those who are interested in \nhelping make sure that we do accurately state the problem and the \nobservations that the Senate has as a collective body of Republicans \nand Democrats in dealing with the problems, and can pass it without any \nobjection on either side. That would be my hope, and that is what I \nintend to suggest the Senate do.\n  We have some other amendments that we are going to have to offer. \nMany of these amendments are proposed by Senators who are not members \nof the Appropriations Committee, but we have now had an opportunity to \nreview them and we are prepared to recommend that a number of \namendments be accepted.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader indicated that he would have no \nobjection in setting aside this amendment if we wanted to go to other \namendments, and so at this point I am going to ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending sense-of-the-Senate resolution be set aside and I be \npermitted to send an amendment to the desk on the subject of crop \ninsurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3128\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Agricultural Research \n   Service, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension \n  Service, and the Rural Community Advancement Program; to amend the \n Federal Crop Insurance Protection Act by eliminating the surcharge on \n   the administrative fee for fiscal year 1999; and to restrict the \n Wetlands Reserve Program's new acreage enrollment in fiscal year 1999)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. \n     Bumpers, for himself and Mr. Cochran, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3128.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, line 17, strike ``$767,921,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$768,221,000''.\n       On page 13, line 11, strike ``$49,200,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$50,500,000''.\n       On page 14, line 17, strike ``$434,782,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$436,082,000''.\n       On page 35, line 7, strike ``$700,201,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$703,601,000''.\n       On page 36, line 14, after the ``systems'', insert ``: \n     Provided further, That of the total amount appropriated, \n     $2,800,000 shall be available for a community improvement \n     project in Arkansas''.\n       On page 64, line 18, strike ``140,000'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``120,000''.\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n       ``Sec. 739. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act may be used to require any \n     producer to pay an administrative fee for catastrophic risk \n     protection under section 508(b)(5)(A) of the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)(5)(A)) in an amount that is \n     greater than $50 per crop per county.''.\n       ``Sec. 740. Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted or \n     construed to alter the current implementation of the Wetlands \n     Reserve Program, unless expressly provided herein.''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the clerk \nwithhold reporting of the amendment. I have been advised, contrary to \nmy understanding with the Democratic leader, there are some Democrats \nwho could not agree that that amendment be set aside now. So I do not \ninsist that the amendment be reported. Let me state what this amendment \nwill do when it is offered.\n  This is an amendment that increases appropriations in the bill for \nthe Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation and Extension Service to fund additional agriculture research \nactivities.\n  It also increases the total appropriations for the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program and earmarks funding for a community improvement \nproject in Arkansas.\n  It also adds a general provision to the bill to eliminate for fiscal \nyear 1999 the surcharge on the administrative fee in excess of $50 per \ncrop per county authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Protection \nAct.\n  The proposed changes will also place some enrollment limitations on \nthe Wetlands Reserve Program. The amendment is designed to make \navailable to the Crop Insurance Program additional funds that were \ncontemplated by the agriculture research bill that was passed by the \nSenate and signed by the President earlier this year. It is that \nlegislation that we are suggesting be attached to this legislation to \nhelp carry out the provisions in the law that we now have had enacted \nas a result of the bipartisan effort in the Agriculture Committees of \nboth the Senate and the House.\n  It is that amendment that we would like to propose to the Senate \nwhile we work on reaching an accommodation with Senators on both sides \nof the aisle on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution with respect to the \nproblems in the agriculture sector of our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Mississippi is set aside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that the objection that we \npreviously heard had been raised to setting aside the pending sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution and sending an amendment to the desk has now been \nlifted, and that there is no objection to taking that action, as I had \nearlier been advised.\n  So, I send the amendment that I described on crop insurance to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nMississippi is now the pending question.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment increases appropriations \nin the bill for the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative \nState Research, Education, and Extension Service to fund additional \nagricultural research activities. Specifically, the amendment provides \nan additional $300,000 to increase scientific staffing at the Cropping \nSystems Center at the New England Plant, Soil, and Water Laboratory in \nOrono, Maine, to develop production and disease management systems. \nThis research will increase potato production efficiency, viability of \nsmall farms and enhance water quality in the Northeast Region.\n  It increases the total funding provided in the bill for special \nresearch\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\ngrants funded through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \nExtension Service by $1,300,000 to fund the following new research \ngrants at the levels specified:\n\nChesapeake Bay agroecology (Maryland)..........................$300,000\nDesigning Food for Health (Texas)..............................$250,000\nInfectious disease research (Colorado).........................$250,000\nScallops Research (Connecticut)................................$250,000\nUrban aquaculture (Massachusetts)..............................$250,000\n\n  The amendment also increases the appropriation for the Rural \nCommunity Advancement Program by $3,400,000 and earmarks funding for a \ncommunity improvement project in Eastern Arkansas.\n  Finally, the amendment adds a general provision to the bill to \neliminate for fiscal year 1999 the surcharge on the administrative fee \nin excess of $50 per crop per county authorized by the Federal Crop \nInsurance Protection Act.\n  The additional costs of the changes proposed by this amendment are \nfully offset by a further restriction on new acreage enrollments in the \nWetlands Reserve Program for fiscal year 1999. This proposed change \nwould place a 120,000 acre limitation on new acreage enrollments versus \nthe 140,000 limitation currently recommended in the bill.\n  I ask that this amendment be favorably considered by my colleagues.\n  Let me say by way of further explanation, in describing the \namendment, the reason we have to make this change in the Crop Insurance \nProgram is that we wanted to remove a 10-percent surcharge on the \nadministrative fee imposed by the Agriculture Research Extension and \nEducation Reform Act. That was the bill that we had earlier passed \nwhich provides a lot of new, mandated expenditures for agriculture \nresearch. This surcharge, that I have referred to, would require \nfarmers to pay as much as a 400-percent increase above the 1998 \nadministrative fee. This is not a minimal administrative fee as farmers \nhad been promised.\n  So this amendment will remove the surcharge, and that is the purpose \nof getting this amendment offered at this early stage in the bill, so \nthere will not be any question about whether or not there will be an \nopportunity for participation by farmers in the Crop Insurance Program \nbecause of these prohibitive costs. We think this is an important \nchange to be made in that law and will help provide the opportunity to \ndeal with disaster assistance under the Crop Insurance Program.\n  My understanding is that this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I will defer to my friend from Arkansas for any comments he \nwould like to make on this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. This amendment \nhas been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3128) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have a number of other amendments \nwhere we have worked to reach agreement and to recommend to the Senate \nthat amendments be approved.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3129\n\n  (Purpose: To make a technical correction in the amount provided for \n                        demonstration programs)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the first one that I suggest we consider \nis an amendment offered by Senator Bumpers and myself dealing with the \nRural Community Advancement Program. It is a technical correction. I \nsend that amendment to the desk and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 3129.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 35, line 25, strike ``$1,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$70,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment makes a technical \ncorrection to the bill to provide that not to exceed $70,000 of the \ntotal funds appropriated for the Rural Community Advancement Program be \navailable to subsidize the cost of funds provided for demonstration \nprograms.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nthere is no objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3129) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3130\n\n(Purpose: To transfer funding for credit sales of acquired property to \n         subsidize the cost of additional farm ownership loans)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk \noffered for myself and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. This \namendment will transfer funding for credit sales of acquired property \nto subsidize the cost of additional farm ownership loans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 3130.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 26, strike ``$488,872,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$510,649,000''.\n       On page 27, line 7, insert ``and'' before ``for''.\n       On page 27, lines 8 and 9, strike ``; and for credit sales \n     of acquired property, $25,000,000''.\n       On page 27, line 13, strike ``$16,320,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$19,580,000''.\n       On page 27, line 20, insert ``and'' before ``for''.\n       On page 27, lines 21 and 22, strike ``; and for credit \n     sales of acquired property, ``$3,260,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as I stated, is designed \nto eliminate the subsidy appropriation for Farm Service Agency credit \nsales of acquired property and transfer this amount to subsidize the \ncost of additional farm ownership direct loans.\n  The amendment increases the subsidy appropriation for farm ownership \ndirect loans by $3,260,000 to fund an additional $21,777,000 in loans. \nThis will fund an estimated total farm ownership direct loan level of \n$85,649,000 for fiscal year 1999 versus the $63,872,000 level now \nproposed by the bill.\n  I have been advised by the Department of Agriculture that the Farm \nService Agency credit sales loan obligations are currently lower than \nanticipated and the full amount requested for fiscal year 1999 will not \nbe required. Any funding needed for credit sales of acquired property \nfor fiscal year 1999 can be made available through the agency's loan \nprograms. Given this, the amendment proposes to move this money to \nincrease available funding for farm ownership direct loans.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3130) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Mr. President, the next amendment on my list that has \nbeen cleared is one by the Senator from Arkansas dealing with a pilot \npersonnel program. Does the Senator want to send that to the desk?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill continues the current hiring \nsystem being used within the Forest Service and the Agricultural \nResearch Service to examine for, and make, first permanent competitive \nFederal appointments. The hiring system will terminate on June 30, \n1998, unless it is extended.\n  Applicants and management officials have had an overwhelmingly \npositive response to the hiring system. Specifically, management \nbelieves the program has increased its control over hiring, resulting \nin a greater likelihood that the candidate pool is appropriate and \navailable, reducing the number of staff hours expended in testing, \nexamining and rating applicants.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has no objection to this \namendment. I think this has been cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed this amendment, and we \nhave cleared it on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The first sentence of section 509(f)(4)(A) of \n     the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1479(f)(4)(A)) is amended \n     by striking ``fiscal year 1998'' and inserting ``fiscal year \n     1999''.\n       (b) Section 515(b)(4) of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. \n     1485(b)(4)) is amended by striking ``September 30, 1998'' and \n     inserting ``September 30, 1999''.\n       (c) The first sentence of section 515(w)(1) of the Housing \n     Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1485(w)(1)) is amended by striking \n     ``fiscal year 1998'' and inserting ``fiscal year 1999''.\n       (d) Section 538 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. \n     1490p-2) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (t), by striking ``fiscal year 1998'' and \n     inserting ``fiscal year 1999''; and\n       (2) in subsection (u), by striking ``September 30, 1998'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 1999''.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment relating to \nrural housing programs of the Department of Agriculture. I express my \nsincere appreciation to Chairman Cochran and Ranking Minority Member \nBumpers for their consideration of the amendment which I offer with \nSenator Paul Sarbanes, Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. I commend them for their steadfast \ncommitment to providing affordable housing for rural Americans.\n  The Department of Agriculture operates a number of successful housing \nprograms under the auspices of its Rural Housing Service (RHS). Rural \nhousing programs, while a function of the Department of Agriculture, \nare under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. As Chairman of the \nBanking Committee, I respectfully request the adoption of this \namendment.\n  This amendment will permit vital housing programs to continue in an \nuninterrupted fashion. It includes one-year extensions of existing \nhousing programs. Specifically, the RHS Section 515 Rural Rental \nHousing Program, the RHS Section 538 Rural Rental Housing Loan \nGuarantee Program, and the RHS Underserved Areas Program would be \nextended until September 30, 1999. These short-term extensions are \nnecessary to ensure that needy Americans continue to be served.\n  There is a critical need for affordable housing in rural America. \nAccording to the 1990 census, over 2.7 million rural Americans live in \nsubstandard housing. In my home State of New York, 76 percent of \nrenters are paying 30 percent or more of their income for housing. \nApproximately 60 percent of New York renters pay over 50 percent of \ntheir income for rent.\n  The Rural Housing Service Section 515 and Section 538 programs \nrepresent a significant portion of the limited resources available to \nrespond to this serious unmet housing need. Since its inception in \n1962, the Section 515 rental loan program has financed the development \nof over 450,000 units of affordable housing in over 18,000 apartment \nprojects. The program assists elderly, disabled and low-income rural \nfamilies with an average income of $7,200. The Section 538 program is a \nrelatively new loan guarantee program which has proven to have \nwidespread national appeal. With a subsidy rate of approximately 3 \ncents per dollar, it is an example of cost-efficient leveraging of \npublic resources.\n  I thank the Appropriations Committee for its recognition of the great \nneed for these essential rural housing programs. I support immediate \nadoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment, \nalong with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, to extend rural housing \nprograms for the Rural Housing Service of the Department of \nAgriculture. I would like to commend the leadership of Chairman Cochran \nand Ranking Member Bumpers for their continued commitment to ensuring \nthat rural housing programs serve rural Americans with affordable, \ndecent housing choices.\n  This amendment would extend for one year several rural rental housing \nprograms. This includes the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, \nthe Section 538 Rural Rental Housing Loan Guarantee Program, and the \nUnderserved Areas Program. Because many families in rural America do \nnot have incomes high enough to make homeownership possible, it is \nimperative that Rural Housing Service be able to provide decent, \naffordable rental units. These programs are among the few resources \nthat help alleviate the shortage of affordable rental housing and \nenable very low and low income renters in rural America to access \naffordable rental housing.\n  The Section 515 Program has provided over 450,000 units of affordable \nrural housing since 1962; there is no other federal program that \nprovides this assistance to very low income renters in rural areas. The \nSection 538 Loan Guarantee Program is designed to meet the needs of low \nand moderate income rural Americans not being served by the Section 515 \nProgram. This program enables the federal government to partner with \ndevelopers and funders to generate needed rental housing in rural \nareas.\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n  Both the Section 515 and 538 Programs offer direct benefits for \ncommunities, including creating jobs and increasing local taxes, in \naddition to attracting and maintaining businesses. Stable rental \nhousing has been proven to be a vital link to the overall health and \nviability of rural communities. While the Rural Housing Service has \ndone much to bring affordable housing to rural America, many rural \nfamilies still experience housing overcrowding, substandard facilities, \ncost overburdens, and remain in desperate need of housing assistance. \nAs we encourage families to move from welfare to work, it is even more \nessential that we build on this vital housing program that provides the \nsafety net which will give the working poor an opportunity to live in \naffordable, safe and decent housing.\n  Again, I would like to commend Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member \nBumpers for their action to ensure that essential rural rental housing \nprograms receive authorization to continue serving low income families \nfor another year. I urge the swift adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside. We recommend that it be approved by the Senate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3132) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3133) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3134\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \nAgriculture should take certain actions to provide timely assistance to \n Texas agricultural producers that are experiencing worsening drought \n                              conditions)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, another amendment we have been able to \nreview and are prepared to recommend approval of is offered by the \nSenators from Texas, Senator Gramm and Senator Hutchison. On their \nbehalf, I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Gramm, \n     for himself, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3134.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR TEXAS \n                   AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the statewide economic impact of the drought on \n     agriculture in the State of Texas could be more than \n     $4,600,000,000 in losses, according to the Agricultural \n     Extension Service of the State;\n       (2) the direct loss of income to agricultural producers in \n     the State is $1,500,000,000;\n       (3) the National Weather Service has reported that all 10 \n     climatic regions in the State have received below-average \n     rainfall from March through May of 1998, a critical time in \n     the production of corn, cotton, sorghum, wheat, and forage;\n       (4) the total losses for cotton producers in the State have \n     already reached an estimated $500,000,000;\n       (5) nearly half of the rangeland in the State (as of May \n     31, 1998) was rated as poor or very poor as a result of the \n     lack of rain;\n       (6) the value of lost hay production in the State will \n     approach an estimated $175,000,000 statewide, leading to an \n     economic impact of $582,000,000;\n       (7) dryland fruit and vegetable production losses in East \n     Texas have already been estimated at $33,000,000;\n       (8) the early rains in many parts of the State produced a \n     large quantity of forage that is now extremely dry and a \n     dangerous source of fuel for wildfires; and\n       (9) the Forest Service of the State has indicated that over \n     half the State is in extreme or high danger of wildfires due \n     to the drought conditions.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary of Agriculture should--\n       (1) streamline the drought declaration process to provide \n     necessary relief to the State of Texas as quickly as is \n     practicable;\n       (2) ensure that local Farm Service Agency offices in the \n     State are equipped with full-time and emergency personnel in \n     drought-stricken areas to assist agricultural producers with \n     disaster loan applications;\n       (3) direct the Forest Service, and request the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, to assist the State in \n     prepositioning fire fighting equipment and other appropriate \n     resources in affected counties of the State;\n       (4) authorize haying and grazing on acreage in the State \n     that is enrolled in the conservation reserve program carried \n     out under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 \n     U.S.C. 3831); and\n       (5) convene experts within the Department of Agriculture to \n     develop and implement an emergency plan for the State to help \n     prevent wildfires and to overcome the economic impact of the \n     continuing drought by providing assistance from the \n     Department in a rapid and efficient manner for producers that \n     are suffering from drought conditions.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the situation \nin the State of Texas occasioned by the severe drought that has \noccurred there. The Senators from Texas are acquainting the Senate with \nthe problems that exist in Texas and making some observations about \nappropriate actions that could be taken to help relieve the problems.\n  It is very similar, as a matter of fact, to the sentiment contained \nin the earlier sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It probably could be \nincluded in our overall sense-of-the-Senate resolution on this subject \nwhen we get that worked out on both sides of the aisle. I am optimistic \nthat we can do so. But in the\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nmeantime, I think it is appropriate for us to go ahead and adopt this \namendment. We recommend that it be done.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The amendment has been cleared on this side of the \naisle, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3134) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the next item on my list for agreed \namendments is one by the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from \nArkansas dealing with Conservation Farm Options Program funding, if \nthat is ready.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, it is not quite ready yet. Hopefully, it \nwill be by the time we finish this package of amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3135\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Wetlands Reserve Program by exempting thirty \n      year easements from payment limitations; and clarifying the \ninterpretation of ``Maximum Extent Practicable'' regarding the Wetlands \n                    Reserve Program enrollment goal)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, next I have an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar, dealing with the Wetlands Reserve Program. \nI am prepared to send that to the desk at this time and ask that it be \nstated on behalf of the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3135.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following new sections:\n       ``Sec.  . Section 1237D(c)(1) of Subchapter C of the Food \n     Security Act of 1985 is amended by inserting after \n     ``perpetual'' the following ``or 30-year.''\n       ``Sec.  . Section 1237(b)(2) of Subchapter C of the Food \n     Security Act of 1985 is amended by adding the following: (C) \n     For purposes of subparagraph (A), to the maximum extent \n     practicable should be interpreted to mean that acceptance of \n     wetlands reserve program bids may be in proportion to \n     landowner interest expressed in program options.''\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nimprove the effectiveness of the Wetland Reserve Program, or WRP.\n  The WRP is a program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, \nor USDA, which purchases easements to restore and protect wetlands. \nThese easements are purchased from landowners on a willing-buyer and \nwilling-seller basis. Under current law, land going into the WRP is \nenrolled for different time periods based on one of three types of \ncontracts entered into between USDA and the landowner: (1) cost share \ncontracts (which enroll land for ten years), (2) 30 year easements, and \n(3) permanent easements. Landowners have expressed more interest in \nlonger term easements than in cost share contracts. However, current \nlaw requires USDA to enroll an equal proportion of each contract type \n(hence the so-called \\1/3\\, \\1/3\\, \\1/3\\ rule), regardless of landowner \ninterest. One part of the amendment which I am proposing would permit \nUSDA to deviate from the \\1/3\\, \\1/3\\, \\1/3\\ requirement based on \nlandowner interest. Landowners would retain the ability to choose among \npermanent, non-permanent and cost-share agreements.\n  Mr. President, the second part of my amendment would also amend the \nWRP. Under current law, landowners receive annual payments for land \nenrolled in the WRP, but, in the case of longer term easements, can \nelect to receive payments up-front in a lump sum. Annual payments, \nincluding those taken in a lump sum, are subject to a $50,000 per \nperson limitation. However, permanent easements are exempt from the \nlimitation. Exempting only permanent easements from the payment \nlimitation tends to discourage landowners from choosing 30 year \neasements. This amendment solves the inequity by broadening the \nexemption to include 30 year easements.\n  My amendment is strongly supported by the Audubon Society, Ducks \nUnlimited, and other conservation groups. It has been scored at no cost \nby the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The amendment makes common-\nsense improvements to an important program which protects our natural \nresources. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this does involve an effort by the \nSenator from Indiana to improve the effectiveness of the Wetland \nReserve Program. It has been reviewed, and we are prepared to recommend \nthat it be agreed to in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3135) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3136\n\n (Purpose: To make technical corrections to the Agricultural Research, \n              Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have another amendment offered by the \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, and cosponsored by others, dealing \nwith technical corrections to the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nEducation Reform Act. On behalf of Senator Lugar, I send that amendment \nto the desk and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] for Mr. Lugar, \n     for himself, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Collins, Mr. Harkin and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3136.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, \n                   EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM ACT OF 1998.\n\n       (a) Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research.--\n     Section 3(d)(3) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1642(d)(3)) (as \n     amended by section 253(b) of the Agricultural Research, \n     Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998) is amended by \n     striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``At the request of \n     the Governor of the State of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, \n     or Vermont, the Secretary''.\n       (b) Honey Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information.--\n     Section 7(e)(2) of the Honey Research, Promotion, and \n     Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 4606(e)(2)) (as amended by \n     section 605(f)(3) of the Agricultural Research, Extension, \n     and Education Reform Act of 1998) is amended by striking \n     ``$0.0075'' each place it appears and inserting ``$0.01''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take effect on the date of enactment of the Agricultural \n     Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to offer an amendment to make \na technical correction to recently passed bill. This noncontroversial \nlegislation serves to clarify two provisions of the Agricultural \nResearch, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. Senators \nSantorum, Collins, Harkin and Leahy are cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First, under the Forest and \nRangeland Renewable Resources Research program in the northeastern \nUnited States, the amendment adds a requirement that the Governor of \nthe State of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont make a request \nto the Secretary before any research is conducted under that particular \nprogram. Second, the assessment rate is amended from $0.0075 to $0.01 \nunder the Honey Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act.\n  Mr. President, both amendments make technical corrections. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed it. We think it ought to \nbe agreed to by the Senate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, it has been cleared on this side of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 3136) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Mr. President, another amendment we have been able to \nclear, I am advised, is offered by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb. \nOn his behalf, I send his amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Robb, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3137.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After line 23 on page 67, add the following new title:\n                               TITLE VIII\n\n     ``SEC. 1.

Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3137) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     orphan products research grant\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nCochran, in a brief colloquy regarding the ``Orphan Products Research \nGrant'' program. I am pleased to note that the bill before us which \nincludes funding for the Food and Drug Administration specifically \nmaintains the current level of funding for the operation and grants \nthat support research on rare conditions and diseases, the so-called \n``orphan products''. While I hasten to point out here, as in many other \ncases, continued level funding is a reduction in program effectiveness \nbecause underlying costs go up which result in fewer grants and less \nresearch efforts going into this effort to help what have to be some of \nthe most neglected and medically needy in our society who lack \neffective therapies.\n  Beyond the grant funding, I am seeking assurance that the Committee \nintends that the staffing and support functions of the FDA's orphan \nprogram are to be continued at not less than the current level of \nappropriated dollars and FTE's allocated to this most important mission \nand function. I understand that the FY98 resources are 17 FTEs and $1.8 \nmillion for operation costs for administering the Office for Orphan \nProducts Development. The total funding level is $11.542 million which \nincludes both grants and operation costs. The whole program is \nrelatively small, clearly within the core functions of the agency, and \nextraordinarily effective and productive. It certainly deserves to have \npriority on any future increased funds that become available. In the \nlast 15 years, this program has nurtured the development and marketing \nof more than 170 products, 21 of which have directly benefitted from \nits grant funding. It could easily get lost in the focus on many of the \nother big ticket, high visibility responsibilities of the FDA.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Illinois. As Senator Durbin \nknows, the committee has worked hard over the past several years to \nmaintain this very important program. This program may be the only hope \nfor cures for some with extremely rare diseases. It is important that \nFDA not divert these appropriated funds to other areas, thus \nundermining this worthwhile program. I thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor bringing this issue to our attention.\n\n\n                                  fda\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I would just like to commend the Senator from Mississippi \nfor his hard work and dedication on this bill, and would like to thank \nhim for his particular attention to FDA matters. It is important that \nthe regulatory programs be adequately funded, and of particular \nimportance to me and a number of my colleagues is the important \nregulatory program for cosmetics in the Office of Cosmetics and Color \nwithin the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. As the \nSenator from Mississippi knows too well, the FDA recently announced \ncutbacks in this program, and I just wanted to thank him for the report \nlanguage accompanying this bill and its encouragement for restoring \nthis program to previous years levels.\n  It is my understanding that our colleagues in the House have provided \na $2.5 million increase to restore this program to that level, and I \nwould hope that we can work to ensure that the final version of this \nbill contains that increase.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. We will do \neverything we can to make sure that the funding for this worthy program \nis adequately addressed.\n\n\n                       tomato spotted wilt virus\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \na very important issue, specifically my efforts to provide critical \nresearch funding for Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus. First, I would like to \nthank my distinguished colleagues, the Chairman, Senator Cochran, and \nRanking Member Senator Bumpers, for their skillful work and superb \nleadership on this bill. I, like many of my colleagues, find it \nextremely fortunate to have two gentlemen in these posts who not only \nprovide a valuable resource on matters facing agriculture, but can be \ndepended on to work with Senators with candor and cooperation. As you \nmay know, spotted wilt, caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), \nhas become a serious impediment to effective production of several \neconomically important crops in the Southeast, causing an estimated \n$100 million in losses to peanuts and vegetable crops annually. The \ndisease is endemic to the Southeast and the wide host range of the \nvirus\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\nmakes it extremely difficult to control. If you recall, in the letter \nwhich I sent to you earlier this year, I requested that $330,000 be \nappropriated to the College of Agriculture at the University of Georgia \nfor a project titled the Integrated Approach to Mitigate Tomato Spotted \nWilt Virus Epidemics in the Southeastern United States. Although \nfunding has not been provided in this bill, I understand that the House \nversion contains $200,000 for this project's research.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My colleague from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. While I would like to see funding \nfor this project included in the Senate bill, I understand the \ndifficulties that my colleagues are facing in trying to accommodate my \nrequest at this time and I defer to your advice on this matter and will \nnot offer an amendment to provide the funding. Given that my ultimate \ngoal is to ensure that adequate funding for this important project is \nobtained, I would truly appreciate my colleagues providing recognition \nof the seriousness of this problem as well as a commitment to work to \nobtain this funding in conference.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I share the Senator's concern about this matter and \nrecognize the serious nature of this disease. I also believe that it is \nimportant that we provide funding for this valuable project, and \nhopefully we will be able to accommodate the Senator from Georgia's \nrequest in conference.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I too appreciate the Senator bringing the critical \nnature of this issue to our attention. When we meet with the House \nConferees on this bill, we will give every consideration to provide \nfunding for this project.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank my esteemed colleagues for their assistance on \nthis matter and I feel confident that, with your commitments, this \ncritical funding will be provided. Considering the cost-benefit ratio \nof this research as well as our desire to maintain the superiority of \nAmerican food quality and abundance, I believe that such funding is \nwell justified and in the national interest.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3127\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on amendment 3127.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, a parliamentary inquiry. I guess we \nhave before us now the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that was proposed \na little while ago by the minority leader, Senator Daschle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the pending matter before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of my colleagues from the Midwest \nand the Northern Plains States who are here on the floor. I think we \nhave to really lay out for the American people what is happening in \nrural America today.\n  We can close our eyes to it. We can try to ignore what is going on, \nbut the fact is, there is a crisis of immense proportions happening all \nover rural America.\n  In our sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we pointed out that net farm \nincome for 1998 is projected to fall to $45.5 billion. That is down 13 \npercent from 1996. Now, with farm income going down 13 percent--I asked \nmy staff to check and see what Wall Street did last year. The S 500 \nindex went up 36 percent last year; farm receipts down 13 percent.\n  Farm debt for this year is expected to be $172 billion, the highest \nlevel since 1985. So what we say in our sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nis:\n\n       . . . emergency action by the President and Congress is \n     necessary to respond to the economic hardships facing \n     agricultural producers and their communities.\n\n  Very simple. Very straightforward. It is an emergency situation and \nrequires emergency action.\n  Mr. President, this chart really says it all, what happened to farm \nincome between 1996 and 1997. Let us see, 32 States had a drop in net \nfarm income--32 out of 50. Now, some of them, you might see, had a big \nincrease. Oklahoma was up 94 percent and Kansas 28 percent and Wyoming \n73 percent. That was simply because of the devastating drought they had \nin 1996, and their wheat crop recovered in 1997, and it looks better. \nBut the prices there--and I will get to that in a moment--are still \ncatastrophic for the wheat farmers all up and down the wheat belt.\n  But look at the other States: Minnesota, down 38 percent; North \nDakota, down 98 percent, a 98-percent drop in farm income in the last \nyear; New York State, 44 percent; Pennsylvania a 32-percent decrease in \nfarm income.\n  Wall Street is doing great. Standard & Poor's is up--what did I \nsay?--36 percent. Yet the ag economy in New York State went down 44 \npercent. That is the story across America. That is why we have a \ncrisis.\n  Look at prices here, and you will find something, Mr. President, very \ninteresting about these charts I am about to show. Here is the farm \nlevel corn price. We were coming up here in the early 1990s, and we had \na steady increase, a little drop, but kept coming up. Right here is the \nFreedom to Farm bill, and, bang, down it goes. That is corn. Is that an \nanomaly? Let's look at wheat prices. We were bouncing around, but we \nhad steady progression up all the time. We enacted Freedom to Farm, and \ndown it comes. Wheat prices have been coming down ever since Freedom to \nFarm was passed. So that is corn and that is wheat.\n\n  Farm-level soybeans. Soybeans were coming up gradually, getting \nbetter, and we get here to Freedom to Farm, and down it comes. All of \nthose crops, ever since Freedom to Farm, down they come.\n  Here is the other interesting thing. We can look at the corn and the \nwheat and the soybean prices. But let's look at the farm share of what \nis happening to how much farmers are getting from their products that \nare sold in grocery stores.\n  Right now, the farm share of the pork dollar is at the lowest point \nit has been in over 2 decades--in over 20 years. Iowa hog farmers, and \nhog farmers around America, are getting the lowest share of the retail \ndollar. So if prices have been declining, as I pointed out here for \nsoybeans and for corn and for wheat, how come we haven't seen the price \ndropping at the grocery stores? Not a bit. Prices continue to go up, \nand yet the share of that dollar for our farmers keeps going down. That \none is pork.\n  Let's take a look at beef. Here is the retail share of beef, which \nhas been coming down all the time. It keeps coming down. Maybe it is \nnot quite as bad as pork, but it is still pretty bad. So farmers get \nless and less.\n  Now, I noted that in the Washington Post this morning there was a \nstory about our plans to do something to help the farm crisis in \nAmerica. It said here, ``While Democrats in both chambers want to help \nfarmers by revamping domestic farm supports, Republicans say aid will \ncome from more aggressive pursuit of exports.''\n  Interesting. We are going to solve it all by exporting more. Well, \nlet's look at two charts here. I heard a lot of talk about getting rid \nof sanctions. We are all for getting rid of sanctions. Here is a chart \nthat shows how much agriculture is being affected in terms of sanctions \nand how much it is being affected by the fact that IMF is not being \nreplenished, so they can continue to straighten out the economies in \nAsia. Trade sanctions reduce U.S. exports by about 1 percent of the \ntotal. That is the USDA estimate. Here is IMF-affected trade coming in \nat about $35 billion because of the lack of funding for IMF. Who is \nholding up the funding for IMF? The leadership in the House and the \nleadership in the Senate.\n  We will hear a lot of talk about sanctions. But if you really want to \nget at what is affecting our farm exports, it is the lack of funding \nand replenishment for IMF. But, Mr. President, is it really exports \nthat are going to solve our problem? Here is U.S. exports on this chart \ngoing clear back to 1960--what we see here, hitting 1970 and in the \n1970s and then the 1980s. We had a dip in 1985 because of the farm \ncrisis, and then up and up and up. Look at the increase in U.S. \nagricultural exports. It is down a little bit now from its peak a \ncouple years ago, down 7 percent. But it is still a huge increase over \nwhat we have had in the past. That is not the total answer to our \nproblems.\n  Yes, we need to replenish IMF; yes, we need to continue our strong \nsupport for exports. But that won't solve the\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\nproblem. The problem is that we have pulled the safety net out from \nunderneath the farmers in this country when we passed Freedom to Farm a \ncouple of years ago--the so-called ``Freedom to Farm.'' I called it at \nthat time the ``freedom to go broke'' bill, talking about our family \nfarmers.\n  Now, some say, well, what we have to do is, we have to get EEP in \nthere and we have to do more to get our exports going overseas. But the \nfact is, that would put more money in the pockets of the grain traders \nand importing companies and not the farmers we all represent. Some \ncommodity groups want to spend several hundred million dollars on the \nExport Enhancement Program and other export programs. But who is it \ngoing to help? That money will go right into the pockets of the \nexporters, the big grain companies, and the importing countries. It is \nnot going to go to the farmers.\n\n  I call that the sparrow feeding the horse kind of analogy. If you \nwant to feed the horse, you feed the sparrow. Then the sparrow drops \nsomething on the ground; that fertilizes the grass; the grass grows, \nand the horse eats it. That is a crazy system. If you want to get money \nto farmers, then what we have to do is, we have to put in some supports \nand put that safety net back in there.\n  A 1994 General Accounting Office study found that direct payments to \nproducers increased net income of farmers much more effectively than an \nequivalent level of indirect support through subsidies granted under \nthe export subsidy program.\n  GAO. Direct payment of producers gets their net income up more \neffectively than putting that money into EEP.\n  Again, a lot of farmers were told that we had to pass this so-called \nFreedom to Farm because it gave them flexibility. We were all for \nflexibility. We had that before under the Carter administration. We had \nthe whole farm base at that time. We all wanted to give farmers more \nflexibility for the whole farm and let them make the decisions. But we \nwanted to keep a safety net there.\n  This so-called Freedom to Farm is fine when prices are high, fine \nwhen you have the big payments going out to farmers in the initial 1 or \n2 years. But when disasters come, as they will in agriculture, as they \nhave since biblical times, when the prices go down, then what happens \nis, our family farmers are squeezed out.\n  It almost seems like the so-called Freedom to Farm bill really was \ndesigned with only the largest producers in mind. Why do I say that? \nBecause when you get a downturn, when you have low prices, the big, \nwell-financed producers can weather it. They can get through 1 or 2 or \n3 years of low prices. But for that smaller family farmer out there, \nthey can't do it. That is why you are now going to see farm \nbankruptcies again, as high as they were during the 1980s.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for the sake of other colleagues, I \nbelieve many will support our efforts on the floor this week because \nthey know how important agriculture is. But when the Senator makes the \npoint about what is going to happen to family farmers, as opposed to \nlarge conglomerates able to weather this crisis, I wonder if the \nSenator might want to explain to people who feel strongly about it why, \nfrom the point of view of consumers, it is important that the family \nfarmers be able to stay on the land. Maybe some people will hear you \ntalk and they might say, well, OK, so the giants can stay on, they will \nfarm the lands, and what difference does it make to the vast majority \nof the people in the country? I wonder if the Senator can spell that \nout.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend, because we hear a lot about that: \n``Wouldn't it be better to have a few large farmers out there rather \nthan all these family farmers?'' There are a lot of ways to answer that \nquestion.\n  First, a strong, healthy rural America is better in terms of the \nimpact of unemployment in our cities, where people from farms are \nforced off, they come into the cities. It causes more urban congestion \nand all of the expenses that causes for people who live in our larger \ncities. You can look at it that way.\n  Secondly, you can look at it from the standpoint of a stable, safe \nfood supply. Why do I say that? Because it has been my experience that \na family farmer who lives on that land, owns that land, and the \nchildren are raised there, and they go to the local schools, and they \nhave a stake in their community--they are some of the best stewards we \nhave for our land. So if you want to take care of the land for future \ngenerations and you want to protect the soil and the water, it is \nbetter to have a family farm system of agriculture than these big \ncorporate conglomerates that maybe just hire someone or rent it out.\n  It is like in housing. If you want people to take care of their \nhouses, make them homeowners. That is why I have always been in favor \nof housing subsidies and getting more housing for low-income people. \nThey will take care of it. They have a stake in it. They have equity in \nit. That is true with our family farmers, too. As long as they own the \nland and work it and have their families there, they have a stake in \nit.\n  Lastly, just from the standpoint of price, if you have more farmers \nout there producing more beef, pork, poultry, corn, wheat, and beans, \nyou are going to have a more competitive situation out there. As we all \nknow, competition gives you the best price.\n  I never could understand people who believe in a free enterprise \nsystem and who believe in this concept of competition and giving us the \nbest products at the lowest possible price, then supporting policies \nthat do just the opposite in agriculture and squeeze them out by \nsetting up a few large, vertically integrated entities that have \neverything from the production of the grain, to the feeding of the \nlivestock, to the slaughtering of the livestock, to the packaging, \nright to the time it gets to your counter. I can't understand people \nwho think that somehow these kinds of monopolistic prices are going to \nbe the best deal for our consumers. They just aren't. We know it, and \nwe can prove it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have one more question for my \ncolleague from Iowa. We have colleagues here on the floor from North \nDakota and South Dakota. You talk about the Freedom to Farm bill and \nthe whole question of the price plummeting and the dramatic loss of \nfarm income in a State like Minnesota where we are really hurting. \nLater on I will get a chance to speak to that. The Senator mentioned \nthat income in North Dakota dropped by 98 percent.\n  Could my colleague from Iowa explain, A, why the price has plummeted; \nand, B, when we talk about a fair price, what we are really saying \nhere? Because I think people need to understand how centrally important \nthe price is to this whole question. Would the colleagues from North \nDakota and South Dakota also be willing to comment on this?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am going to ask that same question of our colleague \nfrom North Dakota, because I believe he can answer it better.\n  I just wanted to point out that last year the average North Dakota \nwheat farmer suffered a loss of $23,000. My figures show, at least \nright now, that the income of the North Dakota farmer--I could be \ncorrected by my colleague from North Dakota--this year their income \nwill be, for a family of four, below the poverty level. Their income \nactually will be below what we have designated as the poverty level in \nthis country.\n  So I guess the question of the Senator from Minnesota was, What has \nbrought this about? Was that the question? Why has North Dakota, now, I \nthink for 2 consecutive years of low wheat and barley prices--what has \nbrought this about? I ask the same question of my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The price, and also, why is the price so important to \nwhether or not family farmers will be able to continue to farm, and \nwhat is the central importance of that to our statement?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to ask that question of my colleague from \nNorth Dakota and ask him to respond to that question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond to the inquiry of the \nSenator from Iowa, who has used the floor to describe his sense of the \nSenate resolution.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nThe problem in North Dakota has been that family farmers lost 98 \npercent of their income last year as compared to 1996. They planted a \ncrop and they discovered that the crop was devastated by disease. The \nworst crop disease in this century has hit our part of the country. It \nhas also touched Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota, and some other \nareas, but none quite as devastating as in North Dakota.\n  So a farmer plants a crop and hopes it grows. When it grows he hopes \nit avoids the insects, avoids the drought, avoids too much water, and \navoids disease. Unfortunately, our crop didn't, it was devastated by \ndisease. Then the farmer harvests those crops, or is what left of them.\n\n  That is not easy. I have been out on harvests plenty of times in my \nlife. It is tough work. The farmer drives his truck into town and pulls \nit up to the county elevator and unloads that grain. The harvest in \nthat truck box has all of your hopes and dreams for an entire year. \nThat harvest in the truck box determines whether you are going to be \nable to feed your family, whether you are going to continue farming, \nand whether you are going to be able to pursue your hopes and dreams on \nthe farm. That is what is in that truck box.\n  Then they unload that truck, and they put that durum, or the wheat or \nthe barley, into that country grain elevator, and it is weighed, \nevaluated. And the elevator operator says, ``Well, Mr. Farmer, Mrs. \nFarmer, we have decided that your grain is worth $2.75 a bushel.'' You \ndidn't get much for it because you had a lot of disease. But what you \ngot is worth $2.75 a bushel. The farmer looks at the price and says, \n``Well, the problem is it cost me $5 a bushel to raise that grain.''\n  That is in short exactly what has been happening in our State. It has \nbeen devastated by disease and low prices.\n  Think of it this way: Ask any group of families living on any block \nof this country, any group of businesses on any Main Street of America, \nfor that matter any legislators who are standing visiting in a circle. \nAsk them about what they would do if they were losing 98 percent of \ntheir income. Ask the folks on the block, the folks on Main Street, the \nlegislators, anyone, how would you like to lose 98 percent of your \nincome? Then ask yourself: How am I going to provide for my family? How \nam I going to meet the future and continue to farm?\n  That is what has happened to our family farmers. I will read some \nletters. I will not do it at the moment, but I will read some letters \nof some farm families in North Dakota who were forced to sell out this \nyear. They say, ``Well, we are good farmers. We don't spend money \nfrivolously. We are not going out at night. We work. We work to the \nbone, and we try. We try hard. And the fact is we are going broke. Yet, \neverybody else dealing with this grain that we produce is making \nmoney.''\n  The people who haul it, the railroads, have record profits. The \npeople who put it in the mill have record profits. The people who make \nit into breakfast cereal have record profits. Take some wheat, puff it \nup, call it ``Puffed Wheat,'' put it on the grocery shelf, charge $4 or \n$5 for it, or put it in bread. The farmer gets less than the heel.\n  Farm prices have collapsed. Have bread prices come down? I don't \nthink so. Have cereal prices come down? I don't think so. Yet everybody \nin the process, except the people who grow the food, is making money.\n  There is one final point I want to make. I was on the floor of the \nSenate yesterday pointing out that half way around this globe of ours \nthere are people climbing trees for food. Old women are climbing trees \nin Sudan to forage leaves to eat. They are eating leaves from trees \nbecause they are dying of hunger. Over 1 million people are at threat \nof starvation in Sudan.\n  The people on this side of the world are told, yes, there are 1 \nmillion people facing starvation. They are eating leaves off trees. But \nthe food you raise on the family farms somehow doesn't have worth. It \ndoesn't have value. That is a terrible, terrible disconnection of what \nwe ought to be doing.\n  So the answer to the question of the Senator from Iowa is that our \nfarmers have been devastated more than in any other State largely \nbecause we have been hit harder by disease. But all farmers trying to \nmarket wheat at this point are discovering that the price of wheat has \ncollapsed.\n  Today the price is $2.99 a bushel at one of our local elevators in \nNorth Dakota. It was $5.75 just 2 years ago. The price today is what it \nwas decades ago when the price of all the inputs was much, much less. \nAt today's prices, farmers are losing over $2.00 per bushel.\n  So the question facing us is whether we are going to do something \nthat gives family farmers an opportunity to make a living. Does family \nfarming have value to our society? I believe it is more than just \ndollars and cents. If you believe as I do that it is important, then \nthe question becomes what is the solution. What kinds of solutions and \nwhat menu of choices can we select that will say to family farmers, \n``You are not alone? When you hit price valleys, we will try to build \nbridges across those valleys because we want you in our future.''\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for asking the question. \nI thank my colleagues for their indulgence so that I could answer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to finish a few remarks, and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  Is that the desire of the Senator from South Dakota?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have a question that I would like to \nask of the Senator from Iowa at some point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his extraordinary \nleadership under these very trying circumstances.\n  One of the points that the Senator was making earlier struck me as \nparticularly important in terms of the long-term future of rural \nAmerica and the long-term capability of our Nation to feed not only our \ncitizens but also much of the rest of the world. The Senator from Iowa \nwas talking about what kind of structure we would have in rural America \nif we go particularly down the road of more and more concentration and \nvertical integration. It struck me that there may be other societies \nthat have gone down that road from whom we can learn a lesson or two.\n  I am reminded of the agricultural regime in the former Soviet Union \nand their efforts to turn agricultural workers into paid employees \nrather than people who have a personal family stake in the outcome of \ntheir agricultural enterprise, and what that led to in terms of taking \na nation with enormous natural resources, that had historically been \none of the bread baskets of the world and what that did to that nation \nin terms of destroying its infrastructure of small rural communities, \nwhat it did ultimately to destroy its ability to produce food shipments \nfor itself and for its neighbors.\n\n  I would wonder and question the Senator from Iowa whether he thinks \nthere are some lessons to be learned from other societies that have \ndestroyed family agriculture, then discovered it was a mistake, then \ndiscovered that turning family agriculture up by the roots is not so \neasily replanted and what happens after you have gone down that road, \nif you decide that you want to reestablish family agriculture after you \nhave ripped it up by the roots in that manner? I wonder if the Senator \nwill comment about the long-term structure that we are headed to if we \ncontinue down this road.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from South Dakota has put his finger on it. I \nvisited the old Soviet Union on a couple of occasions before it \ndisintegrated, went out and visited some of these big farms, some of \nthe most inefficient, awful operations you have ever seen, and then I \nvisited later just when they were breaking up the large farms. What I \nheard time and time again was that was probably one of the biggest \nmistakes they ever made in the Soviet Union--collectivizing the farms. \nAnd now in Russia, what they have decided--and I have met on more than \none occasion with a couple of their agriculture ministers--is the best \nthing to do is return the land to the people, give them private \nownership of that land and to disburse it as much as possible.\n  What they have found, lo and behold, is they are getting better \nproducts and better production for their people. Right on target. And \nyet we seem to be going in the other direction. We seem to be doing \nwhat the Soviet Union did. Now, it is not State collectivization,\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nbut it is monopoly practices. That is the same kind of vertical \nintegration.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator agree that while the track that we are \non may not be as a consequence of a specific plan simply on the part of \nthe Government or anyone else, but that any sector of the economy that \nis expected to generate profits based on prices that were consistent \nwith 1940, as we are in the grain and livestock sector today, and yet \nto pay the input costs that reflect 1998 costs will lead ultimately, as \ncertainly as night follows day, to the demise of that enterprise, that \nfamily agriculture capitalized in a modest way as it is cannot possibly \nsustain itself with the combination of these tragically low prices and \nthe extraordinary high input prices?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator knows about what I am about to say because I \nknow he has been through this, and that is what I think a lot of \nconsumers and what a lot of people have to understand about farming in \nAmerica and about our family farms. Farmers are price takers. In other \nwords, a farmer has a lot of fixed costs over which that farmer has no \ncontrol--land, seed, fertilizer, chemicals. The farmer who goes down to \nget his seed can't say, well, my prices went down last year. I will buy \nthat, but I can give you 10 percent less. The farmer has zero \nbargaining power. He pays the freight. Whatever it is, that is what he \nhas to pay. So the only way for that farmer to make anything is through \nthe price that the farmer receives, price plus his production. Now, if \nthe price is so low, no matter what he produces, he can't produce \nhimself out of the hole.\n  That is another little anomaly that I have thought about in all my \nyears here and working in agriculture on the agriculture committees. \nPeople say, well, if prices drop--see if this doesn't ring true with my \nfriend from South Dakota. A lot of ideologues say, well, if prices \ndrop, farmers will take that signal and they will plant less. But we \nknow what happens when a farmer has a fixed unit of land and he has his \nfixed machinery and prices drop. They say, how can I get more \nproduction out of that unit of land to cover the lower prices? And so \nwhat happens is you get a drop in the prices. Farmers plant more \nbecause they have a fixed amount of land. They want to squeeze more \nproduction out of it.\n\n  That has happened time after time after time in American agriculture. \nYet some people do not seem to understand that.\n  So they have to have the price plus production or they are going to \ngo broke, and that is what is happening today. I believe it was \nattributed to former President Kennedy--I can't be certain about this. \nBut I think former President John Kennedy once said that a farmer is \nthe only man in America who buys at retail, sells at wholesale and pays \nthe freight both ways.\n  That is very true today. That is why we are having this crisis in \nAmerica.\n  Now, again, I am all for farm flexibility and giving farmers the \nmaximum flexibility. But we have to have a safety net in there because \nit is as true today as it was in biblical times. I guess we just never \nseem to learn it. I have here a letter that was sent to a number of us \nfrom Mr. Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the board of Archer Daniels \nMidland Company. I found this to be a fascinating letter.\n  Now, obviously, Andreas heads a large agribusiness that takes the raw \nfood shipments and processes them and makes them into articles that we \nsee sold all over the world. I am sure we have seen his ads on Sunday \n``Meet The Press,'' ADM, which is the supermarket to the world. We have \nall seen that and they do a good job. So here is an individual, the \nhead of a large company that buys the raw products, processes them, \nturns them into something that is sold in supermarkets in places around \nthe world. Interesting. He sends a letter dated June 18. He said:\n\n       I feel the urge to say something about present farm policy. \n     I could write pages about why support prices are necessary to \n     protect farmers from the excesses of speculators.\n       It was a bad idea to remove all the support prices from \n     under farm commodities and if left alone it will lead to \n     disaster. The side effect of a drop in farm income affects \n     all U.S. businesses and can be devastating. Only those of us \n     with long-term memory seem to be aware of that. The country \n     shouldn't have to learn it all over again. Although, of \n     course, it is legendary that people in my line of business \n     can benefit from free falling farm prices by buying bargains, \n     I feel that stabilized agriculture is extremely important for \n     America and for the world.\n       I hope you will work to restore some form of price support \n     to protect farmers from disaster. Subsequent events prove it \n     has to be corrected, not just for the benefit of farmers, but \n     to stabilize the economy of our Nation. People seem to ignore \n     the fact that no genuine free market is left in this world. \n     Governments everywhere manage farm prices and the U.S. will \n     have to follow suit or face disaster.\n\n  I find that interesting, coming from the head of perhaps one of the \nlargest manufacturers of agricultural products. As he said, it is \nlegendary that it would be in his best interest to have low farm \nprices. But I think what we have seen from Andreas is the statement of \na statesman and someone who understands what it means for our entire \neconomy and for our Government and, indeed, for hungry people around \nthe world to make sure that our farmers have a decent price. So I \napplaud Andreas for making that statement and taking the position he \nhas taken, which probably is in direct conflict with his economic best \ninterests.\n  Why I remembered that letter is he said those of us with memory long \nenough. And I have said it time and time again. It started in biblical \ntimes with Pharaoh's dream, and he asked Joseph to interpret the dream. \nAnd Joseph said what it means is during good times you store up the \ngrain so you have it during bad times, 7 years of plenty and 7 years of \nfamine. Through the ages, governments everywhere have learned and \nrelearned that lesson. And yet for some reason, under the Freedom to \nFarm, so-called Freedom to Farm bill that we passed here a couple of \nyears ago we said that is all over. Evidently, farmers are going to \nhave high prices from now on. Well, they have short memories, and they \nprobably haven't been reading the Bible either because if they had they \nwould know that this has plagued us for thousands of years.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator agree that one of the things this \ninstitution needs to do is step back and recover its institutional \nmemory, its recognition of why we arrived at the price support system \nin the first place, going back as long ago as the 1930s and the \nagricultural stabilization service? There was a recognized need then, \ngenerations ago.\n  Family agriculture, it would seem to me, cannot sustain itself \nwithout some stabilizing force. Otherwise, they simply will not be \ncapitalized well enough. They will be driven off the land, just as what \nwas happening at that time, and we need that kind of a presence not to \nmicromanage, not to deny the flexibility that our farmers need to meet \nthe forces in the market, but that they need an opportunity to compete \nfairly with a more stable kind of environment. We, in fact, are losing \nsight of that--assuming that the $6 wheat when Freedom to Farm was \npassed would be here forever, that the $5 corn when Freedom to Farm was \npassed would be here forever--and we find it out only a few years \nlater, conveniently after the next elections, when prices have \ndeclined.\n  Does the Senator concur that a handful of years of declining \ntransition payments, a pat on the back and a ``good luck, buddy,'' is \nnot a reasoned, long-term strategy for family agriculture and the \nprovision of food in this Nation, and now that there is great urgency, \nwe need to step back and accept that that was misguided? We do not need \nmicromanagement, we do not need bureaucracy-laden policies, but we do \nneed something that will provide the kind of stability that, as long as \n60 years ago, was recognized as necessary when, if anything, we are in \na more volatile world market situation now than we were then? Does the \nSenator concur with those observations?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right on the mark again. I said a couple \nof years ago, when that so-called Freedom to Farm bill passed, it was a \ntriumph of ideology over experience--the experience of thousands of \nyears; the experience we have had in our own country since the 1930s. \nYet there was this ideology that said, no, we have to get the \nGovernment out of everything; no price supports.\n  But I submit to my friend from South Dakota that the so-called \nFreedom to Farm bill probably is working just as it was intended. \nDuring high-price years, like we had when the Freedom to Farm passed, \nit offers large-\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nscale farmers the ability to take advantage of opportunities that they \nmight see in the marketplace. Now, does it help the smaller farmers a \nlittle bit? Sure, but only because those payments were high in the \nfirst years. As the Senator pointed out, those initial payments are \ncoming down, so the large-scale farmer, better able to weather 1 or 2 \nor 3 years of low prices, is left to sail on through. The smaller \nfarmer is left to go broke, and that is what Freedom to Farm was \nintended to do. I swear, the idea was to get fewer farmers out there, \nto structure it differently.\n  I am going to yield the floor momentarily, but I have to tell my \nfriend a story that happened to me back in David Stockman's time. We \nalways remember David Stockman first as the head of OMB under President \nReagan.\n  I remember having a meeting with him at that time, talking about farm \nbills, and they were after agriculture. I used to have debates with \nDavid Stockman on the floor of the House on agriculture. He was always \nfor this so-called getting the Government out of agriculture and \neverything. I remember, he sat at a table one time, and he said to me \nat the time, I think I was a Congressman then, he said, ``Congressman \nHarkin, you know as well as I do, if you have two farmers out there and \nthey both have such-and-such land, they both have two tractors, they \nboth have two combines, they both have two barns, they both have two \nthis and that,'' he said, ``you know as well as I do, one farmer could \ndo it all.''\n  I said, ``Really? One farmer can do it all? Is that right? How so? \nHow can one farmer?''\n  ``Well, one farmer can buy out the other farmer and get all that \nmachinery and get bigger equipment and hire someone to work for him and \nget it all done.''\n  I said, ``How is that one farmer going to buy out the other farmer? \nIf you have those two farms, what is going to cause one of the farms to \ngo under?''\n  ``Well, recurring low prices.''\n  We talked. I will give him one benefit, he was honest about it. He \nsaid, ``With these recurring low prices, the little farmer will have to \nget out. The bigger farmer will buy him up.'' And his point was it \nwould be more efficient to do it that way, more efficient.\n  I said, ``How do you measure efficiency? How do you measure \nefficiency? Do you measure it in terms of the local businesses that now \nwill go under in the local community because that farmer has gone out \nof business? Do you measure it in the local education system, where now \nkids have to go 30, 40 miles a day to go to school, and they have a \nhard time getting teachers to teach in these rural areas? Do you \nmeasure efficiency in terms of the lost production? If you had two \ntractors before and you only have one now, what does that mean in \nDetroit and places like that where people are working in \nmanufacturing?''\n\n  So I always challenged him to define efficiency, not just by looking \nat the individual farm itself, but looking at the community at large; \nwhat was more efficient? I had always believed, and I do today believe \nthat the most efficient, in terms of our Nation, in terms of our \ncountry, in terms of our consumers--the most efficient form of \nagriculture is one that is diverse, dispersed, and one that encompasses \nmany family farmers owning their land and working their own land. I \nhave maintained that for the last 25 years and I maintain it today. I \nthink a lot of the problems we are having today have to do with the \ncrisis we had in the 1980s that kicked a lot of farmers off their land, \nand we are having the same crisis today up in the northern plains area.\n  As I said, those who want to stick with that so-called Freedom to \nFarm--I suppose maybe they have the votes. I don't know. But we are \ngoing to have some amendments on this floor today and tomorrow, as long \nas we have to take, on this ag appropriations bill, to get some changes \nmade to put that safety net back under our family farmers and to \nprovide them with the support they need during these tough times. We \ncan do nothing less, not just for them, but for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senators from South Dakota and Minnesota who were \nhere. We have offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the question \nof the farm crisis and will get a vote on that at some point. The \nSenator from Iowa indicated other amendments will be offered. Let me \njust provide a bit more context for some of this.\n  I know a lot of folks in this country don't live on a farm, have \nnever been on a farm, and don't know much about family farming. Perhaps \nthey wonder why is there so much discussion about family farming. Why \ndoes it matter?\n  I come from a small community of 300 people in southwestern North \nDakota, which is where we raise a lot of wheat and livestock. I suppose \none can look at those parts of the country where there are not many \npeople who live in the area and say that is not a big population center \nand it doesn't matter much. But it is where we produce our food, by and \nlarge, in this country.\n  When you get on an airplane and fly across the States at night, you \nlook out the window. I am sure as the Senator from Iowa flies across \nthe State of Iowa, just as I fly across North Dakota, he sees these \nyard lights out there at night. Take a look at them. See these \nbrilliant little lights from the prairie that sparkle up to your \nairplane window and understand what is there. Underneath that light is \na family out there. They have turned the yard light on, on the family \nfarm. That is where they are trying to make a living. All those yard \nlights out there on the family farms represent the economic blood \nvessels that represent the rural lifestyle that allow these small towns \nto flourish and to live. That is where I grew up.\n  I am a Jeffersonian Democrat. I believe, as Thomas Jefferson did, \nthat this country will survive as a free country with the kind of \npolitical freedoms that our Constitution guarantees us so long as we \nalso have economic freedom. Economic freedom and political freedom go \nhand in hand. And economic freedom is nurtured and guaranteed by broad-\nbased economic ownership in our country.\n  Jefferson believed in broad-based economic ownership. Small \nbusinesses and family farms dotting the prairies and populating our \nmain streets represent broad-based economic ownership and, ultimately, \nrepresent the opportunity within economic freedom.\n  The country these days has seen an orgy of mergers. Gee, every day \nyou wake up and you pick up the morning paper and somebody else has \nmerged. You see it in almost every industry. Recently, it has been \nbanks. The biggest banks in the country discover they love each other, \napparently, and decide they want to get married. We didn't even know \nthey were dating, and all of a sudden the newspaper in the morning \ntells us they want to get hitched, so they merge and two big banks make \na much bigger bank.\n  Airlines have been doing it as well. Big airlines take a look at the \nlittle airlines and they don't like the competition. They say, ``We \nwant to buy you up and merge.'' So they merge. Two big airlines decide \nthey will be better off if they merge, and they merge.\n  It doesn't matter what industry you look at. We used to have 30 or 40 \nclass 1 railroads in this country. Now we have a handful at best. They \nall merged.\n  Some say that would also be good for farming. Let's have them all \nmerge together; we can have farmland farmed; just get the family out of \nthere. That is what some say. They say we can have giant corporate \nagrifactories producing agricultural products from California to Maine \nand that we don't need family farmers living out on the farms.\n  First of all, I think the people who ignore the question of size and \nmergers in this country do so at their own peril. And I think the \npeople who ignore the question of the health of family farms do so at \ntheir own peril as well. Broad-based economic ownership in this country \nis important, and we ought to be concerned about it. We especially \nought to be concerned about it on the family farm.\n  In addition to hearing about mergers every morning, you turn on the \nradio going to work and you hear reports on America's economic health. \nIt is always some gray-suited economist who comes from the same \nuniversity and\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\nworks for the same entities, in most cases, who tells us how healthy \nAmerica is, and they tell us in the morning how healthy America is by \ntheir latest reports on what we consume.\n  I actually used to teach economics a couple of years. I don't always \nadmit that. Yet, I have been able to overcome that experience and, \nnonetheless, go on to lead a decent life. When I taught economics, I \nwas one of those who didn't teach that our economic health in America \nis dependent on what we consume. No, it is dependent on what we \nproduce. Real economic wealth is represented by what you produce.\n  The most prodigious producers in our country are family farmers. They \nare the all-star producers, bar none. Yet, you can take a look at this \neconomy of ours and who is doing well and who isn't. Then you will \ndiscover that this economy has decided, for a whole series of reasons, \nsome of which are public policy reasons and others, that the producers \non the family farm are somehow expendable; it doesn't matter whether \nthey do well.\n  I mentioned some while ago that in North Dakota family farmers lost \n98 percent of their income in 1 year. I don't know of anyone who can \nwithstand the loss of 98 percent of their income, not in theory, not in \npractice. When you lose 98 percent of your income, you lose your \nability to continue.\n  I am going to read just a few letters from some North Dakotans, \nbecause they say it much better than I can.\n  A woman named Shirley in North Dakota. Their son is a beginning \nfarmer. Shirley and her husband farm. Their son is a beginning farmer. \nShe said:\n\n       My son filled a sprayer with water, then checked the \n     temperature at 4:30 a.m. this morning, June 3, 1998. Last \n     night, freezing temperature records were forecast for all of \n     North Dakota.\n\n  They ran into a cold spell.\n  She said:\n\n       My son filled a sprayer with water, then checked the \n     temperature at 4:30 a.m. because it freezes usually just \n     before sunrise. He was prepared to go out and spray the beans \n     with water to prevent them from being killed by frost. He \n     probably already put in a 15- to 18-hour day, but at 4:30 \n     a.m., he was up filling the sprayer with water to try to save \n     his crop.\n       He does carpentry work all winter to make ends meet. He \n     serves on cooperative boards. He is a volunteer on the \n     emergency medical team that runs two rural ambulances in our \n     community. Last year, two quarter sections of his land were \n     totaled by hail, and Federal crop paid almost nothing. He's \n     been able to pay his $5,294-a-year health insurance bill only \n     by giving up some farm-related necessities, like hail \n     insurance.\n\n  She said:\n\n       This letter is my personal plea that Congress appreciate \n     the value of family farmers in this country and do something \n     to help stabilize their income.\n\n  This is from Edwin from North Dakota. He said:\n\n       If things continue as they are now, in 10 to 15 years, \n     you'll find very few family farms. I believe when and if this \n     happens and the farms get big enough, the price of food will \n     go up drastically because the companies that operate these \n     corporate farms will then be able to hold back production \n     until they get what they want to make a profit. I farm a \n     1,200-acre farm. The original farm was homesteaded by my \n     grandad, so I'm the third generation to be out here on the \n     family farm. I'm 61 years old and have a son who would very \n     much like to take over the farm when I retire, and I would \n     like nothing better. But I have no choice but to tell him \n     that as it is now, it is almost impossible to make a living \n     on this farm anymore.\n       The Federal Government says they want to keep family farms \n     viable, but the freedom to farm bill is selling them down the \n     river, in my opinion.\n\n  Mr. President, a letter from a man named Kelly, a family farmer. He \nwrote to Secretary Glickman and sent me a copy of it. He said:\n\n       You can say that a farm crisis is occurring in a small \n     isolated area and that Mother Nature has caused all of this, \n     but I disagree. First of all, this is not an isolated area. \n     This is a huge area. The population is small because many \n     farms have already been forced out of business. Mother Nature \n     is something farmers are used to dealing with when they have \n     the proper tools to manage the climate wrath that she can \n     behold. But these tools have slowly been taken away from \n     farmers as yield guarantees and crop insurance formulas are \n     getting lower and lower each time a claim is filed. Secondly, \n     farmers' marketing tools--export enhancement and restricted \n     trade with Canada--have been thrown in the junk pile by two \n     successive administrations.\n\n  I am not going to continue to read more letters, but I think everyone \nunderstands the circumstances. Let me mention, finally, a paragraph \nfrom a woman named Kristen who talks about her father:\n\n       I spoke to my father and he said if he doesn't have a good \n     year this year, doesn't make it this year, he probably will \n     have to get another job and sell the farm.\n\n  She said:\n\n       That broke my heart. My father worked so hard all his life \n     to give me and my brother the best upbringing and education. \n     He put me through undergraduate and graduate school. As a \n     child, I remember not seeing him much from April until he \n     started taking me to basketball practice in August. He got up \n     before dawn and returned long after I went to bed. That is \n     what family farming is. The winters were not idle, either. \n     Intricate planning necessary to run a successful farm is \n     done all year-round. The reason my father is struggling is \n     not because he is not a good farmer. He doesn't spend \n     money frivolously. There is an increase in disease \n     ravaging his crops, and the government is cutting back the \n     help to make up for these losses.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, you get the point. But the point is more than \njust that. There is suffering and there is a farm crisis. The point is \nthat somehow this system of ours has decided that everybody else can \nmake money with the farmer's product. Yet the persons who grow it, it \nis OK if they do not make any money, and it is OK if they go broke.\n  You raise some crops, as I mentioned a bit ago, on the farm, and ship \nthem through the process. The people who are going to haul that crop \nare going to make money. We have a railroad through our State that is \ngoing to charge them twice as much to haul that grain per carload of \nwheat, than they would charge on another line where there is \ncompetition. From Bismarck to Minneapolis there is no competition, so a \nfarmer is told, ``You pay $2,300 a carload to ship your wheat to \nMinneapolis.'' Yet, if you put the wheat on a train from Minneapolis to \nChicago, which is about the same distance, you pay $1,000. Why do they \ncharge us more than double? Because they can. That is the way the \nsystem works.\n  The people who haul the wheat make money. The people who mill the \nwheat, the flour mills, are doing just fine. About four firms control \nabout 60 percent of that. They are doing just great, probably making \nrecord profits. Grocery interests are doing just fine.\n  Virtually everywhere you look, the people who turn it into breakfast \nfood and puff it and crisp it and mangle it and shape it and box it and \npackage it and send it to the store shelves and charge $4 for it, they \ndo just fine. What about the person who produces it and takes all the \nrisks and does all the work to produce the food out there in the family \nfarm. They are the ones going broke in record numbers. In my State, \nthey have had so many farm sales this spring they had to call \nauctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales.\n  The question for the Congress is whether we are we going to do \nsomething that says to the family farmers: ``You matter. You are \nimportant to this country, and we want to provide something that helps \nyou in a range of areas?''\n  We ought to help because we have a trade system in this country that, \nin my judgment, sells out the interests of producers. Our system of \ntrade is not fair. We say to farmers, ``We're upset with Cuba; \ntherefore, we won't ship grain to Cuba, and you pay the cost of that \nlost market. We're upset with Libya; we will not allow you to ship \ngrain to Libya, and you pay the cost, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, for that \nlost market.''\n  Ten percent of the wheat market in the world is off limits to our \nfarmers. And farmers are told that is a foreign policy judgment, and we \nwant you to pay the cost of it. That is not fair.\n  We also negotiate trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, \nand many others. In every set of circumstances, somehow we end up \nlosing. We send negotiators out and they can lose in a day. I do not \nunderstand that. Will Rogers said some 60 years ago, ``The United \nStates of America has never lost a war and never won a conference.'' He \nsurely must have been thinking about our trade negotiators. How can \nthey lose so quickly?\n  Let s talk about Canada. They negotiated an agreement with Canada \nwhich fundamentally sells out the interests of our farmers. Every day, \nin every way, there is a flood of unfairly\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nsubsidized grain coming into this country eating away at the profits of \nour farmers, diminishing our price.\n  When we say to the Canadians, ``We think you are violating the \nantidumping laws of this country, and we demand you open your books to \nour inspectors,'' they thumb their noses at us and say, ``Go fly a \nkite. You have no ability to determine the trade practices of Canada.'' \nThis incidentally is happening despite the fact that the trade \nnegotiator who negotiated the trade agreement with Canada promised in \nwriting it would not happen. That promise was not worth the paper it \nwas written on.\n\n  I can speak at great length about trade. Why can't we get more wheat \ninto China? Why can't we get more beef into Japan? Why can't we get raw \npotatoes into Mexico? Why can you drink all the Mexican beer up here \nyou can possibly consume in a lifetime, but try to order an American \nbeer in Mexico. Yes, when I talk about beer, I am talking about barley. \nBut rather than talk at great length about all of those trade problems \nthat confront our farmers and diminish their price, my point is, this \nisn't their fault.\n  The Federal Government, through a series of policy initiatives must \ntake some responsibility. First of all, there were bad trade deals that \nwere negotiated poorly, and then not enforced at all. Secondly, there \nhas been a ravaging crop disease which decimates the quantity and \nquality of a crop. Then third, prices have collapsed following a farm \nbill that was passed by this Congress. which pulled the rug out from \nfamily farmers, and left them without a working safety net.\n  When Congress passed the farm bill a couple years ago, the price of \nwheat peaked at $5.75 a bushel. They called it the Freedom to Farm \nbill. To pull the rug out from under family farmers and say, ``We're \ngoing to get rid of the price supports for you,'' would be like saying \nto the minimum wage folks, ``Let's cut the minimum wage to $1 an hour \nand call it freedom to work.'' That is what freedom to farm is all \nabout.\n  Since freedom to farm was passed, the price of wheat has gone \nstraight down. Now it is almost $2 a bushel below what it costs the \nfamily farmer to raise wheat or to produce wheat. Family farmers cannot \ncontinue with prices below their costs of production.\n  This Congress has to decide whether it wants family farmers in our \ncountry's future or doesn't it? If it does, the question becomes what \ncan and must we do together? What can Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals and moderates do together? What can and must \nwe do together to develop some kind of basic safety net to say to \nfamily farmers, ``You matter. When prices collapse, and you are \nconfronting monopolies on the upside and monopolies on the downside, or \nyou are confronting unfair trade agreements, or you are confronting \nsanctions all around the world, or when you are confronting crop \ndisease that is devastating your crops, then this Government cares \nabout that, and the rest of the American people will provide some basic \nkind of safety net for you.''\n  That is going to be the question that is posed to Members of Congress \nin the coming couple of weeks: Do family farmers matter? If they do, \nwhat can we do together to try to say to these people, ``We'll give you \nsome hope for the future. If you don't get a decent price at the \nmarketplace, we'll provide a support mechanism of some type to get you \nover this price valley.''\n  For decades, this country had decided that when farm prices collapse, \nwe will build a bridge across those price valleys, because family \nfarming matters and we want family farmers to be able to populate this \ncountry and retain broad-based economic ownership of the land in \nAmerica.\n  That is the question we have to confront in the next couple of days \nand couple of weeks as we talk about this farm crisis that gets worse \nby the day and is affecting more and more areas of the country.\n  It is true that North Dakota is hardest hit. It is true that North \nDakota had a 98-percent loss of net farm income for family farmers in \nour State. That is devastating. But it is also the case that crop \ndisease called scab or fusarium head blight is spreading across this \ncountry. And it is also true that collapsed grain prices eventually \nwill cause the same kind of problems they cause for our farmers in \nother parts of the United States.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to speak for a few \nmoments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I advise the Senator that, under the previous \nagreement, we are to adjourn at 12:30.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for up to 5 minutes on an amendment that has just passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3134\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cochran and \nSenator Bumpers for helping pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution about \nan hour ago that addresses the devastating drought that we have been \nexperiencing in Texas. They did it on behalf of Senator Gramm and \nmyself. This is a very important sense of the Senate, because it direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to do everything possible to relieve the \ndrought conditions--not to provide rain, obviously, but to do \neverything we can to prepare for the relief that is going to be \nnecessary due to the economic losses that Texas farmers and ranchers \nare facing because of the worst drought that we have seen in my memory \nin the State of Texas.\n  In fact, it is now estimated that more than $4.6 billion in losses \nwill result to the agriculture community according to the Texas \nAgricultural Extension Service. Direct losses of income to agricultural \nproducers is $517 million, which will lead to another $1.2 billion in \neconomic activity for the State.\n  What we are asking the Secretary to do is to streamline the drought \ndeclaration process to provide necessary relief as quickly as possible. \nThe Secretary has released CRP acres in 53 counties for haying and \ngrazing.\n  It will help to have these acres available for grazing because there \nis so little grass and few crops able to grow right now. Not only will \nhaying the land provide food for the livestock, but it will take up dry \ngrass so that it will not be a fire hazard.\n  In addition, we have asked and the President has given us an \nemergency declaration so that we can start positioning equipment in \nplaces where there is imminent danger of wildfires. We are very \nconcerned about this potential because we have had so little rain for \nsuch a long period of time.\n  We have also ensured that the local farm agencies are equipped with \nfull-time and emergency personnel in these drought-stricken areas to \nassist the producers with the disaster loan application pages. We are \ndoing everything we can to prepare for the disaster that we are seeing \nunfold before our very eyes in our State right now. In fact, we have \nhad more days of back-to-back temperatures over 100 than at any time in \nour State's history.\n  As you know, when you have, day after day after day, of no rain, and \nover 100-degree temperatures, it does start baking our land pretty \nquickly. I hope the Secretary of Agriculture will continue to respond \nto the requests that Senator Gramm and I are making. As I will continue \nto do everything to prepare for the farmers who are losing their \ncrops--as we speak right now--to give them the insurance that they need \nto get through this year economically. I want to thank both Senator \nCochran and Senator Bumpers for working with us to expedite this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. I just hope that, in lieu of rain, we will do \neverything else we can to prepare and give a cushion to the farmers and \nranchers of my State that are suffering greatly right now.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her leadership in bringing to the attention of the Senate the \nfacts about the Texas drought. We have already had news reports on that \nsubject. It is obvious that there are very serious conditions there \nthat need the immediate attention of the Federal Government. Her \nresolution, cosponsored by Senator Gramm from Texas, will be very \nhelpful in directing the way for this response to be made.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8091-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3127\n\n  Mr. President, I come before the Senate as a Senator from Minnesota, \nalong with other Senators from the Midwest, although I think that we \nrepresent the point of view of Senators throughout the country. I come \nto speak to the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that is before the \nSenate, although we are going to have much more business to follow.\n  The concluding paragraph of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is:\n\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that \n     emergency action by the President and Congress is necessary \n     to respond to the economic hardships facing agricultural \n     producers and their communities.\n\n  This was laid down by my colleague, Senator Daschle from South \nDakota, the minority leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be included as an original cosponsor \nof his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Harkin spoke when I was out on the floor \nearlier, and Senator Dorgan, and Senator Johnson. Senator Conrad may \nhave spoken.\n  Mr. President, let me talk not so much about what is happening around \nthe country, although most Senators represent States that are being \nhurt by this crisis in agriculture. Let me instead talk about what has \nhappened in northwest Minnesota and what is happening right now in my \nState.\n  In northwest Minnesota, we have been hit by bad weather. Everybody \nremembers the floods. We have also been affected by scab disease. And \nnow we are facing very low prices with grain crops.\n  Mr. President, the situation is dire. Wally Sparby, director of our \nfarm service agency in the State, has predicted that we could lose as \nmany as 20 percent of our farmers, that right now one out of every five \nfarm families is in trouble and is struggling. Thanks to the help of \nSenators, including the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, we \nwere able to get some help to farmers for spring planting season. We \nwere able to get USDA farm credit to farmers at planting time. The \nproblem is whether people are going to continue to be able to farm.\n  Mr. President, I read from the testimony of Rod Nelson, who is \npresident of the First American Bank in Crookston, which also has \noffices in the communities of Warren, Fisher, and Shelly in northwest \nMinnesota. Here is the concluding paragraph:\n\n       In our bank in the fall of 1995, we began addressing the \n     reality that things had reached a new level of concern, as \n     many rather than some of our farm customers, were not doing \n     well. Things have only gotten worse since then. This year we \n     conservatively project to have 20 growers quitting or \n     significantly downsizing their operation. We likely have an \n     equal number thinking about doing so or in the process of \n     doing so. It's important to note that to properly phase out \n     of farming it takes good planning and 2, 3 or 4 years. The \n     increased number we are seeing this year will likely be even \n     larger next year. These numbers just represent our banks \n     customers. As you look at the whole of Northwestern \n     Minnesota, the picture would be worse because not all areas \n     have beets which has been the one consistently good crop.\n\n  Mr. President, I will just translate all of these statistics in \npersonal terms.\n  I hope we will take action in this Chamber that will make a \ndifference. I hope it will happen in the House. I don't want it to be \nsymbolic politics. I don't want a partisan debate. I hope it doesn't \nend up going in that direction, because I will tell you, I have met too \nmany people who are now being driven off their farms. They not only \nwork on the farms; this is where they live. During the mid-1980s, I was \na teacher at Carleton College in Northfield, in Rice County, some 491 \nsquare miles, population I think about 41,000, and most all of my \ncommunity organizing was in farm, rural areas. I spoke at so many \ndifferent farm gatherings, and I knew so many families that were \nforeclosed on. I saw a lot of broken dreams and a lot of broken lives \nand a lot of broken families. That is exactly the direction we are \ngoing in right now.\n  Farmers have good years and also some not so good years. Prices go up \nand prices go down. I am not, I say to my colleagues, going to come out \nhere and rail about the Freedom to Farm bill. Maybe there will be a \ntime to do that. I will say in a very quiet way that I really do \nbelieve this has been more for the benefit of corporate agribusiness, \nand I do think now that prices are falling and the so-called transition \npayments are dwindling, an awful lot of farmers are in trouble. That is \nthe real point.\n  We no longer have the safety net we once had. Farmers cannot make it \non $2 corn, they can't make it on $3.25 wheat, and that is why at the \nbeginning I said, and I say it again, I think the Freedom to Farm bill \nhas become the ``Freedom to Fail'' bill.\n  Now, after having said that, I want my colleague from Mississippi and \nother colleagues to know that I don't see this particular resolution or \nthe amendments that we are going to bring to the floor over the next \nday or so as being a debate about the Freedom to Farm bill. I think it \nwas a profound mistake. I voted against it. I will always take that \nposition until proven wrong.\n  By the way, I said when it was passed that I prayed I was wrong. I \nwould be pleased to be proven wrong. If in fact the Freedom to Farm \nbill, along with the flexibility for farmers in planting, which I am \nall for, was to lead to family farmers doing better and the families \nbeing better off, I would be all for it.\n  I guess that was the theory. But now we don't have the safety net we \nhad, and, most important of all, farmers do not have the leverage in \nthe marketplace to get a decent price. That is what I would put my \nfocus on, a fair price for farmers, especially family farmers.\n  Now, for people who might be watching our debate, I think this is \nspecial to me as a Midwesterner, because the family farm structure of \nagriculture is precious to our part of the country. We all know that \nthe land will be farmed by somebody and somebody will own the animals. \nThe question is whether or not the land is farmed by family farmers. \nThe number of family farmers who live in our communities has a lot to \ndo with who supports our schools, who supports our churches or \nsynagogues, who supports the local businesses in town. This is a life-\nor-death issue for a very important part of America. This is a life-or-\ndeath issue for a part of America that is dear to many Americans.\n  So first we have the resolution that is before us which asks the \nSenate to recognize that we have an emergency situation, and we do. \nThis would potentially free up some funds that are needed to provide \nfamily farms and families in rural America with some support.\n  Second, I think the most significant thing we can do is to focus on \nprice. When I think about the discussions I have with farmers--I hope \nto be in Granite Falls, Minnesota this Saturday with State legislators. \nDoug Peterson is going to be there; Ted Winter is going to be there; \nJim Tunheim from northwest Minnesota has been making the plea over and \nover: Please do something. Our focus will be to lift the current cap on \nthe market loan rate.\n  Right now, we have a cap on the loan rate which is $1.89 for a bushel \nof corn and $2.58 for a bushel of wheat, and this tends to set a floor \nunder prices. But this is simply too low. It is just simply too low. \nFarmers cannot cash-flow with these kinds of prices. At a Minnesota \naverage price for the year at $2 for corn, it simply is not going to \nwork for family farmers.\n\n  What I would like to do in the best of all worlds, is to remove these \ncaps and raise the loan rate to the close to the cost of production--$3 \ncorn and $4\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nwheat. That is what we should talk about. Instead, what we want to do \nis to at least take the cap off this loan rate, and then raise the loan \nrate to 85 percent of the average price for the last 5 years. That \nwould be at about $2.25 a bushel for corn and about $3.22 for a bushel \nof wheat.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if we do that and we also extend the \nrepayment period from 9 months to 15 months--all of it is paid back; \nthis is not a giveaway--then what we will see is farmers getting a \nbetter price for their crop.\n  We have to take the cap off the loan rate. We have to get the price \nup. There is no way that family farmers can make it otherwise. We can \nfocus on exports. We can focus on all those other issues. That is fine. \nBut the central issue is price, price, price. And right now that loan \nrate is set at such a low level and farmers have so little bargaining \npower in the marketplace that they cannot get a fair price.\n  We also want to make sure that we have some price disclosure and \nreporting when it comes to what is going on with the livestock markets \naround the country.\n  The problem is that there is plenty of competition among the \nproducers, but there is no competition among the buyers of hogs and \nbeef cattle. Therefore what we are talking about is a pilot project \nthat basically puts us on the path toward mandatory price reporting by \nthe packers. I personally would like to see mandatory price reporting \ndone nationally, but I think this is a good step. We ought to know what \nthey are paying.\n  We have precious little free enterprise in what should be a free-\nenterprise system. The family farmers are the only competitive unit, \nand they find themselves squeezed both by the input suppliers and to \nwhom they sell.\n  Finally, crop insurance just cannot do the job if you face several \ndisaster years in a row. Our amendment would replenish the disaster \nreserve of the Secretary of Agriculture so we can make payments to \nfarmers who have suffered a disaster and for whom crop insurance hasn't \nworked. This is the indemnity feature of this piece of legislation.\n  I say again to my colleagues, we can end up debating Freedom to Farm. \nI am all for debating it. But there is no way, whether it be what is \nhappening to wheat farmers or what is now going on with corn growers as \nwell, that farmers are going to make it if we don't get the price up. \nThe most important single thing we can do as an emergency measure is to \ntake the cap off the loan rate to get the price up, and, in addition, \nmake sure that we can get some funding out there, some kind of \nindemnity program that will enable the Secretary of Agriculture, in the \nspirit of disaster relief, to get some funds out there to these \nfamilies so that they have a chance.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, I hope there will be overwhelming \nsupport for this resolution. More importantly, I hope that we will have \noverwhelming support for what is to follow. We want to take a position \nas a Senate that this is for real. The economy is at peak economic \nperformance, but we are faced with a crisis in many of our rural and \nagricultural communities. Then what we have to do is pass amendments to \nthis appropriations bill which take some concrete steps that can make \nall the difference in the world to the people we are trying to \nrepresent here.\n  Those are steps I think we should take. I hope we get strong support \nfor them. My priority is to be out on the floor speaking, debating \nthis, working with colleagues, trying to get as much support as \npossible. For many family farmers in Minnesota and around the country, \ntime is not neutral. It is not in their favor.\n  If we are not willing to take some action that can make a difference, \nthey are going to go under. We are going to see too many family farmers \ndriven off the land. We will see more and more concentration of \nownership of land. It is not going to be good for agricultural America; \nit is not going to be good for rural America; it is not going to be \ngood for small businesses; it is not going to be good for small towns; \nit is not going to be good for the environment; and it is not going to \nbe good for the consumers in this country. This is a crisis of national \nproportions, and I hope we will take corrective action this week on \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the American \nfarmer.\n  Mr. President, Montana's farmers and ranchers have suffered from an \nextraordinary turn of events that is driving people off the family \nfarm. Low prices, shrinking Asian markets, drought and the adjustments \nto a new farm bill have left our producers with an inadequate safety \nnet. For many, this is disaster.\n  First, we have to deal with price. And we have to deal with price \ntoday. Our producers can't survive another setback. Montana farmers \nhave already planted the smallest spring wheat crop since 1991--down 17 \nprecent over last year and down 8 percent from what they intended to \nplant March 1. As I recall, we were talking about low prices as far \nback as December, And now, in mid-July we are talking about the same \nissues. We are simply farther down the rocky road. It's high time to \nact.\n  I am sure many of you will recall last spring--nearly 6 months ago--\nwhen our producers were desperately reaching out for help. So, we \nbrought an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nthat would extend marketing assistance loans. Unfortunately, we faced a \nbrigade of opponents who wanted to push an aggressive trade agenda \ninstead of an emergency price fix.\n  Now I find it ironic, that despite all of our best efforts, the many \nhearings held about the ``Crisis in Agriculture,'' and the promotion of \nthe sanctions package as the cure-all for our price dilemma--that we \nare exactly where we started--at ground zero. We've seen no improvement \non price. In fact, we've lost ground: Montana's winter wheat average \nprice decreased 22 cents from April 1998 to now, dropping to $3.06 per \nbushel.\n  Beef prices also are lower--down $3.10/cwt. And sheep have dropped by \n$8.40. And still, we want our producers to believe that we should look \nfor brighter days in the international market--without congressional \nintervention.\n  Some would argue that this situation can be blamed on over-\nproduction, alone. I wholeheartedly disagree. While it is true that \nwheat stocks in Montana on June 1 totaled nearly 60 million bushels, up \n80 percent from the same quarter last year, but our exports are down \nconsiderably. I think we can also make the argument that extending the \nmarket loans an additional six months is but a step in resolving the \nproblem.\n  It is true that we must move our wheat, our beef, and all other \n``crisis commodities''--and now. We can't view this measure of \nextending loans and lifting the loan cap to become a last ditch-policy. \nBut as an emergency matter, I would call on my colleagues to consider \nthe ramifications of letting this disaster go another day. And \nencourage them to lend their support.\n  That will solve the short-term issue of price. Then, we must address \nthe long term. We did just that by stepping up our efforts on the trade \nfront by passing a bill last week removing GSM ag credits from our \nsanctions package on India and Pakistan.\n  Next we need to review those sanctions still pending on nearly 9 \npercent of the world and re-evaluate whether they are current, \nnecessary and proper. If not, let's remove the sanctions and move our \nwheat into these markets and help our producers. Food should not be \nused as a weapon. And our policies should not hurt our hard-working \nproducers.\n  We should also support the country of origin labeling amendment for \nour livestock producers. Consumers in America can examine the label on \nany given product to make an informed shopping decision. But that is \nnot the case with our imported meat. I am a cosponsor of Senator \nJohnson's efforts to require meat labeling. It makes sense. It costs \nlittle. And the benefit extends, not only to producers, but also \nconsumers.\n  And finally, we cannot ignore the force of Mother Nature. No one can \nargue that our farmers have been subject to an adverse and often \nhostile market. But this year marks a series of natural disasters that \nare beyond our control. Drought still plagues many counties in Montana. \nIn fact, twenty-two percent of our crops are in poor condition because \nof lack of moisture. That is bad news for our livestock industry, as \nwell. Fifty-nine percent of\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nour pasture--used for forage--is in less than good condition. Clearly, \nefforts targeted at replenishing the disaster reserve would be hailed \nas relief for those victims of annual disaster.\n  And finally, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support these \nmeasures--not on a partisan basis--but because it is the right thing to \ndo for our producers back home. Our feet--and those of our producers--\nare being held to the fire. Will we take action--or spout rhetoric? \nWill we show our constituency that we are here in Washington fighting \nfor them--not amongst ourselves? I would hope we can take the higher \nground and send a message to America--we need and support our farmers \nand ranchers--by lending our support.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four members \nof my staff, Catharine Cyr, Jason McNamara, Brandon Young and Sally \nMolloy, be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of the \nconsideration of the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n         New England Plant, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senator from \nMississippi, the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, for so generously honoring my request to \nsupport the USDA-Agricultural Research Service's New England Plant, \nSoil, and Water Research Laboratory, which is located at the University \nof Maine. I am very pleased that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee has recommended that this important agriculture research \nworksite be kept open, despite the administration's misguided attempt \nto close the facility and curtail its funding.\n  I am also happy that the distinguished chairman has agreed to my \nrequest to provide a $300,000 increase in the lab's funding to hire new \nscientists at the Cropping Systems Center to develop production and \ndisease management systems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to be able to grant the \nrequest of the distinguished Senator from Maine, the request to ensure \nthat this valuable agricultural research is continued at the \nAgriculture Research Center's laboratory.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to continue the colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman, I again thank him very much for his support. I \nwould like to point out the research conducted at the University of \nMaine is particularly vital because of the 104 USDA-ARS labs across the \ncountry, the laboratory located in Orono, ME, is the only one in New \nEngland. The facility is thus able to conduct research on the unique \nchallenges that face our New England farmers.\n  Specifically, the lab at Orono has conducted research into raised bed \ntechniques that allow potatoes to be grown in the short New England \ngrowing season, as well as into disease and pest management.\n  The potato industry in New England, 95 percent of which is located in \nnorthern Maine where I grew up, is suffering through a difficult \nperiod. Underpriced subsidized imports and several consecutive years of \ndisease, drought and pest problems have resulted in a steady decline in \nthe amount of acreage planted in potatoes. The additional $300,000 \nincluded in the managers' amendment will allow the lab to hire a new \npathologist and microbiologist to help New England farmers to overcome \nmany of the challenges they face. I look forward to working with my \ncolleague to enact this significant legislation and, again, I commend \nand thank him for acceding to our request in this regard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to point out the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine has chaired committee hearings in the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the subject of food safety. \nIt has been a pleasure to participate with her in that effort and to \nobserve the quality of leadership she has brought to that issue.\n  Her comprehensive investigation on the subject of food safety will \ngreatly assist all of us in the Senate in our efforts to improve the \nfood safety system in this country and ensure legislation on this \nsubject is responsive to the real needs for improvements in the \nprograms that are administered by the Food and Drug Administration and \nother agencies of the Federal Government.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for his very kind comments. It has \nbeen a great honor to be able to work with the Senator on the issue of \nimproving the safety of imported fruit and vegetables and all imported \nfood.\n  As we have learned from the two hearings that we held to date, this \nis a very complex issue that does not lend itself to a simple solution. \nIt is my hope that continuing to work with the Senator from \nMississippi, we will be able to complete our investigation this fall \nand develop a series of recommendations that will get to the heart of \nthe problem and help to continue to ensure that our food safety is the \nbest in the world.\n  I thank the chairman for his cooperation and participation in this \nconversation, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished \nChairman of the FY99 Subcommittee for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFDA and Related Agencies appropriations for honoring the requests of \nSenator Collins and myself for additional funding of $300,000 to fund a \nscientist and technical support for the New England Plant Soil, Water \nand Research laboratory at the University of Maine in Orono. I also \ngreatly appreciate the fact that the appropriators have also agreed \nthat the lab, which has been threatened with closure in the President's \nFY99 budget, should remain open.\n  This lab, under the capable leadership of Dr. C. Wayne Honeycutt, \nconducts research to develop and transfer solutions to problems of high \nnational priority in the potato industry and is critical to the State \nof Maine, its potato growers, and its economy. Ninety five percent of \nNew England's potato acreage is in Maine, and this lab has the benefit \nof being in close proximity to growers' fields. The additional funding \nprovided by the appropriations will preserve and expand this vital \nresearch program and maintain New England's only agricultural research \nlaboratory, and I thank Senator Cochran for his attention to our \nrequests.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3127\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the resolution \nthat was offered by the Democratic leader and others which is a \nrecitation of some of the challenges and problems that face those who \nare involved in production agriculture throughout America. Several \nSenators have taken the floor to point out some specifics that back up \nthe suggestion made in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Other Senators have added their comments in the form of other \nresolutions. We have already adopted on a voice vote a resolution \noffered by the Senator from Texas dealing with the problems of the \ndrought that is confronting agriculture producers in that State.\n  We have another amendment that has been brought to my attention that \nwill be offered by the Senator from Florida, maybe both Senators from \nFlorida, on the subject of the problems of agriculture that have been \ncaused by the wildfires and the other disasters that have occurred in \nthat State.\n  So it is no secret that we have plenty of problems out there. There \nmay be disagreements on exactly how to approach the difficulties. They \nare not all the same. Some are weather related; some are not. Some have \nto do with market conditions in various parts of the world. So it is a \ncomplex and wide range of problems facing the Senate. We are being put \nto the test today, to come to some decision on these issues.\n  I encourage Senators who have comments to make on this subject to \ncome to the floor and express their views. This is a good time to do \nthat. At some point, we will have to either agree to this amendment or \nconsider an amendment to it and move on to other issues.\n  So any Senators who would like to comment on that at this point, I \nencourage them to do so.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the agricultural \nissues that have been presented by my colleagues, the agriculture \nappropriations bill, and to discuss the current state of agriculture in \nthe country. More particularly, I think it is most pertinent and \nappropriate to discuss the amendment that has been introduced by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader on behalf of my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that describes a very serious \nsituation in agriculture today. The resolution was presented to the \ndesk when I had the privilege of being the Presiding Officer. It is a \nlittle difficult to read all of it in that there has been some editing \nthere. I am not trying to perjure the editing at all. The distinguished \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, has indicated that if we could work on this a little \nbit, there should not be any problem in regard to a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that addresses the serious situation we have in agriculture, \nand more especially, the regional crisis that is now being experienced \nin the northern plains. So I look forward to a bipartisan sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  I guess we could quibble about the adjectives and adverbs and some of \nthe comments and figures. We are trying to work that out. It should not \nbe a problem, though. We have appropriate language. My staff has worked \non it, and I know Senator Cochran's staff has worked on it. I know we \nare going to consult with Senator Lugar, and many on the other side \nhave worked on this. I think it is appropriate that we draw the \nattention of the American public to the severe problems that we are \nexperiencing in agriculture, more especially in the northern plains.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I don't argue that things are \nperfect in farm country or in rural America. But I do not believe that \nthe wheels have fallen off and sent agriculture policy crashing into a \nwall, as some of my colleagues are claiming. There are, indeed, \nproblems in agriculture. I think we are all aware of that. But, again, \nthey are regional problems, it seems to me, caused by weather and crop \ndisease and the ``Asian economic flu''--or in some cases it has become \nthe ``Asian pneumonia''--but not the 1996 farm bill. They do not \nrepresent a national crisis in agriculture. It is very severe for the \npeople involved, but a national crisis? No. Are there real problems in \nagriculture today because of the lack of a coherent, aggressive export \npolicy? Sure. Are there other problems and other challenges? Yes. But a \nnational crisis? I don't think so. Two years ago, we passed the Federal \nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act, dubbed the Freedom to Farm \nAct. And it represented, I think, the most comprehensive change in \nagriculture policy since the New Deal. This new farm bill removed \nrestrictive planting and marketing requirements--and, boy, were they \nrestrictive--that for many years had prevented farmers from planting \ntheir crops and using their resources in the most efficient and profit-\ngenerating manners. When we wrote the FAIR Act, we had two basic \nchoices. We could continue on a course of micromanaged planting and \nmarketing restrictions that often put our producers at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the world market, or we could pursue a course that \nwould eliminate these restrictions and allow farmers to make their own \nplanting decisions based on domestic and world market demands, while \nalso receiving guaranteed--and I emphasize the word ``guaranteed,'' \nunderscore it--levels of government transition payments.\n\n  Let me put it in language that most farmers used when they talked to \nme when I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee in the midst of the farm rewrite. They were a \nlittle tired of putting seed in the ground according to USDA dictates. \nBefore this farm bill, the farmer put the seed in the ground as \ndictated by the USDA to preserve an acreage base. Why? Because the \nacreage base qualified them for subsidy payments. How much? We would \ndetermine that here in Washington. Then, of course, the more we set \naside to pay for all of this, they said, OK, put the seed in the \nground. You protect your acreage base. But you have to set aside part \nof your wherewithal on some kind of a supply-demand, command-and-\ncontrol scheme. That said, we will set aside 10 percent, 20 percent, or \n30 percent of your reduction as decided by Washington in order to pay \nfor this. Guess what? Our competitors overseas simply increased their \nproduction by more than we set aside, and we lost market share.\n  Folks, that was a dead-end street. The whole design of the new farm \nbill was to let farmers make their own decisions in regard to planting \nand what made sense in terms of price, market, environment, working \ntheir ground, or whatever.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I worked with \nChairman Lugar and members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to \npursue this legislation that really would provide our producers with \nthe tools to compete in the world market. But we did not, Mr. \nPresident--we did not--veer off aimlessly into the wilderness. Chairman \nLugar and I had held dozens of field hearings throughout the United \nStates. I think we totalled them up in the House Agriculture Committee, \nand I think we went 30,000 miles--30,000 miles listening to farmers and \nranchers in regard to what they wanted. The producers overwhelmingly \nstated that they wanted flexibility in making their own planting \ndecisions in competing with the world market.\n  Has the FAIR Act worked? Has the Freedom to Farm bill worked as it \nwas intended? I think the answer is a qualified yes. Is it perfect? No. \nIs it written in stone? No. Is it an ongoing work in progress? Yes.\n  Let me refer to the policy ledger that we promised farmers in regard \nto when we considered this bill. We said, ``Look.'' If we are going to \nbe budget-responsible--this is the policy ledger, 1996. This is what we \ntold farmers in all of the hearings. And most of them bought it. Not \nall, but most of them bought it. And we said, look, if you have less \nFederal dollars here in terms of meeting our budget obligations--and \nlet me point out that farmers and ranchers above anyone suffer from \ninflation and higher interest rates--they wanted a balanced budget. And \nwe said, OK, if we are not going to rely on supply-demand set-asides, \nwe have more reliance on risk management. Boy, that is a tough one \nbecause today a lot of farmers are finding unacceptable risk, as I have \nindicated, more especially in the northern plains. We are going to give \nyou this in connection with the Freedom to Farm legislation.\n  This was farm policy reform under the bill, a consistent and \npredictable farm program support, and the only time we have ever passed \na farm bill that for 5 or 6 years laid it out for every banker, every \nfinancial institution, every farmer on exactly what they were going to \nget. As one farmer told me one time at the Hutchinson State Fair in \nKansas, he said, ``Pat, I don't care what you do to me, just let me \nknow.'' We did for 5 or 6 years.\n  Planting flexibility: I have gone over that.\n  The elimination of the set-aside programs, because we were losing \nmarket share. We were noncompetitive on the world market.\n  Improved risk management tools: Have we done that? Well, no. We \nhaven't. We have ample funding, hopefully, in the agriculture research \nbill that was passed and the crop insurance bill that was passed with \nthe help and leadership of Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, and others \nas well, and some others. It was a tough fight, but we got it past the \nHouse, and we got it past the Senate. If we can get it past the House \nAppropriations Committee, why, that will be a real feather in our cap.\n  Having said that, we have not really reformed the risk management \ncrop insurance that we need to do.\n  So, yes, the farm bill is not perfect. We need to do that.\n  Less paperwork and standing in lines: I will tell you, under the old \nbill farmers stood in line outside of the old ASCS office. That is an \nacronym. It is now changed to FSA. That is the Farm Service Agency. And \nAunt Harriet was in the agency's office, the Farm Service Agency \noffice. Farmers stood in\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nline, filled out all of the paperwork, and filled out all of the forms. \nThey got plumb tired of it. Under this new farm bill they don't have to \ndo that. Less paperwork, less regulation, and less waiting in line.\n  Tax policy reform: That is all part of the credit that we promised, a \nfarm savings account. We are going to do that this session of Congress. \nWe should have done it in the farm bill. It should have been done at \nthat particular time. We simply ran out of time.\n  Capital gains tax cut: We have done some of this. We need to do more.\n  State tax cut: We have done some of that. We need to do fully \ndeductible health care. We are on the road to accomplishing that.\n  Income averages: Conrad-Burns from this very desk introduced the \namendment on income averaging. We should extend it for the life of the \nfarm bill. We need to do that.\n  The other thing on the ledger that we promised farmers we would work \non, No. 3, is trade policy reform. Boy, we have a real challenge ahead \nof us in this regards.\n  Fast track negotiating authority: If there is one single thing that \nhas happened in the last year that threw a real clinker into our export \nsales it was a decision by the Congress--and, yes, by the President--to \nwithdraw fast track. That single item is the most distressing piece of \nnews since the embargo of 1980 that lead to shattered glass in regard \nto exports, and helped cause the 1980s farm crisis.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, with all due respect, if we can get a \n98-to-0 vote in regard to sanctions reform as we did last week, rethink \nfast track, please. I think that we could get it done, if you are for \nit. Be for it. Speaker Gingrich and Leader Lott have indicated that we \nwill vote on it with a CBI initiative, with the African Trade \nInitiative. Let's do it. But that signal that was sent when we withdrew \nthat bill sent tremors through all of our trade policies and with \nregard to contract sanctity.\n  End these unilateral sanctions. This Congress, and, yes, this \nadministration, have become sanctimonious in regard to walling off \nabout 75 percent of the world's population, 75 percent of the world's \ncountries. You can't have a market-oriented policy with that.\n  Consistent aggressive export policy: Well, I don't think we are using \nall the tools we should.\n  NAFTA and WTO oversight: Not doing enough.\n  Value-added emphasis in regard to research funding: We are doing \nsome. We should do more.\n  Extend MFN for China: Well, you can see on the trade policy reform \nthat we haven't done so well. And that is part of the problem, albeit a \npassing glance to my colleagues on the other side. But that is part of \nthe problem that we have.\n  Regulatory reform; preserve the conservation reserve program. We did \nthat; not the way I wanted to, but we did that to some degree.\n  Enact FIFRA reform. That is an acronym for you. That is the Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Reform Act. That is the food \nsafety reform bill. We enacted reform. The way the EPA is administering \nit we have real problems. And that is going to be the source of another \ndebate on the floor and in committee as we go down the road. So we need \nsome help there.\n  Incentive programs for good stewardship; eliminate unfunded mandates. \nThat is the recipe.\n  We promised farmers in all of the hearings we had. We said, OK, you \ngo to market-oriented agriculture. We rely less on subsidies. These are \nthe things we are going to work on. Have we done them all? No. Should \nwe do them all? Yes. And it should be a bipartisan effort.\n  But, if we do this, then obviously, by the way, the Freedom to Farm \nbill will work, and is working to a certain degree.\n  We have heard a lot of statements that the Freedom to Farm bill has \nfailed, and that we ``pulled the rug out from underneath our \nproducers.'' My colleagues, this is not true. The facts are not there. \nThe 1996 and 1997 farm bill provided a combined $11.5 billion in \npayments to America's farmers. Under the old program farmers would have \nonly received a combined $3.6 billion in payments.\n  If we have increased the payments to farmers in this transition three \ntimes as high as in the old farm bill, how on Earth can you say that \nthe current farm bill is the source of our problem?\n  Let's just put it in simple terms. If we provide more money to \nfarmers, three times as much, that is a problem in regards to price \nwith our export demand? Hello.\n  Mr. President, we have also heard that there is no longer a safety \nnet for America's farmers, and advocates of this position argue that we \nmust extend marketing loans and remove the caps on loan rates. And \nbased on recent figures, it is estimated the loan rate for wheat would \nrise to $3.17 a bushel from its current level of $2.58. We could use \ncorn and soybeans and other program crops, but wheat is going through a \ndifficult time. It is a good example, so I am going to use wheat. But \nif you add in the transition payments--nobody over there on that side \nof the aisle has even mentioned a transition payment--the 63 that a \nfarmer is getting per bushel right now--as I say, three times as much \nas they would have received under the old farm bill. That doesn't exist \nfor my friends across the aisle. It is invisible. But it is not \ninvisible to the farmer. When you add in the transition payments of 63 \ncents per bushel on the historical base farmers are receiving for \nwheat, you now have a safety net of $3.21. Why should we approve \namendments that will bust the budget at a cost of nearly $4 billion \nover 5 years, Mr. President, when they provide a lower safety net than \nthe current program?\n  No, I know the answer. They say we want both; we want the whole loaf. \nAs a matter of fact, if we are going to consider any kind of a payment, \nit seems to me it ought to be added to the transition payment so \nfarmers could make the decision, not some kind of a marketing loan or a \nloan program where, again, Washington makes the decision.\n  So raising and extending loan rates, I do not think, in the end \nresult will improve prices and the producer's income. As a matter of \nfact, extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the \nlong run. Extending the loan for 6 months simply gives producers \nanother false hope for holding on to the remainder of last year's crop. \nFarmers will be holding on to a portion of the 1997 crop while at the \nsame time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998. Thus, when you roll \nover the loan rate, it actually increases the amount of wheat on the \nmarket and results in lower prices, not higher prices. Since the excess \nstocks will continue to depress prices, we will then extend the rate \nagain.\n  Once you go down that road, it is going to be very difficult not to \nextend it again. And I think it would become an endless cycle that \nwould cost billions of dollars and which will eventually lead to a \nreturn of planting requirements to pay for it. You can't simply stand \nup and say we are going to spend $4 billion on an emergency because you \nhave a regional farm crisis on the northern plains and not expect some \npeople around here to say where is the offset. The offset would be in \nset-aside acres and you are right back to square one with the same old \nfarm bill that caused all the problems to begin with. That would be an \nattempt to control the output and limit the budgetary effects.\n  I suppose we could find some offsets. Where is that article by Jim \nSuber? Jim Suber is an ag writer for the Topeka Daily Capital. He knows \nwhat he is talking about, if we want to find offsets and pay for this \nand do it the right way, not add to the budget deficit, not add to the \npossibility of inflation, higher interest rates. Jim says USDA is \nspending, or will spend $37.9 billion on social welfare programs. I am \nnot perjuring that. They are very good programs. But it plans only to \nspend $5.9 billion in commodity programs.\n  So here we have the Department of Agriculture, according to Jim, \nspending 7 to 1 more money in regard to social welfare programs and \nother very fine programs as opposed to assistance to farmers.\n  Well, if we want to get offsets, I can certainly go down that list, \nbut I don't think that is a popular thing to do, and I don't think I am \ngoing to do that.\n  Extending and raising loan rates will only serve, I think, to \nexacerbate the lack of storage associated with the \ntransportation problems in middle America because it simply causes \nfarmers to hold on to their crops and to fill their elevator storage \nspaces.\n\n  Now, in Kansas we have just harvested our second largest wheat crop \nin\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nhistory. Perhaps not in Oklahoma and Texas, where they have had bad \nweather, but in Kansas that is certainly the case. There are \npredictions of record corn and soybeans in the fall in Kansas. If we \ndon't move the wheat crop now, it will create transportation problems \nin the future that will surpass anything we experienced last year. And \nwe had mounds of grain sitting by the local country elevator with no \nrail transportation.\n  I think I should also mention that advocates of higher extended loan \nrates argue it will allow farmers to hold their crops until after the \nharvest when prices will rise. After all, that is the whole intent, or \nthat is the whole plan in regard to the higher loan rate. I would point \nout that Kansas State University recently published a report which \nlooked at the years of 1981 to 1997, and they compared the farmer's \nearnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November as opposed to \nselling at harvest. In all but 5 years, why, farmers ended up with a \nnet loss as storage and interest costs exceeded the gains in price. \nSimply put, extending and raising the rates, I think, would provide a \nfalse hope for higher profits that most often does not exist.\n  Really, what we are talking about here, Mr. President--and it gets a \nlittle detailed here, but we are talking about what is the function of \nthe loan rate in any farm program. Is the loan rate a market clearing \ndevice or is it income protection. And my friends across the aisle \nobviously want to make it both. I don't think you can have it both \nways, but they want to make it income protection as opposed to the \ntransition payments.\n  In addition, if you raise the loan rate up to $3.17, and you have a \nfire sale on wheat, you have a bumper crop and you have China, which is \nthe world's No. 1 wheat producer, and you had the European Union, which \nis the world's No. 2 wheat producer, and a surplus of grain on the \nworld market, what do you think is going to happen to the price? It \nwill fall, and we will never have wheat over the price of $3.17.\n  So what my distinguished colleagues across the aisle fail to point \nout is if you put that cap on the loan rate at $3.17, you may get the \n$3.17 plus the transition payment if you can somehow squirrel that by \nthe Senate and the House with all the budget problems, but you put a \ncap on it and you will never see $4 and $5 wheat. As a matter of fact, \nthat is what some of my colleagues across the aisle say they have to \nhave to stay in business.\n  One of the most effective measures of the success of the Freedom to \nFarm Act is to review the planting changes that have occurred all \nthroughout the country since its passage. When that bill was passed, \nthe opponents argued that farmers did not have the capability to rotate \nand grow various different crops, that this would be a negative. And we \nhave heard that rhetoric here in this debate. We have heard it now for, \nwhat, 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks with the appropriate charts. Here are the facts.\n  In the northern plains, where many farmers are suffering from a \ndevastating disease called white scab, farmers have rotated out of \nwheat acreage. They have switched to higher value crops. Recent USDA \nreports state that spring wheat acreage has fallen nearly a quarter \nfrom last year. We have in effect had a wheat set-aside to reduce the \nsupply, but the farmer made that decision and went to more productive \ncrops all across this country.\n  A comparison of the Farm Service Agency figures from 1993 and 1997 in \nNorth Dakota shows that during the 4 years soybean acreage increased \nfrom 591,000 acres to 1,090,000. Canola, which should be the crop of \npreference now in terms of profit in that State, went from 47,000 acres \nto 456,000 acres; dried pea acreage rose from 6,711 to 67,000 acres; \nnavy beans went from virtually no acreage to 151,000--dramatic changes \nin crop production made by the decision of the individual producer.\n  Minnesota: The Minnesota Agriculture Statistics Service reported \nrecord soybeans and sugar beet acreage in 1997 with soybeans breaking \nthe previous record by 850,000 acres. South Dakota's harvested soybean \nacres were 3.4 million--million--in 1997, 780,000 above the previous \nrecord set in 1996. Sorghum production was also up 42 percent from \n1996.\n  I think it is important to know that these changes are not only \noccurring in the northern plains, but throughout the entire United \nStates by farmers, under the flexibility under Freedom to Farm. Alabama \ncotton on acreage fell by 74,000 acres in 1997; soybean acreage \nincreased by 70,000. They are following the market. A February paper by \nthe Agriculture and Food Policy Institute at Texas A reported that \ncotton acreage declined in 1997 from the 1994-1996 average in \nLouisiana, in Mississippi, and in Arkansas by 34, 23, and 9 percent, \nrespectively.\n  Here cotton farmers take a look at the market saying, ``I think I can \nmake a better deal; I can make a better profit in another crop.'' That \nis the flexibility that was provided in regard to Freedom to Farm.\n  Same report: Cotton acreage in Oklahoma decreased 42 percent from a \n3-year average while sorghum acres increased 31 percent. And harvested \nwheat acreage in Kansas--we have a little saying on the Kansas license \nplate that says, ``The Wheat State.'' Well, we are not. We are now the \ngrain State--in 1998 was at its lowest level in nearly 25 years. \nMeanwhile, we have now planted some 20,000 to 25,000 acres of cotton in \nKansas because it is productive. It is a profit incentive. As a matter \nof fact, the weather is a little cold up in Kansas as compared with \ndown south, and the insects can't bite quite as hard on the cotton. If \nwe can survive the winters, which we are doing, why, Kansas is now a \ncotton-producing State. You would never have dreamed that under the old \nfarm bill.\n\n  These farmers who made these decisions and changes in American \nagriculture have exceeded expectations in 1996. During a recent meeting \nwith 12 major farm organizations--what we call the summit, which we had \nhere about 2 weeks ago--a Mississippi farmer representing the cotton \ngrowers summed it up best when he said, ``I have been farming for 40 \nyears and farming has changed more in the last 4 years than it did in \nthe previous 40.'' That was a positive, not a negative. Farmers have \nswitched to higher value crops because it makes economic sense.\n  The plain and simple and sometimes painful--let me emphasize that--\nsometimes painful truth is that all U.S. producers are no longer the \nmost efficient producers of a crop, more especially wheat, in the \nworld. That is hard news to tell to somebody who is going through a \nvery difficult time, but in fact our producers are no longer the No. 1 \nproducer of wheat. When my staff, my able staff, answers the phone from \nworried and concerned farmers from Kansas, one of the things that I \ninstruct him to say is: Wake up a little bit. We are no longer the No. \n1 wheat producer--I am talking about the United States--that's China. \nWe are no longer No. 2; that's the European Union.\n  So, consequently, I think we have to look at what we can grow and be \ncompetitive with in regards to the global marketplace. I think that is \na fact. Some people, however, refuse to accept that fact. But we have a \ncompetitive advantage in the feedgrains and oil seeds, and these are \nthe exact crops that producers have shifted to under the Freedom to \nFarm bill.\n  Let me again clearly state, I am not standing here saying there are \nno problems in farm country--we have them--or that I would not like to \nsee higher prices for our producers. Would I like to see the $5 wheat \nof 2 years ago? You bet. I would like to see $6 wheat. I can give a \npretty good speech about old parity. Parity meant justice. Parity for \nwheat today is, what, $12, $13, as compared to what all the costs were \nback when the parity formula was first considered, way back in I think \nit was 1912.\n  So, to be fair, our producers ought to get $12 wheat. I can say that, \nbut I also know that when wheat production--not acreage but \nproduction--is 60-bushel wheat in my State, which is more than double \nthe level of 1996, we are not going to see any $5 wheat. And when you \nadd in the European Union and you add in China, that is simply not \ngoing to happen.\n  As hard as it may be for some to believe--and I want every farmer and \neveryone listening, in terms of agricultural program policy, to pay \nattention--our Kansas farmers and other farmers, if they are blessed by \ngood weather and good ideas, will make more in 1998 than they did in \n1996. In 1996, 20 bushels an acre was a common yield for many Kansas \nfarmers. At $5 a\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nbushel, why, farmers had gross incomes of $100 per acre. Yesterday, \nwheat closed at $2.55 in Dodge City, KS, America. On Friday, we \nreceived estimates that the 1998 Kansas wheat crop will likely average \nat a State return of around 50 bushels per acre at $2.55 a bushel, a \nprice I think is way too low. However, this figures up to a gross of \n$125 per acre.\n  In 18 years, serving as a Representative and Senator, I have yet to \nmeet a farmer who would not choose the $125 per acre over the $100 per \nacre. Obviously, it would be better if the price were higher.\n  I know that current prices are not good. However, high yields are \nallowing farmers to continue to receive an income. The facts simply do \nnot represent a crisis all throughout American agriculture. Yes, there \nare very severe problems in the northern plains. Yes, we must do \nsomething about it. But farmers in this area of the country have had to \nface a triple whammy, as evidenced so clear, and appropriately clear, \nby their Senators from those States. It is a triple whammy of floods \nand blizzards and crop disease. These are regional problems. They are \nfactors that would have occurred regardless of the farm bill, \nregardless of what agriculture policy we had in place. You simply \ncannot argue that these factors are evidence we need to rewrite the \nfarm bill.\n\n  Let me try to demonstrate how sincerely I feel about the \ndemonstration of intent on the part of the distinguished Democratic \nleader and Senators Dorgan and Conrad and Wellstone and Durbin and \nothers who have pointed out the seriousness of the situation in the \nnorthern plains. And I know that.\n  But let me quote in regard to the farm management specialist from \nNorth Dakota State University and their extension service. His name is \nDwight Aakre. He says:\n\n       Farmers in northeast North Dakota have only about a 50/50 \n     chance of paying out-of-pocket costs if they raise durum or \n     barley or flax in dry beans this year.\n\n  Boy, that is tough. They do have a problem, a very serious problem. \nHe also says--this is Dwight again:\n\n       Current expectations for harvest time prices keep dropping \n     while the cost of production, the cost of operations, do not.\n\n  And he said:\n\n       We are now approaching price levels where the best farming \n     strategy is how to consider your losses and to go forward \n     from that.\n\n  And then he says:\n\n       Ouch, it is this the combo of anemic wheat prices and wet \n     weather that has created what Senator Kent Conrad aptly calls \n     the stealth disaster for his State in that region? As for \n     this individual--\n\n  Again--I am referring to Dwight Aakre--he calculates:\n\n       It's a pretty tough time to get enough income to pay out-\n     of-pocket costs.\n\n  And he says:\n\n       It's likely too late to drop any rental land for 1998.\n\n  So you can understand why my colleagues are on the floor calling for \naction. I know that.\n  Then he said, in regard to the farm bill, however:\n\n       Contrary to popular thought--\n\n  And this is Andrew Swensen, the Farm Management Specialist for North \nDakota State University Extension Service. He said:\n\n       What caused our problems last year with wheat and barley \n     yields of poor size and quality and lower prices and high \n     cost of production [he says] is the effects of this last \n     factor especially have been underestimated by many. Don't \n     blame Freedom to Farm.\n\n  That isn't Pat Roberts, that is Andrew Swensen, from North Dakota:\n\n       Contrary to popular thought, [says Swensen] the new Freedom \n     to Farm Program was not responsible for 1997 woes. In fact, \n     he says the market transition payments it provided were \n     greater than what would have been provided under the old farm \n     program.\n       It is difficult to avoid blaming this whole situation on \n     the weather, the Government, and prices, [says Swensen] but \n     it is more productive to be realistic and analyze things that \n     can be controlled internally in your own business.\n\n  I think that is certainly true.\n  So I don't doubt or disregard the pain many producers are feeling in \nthe northern plains. However, I do point out that many of my farmers do \nhave at least some questions, and I guess if you are going through a \nsituation where you are drowning in a sea of troubles financially, you \ncan drown in 6 inches of water or 6 feet. But we have heard that this \nis a disaster that has continued for 5 or 6 consecutive years. Every \none of my colleagues over there has indicated that.\n  Kansas is known as a wheat State, yet both in 1995 and 1996, why, \nNorth Dakota led the Nation in the production of wheat. In 1996, North \nDakota was first in the production of eight crops, second in two, third \nin one, fourth in two. In 1997, why, North Dakota had the following \nnational production rankings: First in spring wheat, durum, barley, \nsunflower, dry edible beans, and canola and flax seed; second, all \nwheat, oats and honey; third, sugar beets.\n  There is very real pain being faced by the producers in North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Minnesota, some parts of Montana. If, in fact, for 6 \nyears it has been a crop disaster, if you are going to lead the Nation \nin production in these crops, that is a disaster that most farmers in \nmy State would be happy to experience.\n  I would also ask what good raising the loan rate will do if producers \nhave no crop to sell; if, in fact, this is that serious. It is \nimportant to note that many farmers did indeed suffer production losses \nduring the blizzards and the floods experienced in the northern plains \nlast year, a real tragedy. However, under the old program, why, \nproducers would have received little or no Government support. Yet, \nunder the Freedom to Farm Act, farmers in North Dakota received $244 \nmillion in transition payments in 1997. Talk about indemnity payments. \nNot only did farmers receive the Government support they would not have \nreceived under the previous program, they were also allowed to go into \nthe fields and plant substitute crops in place of the lost acres.\n  They could not have done that without the current farm bill. We have \nheard many statements on this floor about how the Government payments \nhave been yanked away from producers in North Dakota, South Dakota and \nMinnesota. I point out the average payments in 1996 and 1997 for all \nthree States exceeded the average level of Government payments in each \nState during 1991 through 1995. So if you have a bill that is providing \nmore average payments to those three States, all three States exceeding \nthe level of Government payments in each State during 1991 to 1995, \nwhere were my colleagues from 1991 to 1995? And what has changed? And \nwhat has changed is the export demand and unfair trading practices from \nCanada and the wheat disease and the weather--we have gone all over \nthat--but it sure isn't the farm bill.\n  We have been told this is the worst crisis in farm country since the \ncrisis of the eighties. Yet, let me point out in other sections of the \ncountry--not the northern plains--tractor purchases were up 15 percent \nin June over levels of a year ago, while self-propelled combine sales \nare 40 percent above year-ago levels.\n  I don't think the arguments we are hearing on the floor--they are \ncertainly true in the northern plains--but I don't think they mirror \nwhat we are hearing from producers all across the country. Mr. \nPresident, I like to think that no one has spent more time on the wagon \ntongue listening to America's farmers than I have, and I must tell you \nfrom my recent visits with producers, they are not happy. They are \nworried about current prices. They are worried about the export market. \nBut they realize in many instances why high yields have allowed them to \nmeet or even surpass their income expectations. The greatest majority \ndo not want to return to higher loan rates and loan extensions. They \nfear, and rightly so, that this would simply be the first step toward \nreturn to the narrow-focused, anticompetitive, micromanaged Government \nprograms of the past.\n  Farmers tell me the 1996 farm bill is working if we can get our \nexport demand back up to the levels that they used to be. They are \nchanging their planting decisions. They are growing the crops that \nallow them to earn the most profits. They are happy with this \nflexibility. They want to see it continue.\n  What my farmers and ranchers are telling me is that they are \nextremely concerned with the seemingly lack of\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\ntrade and foreign policy focus in Washington. Our farmers and ranchers \nrealize the United States must export nearly 40 percent of our \nagriculture products to overseas customers. Unfortunately, this is very \ndifficult to do when Congress and the President become what I call \n``sanctions happy'' and place sanctions on approximately, as I have \nindicated before, 75 countries, 70 percent of the world's population.\n  U.S. Wheat Associates recently published several depressing facts in \nregard to U.S. trade policies. In the last 10 years, the embargo on \nCuba has cost wheat producers at least $500 million in lost wheat \nsales. Iran, Libya, North Korea did represent 7 percent of the world's \nwheat market. The United States will not trade with these countries. \nAdd on the embargo of Iraq and our producers are shut off from 11 \npercent of the world wheat market.\n  I am not saying those sanctions should be immediately lifted. There \nare national security implications, obviously. The United States has \nimposed sanctions 100 times since World War II. Sixty of these have \nbeen imposed since 1993.\n  Mr. President, as Hubert Humphrey once said, ``We need to sell them \nanything that can't shoot back,'' and we are shooting ourself in the \nfoot by not allowing our producers to sell to the other countries of \nthe world. We must also give our trade negotiators the tools they need \nto open up foreign markets to U.S. products. You can't go to the trade \ngunfight with a butter knife. That was a statement by the president of \nthe Oregon Wheat Producers, and he is certainly accurate. That is what \nwe continually ask our negotiators to do. Other countries will not \nnegotiate the trade agreements with the United States because our \nnegotiators do not have fast-track trade negotiating authority.\n\n  President Clinton has blamed inaction in the trade arena since last \nNovember on the Congress' failure to pass fast track. Now, Congress is \nnot blameless. I have never seen a Congress more insular, more \nprotectionist, and more ideological in regard to trade, and I am not \nhappy with every member of my party on the Republican side who seem to \nthink we can impose sanctions or not pass MFN or not pass the IMF or \nnot go ahead with fast track. I understand their concerns. But in terms \nof doing great damage to the agriculture sector and other sectors of \nthe economy, we are not blameless either--an editorial in behalf of the \nparty with which I am associated.\n  However, our majority leader and the Speaker of the House are now \npledging a vote on fast track in the Caribbean initiative and the \nAfrican trade bill before the end of the 105th Congress. However, the \nPresident indicates he is not quite sure whether this is the time to \npass fast track. Mr. President, our farmers and ranchers respectfully \ndisagree.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues have stated that trade is \nreally not that much of the problem. I point out that approximately 1 \nmonth ago, 14 Senators met with 12 major agriculture groups and \norganizations to discuss the priorities these groups felt were \nabsolutely necessary for Congress to pass this year.\n  Rather than parroting a particular point of view or ideology or being \nlocked into your criticism of the current farm bill of 2 years ago, \nwhat we did on the Republican side is to respond to the letter sent to \nall of the leadership in the Congress by the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association \nof Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers Association--\nthere are about six left--National Cotton Council of America--I have \ntheir tie on in support of Senator Cochran in this debate--National \nGrange, National Grange Sorghum Producers Association, National Oil \nSeed Processors Association, National Pork Producers, National \nSunflower Association.\n  A letter by all of these groups was sent to the President, Secretary \nof State, Trade Representative, Secretary of Agriculture, members of \nthe House Committee on Ag, members of the House Committee on Ways and \nMeans. I guess the only one they didn't send it to is Larry King.\n  They listed all of the things that they felt--farmers felt--that we \nneeded to do in this session of the Congress to turn this thing around. \nI can go down the list: fast track, $18 billion IMF, reform of U.S. \nsanctions, administration should commit to seek agreement to end unfair \ntrade practices in the next trade negotiation round, foreign market \ndevelopment, market access program, GSM program--trade, trade, trade, \nand trade.\n  Something has to be wrong here. Either the farmers and ranchers or \nthe members of these organizations who hold meetings in counties and \nStates and pass resolutions--the tail doesn't wag the dog; they get \nthis information from farmers and ranchers--and either they are right \nor my colleagues who argue trade is not the problem at all or vice \nversa. I think I am going to go with the farm organizations.\n  I realize that some will argue that trade agreements, such as NAFTA, \nhave sold out our farmers. I agree. We have not had the appropriate \noversight in regard to NAFTA or, for that matter, GATT or, for that \nmatter, preparation of the next round of trade talks.\n  However, let me point out that the USDA Under Secretary Gus \nSchumacher, who is doing all he can in regard to our export markets \nunder very difficult circumstances, recently said in a speech in \nMinnesota that the United States would send a record number of exports \nto both Mexico and Canada in 1998. That is not a failed trade policy; \nit means simply we have regional problems where we could do a lot \nbetter.\n  Critics have stated on the Senate floor that one day we will wake up \nand discover that we are no longer the leader in agriculture exports, \njust like we lost the automotive market. Pay attention to this \nargument. It is interesting to note that many of the pitfalls suffered \nby the U.S. auto industry in the 1970s and early 1980s were based on \nits unwillingness to adapt to the desires of consumers the world over. \nCould there be a similar effect resulting from some Members' seeming \nunwillingness to allow producers to change their production practices \nto meet the demands of the world market?\n  Finally, Mr. President, not only do Republicans believe that we need \nto improve trade opportunities for our producers through fast track and \nsanctions reform and IMF funding and normal trade relations with China, \nwe must also provide viable forms of risk management for our producers. \nOne of the most important steps we can take in this area is passage of \nthe farm savings account legislation.\n  The primary sponsor in the Senate is Senator Grassley. The young \nMember of Congress who really authored this bill is Kenny Hulshof, who \nis from Missouri. We tried to do it in the farm bill considerations in \n1996. It would allow farmers to place up to 20 percent of their \nSchedule F income tax into a tax-deferred account for a period of up to \n5 years. This would allow farmers to average out the income highs and \nlows better that are common in agriculture and allow farmers to save \nmoney for those years when incomes are lower due to a reduced crop \nyield.\n  I recently joined with many other Senators in signing a letter to our \nmajority leader reconfirming our support of the farm savings account \nlegislation. This is one of the most important risk-management tools, \nMr. President, we can provide our producers. I think we are going to \npass it this year.\n  As I have said in my earlier remarks, things are far from perfect in \nfarm country, but we are far from a national crisis. It is not time to \nreinvent the wheel. We are at another one of those historical \ncrossroads in agriculture policy. I am sorry the situation has \ndeveloped on our export demand--that it is so severe. We can choose to \nreturn to the failed policies of the past and put our farmers and \nproducers at a competitive disadvantage on the world market at the same \ntime our dependence on world markets continues to increase. Or, we can \ntake the necessary steps to provide our producers and our trade \nnegotiators with the tools necessary to open foreign markets and meet \nthe demands of the world market.\n  My colleagues are correct, the choices we make here today, and in the \nnext few months, may very well affect the future of agriculture in the \nUnited States. My hope is that we continue to look with our producers \ntoward the future and not into the rearview mirror and the broken \npolicies of the past.\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n  I want to make some very brief additional comments in regard to the \nfact that this is an even-numbered year.\n  At the beginning of this debate, this discussion that is most \nrelevant to the difficulty we face in farm country, a number of my \nfriends across the aisle have gone out of their way to mention me \npersonally--I think I appreciate that--and very candidly, very frankly, \nblame most, if not all, of agriculture's problems on what is called the \nFreedom to Farm bill.\n  I know and I realize and accept that it is an even-numbered year. And \nwhen there are strong differences of opinion in even-numbered years, \nthe chances for just a tad bit of politics to enter into the debate are \npretty good. In this case, a tad has become a deluge.\n  I truly appreciated the kind remarks of the distinguished Democratic \nleader in reference to our friendship, even my alleged sense of humor. \nIn that regard, I take the job and my responsibility very seriously, \nbut not myself. But after listening to my colleagues go on and on and \non, blaming all our problems on the new farm bill, I think you have to \nhave a sense of humor.\n  The northern plains have experienced very bad weather. It is very \nreal. You would think that Freedom to Farm was El Nino. The northern \nplains have experienced wheat disease for 6 years running. You would \nthink the disease came from the Freedom to Farm bill.\n  By the way, I am at least gratified that after 6 years of wheat \ndisease, my colleagues have now requested the targeted research funds \nto address this problem. And we should do that.\n  The Asian flu and sanctions and the lack of an aggressive and \ncoherent trade policy are--or as the farm organizations simply put it \nto me yesterday, the failure of the administration and the Congress to \nuse all of our export tools has played havoc in our markets.\n  My colleagues mention that with the wave of a hand--so much for \nsupply and demand--must be the fault of the Freedom to Farm bill. The \nseven or so distinguished Senators who have been railing against and \nblaming the farm bill are the same seven who bitterly opposed it during \nthe farm bill debate 2 years ago, voted against it, and recommended \nthat the President veto it. He did not. It is  an understatement to say \nthey have not given up and will not.\n\n  If the good Lord is not willing and the creeks do not rise or if the \ncreeks rise too much, blame the farm bill.\n  Can we end this partisan book-shelving of Freedom to Farm? I know it \nis not perfect. It is a work in progress. No bill is perfect. But I \nthink it is a foundation. Can we build upon what is a good foundation? \nCan we seriously consider proposals that do not break the budget, or \nreturn us to the old command-and-control and residual-supply \nagricultural days? Can we shoot straight, Mr. President, with producers \nwho are experiencing serious problems, and quit promising more than can \nbe delivered, or should be delivered?\n  Let us fix crop insurance. Let us get cracking on an aggressive \nexport policy free of sanctions. Let us finish the job with tax policy \nchanges and regulatory reform. Let us commit to appropriate research to \nfight the plant disease. And let us pass this week--this week, if we \ncould; next week--the farm savings account, and, yes, let us consider \nsome form of payment.\n  The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on Ag Appropriations \nhas indicated to me that the President would declare the State of \nFlorida, because of fires, eligible for disaster assistance. The same \nkind of thing could apply to the northern plains States. Of course they \nare hurting. There may be an opportunity here.\n  In view of what has happened to our markets--no fault of our farmers \nand ranchers--I would favor emergency sanction indemnity payments. If \nyou are going to spend $4 billion, for goodness' sakes, call it an \nemergency. Why would you put it in a loan rate that keeps the price \nbelow approximately $3? You ought to give it to the farmer. Let us do \nall of this, and more, to build upon and improve the current farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be \nprinted in the Record. I call them the ``Set the Record Straight \nArticles.'' I call them to the attention of all of my colleagues, \nespecially those so critical of current policy. It ought to be required \nreading for them.\n  As I have said before, the Freedom to Farm bill is not sacrosanct. It \nis far from perfect. There is no perfect legislation. It is a work in \nprogress, should not be discarded.\n  I originally thought, in coming to the floor, I would not take so \nmuch of the time of my colleagues and the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi. I thought the proper course of debate would be to simply \nignore some of the commentary--basically accentuate the positive, \neliminate the negative, and do not mess with Mr. In-Between. That was \nmy original plan. But given the tidal wave of criticism, I think we \nalso have the responsibility to set the record straight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Pro Farmer outlining \nwhat Speaker Gingrich has indicated their agenda is in the House to be \nof help, be printed; and, finally, an article by Gregg Doud of World \nPerspectives, who did an analysis, and he calls it the ``Anatomy of a \nRegional Farm Crisis.''\n  I urge that all Senators--if they could find the time to really get \nat the bottom of what we are facing in regard to this farm crisis--read \nthis. This goes into considerable detail. It is painful. It is painful \nto go through a transition when you are not competitive in the world \nmarket or, for that matter, the domestic market. But Gregg certainly \ntells it how it is. And I think all of these articles certainly set the \nrecord straight. And, again, I ask unanimous consent that these \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Inside Washington Today, June 26, 1998]\n\n         House Speaker Speaks Out on Critical Ag, Trade Issues\n\n                          (By Jim Wiesemeyer)\n\n       It is unusual for a top hitter like Speaker of the House \n     Newt Gingrich to wrap his arms around so many major issues \n     impacting agriculture and trade. But that he did Thursday in \n     a joint press briefing attended by other House Republicans, \n     including Ag Committee Chairman Bob Smith (R-Oregon).\n       Today's dispatch focuses on the agenda Gingrich and Company \n     said will prevail this summer and fall. And that agenda, if \n     realized, would set a very firm foundation for U.S. \n     agriculture's future, both near-term and especially over the \n     long haul.\n       Gingrich's top-five priorities for action to be taken \n     before Congress ends its 105th session:\n       A vote on fast-track trade authority by September.\n       Bipartisan agreement on reform of and funding for the \n     International Monetary Fund (IMF);\n       A vote on renewing normal trade status for China;\n       Legislative action on exempting financial assistance for \n     exports of agricultural commodities from international \n     sanctions;\n       Efforts to significantly increase pressure on the European \n     Union regarding agricultural subsidies and anti-competitive \n     trade practices.\n       Let's takes those five priorities one important step at a \n     time:\n       Fast track: Gingrich is committed to scheduling a vote this \n     September. And the House Speaker says supports were ``within \n     eight votes'' of passage last fall. Odds for passage this \n     year in the House would improve rather dramatically under \n     House Ag Committee Chairman Bob Smith's proposal. Smith says \n     he could round up the needed House votes by altering a \n     pending bill to increase the role of the Ag Committee in \n     working with the Clinton administration before a trade \n     agreement is initiated.\n       I've mentioned Smith's proposal before--it was included in \n     his letter to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. \n     It would create a requirement that the administration consult \n     with congressional committees before it initials a trade \n     accord Under Smith's approach, this means the House and \n     Senate ag panels would have the same rights as the House Ways \n     & Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee--the usual \n     trade policy kingpin committees.\n       Reports have surfaced that in a June 18 letter to Rep. \n     Smith, Barshefsky informed Smith that the administration \n     supported a provision similar to his during last year's fast-\n     track debate and thus would continue to do so. (However, the \n     U.S. Trade Rep's office says the proposal had not been \n     returned late June 25.)\n       What about the White House and Democrats? Gingrich says he \n     believes the Clinton administration will ``do everything it \n     can to help pass this when it comes up in September.''\n       White House reaction: On June 19, White House spokesman \n     Mike McCurry said he was not aware of a renewed effort to \n     past fast track, but said the administration would \n     ``welcome'' such a step. Well, they've got it.\n       The Senate already has the votes to past fast track in my \n     judgment. And that's what Gingrich says is the conclusion he \n     got after speaking with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-\n     Miss.).\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\n       But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said that \n     while he would support efforts to resurrect fast track, given \n     the degree to which it is controversial, ``it may be \n     difficult to bring up in the short time we have left'' in the \n     current Congress--with less than 40 legislative days in the \n     session.\n       The House must act first on trade legislation because it is \n     considered a revenue measure.\n       Botton line: It's been a slow-track to fast-track, but its \n     getting there.\n       IMF funding and reform: Gingrich says it might be necessary \n     to fund the IMF at less than the $18 billion the United \n     States has promised to provide.\n       That suggests the $18 billion amount is open to \n     negotiation. Congressional sources say the final result on \n     this topic depends on how many IMF reforms Republicans can \n     get the White House to swallow (this is the most contentious \n     area on this topic as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has \n     focused his attention on the matter.)\n       Gingrich is mum on what level of IMF funding will likely \n     come out of the Republican-controlled Congress. But he \n     admitted the problems in Asia and Russia have sensitized the \n     need for Congress to act.\n       Gingrich still faces some naysayers in his own party. Rep. \n     Tom DeLay (R-Texas), who is the House Majority Whip, says \n     ``Giving the IMF more money is not a panacea for all the \n     troubles that bedevil the Asian economy. In fact, in many \n     instances, the IMF is the problem, not the solution.''\n       I agree in many ways with DeLay's comments, but the IMF has \n     suddenly (and prudently) changed its previous take-no-\n     prisoners' stance at reforming the very impacted Asian \n     countries.\n       The White House and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-\n     Mo.) calls the financing of the IMF a more pressing issue \n     than fast track. Gephardt predicts there would be enough \n     Democrats and Republicans to support IMF legislation. He said \n     he thinks Republicans ``are hearing loud and clear from the \n     business community that they think this is a risky business \n     (delaying IMF funding). And I think you're going to see more \n     and more Republicans coming to the view that we ought to take \n     up that legislation.''.\n       Bottom line: The ongoing Asian financial crisis is leading \n     some previous naysaying lawmakers to at least reassess their \n     prior stance. More IMF money is coming. Perhaps not the $18 \n     billion. And there will be some needed IMF reform strings \n     attached to it.\n       A vote on renewing normal trade relations/MFN with China. \n     The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday came out \n     strongly in favor of granting China normal trade status.\n       Gingrich says ``There are no practical grounds for cutting \n     off American producers, American agriculture, and American \n     companies'' from the Chinese market, despite concerns about \n     transfer of missile technology and illegal campaign \n     contributions. A better way to say this cannot be found.\n       Bottom line: This is the easiest one to call--it's not a \n     question of if but when China gets the ``normal'' trade \n     status moniker. That is of course assuming the country \n     doesn't make any major stupid moves to upset an election-year \n     Congress.\n       Exempt financial assistance to ag commodities from U.S. \n     sanctions: The House on June 24 passed a bill (HR 4101) that \n     has an amendment lifting sanctions on Pakistan. The House Ag \n     panel also has passed a bill (HR 3654) that would life ag \n     sanctions. The Clinton administration says it supports the \n     pending legislation.\n       Increase pressure on the EU for its ag subsidies and anti-\n     competitive trade practices. I have two words for this \n     priority: good luck.\n       They should have added Canada to the list. For example, \n     Canada on Thursday declined to conduct a full financial audit \n     of its wheat board. The United States says it will keep \n     ``pressing'' the issue.\n       USDA General Sales Manager Chris Goldthwait says Canada \n     ``agreed to an audit of durum (wheat) only. We (U.S.), of \n     course, had asked for a full audit, including sales to third \n     countries, and will continue to press them on that.''\n       The U.S. wants an audit because it suspects the Canadian \n     Wheat Board is subsidizing Canadian growers--in violation of \n     international trade rules.\n       Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) says Canada's outright refusal \n     to conduct an audit is proof positive that it is subsidizing \n     its wheat farmers. He labeled it a ``national travesty'' that \n     the United States has not been able to convince Canada to \n     conduct the full audit.\n       It didn't take long for an official at the Canadian Embassy \n     here in Washington to put the word out that Canada's Wheat \n     Board does not subsidize exports.\n       One Canadian official says the Canadian government wanted \n     to limit the scope of the audit, due to cost. What? Heck, the \n     U.S. Congress spends more money than a drunken sailor, so \n     they should take Canada for its word and put the money. But \n     frankly, if history prevails, another reason will float out \n     as to why Canada shouldn't and won't oblige.\n       Bottom line: We must think smarter and be tougher. Until we \n     get U.S. trade officials who consistently, fervently, and \n     smartly keep up successful attacks on trade-distorting \n     policies in the EU and other places (Canada for one), U.S. \n     agriculture will continue to face an uphill battle in \n     significantly boosting its export potential in the years \n     ahead. Market access is one thing; getting countries to \n     fulfill on prior pledges is another.\n       The best statement Gingrich made on these topics is when he \n     said, ``the only country economically strong enough to keep \n     the world economy moving forward is the United States. The \n     trick is for us to send a signal that we want a stronger and \n     more vibrant world market, and that means a strong vote on \n     fast track.\n       And if we don't get fast track and the hoped-for result of \n     improved market access for competitive U.S. agricultural \n     products, the trick will be on U.S. agribusiness which is in \n     the process of pursuing structural and farm policy reforms to \n     gear up for the perceived growth years ahead for the export \n     market--both in volume and market share.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Anatomy of a Regional Farm Crisis\n\n                            (By Gregg Doud)\n\n       There is no ``crisis'' in U.S. agriculture today. Even \n     though grain prices are at multi-year lows and livestock \n     prices are also in the doldrums, it must be realized that \n     agricultural is a cyclical business. Anyone would have to \n     expect that after 20-year-highs in world grain prices, the \n     pendulum would eventually swing. After all, it's taken at \n     least the last 100 years figuring out that the ebb and flow \n     of supply and demand explain price and that agricultural \n     commodity markets literally ebb and flow with the wind.\n       What hasn't been so obvious, however, is that little more \n     than plain and simple greed drives farmers, over time, to \n     produce at a level that covers little more than their \n     variable costs of production. In other words, very few \n     farmers have not wanted to farm the entire county in which \n     they reside. Every year it's the same old, ``I'll gamble and \n     extend myself a little this year, because if I don't my \n     neighbor will have an advantage over me.''\n       Applying this classic psychology to northwest Minnesota and \n     northeast North Dakota where there certainly is a regional \n     production agriculture crisis going on these days, is the \n     first step in understanding just what is now causing \n     producers to go bankrupt and what policies and actions, if \n     any, are to blame.\n       A recent study by North Dakota State University (NDSU) says \n     production costs for producers in the Red River Valley \n     (again, northwest Minnesota and northeast North Dakota) have \n     increased by 71 percent since 1991 although yields in this \n     predominantly spring wheat and barley producing area have not \n     changed. The report estimated that costs of production in \n     this region of the country range anywhere from $11 to as much \n     as $200 per acre for wheat and/or barley. By comparison, the \n     average northcentral Kansas total variable cash costs are $82 \n     per acre and fixed costs are $35.53 per acre for a $118 per \n     acre total. (Source: Kansas State University) Much of these \n     added production costs in the Red River Valley include \n     fungicides and herbicides and increased fertilizer costs \n     associated with disease problems and an overabundance of \n     rainfall in recent years.\n       It seems that where the Red River Valley separates itself, \n     however, is with regard to land costs. In central North \n     Dakota, cash rental rates typically run between $25 and $30 \n     per acre (30 bushels per acre wheat). In the Red River \n     Valley, though, NDSU put the average rental rate at $57.75 \n     per acre and the average land value at $850 per acre. In \n     comparison, good dry-land wheat farmground in northcentral \n     Kansas these days that has a wheat production capability very \n     similar to the Red River Valley goes for about $450-500 per \n     acre. Remarkably, the disparity in land values is even larger \n     when one considers that property taxes in Minnesota are some \n     of the highest in the nation.\n       These numbers are important as they bring to light one of \n     the major factors influencing this crisis. There is no way a \n     Red River Valley wheat and barley producer can stay in \n     business and pay these prices for cash rent or land \n     ownership! The NDSU report suggested that a barley crop can \n     cover about 50 percent of the cost of production while wheat \n     will cover about 85 percent of total costs. These examples \n     quickly illustrate the biggest obstacle Red River Valley's \n     small grain producers face--their land is overpriced for the \n     crops they are trying to grow. Or is it? There is a reason \n     for this seemingly mad behavior and it's probably not too \n     surprising that its roots are derived from another U.S. \n     government commodity program.\n       In this region of the country, sugar beets are the money \n     crop as producers can gross $700 per acre and net $150. \n     However, in order to ``get in'' a producer must buy stock in \n     the sugar beet corporation or co-op and that stock translates \n     into the number of acres of beets the producer can plant. \n     Apparently sugar beet stock trades just like land and is \n     worth about 1-1\\1/2\\ times what the land is worth. Stock \n     offerings have recently expanded to acquire more acreage.\n       Although there is a tariff rate import quota, these returns \n     have driven up cash rental rates to $120 per acre or more in \n     beet production areas. This wide discrepancy between these \n     $25 per acre cash rental rates in the central part of the \n     state and $120 per acre for beets has provided a wide window \n     of opportunity for non-sugar beet landowners with an average \n     $57.75 per acre rental rate the result.\n       Coming along once again to further complicate these \n     seemingly unjustifiable rates, however, is the USDA and its \n     ``prairie pothole'' designation as part of the Conservation \n     Reserve Program (CRP). Some would argue that while the \n     approximate average of a $55 per acre CRP rental rate doesn't \n     necessarily drive up regional rental rates, the\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n     special designation makes it easier for landowners to get \n     into the program. It is this threat that is causing renting \n     producers to bid enough to keep the land in production \n     despite the fact that paying these rates is not economically \n     justifiable.\n       When Red River Valley producers have to pay ``too much'' \n     for fixed or capital investments, it means there is little or \n     no room for error when it comes to anything connected with \n     either price (marketing), yield (gross returns), or \n     management decisions. However, since problems do occur \n     because of poor weather, etc., producers have to insure \n     themselves by utilizing risk management tools such as crop \n     insurance and the futures market.\n       Managing risk is the most difficult part of farming and \n     every producer knows there is no such thing as a ``perfect \n     hedge.'' One often used risk management tool is the Federal \n     Crop Insurance program. However, Red River Valley spring \n     wheat producers in recent years have exposed a few holes in \n     this program when it comes to dealing with scab damaged \n     wheat.\n\n\n                  is better crop insurance the answer?\n\n       Federal Crop Insurance indemnity payments are based on \n     yield losses. If a producer's average wheat yield is 40 \n     bushels/acre and insurance with a typical 65 percent coverage \n     level is purchased, that equates to 26.5 bushels per acre of \n     coverage multiplied by $3.50 per bushel, or $92.75 per acre \n     of coverage. While this is still below the cost of \n     production, it's certainly better than nothing. In the Red \n     River Valley, participation in the Federal Crop Insurance \n     program is very high although it has begun to decline \n     somewhat. However, problems occur with this program when \n     wheat is infested with scab damage.\n       Scab damage greatly reduces the quality of the wheat while \n     sometimes having only a minor impact on yields. Research \n     indicates that the Actual Production History (APH) on which \n     Federal Crop Insurance is based has fallen by about five \n     bushels per acre on the Minnesota side of the valley, but on \n     the North Dakota side there is no overall decline. In fact, \n     there has been a slight increase in the North Dakota barley \n     APH. (Note: This describes county aggregates. Some individual \n     producers may be greatly impacted by their lower APH levels.)\n       Since the APH is based on a five-year moving average yield \n     and there have been three to four years of problems in this \n     region, lower APHs are unavoidable and present a significant \n     problem for the producer. The primary area of concern \n     involves some 18 counties in eastern North Dakota and 10 \n     in western Minnesota. While there are some instances of \n     significant declines (20 bushels per acre) in APH levels, \n     the bulk of the counties in North Dakota actually \n     fluctuates between +/- 4 percent. An APH change of 4 \n     percent, with a 40 bushel per acre yield, would add $5.60 \n     per acre to the indemnity payment using the example above.\n       Some have suggested that USDA ``give'' or reset the APH \n     levels in these areas to provide relief to the producer. To \n     this regard, there will be a pilot program in 1999 that will \n     look into alternative ways of calculating an APH. However, \n     officials have some concern about the impact of having other \n     parts of the country essentially subsidize the program in \n     this particular region.\n\n\n                             quality losses\n\n       The more serious income problem also not addressed by \n     federal crop insurance is a result of the drastic changes in \n     discount schedules the marketing system has instituted as a \n     result of scab disease problems. In 1993, when scab damage \n     first entered the scene, the market severely discounted non-\n     millable quality wheat in a range of between 50 and 80 cents \n     per bushel. Discounts typically deal with the quantity of \n     total defects and test weight losses and are usually larger \n     in times of higher prices.\n       Since that time, cleaning equipment has been installed and \n     the market has done a better job of segregating quality. This \n     past year a typical discount was about 20 cents per bushel. \n     In all cases, however, neither crop insurance, the futures \n     market, nor any other government program could provide the \n     producer a mechanism of risk management for these income \n     losses.\n       USDA's federal crop insurance program does not factor in an \n     offset for losses until the quantity of damaged kernels \n     exceeds 10 percent (making it U.S. Grade #5 wheat). Even at \n     that point, the program only provides a 1 percent increase in \n     the production account for 11 percent damage. This level of \n     damage, however, would likely relegate a particular parcel of \n     wheat to a price on par with corn.\n       Scab damage is again a concern in the Red River Valley this \n     year as a large portion of the Valley's wheat crop is now \n     flowering and standing in water due to recent heavy rains. \n     Quality premiums and discounts could well end up being more \n     important price discovery factors than the futures market \n     this year if disease once again breaks out. The Federal Crop \n     Insurance program's ability to better address quality and \n     value losses could be of great benefit to these producers. \n     The concern is that adjustments in these quality provisions \n     could impede market signals.\n       A third minor option being discussed is to define an \n     additional ``unit level'' within the structure of the Federal \n     Crop Insurance program by combining ``all owned'' land with \n     ``all crop shared'' into one ``enterprise unit.'' This might \n     provide for lower premiums, but this is very minor in \n     relation to the overall regional farm income situation.\n       All of the above, however, is not enough to explain or \n     resolve the distress for the entire region although a few \n     changes to the crop insurance program would provide at least \n     some assistance. These changes may also help turn the tide of \n     decreasing participation in the Federal Crop Insurance \n     program in this region.\n       A better approach would be the whole-farm-based Farm \n     Production Insurance Corporation (FPIC) proposed by World \n     Perspectives' CEO Carole Brookins. This program would deliver \n     business interruption insurance and whole farm equity \n     protection rather than a price-times-yield insurance coverage \n     that has to be modified for every new situation that arises.\n\n\n                    Making Better Business Decisions\n\n       One piece of WPI advice to producers is that when they find \n     themselves in a hole, stop digging. Most U.S. grain farmers \n     learned during the mid-1980s that bigger is not necessarily \n     better. Farmers in the region say that one of the most unique \n     characteristics of this regional crisis is that many \n     producers have not stopped spending money. The truth is that \n     farmers may be greedy, but when they have money, they spend \n     it.\n       In the instances of producers still sitting on large \n     quantities of old-crop grain, many had the opportunity to \n     sell wheat at $3.75 per bushel last fall, but chose instead \n     to put the crop under loan. Although hindsight is always 20/\n     20, it would appear that in this case, the lure of $8 per \n     bushel soybeans, $5 per bushel wheat and $3 per bushel corn \n     clouded judgment at a very inopportune time. Will this crisis \n     finally provide adequate encouragement for producers to seek \n     other less risky methods of acquiring higher prices for their \n     crops? Heaven only knows.\n       Farming is a cyclical business and it appears that the \n     dairy business is doing quite well and grain prices may be \n     turning the corner. Alternatively, WPI expects to see land \n     values stagnate or possibly even decline slightly along with \n     reductions in cash rental rates in relation to commodity \n     prices. The grain market reacts to global events and right \n     now there seems to be plenty of supply amid sluggish demand. \n     WPI notes, however, that it's always interesting to see how \n     politicians try to spin these circumstances to justify their \n     policy positions.\n       Summer is quickly approaching and it's an even numbered \n     year. All seats of the House of Representatives and one-third \n     of the Senate seats are up for election. The current \n     political landscape suggests that the majority in the House \n     of Representatives is also up for grabs. There are probably \n     about 15 House seats out of the 435 that may well decide who \n     holds the majority and nearly all involve rural districts.\n       As a result, U.S. farm policy is caught in the middle of a \n     raging battle of partisan politics with House Democrats \n     claiming that Freedom to Farm has failed and Republicans \n     decrying the Administration's approach to trade. House \n     Republicans have also seen the non-use of Export Enhancement \n     Program (EEP) during periods of low domestic prices as an \n     opportunity to needle the Administration.\n       Both these postures are fatally flawed as they are old-\n     school agricultural economics and in the real world producers \n     see this for what it really is: political grandstanding. \n     Producers have liked their freedom to farm and it has helped \n     them realize that their income comes from the marketplace and \n     not from Washington.\n       Possibly the most unfortunate consequence of this entire \n     situation is that producers all across the country made \n     significant capital expenditures during this period of high \n     commodity prices and large transition payments in the last \n     few years. In fact, a number of these expenditures were \n     likely made to reduce taxable income. To address this \n     situation, Congress has proposed the Farm and Ranch Risk \n     Management (FARRM) program that would allow producers a five-\n     year window in which to defer up to 20 percent annually of \n     their taxable income. Income, however, could not be deferred \n     for more than five years. This is an excellent way to address \n     the highs and lows of farm income. It's just too bad that it \n     wasn't in place before now.\n       The best option in dealing with scab is still crop \n     rotation. Producers can also opt for chemical control, but \n     this makes little economic sense unless both yields and \n     prices are high. Increasing the loan rate for wheat will \n     only impede this need for rotation. Raising loan rates \n     will only serve to mute market signals and missed market \n     signals will certainly lead to lower farm income. Tweaking \n     the crop insurance program will help, but it doesn't do \n     much to address the fundamental farm economics of the \n     region.\n       One important element that should be arrived at based on \n     these discussions is that there just isn't a lot that \n     policymakers can do without distorting price discovery in the \n     marketplace. Yes, there is a regional farm income crisis in \n     the U.S. Northern Plains, but it is not a U.S. crisis. Also, \n     there are no easy answers. There is, however, a series of \n     steps over time that can be taken to remedy the situation \n     including opening markets and decreasing regulation.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Although it is probably unavoidable in an even-numbered \n     year, WPI deplores the demagoguery in agricultural policy at \n     anytime, but particularly when it occurs during a crisis \n     situation. It is quite clear that deficiency payments would \n     have been less than transition payments and that the 1996 \n     Freedom to\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n     Farm Act and little, if anything, to do with the Red River \n     Valley's unfortunate situation over much of the last five \n     years. it is the responsibility of agricultural policymakers, \n     however, to see that appropriate research funding is \n     available to eventually find a solution to the problem and to \n     develop a better safety net. However, there is a big \n     difference between a so-called safety net and a free \n     indemnity payment.\n       Local newspaper editorials written by farmers in this \n     region are not telling other farmers that if they can't \n     produce wheat at a $3.00-$3.25 per bushel breakeven point \n     they have a problem. WPI adds that, hopefully, these \n     producers have less of a problem growing something else \n     besides wheat. Ultimately, it will be the market which \n     decides whether or not there is a problem, or in other words, \n     whether this wheat really needs to be produced.\n       It is unfortunate that high commodity prices and government \n     payments have masked the severity of scab disease in this \n     region. While many farmers in other places were able to \n     recover financially as a result of these high prices, those \n     in scab country were just postponing reality. Some farmers in \n     this region appear to have been betting that the scab problem \n     would simply go away. It hasn't and these producers are now \n     in trouble.\n       In today's global wheat market, many U.S. regions and/or \n     producers would not fall into the low-cost producer category. \n     However, as of yet, WPI is not sure how well the market has \n     communicated this message. This message will eventually be \n     delivered and it may just be that wheat producers in the Red \n     River Valley are the first ones to receive delivery. There is \n     a siren blaring and it's calling for producers to rotate out \n     of wheat production. Producers need to be able to hear it. \n     They also need to make better business decisions.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \nexcellent remarks of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I think he \nput in perspective the challenges that face American agriculture, \nparticularly out in the northern plains. But he also, I think, put in \nproper perspective the legislative history and the effort that was \nmade, on a bipartisan basis, and with the approval of this President, \nto authorize farm programs that meet the modern needs of farmers, do \nnot solve all the problems, but within the context of Federal \nlegislation give farmers an opportunity to operate their farms in the \ncontext of a global economy, within the limits of the Federal budget \nthat has been constrained in recent years, and with a predictability \nabout the future, with rights of flexibility, with rights of choice on \nthe part of farmers as to what they plan and how they manage their farm \noperation.\n  The distinguished Senator has been a very important leader in \nagriculture and I think, in listening to his remarks, it is clear to \nall of us why he has been chosen and why his advice is so often taken \nhere in the U.S. Senate and when he was chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, and why he has been such an effective leader \nthroughout the country on agriculture issues. It also shows us that we \nare in a situation now where we have to make a choice.\n  We have before us a resolution offered by Senators Harkin and Daschle \nstating the problems in some sectors of the country in agriculture and \ncalling on the Congress and the President to take action in response to \nthese problems. I support the general tone and the general sense that \nis contained in that resolution, and I hope the Senate will work its \nwill soon and adopt this resolution. If it has to be modified, let's \nmodify it and then move on to specific amendments. We have a list of \namendments.\n  As we started the consideration of this bill, which we had been \nadvised Senators wanted the Senate to consider, there were about 50 \namendments. We have worked our way down to a point now where it is a \nlittle less than 40. We have sent out hotline requests to Senators' \noffices to let us know what their intentions are in terms of specific \namendments. Give us the benefit of the suggestions. Let us look at \nthem. Senator Bumpers and I will try to accommodate Senators' requests \nwhere we can, and get the reaction of the administration to other \nsuggestions Senators make for amendments and work our way through those \namendments to final passage of the bill. We would like to get that done \ntonight if we could. It is probably not realistic to expect to complete \naction within the next 2 hours. But I would like to do that. Then we \ncould turn to other appropriations bills tomorrow.\n  The majority leader has already indicated that we will not be in late \ntonight. Certainly we ought to be able to finish this bill at least at \nan early hour tomorrow. But to accommodate the requests and the \ninterests that we all have in moving along expeditiously on the passage \nof appropriations bills, we need to have the cooperation of Senators. \nThe first order of business is to deal with this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  I have suggested to some Senators on this side of the aisle that if \nthey have suggestions for changes in that resolution, let us know about \nit, and we will take them up with the authors of the resolution and see \nif we can pass that resolution within the next several minutes. I hope \nwe can do that.\n\n\n                               Cosmetics\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to commend my friend, the \nSenator from Mississippi, for his stewardship of this important bill.\n  I rise today to voice my great concern about FDA's recent announced \ncutbacks in its cosmetic regulatory program. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a copy of the letter that I sent to the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee on April 23d \nwhich details my concerns about FDA's proposed cuts in the cosmetics \nprogram.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Agencies, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I wanted to bring to your attention a \n     matter concerning the funding of the Food and Drug \n     Administration's (FDA) regulatory program for cosmetics. \n     While I am mindful of how difficult appropriations allocation \n     decisions are given the discretionary budgetary caps we \n     enacted last year, I know that you have consistently worked \n     over the years to see that the FDA would have adequate \n     funding for its vital consumer protection mission.\n       It has come to my attention that FDA has recently informed \n     the cosmetic industry of its intent to decrease substantially \n     both the personnel and financial resources devoted toward its \n     cosmetics regulatory program. I am concerned that this \n     misguided decision will have untoward results for the \n     millions or our citizens who use these products literally \n     every day.\n       Let me just cite a few examples of the types of important \n     activities that FDA plans to reduce, or outright eliminate, \n     supposedly on the grounds that these activities are low \n     priority. On the chopping block is the voluntary registration \n     program whereby manufacturers currently register their \n     products and facilities so that FDA's compliance activities \n     are conducted effectively and efficiently. To eliminate such \n     a program--a program that was successfully implemented in a \n     spirit of voluntary cooperation between the regulated \n     industry and the FDA--in an attempt to capture relatively \n     meager short term budget savings may in practice only go to \n     prove the wisdom in the old adage ``penny wise and pound \n     foolish.'' It just seems to me that this voluntary program \n     provides vital information to FDA in terms of investigating \n     adverse reaction reports, noncompliant products, and dilatory \n     companies.\n       In addition, as I understand the situation, FDA has \n     indicated that it will essentially completely phase out its \n     consumer and manufacturer assistance program. Without this \n     capability to monitor and respond to the technical issues \n     attendant to cosmetics safety, I fear that the public health \n     could be jeopardized.\n       The FDA cosmetic oversight program has been characterized \n     by collaboration between the agency and the industry and this \n     spirit of cooperation has succeeded in helping the industry \n     sustain its strong record of product safety and consumer \n     satisfaction. Without the FDA's visible presence and high \n     standards, we may be unintentionally creating a climate that \n     the irresponsible and unscrupulous will find irresistible. To \n     allow FDA to backslide in the area of cosmetics can only \n     prove unfortunate to the consumers of these products.\n       FDA is charged with implementing one of the most important \n     consumer protection laws--the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. \n     We must not acquiesce to FDA's attempt to take short-sighted \n     budgetary actions that will inevitably diminish the \n     protection afforded consumers of cosmetics under this \n     longstanding statutory scheme. Congress should act to keep \n     ``cosmetics'' prominent in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.\n       In its FY 1999 Justification of Estimates for \n     Appropriations Committees and Performance Plan to the \n     Congress, FDA ``zeroes out'' the current budgetary line item \n     for cosmetics with the following terse footnote: ``Cosmetics \n     monitoring is phased out in FYs 1998 and 1999. FDA will \n     continue its activities at the center level.'' I believe that \n     the best way to structure the budget is to target specific \n     funds for the cosmetic regulatory program in\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\n     the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). \n     Such a decision will send an unambiguous message to FDA that \n     Congress considers appropriate cosmetic regulation to be an \n     important FDA function, and that we expect appropriated funds \n     to be allocated for that purpose in the usual line item \n     fashion.\n       While I know that new funds--not reallocated funds--would \n     be preferable but difficult to secure, I hope that the \n     Subcommittee will conclude that a relatively modest \n     investment will go a long way for consumer protection in this \n     area. Specifically, I recommend that the Subcommittee \n     appropriate an additional $6 million in the FDA budget to be \n     earmarked for the cosmetic program in CFSAN. This sum may \n     represent a small fraction of the total FDA budget but it can \n     provide a great difference for the millions of consumers of \n     such commonly used products as soaps, shampoos, deodorants, \n     and makeup and fragrances.\n       I thank you in advance for your consideration of this \n     request. I want to work with you on this issue and I will do \n     what I can to help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the bottom line of this letter was to urge \nthe Chairman and members of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nto increase funding for the cosmetics program to $6 million.\n  I am pleased that the Report accompanying the Senate bill encourages \nthe FDA to restore funding for this program to the funding levels of \nprevious years. Because nearly every American uses a cosmetic product \neach day, it is important that the regulatory program for cosmetics in \nthe Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Office of Cosmetics \nand Colors be adequately funded. I understand that our colleagues on \nthe House side have wisely provided an increase of $2.5 million to keep \nthis program at previous funding levels.\n  I would hope that we can work with our colleagues in the other \nchamber to see that the final version of this bill that emerges from \nconference does indeed contain the $2.5 million increase that the House \nprovides and would restore the cosmetic program to the $6 million \nlevel.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Utah for his remarks. I can \ntell him that we will try to do everything we can to restore the cuts \nin FDA's cosmetics program.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma has \nbrought to my attention concerns relating to the Food Distribution \nProgram for Indian Reservation (FDPIR) program administered by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Specifically, USDA regulations prohibit \nOklahoma Indian tribes distributing commodity goods under FDPIR to \ntribal members in population area that exceed 10,000 persons. I have \nbeen made aware this prohibition does not exist in other states. As a \nresult, Oklahoma tribes are placed in a different category from tribes \nadministering FDPIR commodity programs.\n  To address the concerns raised by the Choctaw Nation, I would request \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the appropriate \nOklahoma state agencies, review the current regulations with respect to \nthe FDPIR program in Oklahoma and take any necessary regulatory action \nto ensure tribal members receive adequate commodity services from the \nmost appropriate provider.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the concerns raised by the Senator from \nOklahoma, and would make a similar request of the Secretary with \nrespect to this matter.\n\n\n             Motion to Waive Budget Act--Amendment No. 2729\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted on a motion \nmade by Senator Daschle, the distinguished Minority Leader, which would \nhave waived the Budget Act with respect to a point of order raised \nagainst his tobacco amendment to S. 2159, the Department of Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I voted against the Daschle motion because I believe that, after \nhaving debated tobacco legislation for nearly four weeks, the time has \ncome for the Senate to move forward on the pending appropriations \nbills. Although I appreciate the Minority Leader's heartfelt desire to \nsee a tobacco bill enacted during this Congress, I also appreciate the \nfact that that goal is not likely to be met in the few remaining days \nbefore adjournment. Thus, prolonging this issue is not, in my opinion, \nin the Senate's best interest.\n  Mr. President, while I could not support the Minority Leader's motion \nto waive the Budget Act in this particular case, I will not, of course, \nrule out supporting such a motion in the future. Should we, as the \nminority Members of this body, continue to be effectively precluded \nfrom offering amendments, I would then be willing to join my colleagues \nin seeking to have those amendments debated on any available \nlegislative vehicle.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the spending \nbills for the next fiscal year, I commend the efforts of Chairman \nCochran, Senator Bumpers and other members of the Subcommittee in \nputting forth this bill to fund the wide array of agricultural programs \nwithin the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies.\n  In the accompanying report, the Subcommittee stated its objective, to \nclosely examine ``[a]ll accounts in the bill'' and ``ensure that an \nappropriate level of funding is provided to carry out the programs.'' \nMr. President, I was delighted to read this statement. However, after \nreviewing the bill and its accompanying report language, my delight was \nbrief at best.\n  It is painfully clear the subcommittee has not lost its appetite for \npork-barrel spending. This bill has been fattened up with vast amounts \nof low-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending. In fact, this \nparticular appropriations bill contains an astounding $241,486,300 in \nspecifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. This is over $60 million \nmore than last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which \nwas only $185 million in wasted funds. In addition, the bill and report \ndirect that current year spending be maintained for hundreds of \nprojects, without being specific as to the amount.\n  To exemplify this egregious spending, I have compiled a lengthy list \nof the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and special exemptions provided to \nindividual projects in this bill.\n  Many of the programs funded in this bill are laughable. Yet there is \nnothing humorous about funneling Americans' hard-earned tax dollars to \nparochial interests. This bill is rife with examples.\n  The subcommittee's recommendation for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation and Extension Service (CRSEES) blatantly typifies the way my \ncolleagues have irresponsibly put their own agendas ahead of national \npriorities. For CRSEES research and education activities, my colleagues \nadded on $22,193,000 to the budget estimate. In fact, out of 106 \nspecial research grants for state universities, 99 projects were \nunrequested and earmarked to serve specific regions of the nation, such \nas: an earmark of $3,536,000 to Oregon, Mississippi, Minnesota, North \nCarolina, and Michigan for the wood utilization project; $150,000 for \nplant, drought, and disease resistance gene cataloging in New Mexico; \n$64,000 for nonfood uses of agricultural products in Nebraska; and, an \nearmark of $84,000 to Georgia for Vidalia Onions. Mr. President, you \nand I may love Vidalia Onions just as much as the next person, but an \n$84,000 earmark to Georgia for Vidalia Onions is absurd in this era of \nsupposed fiscal restraint.\n  Let's look at the earmarks in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService funding.\n  The Committee directs the Department to continue funding at the \ncurrent level for cattail management and blackbird control in North \nDakota, South Dakota, and Louisiana. I would be surprised if there were \nno problems with excessive cattail growth and huge blackbird flocks in \nother areas of the country.\n  $800,000 is earmarked for rabies control programs in Ohio, Vermont, \nand New York. Again, I am certain other areas of the country would \nbenefit from rabies control funding.\n  The Committee encourages the Department to consider grants to \nBurlington, Vermont, and Anchorage, Alaska, to assist these cities in \ndeveloping public markets.\n  The Committee notes that it ``expects'' the Agriculture Department to \npurchase surplus salmon, but only if there is surplus salmon at low \nprices continue.\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\n  Mr. President, this type of locality-specific and special-interest \nearmarking is blatantly unfair to the taxpayers. It sets the tone, so \nevident in this bill, for a spending frenzy where honest hardworking \nAmericans' tax dollars are thrown away on unrequested, low-priority, \nwasteful spending similar to the previous examples and hundreds like \nit.\n  Similar flagrant violations of the appropriate merit-based review \nprocess permeate the FY `99 Agriculture Appropriations bill and \nreport--a testament to my ongoing concerns about pork-barrel spending. \nMr. President, I raised concerns over earmarks in the FY 1998 \nappropriations bill, yet funding continues to be provided without \nadequate justification for nonsensical programs and designated regional \nbenefits, such as: the perennial add-on of $3,354,000 for the Shrimp \nAquaculture project benefiting the states of Hawaii, Mississippi, \nArizona, Massachusetts, South Carolina; $150,000 for the National \nCenter for Peanut Competitiveness in Georgia; a $26 earmark million for \nadditional spending to benefit the Lower Mississippi Delta region.\n  Mr. President, most of the programs in this bill, such as grants, \nloans and other types of technical assistance programs, would normally \nbe available to local, state and tribal entities in an open and \ncompetitive process. Many projects of merit and national necessity \ndeserve to compete for the scarce funds gobbled up by wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending. But these projects will never receive fair \ndeliberation if this Committee pre-determines their fate by \n``expecting'' and ``urging'' the Department to give special \nconsideration to certain projects over others.\n  This bill also continues the questionable practice of prohibiting \nfacility closures and designating funding for maintaining \nadministrative personnel. For example, an additional $1,400,000 is \nprovided to the Rice Germplasm Laboratory in Stuttgart, AR, for \nadditional staffing, and more than $20 million is provided to various \nagencies and field offices in order to maintain personnel. The bill \nalso contains a section that prohibits the expenditure of any funds to \nclose or relocate an FDA office in St. Louis. The Committee does not \nprovide any justification on why we should be spending taxpayers \ndollars to preserve unneeded bureaucracy. Nor does the report explain \nwhy specific offices and laboratories are higher in priority than \nothers and more deserving of continuing funding despite recommendations \nof closure.\n  Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable \nprovisions of this bill. In closing, I simply ask my colleagues to \napply fair and reasonable spending principles when appropriating funds \nto the multitude of priority and necessary programs in our \nappropriations bills. I look forward to the day when we can go before \nthe American people with a budget that is both fiscally responsible and \nends the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process.\n\n\n                         generic drug approvals\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past several years, I have \nhighlighted my growing concern about the Food and Drug Administration's \nfailure to meet statutory deadlines with respect to a number of very \nimportant consumer products it regulates, including medical devices, \nfood additives and generic drugs.\n  I would note that enactment of the Food and Drug Administration \nModernization Act (FDAMA) is intended to address some of those \nconcerns, especially with respect to innovator drugs.\n  But a very real concern remains about the generic side of the \nequation.\n  My colleagues should be aware that, despite a requirement in the law \nthat generic applications be acted upon within 180 days, the review \ntime usually takes far longer. In fact, in its budget justification \nsubmitted to Congress this February, the agency reveals that only 50% \nof the applications receive final agency action within the statutory \ndeadline, and the mean review time is 25.6 months.\n  This is a matter of significant concern to me, and, I believe, to the \nCongress as well. As the Committee noted in the report to accompany S. \n2159:\n\n       In light of the fact that generic drugs provide important \n     cost benefits to consumers and the Federal Government, the \n     Committee also encourages the FDA to devote additional \n     resources to generic drug reviews in order to address the \n     backlog of applications and provide reviews within the 6-\n     month period required by statute.\n\n  Later, the Committee goes on to say:\n\n       FDA delays have significant implications for public health. \n     Each FDA delay extends the time it takes for consumers to \n     benefit from new products that provide significant \n     therapeutic benefits. The Committee believes that FDA's \n     statutory obligations to perform its core regulatory \n     activities must remain the agency's top priority.\n\n  The failure of the FDA to devote sufficient resources to the Office \nof Generic Drugs is penny-wise but pound-foolish. Generic drugs can \nprovide significant benefits to consumers. They typically enter the \nmarket at a price 30% below their brand-name equivalents, and decline \nin price to 60%-70% below the brand product price over time.\n  Generic drugs have provided consumers with lower cost alternatives to \ninnovator drugs, and they will continue to do so in the future. Over \nthe next decade, a number of important pharmaceutical patents will \nexpire, with cumulative annual sales in the tens of billions of \ndollars, and with the potential of tremendous consumer benefits. These \nbenefits could be significantly diminished if there are not adequate \nabbreviated new drug application reviewers. It is as simple as that.\n  Last year, due to the concerted leadership of Chairman Cochran and \nothers, the FDA was directed to submit a detailed operating plan which \nyielded an increase of $702,000 for the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD). \nI was, and am, very appreciative of these efforts.\n  It is my understanding that the House Appropriations Committee has \nprovided an additional $1 million to OGD this year; I strongly support \nthe House mark and only wish it could have been even higher.\n  When the agriculture appropriations bill goes to conference, I hope \nthat conferees will build upon last year's record and will continue to \nincrease funding for generic drug reviews. I know that it is always \nhard to find additional money given the budgetary constraints we face, \nbut a very small amount of money in Federal budget terms can have a \nvery large impact here, especially for those, particularly senior \ncitizens, who lack prescription drug coverage.\n\n\n                        APHIS/Wildlife Services\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I strongly encourage the Conference \nCommittee for the FY 1999 Agricultural Appropriations bill to recognize \nthe need for a full-time APHIS/Wildlife Services district supervisor \nposition located in South Dakota for the protection of agriculture and \nendangered species.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, which includes essential funding to support our \nAmerican farmers, the most competitive farmers in the world.\n  It is imperative that the Agriculture Appropriations be passed out of \nthe Senate quickly, as our farmers will be forced to pay dearly for any \ndelays. The bill includes vital funding for scab research. This is an \nessential project to counter what has become a major threat to wheat \nand barley farmers. The bill includes many other important bio-genetic \nprojects as well. Long-term basic research is fundamental and must \nremain a priority.\n  This bill also continues the crucial tools to help our farmers \npromote their commodities at home and throughout the world. The bill \nfunds the Foreign Agricultural Service, which is a necessary component \nin successfully identifying and reaching foreign markets. The Service \ncoordinates the formulation of trade policies and programs with the \ngoal of enhancing world markets for U.S. agricultural products.\n  Included are the CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program; the PL-480; the \nExport Enhancement Program; the Market Access Program, and others. The \nbill also includes full funding of the Federal Crop Insurance program,\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nthe major risk management tool to come out of Freedom to Farm.\n  Today we will debate several amendments that are being touted as a \nremedy to the current farm crisis that some states in the Upper \nMidwest, including Minnesota, are currently facing.\n  I do not want to downplay the problems faced by Northern Minnesota \nfarmers. Farmers are hurting, but we must look for the best ways to \nhelp them promote long-term solutions rather than take a costly \npolitical approach.\n  There are multiple factors which have contributed to and exacerbated \nthe current circumstances facing many of our Upper Midwest farmers. \nThey include the Asian financial crisis, plant diseases, and surpluses \naccompanied by low commodity prices. The combined effect has been \nenough to put some farmers out of business, despite the fact that the \nMarket Transition Payments in the FAIR Act have provided our producers \nwith a much greater safety net than the deficiency payments they would \nhave received under the old program.\n  The current crisis cries out for an immediate answer--a quick-fix. \nScrap the intent of the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, some of my colleagues \nare suggesting, and go back to the old-style, government-directed farm \npolicy we fought so hard to change.\n  Surely it is heart-wrenching to watch our neighbors lose their \nlivelihoods, but is the approach of the Minority amendments the right \none? Will it help farmers in the long run? I do not think so. These \nproposals will not alleviate the problems. That much should be obvious. \nThese are serious problems and require serious legislative proposals \nWhat the situation demands is more deliberate, long-range attention.\n  Furthermore, these proposals like a serious misdiagnosis exacerbate \nthe problem, not only for farming generations to come but for the very \nfarmers they would supposedly serve.\n  One amendment would be to extend the loan rates in order to allow \nfarmers the discretion of waiting for higher prices. Sadly, this looks \nlike a sure-fire method to lower commodity prices even further. \nExtending the loan for an additional six months would give a farmer \nincentive to hold onto the remainder of last year's crop, while at the \nsame time pulling in a new harvest--most likely a very large harvest. \nThe effects are obvious--an increased amount of grain on the market, \nwhich pushes prices down.\n  There are other costs to this approach. Grain storage and \ntransportation issues continue to play a role in the overall problem. \nExtending the loan rate will only make matters worse in that farmers \nwho hold onto their grain longer must have a place to store it, taking \nup more space in the elevators. There must also be enough rail cars to \nship it. This also drives prices down.\n  Another ill-fated proposal would raise the cap on government market \nloan rates. Again, we must beware of proposals--like extending the loan \nrates--that would influence the market in such a way as to create \nmarket distortions. That is just what this proposal would do. It would \ncreate more commodity than the market could stand without devaluing it. \nIf loan caps are lifted, it tends to encourage a rational farmer to \nwithhold grain from the market, leading to more government-owned grain. \nThis also drives prices down.\n  Yet another proposal would authorize $500 million in payments to \nfarmers who have suffered repeated crop failures. But we decided to \navoid these types of measures in favor of the Federal Crop Insurance \nProgram, and similar risk management measures included in the Freedom \nto Farm Act. And certainly $500 million spread over a number of hard-\nhit states is not going to be enough to make a real difference for \nfarmers, even over the short-term. The better alternative is to \ncontinue to improve the FCIP.\n  It is not difficult to put these band-aid proposals into perspective. \nWhat is hard is the fact that they are being billed as steps that would \nimmediately help individuals who have supposedly been hurt by Freedom \nto Farm, giving them false hope for relief--a magic elixir for \nsuffering farmers that won't work. With the benefits of Freedom to Farm \nwe agreed to accept the kind of market cycles other industries suffer. \nWhen the cycle turns down, we must look at the best way to reverse the \ndownward cycle through sound government policies. We must continue our \nefforts to seek new markets for our agriculture products, and to seek \nalternative uses for them as well. We can replenish the IMF, pass Fast \nTrack negotiating authority, pursue unfair trade practices, and \ncontinue MFN for China. We can oppose unilateral sanctions.\n  As Chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the Banking \nCommittee, I worked with Senator Hagel to pass the replenishment of the \nIMF in the Senate. I regret it is still held up on the House side. \nWithout this kind of multilateral assistance, we cannot provide the \nassistance needed to address the kind of crises we face in Asia, Russia \nand many other areas. I urge the Administration to work out the \ndifferences we have surrounding this issue in the House so we can \ncontinue this kind of crucial assistance.\n  Fast Track negotiating authority is necessary to pursue new trade \nagreements with other nations that will improve access for agriculture \nand other products. While the Administration indicated it would pursue \nthis authority this year, that appears to no longer be a priority this \nyear. Yet, this authority would open markets to relieve some of the \ncommodity pricing pressure in the Upper Midwest. I have joined Senator \nHagel and others today in requesting Senator Lott to bring up Fast \nTrack this year as one of our top priorities.\n  Continuing MFN for China is another top priority of mine as well as \nthe agricultural community. China is a major market for the United \nStates, now, and even more in the future. Those who want to hold \nagriculture hostage to solving many unrelated problems in China are \nvery shortsighted. Not only do we risk United States exports in the \nshort term, but the long term as well as the United States earns the \nreputation of an unreliable supplier. Engagement through trade and \ncontact with the Chinese leaders and people is what gains us progress \non human rights, religious persecution and other issues--not cutting \noff those relations.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased we passed the Farmer Relief Act last \nweek to exclude agriculture products from India-Pakistan sanctions. We \nshould have gone further to provide waiver authority and exclude all \nthe economic sanctions, but that battle will be fought another day. It \nis clear to me that agriculture sales should not be included in any \nsanction, and I will continue to support efforts to eliminate \nagriculture from current sanctions as well as to prevent our farmers \nfrom being targeted in these largely political battles. Farmers still \npainfully recall the Russian grain embargo and other unilateral \nsanctions that continue to shut off important markets. Cutting off \nagriculture sales only hurts the people of the targeted country--not \nthe government we aim to punish.\n  I am a co-sponsor of the Dodd bill to remove agriculture sales from \ncurrent Cuba unilateral sanctions. The same arguments we make against \nother agriculture sanctions apply here as well. It is time to make this \nhumanitarian, important change in the embargo.\n  I also am a co-sponsor of the Africa trade bill which I believe will \nhelp our farmers in the long term as we work to expand trade \nopportunities in that continent.\n  All of these current and pending sanctions--61 current and many \npending--cry out for passage of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Bill, which \nI have co-sponsored. This will ensure that not only will we have a \nsound basis to ensure that sanctions will have their desired effect \nbefore we pass them, but also that they do not impose a higher cost to \nour economy than we can bear. This legislation should be \nnoncontroversial, and it should be passed immediately.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that pursuing trade policies that open \nmarkets, not close them, will go a very long way in bringing higher \nprices to farmers in my state and others. I challenge my colleagues who \nhave supported legislation to close markets abroad to take a closer \nlook at what they are doing and support American agriculture on these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. President, in passing Freedom to Farm, Congress recognized that \nagriculture policy in this country must emphasize business acumen and \nindividual freedom--the principles that\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\nhave made our economy sound today. And we must provide the means \nnecessary to realize the potential of such a plan. The Agriculture \nAppropriations bill continues to provide the means. I urge my \ncolleagues to stay the course and resist the short-sighted, politically \nmotivated, market-distortion mechanisms that the Minority amendments \nwould offer.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion here \ntoday about agriculture and the fix that it finds itself in, most of it \ncaused by forces not under the control of the folks who live on our \nfarms and ranches in this country, and in particular about our good \nfriends who live in North Dakota along the northern high plains that \nstretch across the northern reaches of Minnesota, from Grand Forks to \nWilliston, and yes, even over into my home State of Montana. I went \nthrough the 1980s as an auctioneer. I sold out some awfully good \nfriends in that era. And, there again, that was caused by forces that \nwere not under the control of those who make a living from our farms \nand ranches across this country.\n  You know, we, some of us, might take this lightly. But we are talking \nabout something that involves every American. Every American has a \nstake in this, because the second thing you do every day after you get \nup is eat. I don't know what the first thing is because we have a lot \nof choices, I guess, but the second thing is that we eat.\n  We understand the pain on the northern high plains because I have \nexperienced the same kind of situations and been around agriculture a \nlong time, in the business of ag business and, yes, on the land, too. \nWe understand that. We cannot write anything into legislation in the \nway of farm policy of a one-size-fits-all. Each State is different. \nEach county is different. Each region of this country is different, \nproducing different crops under different circumstances, under \ndifferent growing seasons, different soils, and that makes it a real \nchallenge to try to develop any kind of farm policy as far as this \nGovernment is concerned from this place here in Washington, which I \nrefer to every now and again as 17 square miles of logic-free \nenvironment.\n  What we did in the FAIR Act was to try to put agriculture into a \nposition where farmers can enjoy as much versatility and flexibility in \ntheir cropping and making their decisions on how to market as each \nindividual producer or operator could have. Risk management--that was \npart of it, part of it, making decisions on what to grow and when to \ngrow it, how to market it, and, yes, even having some say in \ntransportation.\n  We have heard a lot of people say this act is still a work in \nprogress, that there were some things that we should really do that \nwould facilitate the final policy of the FAIR: Farm savings accounts. \nDo something about estate taxes. We don't need estate taxes. Something \nhas to be inherently wrong when you have to sell the farm to save the \nfarm. Capital gains--a reduction in capital gains has already proven \nthat, yes, it is an economic enhancer. We got income averaging for 3 \nyears; now we need to put it in permanent law. And, yes, the sanctions \nreform, of which we have heard a lot in the past week and during this \nweek --do that reform. And also reg reform.\n  Now, reg reform doesn't sound very big, but just this morning, in the \nfull Committee on Appropriations, there was a memorandum of the \nDepartment of Transportation to deal with hazardous material with \nregard to agriculture, the hauling of hazardous materials from the city \nto the farm and from farm to farm with limited space and no reason that \nthis Federal Government should preempt State regulations on handling \nthose materials. Agriculture had enjoyed an exemption, when it comes to \nproduction agriculture, in providing the services that are needed on \nthe farm and getting the crop back to the farm. Yet this Department of \nTransportation wants to change all of that. They want to preempt the \nStates on how they handle hazardous material. It is just a little \nthing, the requirement of a CDL, just to do farm work--commercial \ndriver's license, just to do farm work, not only putting the crop in \nbut getting it out and getting it where it can be transported to the \nmarkets.\n\n  That is reg reform--the ability to use some pesticides and herbicides \non growing new crops that have been introduced into the northern high \nplains, where we have competition from our friends in Canada where they \nhave 15 to 20 different kinds of herbicides and pesticides to grow 1 \ncrop while we are limited to 5 and cannot get FDA approval to go on and \ntake care of the crop the way it has to be done.\n  One could also look at the situation, the terrible situation in North \nDakota, where they have the disease scab. There is regulation on plant \ngrowth health.\n  We could also put together that same package of trade, trade, and \ntrade. We know the effect of the financial crisis in the Pacific rim. \nLast January, we visited Australia. In talking to the Australians, they \ndidn't think it would affect their GDP at all. When I walked out of \nthat meeting in Canberra, Australia, I knew that these folks had really \nmisread the crisis in the Pacific rim. They had underestimated exactly \nwhat was going to happen, when you have four major economies absolutely \ngo in the tank, and then the economy that was to ride in and help them \nout can't do anything about it--and that is Japan. Those forces are \ncompletely out of the control of the American farmer and the American \nrancher.\n  So, fast track, normal trade relations to move our product into those \nmarkets and have a shot at that market. Right now, with sanctions, we \nare getting no shot at all. That is not right, and it is not fair.\n  I would probably say that sanctions have very little effect, if any \nat all, on any kind of product. What happens when you put sanctions on \nanything is, they will find the foodstuffs; they will find the grain. \nThey might pay a little more for it, a couple of pennies a bushel more, \nand then we have to compete against the lower end of that market? That \nis not fair either. So, sanctions very seldom work.\n  There is also another end of this that I haven't heard anybody talk \nabout in this country, and I do not know how to deal with this problem, \nbut I know there is a problem. The percentage of the consumer dollar \ngoing back to the farm is the smallest it has been in the history of \nagriculture.\n  What do I mean by that? If some of you go to the grocery store and do \nyour shopping, go down the cereal line and see what Wheaties are worth \nper pound. I think you will find they are around $3.75 a pound. Cereal \nis not cheap--$3.75 a pound. I want America to know--do you realize \nthat we cannot even get $2.50 for a bushel of wheat that weighs 60 \npounds? There is more money in the box than there is in the wheat that \nis the basis of the product. Something is a little out of whack. Yet, \nwe have some of our great agricultural processors and purveyors and \nbuyers calling themselves a supermarket to the world.\n  What we are saying though is: If you are such a good supermarket, \nthen give us more of the consumer dollar. You have an obligation, like \nanybody else, to make sure the producer gets at least his cost of \nproduction. That would help them stay in business, but it also helps \nthe processor to stay in business.\n  I noticed, there was a little letter that came this way from one of \nthe great processors in this country wanting to go back to the old way \nof doing business. It makes sense to me. If I am out here buying corn \nand soybeans and wheat, I can buy it very cheaply, yet the taxpayer \npays the profitable margin in this country to the farmer.\n  That is not right either. That should be paid at the marketplace, and \na percentage of that should go to production agriculture.\n  We are still a work in progress, and, yes, we have a situation on the \nnorthern high plains with which we are going to have to deal and for \nwhich we have an obligation to deal.\n  NAFTA, has it been good? Maybe for all America, but it sure hasn't \nworked for us on the northern high plains. When you have 300 loads of \ncattle a day coming across the wheat grass in northern Montana, and yet \nwe have a cattle market and you have $60 steers--I have a good friend \nwho lives over in Miles City, MT. Of course, he has a great sense of \nhumor, and it is a great thing. You have to have a good sense of humor \nwhen you farm a ranch. He said $60 fat cattle, $40 hogs, and $2.50 \nwheat,\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nand $9 oil. Remember, oil only costs about $9 a barrel at the wellhead. \nThat would tell me anybody who is in the business of producing a raw \nproduct is not getting paid very much for their product, but the price \nhasn't been reflected at the pump or at the grocery store. If they go \ndown for the consumer, I guess all of us can live pretty good. But I \nsaid, ``Well, that doesn't sound too good.'' He said, ``Yeah, but \nthere's a silver lining--we've got a lot of it.'' And that is the kind \nof attitude you have to carry into this business.\n  How do we deal with the northern high plains, victims of flood and \ndrought and those farm families that really just eke it out every year? \nThey are land rich, but they are cash poor. That has been the story of \nagriculture for a long, long time. I am afraid that story is not going \nto end with any action taken in the Congress.\n  Do we want the Government back in the grain business? Do we want \nthose huge stocks that cost the taxpayer a lot of money in storage? Do \nwe want those stocks to overshadow the market? This man who wrote this \nletter saying we should go back to the old way of doing business thinks \nit is all right, because he is going to get his supply from stocks that \ndidn't cost very much money. Yet, his end product is not going to go \ndown a great amount. In fact, it won't go down at all. They will always \nsay ``inflation.'' The percentage of the consumer dollar we don't have \nany control over either.\n  Just remember that little illustration that there is more money in \nthe box that contains the Wheaties than there is in the wheat that is \nthe base ingredient of that great food, a percentage of the consumer \ndollar. Going back to the old way will not cure the ills of what is \nhappening in the northern high plains.\n  I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and those of us \nwho have been meeting every day to open up markets and to deal with \nsanctions, because it is trade, trade, trade. Just like in the business \nof the real estate, when you buy, there are three main things: \nLocation, location, location.\n  We must continue to do that. This administration must use every tool \nthey have to open those markets and to move the product, whether it be \nthrough Public Law 480, through EEP, or export credits. We must get in \nthe world market, and we must compete and move the products.\n  I thank the chairman, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nMontana for his comments and his leadership. I don't know whether \nSenators realize this or not, but he has been getting Senators together \non an invitation basis at his office to discuss the problems in \nagriculture, bringing to the attention of all of us who are interested \nin that subject some very serious challenges that we face now in terms \nof trade policy and the other related issues that he has already talked \nabout this afternoon.\n\n  His comments to the Senate are very helpful as we put in perspective \nwhat our challenge is and what our options are for responding to these \nvery real problems in agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I am also happy to be able to advise the Senate that \nwe have reached an agreement with the Democratic leader on the subject \nof the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which was offered earlier today \nand which has been the subject of a good deal of discussion.\n  There has been an agreement to modify the amendment, and I am ready \nto propound a unanimous consent request with the clearance of both \nleaders, and it is as follows:\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 p.m. this evening, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on amendment No. 3127, as modified, offered by the \nminority leader. I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3127, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Findings:\n       In contrast to our nation's generally strong economy, in a \n     number of States, agricultural producers and rural \n     communities are experiencing serious economic hardship;\n       Increased supplies of agricultural commodities in \n     combination with weakened demand have caused prices of \n     numerous farm commodities to decline dramatically;\n       Demand for imported agricultural commodities has fallen in \n     some regions of the world, due in part to world economic \n     conditions, and United States agricultural exports have \n     declined from their record level of $60 billion in 1996;\n       Prolonged periods of weather disasters and crop disease \n     have devastated agricultural producers in a number of States;\n       Certain States experienced declines in personal farm income \n     between 1996 and 1997;\n       June estimates by the Department of Agriculture indicate \n     that net farm income for 1998 will fall to $45.5 billion, \n     down 13 percent from the $52.2 billion for 1996;\n       Total farm debt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion, \n     the highest level since 1985;\n       Thousands of farm families are in danger of losing their \n     livelihood and life savings;\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that \n     immediate action by the President and Congress is necessary \n     to respond to the economic hardships facing agricultural \n     producers and their communities.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if there are Senators who want to discuss \nthis or other issues, there is an opportunity between now and 5:15 to \ndo that. Pending such discussion, the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas and I have been able to review additional amendments, and we \nare prepared to recommend to the Senate that they be accepted as a part \nof this agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside for \nthe purpose of propounding these additional amendments for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3142\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify a budget request submission regarding spending \n          based on assumed revenues of unauthorized user fees)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 3142.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23 insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated by this Act or \n     any other Act shall be used to pay the salaries and expenses \n     of personnel who prepare or submit appropriations language as \n     part of the President's Budget submission to the Congress of \n     the United States for programs under the jurisdiction of the \n     Appropriations Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, and Related Agencies that assumes revenues or \n     reflects a reduction from the previous year due to user fees \n     proposals that have not been enacted into law prior to the \n     submission of the Budget unless such Budget submission \n     identifies which additional spending reductions should occur \n     in the event the users fees proposals are not enacted prior \n     to the date of the convening of a committee of conference for \n     the fiscal year 2000 appropriations act.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with what \nis a perennial knotty problem for the members of this subcommittee. It \nsimply says that no funds may be used to prepare the budget for this \nsubcommittee that includes user fees unless those fees have been \npreviously authorized or under the budget identifies spending cuts or \nrevenue increases that should occur in case the fees are not adopted, \nwhich they never are.\n  We invariably get these budgets. The President invariably sends a \nbudget over, and our subcommittee looks it over, and there is always a \nbunch of user fees in there. This is about the eighth or ninth straight \nyear that user fees have been included, and the subcommittee never \nagrees to them. The reason we don't is that the full committee and the \nSenate would never agree to them either.\n  This amendment is designed to say in the future, don't send those \nuser fees\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\nover here unless you are prepared to tell us, in case we don't adopt \nthe user fees, where you are going to find the spending cuts for it or \nwhere you are going to find revenue increases. This is a 1-year \nproposition. This provision will only apply to the budget year 1999. I \nthink this has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas in cosponsoring this amendment. He has identified \nthe problem. It really ought to be labeled the ``truth in budgeting \namendment,'' because it requires the administration now to acknowledge \nwhen a proposal is made for user fees to be approved by Congress. In \nthe absence of such approval by the legislative committee, in the \nlegislative process a submission has to then show how much money should \nbe appropriated from the Treasury through the appropriations \nprocess, not to continue to assume that there is this pot of money \nthere that has been generated by the enactment of user fees. I think \nthis will help everybody understand the process better. And we \ncertainly welcome this change in the law as proposed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n\n  We know of no objection to the amendment on this side. We urge that \nit be approved by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3142) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3143\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a pilot program to permit certain owners and \n  operators to hay and graze on land that is subject to conservation \n                           reserve contracts)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think has a \nlot of merit. It is a pilot program under which farmers who are \nenrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program can take a reduction in \nthe payments that they would otherwise receive under that program in \nexchange for the right to bale hay and graze according to an agreement, \nof course, that they would have to work out. But they would have a \nright to forego certain payments in the Conservation Reserve Program in \nexchange for the right to hay and graze on some of their CRP lands.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment on this \nside of the aisle and find no objection to it. I urge it be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EGG GRADING AND SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Previous Shipment of Shell Eggs Under \n     Voluntary Grading\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\n     Program.--Section 203(h) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of \n     1946 (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``Shell eggs packed under the voluntary grading \n     program of the Department of Agriculture shall not have been \n     shipped for sale previous to being packed under the program, \n     as determined under a regulation promulgated by the \n     Secretary.''.\n       (b) Report on Egg Safety and Repackaging.--Not later than \n     90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, shall submit a joint status report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate that describes actions taken by the Secretary \n     of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services--\n       (1) to enhance the safety of shell eggs and egg products;\n       (2) to prohibit the grading, under the voluntary grading \n     program of the Department of Agriculture, of shell eggs \n     previously shipped for sale; and\n       (3) to assess the feasibility and desirability of applying \n     to all shell eggs the prohibition on repackaging to enhance \n     food safety, consumer information, and consumer awareness.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment codifies the Secretary of \nAgriculture's prohibition on the repackaging of eggs packed under \nUSDA's voluntary grading program. This prohibition went into effect on \nApril 27. It directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and \nHuman Services to submit a joint report to the relevant congressional \ncommittees on egg safety and repackaging.\n  The amendment has been cleared by USDA, by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the egg industry, and it is supported by consumer \ngroups.\n  The USDA recently reported, each year over 660,000 Americans get sick \nfrom eating eggs contaminated with salmonella enterovirus. Illness from \nthis can be fatal to the elderly, children, and those with weakened \nimmune systems.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, this bacteria caused \nmore reported deaths between 1988 and 1992 than any other foodborne \npathogen. The estimated annual cost of illness from this particular \nsalmonella ranges from $118 million to $767 million each year, \naccording to the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n  It sounds like a very good amendment to me.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have discussed this matter procedurally \nwith our distinguished managers on both sides of the aisle and \nappreciate very much their willingness to cooperate in terms of \nexpediting the consideration of these critical amendments.\n  The amendment that I have just submitted is one that Senator Harkin \nand I and others discussed on the floor this morning.\n  The amendment builds upon what I hope will be a very significant vote \nat 5:15 this afternoon. As we note, the first amendment hopefully \nbrings us together, Republicans and Democrats, in a way that allows us \nto say: Yes, we understand there is a problem; yes, we have to respond. \nEven though we may not yet have an agreement on how we might respond, \nthere should be a response.\n  That is, in essence, what we are saying with the passage of the \nresolution\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\nthat we have just ordered a vote on. Now we go to the next phase: All \nright, if we recognize there is a problem, then what we do we do about \nit? As many of us noted this morning, we are offering a series of \nproposals that we hope will allow us to respond in a meaningful way to \nthe situation that we find ourselves in in agriculture. A lot of people \nalready today have put excellent reports found in various publications \ninto the Record. The Chicago Tribune on June 21 of this year had a \nreport that I don't think is yet in the Record. The article is \nheadlined ``Harvest of despair.''\n  In the article, the very first statement says:\n\n       Falling prices, poor growing conditions, and government \n     deregulation are forcing thousands of family farmers to \n     abandon their way of life, perhaps the worst blow to the \n     rural Northern Plains since the bankruptcy crisis of the \n     middle 1980's.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't think there is an article that could say it \nmore succinctly than that. It goes on to explain the circumstances.\n  In 1996, for a bushel of wheat, farmers received $5.20 cents. In May \nof 1998, they received $3.07--a $2.13 reduction in price on a bushel of \nwheat in a 2-year period of time, a 40-percent-plus reduction in the \navailability of price for farmers.\n  That is the problem. This precipitous drop in price is generating an \nextraordinary crisis financially for family farmers and ranchers all \nover America. It is not just wheat. I could give the same statistics \nfor corn. We could talk about livestock. We could talk about virtually \nany commodity found in the northern Great Plains, or in the West today, \nand you would see a situation that could be entitled ``Harvest of \nDespair.''\n  So the question is, What do we do about it? I am one who believes in \nthe marketplace. But I also know that the market has many ways that \nhave been used, many tools that have been used, both public and \nprivate, in an effort to soften these economic upturns and downturns. \nWe see it on Wall Street. We see it on Main Street primarily through \nthe Tax Code. We have seen it in agriculture for decades. We are not \nsuggesting in response to this crisis that we reopen the farm bill and, \nin so doing, reopen the debate about all of the infrastructure that is \nnow in place dealing with the relationship that the people of the \nUnited States have with farmers. We are not going to do that.\n  But what we are going to do is to suggest that there are some actions \nthat can be taken that would have profound benefits to farmers and to \nranchers to get through this crisis. And what we are suggesting is that \nin many of those cases we put a time limit on it. We don't say for all \nperpetuity now we are going to make these changes, because that would \nbe doing the very thing I said we weren't going to do. So the amendment \nthat I have laid down is a perfect illustration of just that.\n  The amendment says that the Government will take the average price \nthat we have seen for commodities over the last 5 years, drop the highs \nand lows, and put in place a marketing loan at 85 percent of that price \nthat the farmers could avail themselves of, if they don't want to be \nforced to sell their grain tomorrow.\n  Let's assume a farmer has a good crop. Let's assume that he is \nsuffering, with this remarkable chart showing that prices have gone \nfrom $5.20 down to $3.07 in 2 years, and he doesn't want to settle for \n$3.07. What does he do? He goes to the Department of Agriculture and \nsays, ``I heard about this marketing loan you all have. I would like to \ntake out a loan.'' For now it is 9 months. We are going to give them a \nlittle more flexibility. We are going to say 15 months--1 year and 3 \nmonths--5 quarters--before he has to pay it back. He is going to say, \n``I am going to take out that loan,'' betting their price is going to \nturn around. So he does. The price goes up, he pays the loan, the \nGovernment makes money, and the farmer stays in business.\n  Mr. President, that is what we are doing. That is what we are \nsuggesting here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chicago Tribune \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, June 21, 1998]\n\n                           Harvest of Despair\n\n                            (By Greg Burns)\n\n       Hillsboro, ND--Years of farming the rich black soil near \n     this town of 1,462 never quite prepared Scott Kraling for his \n     new occupation.\n       Instead of wearing his customary blue jeans and dusty cap, \n     he fidgets in the striped shirt and electric-blue shorts of a \n     uniform. Instead of a trusty pickup truck, he rolls past \n     wheat and sugarbeet fields in a yellow delivery van marked \n     Schwan's Delicious Ice Cream.\n       His farming days are over. ``I'm a Schwan's man now,'' the \n     38-year-old father of two said.\n       Kraling is among thousands of North Dakota farmers who have \n     quit over the last few years in what's being called a \n     ``stealth'' farm crisis.\n       Unlike in the mid-1980s, bankers aren't forcing them out. \n     No one is making a major motion picture about their plight \n     and singer Willie Nelson isn't staging any benefits.\n       Kraling arranged the auction of his tractors and combines \n     himself last year because, truth be told, he was sick of \n     farming. ``You can't keep liking something that keeps going \n     against you,'' he said, taking a quick pull on a cigarette. \n     ``I really don't think there's a future in it.''\n       Across the Northern Plains, low grain prices, poor growing \n     conditions and government deregulation are driving many \n     farmers off the land.\n       Remote prairie countries that once supported a dozen or \n     more independent dirt-scratchers now have just a few, as the \n     survivors take on more acreage to seek elusive economies of \n     scale.\n       In the last two years, 2,511 of North Dakota's farmers have \n     given up, leaving fewer than 30,000, the lowest number since \n     World War I, according to Richard Rathge, state demographer. \n     Another 1,807 are expected to quit by the end of this year, a \n     recent study indicates.\n       So far, the farm woes barely have dented the overall \n     prosperity of this premier wheat state No. 2 in production \n     behind Kansas. Ex-farmers such as Kraling are finding plenty \n     of jobs available in town.\n       A bigger blow is being dealt to the rural culture of the \n     Northern Plains, as a century-old pattern of life slips away.\n       ``It affects all of us,'' said Margaret Bruce, pastoral \n     minister at St. John's Catholic Church in Grafton, ND. \n     ``Grafton is a farming community. When you're looking at a \n     fourth- or fifth-generation farmer leaving the farm, that's \n     sad.''\n       Since May, Bruce's church has distributed thousands of \n     green ribbons to be worn in support of surviving farmers.\n       ``This isn't just about dollars and cents,'' said Sen. \n     Byron Dorgan (D-ND). ``The country will lose something very \n     important. Family values roll from family farms to small \n     towns to big cities.''\n       Yet many folks in these parts have come to accept that \n     market forces will eliminate even more family farms. As in \n     other sectors of the economy, tradition has fallen by the \n     wayside as the nation embraces global commercial competition.\n       ``Will there be fewer farmers? Yes,'' said North Dakota \n     Gov. Ed Schafer. ``It hurts. It changes the character of the \n     state. [But] it's a return-on-investment decision.''\n       In Washington, DC, momentum is building for some relief. \n     Still, a major bailout of producers is unlikely.\n       Since the 1996 Farm Bill, Uncle Sam has moved in the \n     opposite direction, lifting restrictions on farmers while \n     also reducing the safety net of government handouts. Dorgan, \n     for one, wants to restore part of that safety net, but even \n     he expects ``a struggle.''\n       Speaking to some 1,100 North Dakotans earlier this month, \n     Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman dangled only a few modest \n     initiatives--a crop-insurance break here, a credit relief \n     program there.\n       The ``demoralized'' air of the farmers in attendance \n     shocked him, Glickman said afterward. ``It is almost \n     frightening to see the faces,'' he said. ``The situation in \n     the Northern Plains is bleaker than I've seen in agriculture \n     in a long time.''\n       Farmer Mike Kozojed of Galesburg, N.D., came away from \n     Glickman's talk expecting little relief. ``There's no light \n     at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.\n       Last Thursday, Tim Eisenhardt of Grandin, N.D., joined the \n     ranks of ex-farmers, as auctioneer Scott Steffes went to work \n     selling his trucks, combines, sprayers, swathers, and grain \n     carts.\n       Under a cloudy sky, dozens of farmers from at least three \n     states stopped around the muddy barnyard hunting for \n     bargains, as Eisenhardt and his father, Fred, greeted \n     neighbors at the edge of the crowd. ``That's the way she \n     goes,'' Fred remarked as the auction proceeded.\n       Barnyard auctions are becoming everyday events in North \n     Dakota. Steffes had 11 scheduled for last week, nine for the \n     coming week. ``We're having sales for farmers who are \n     discouraged and don't feel there's any opportunity,'' Steffes \n     said. ``Pretty soon, we're going to run out of people to sell \n     for.''\n       Nature is responsible for much of the hardship.\n       Years of poor weather and plant disease have made \n     conditions tough even in the rich Red River Valley along the \n     eastern edge of the state. The arid boondocks to the west, \n     with thin soil suitable for only a few crops, has had it even \n     tougher.\n       ``If it's bad in the Red River Valley, it's bad \n     everywhere,'' said commodity analyst\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\n     Bill Biedermann of Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Ill.\n       Because of its short growing season and reliance on the \n     single crop of wheat, this region has leaned heavily on \n     government programs now being phased out. Under the 1996 \n     legislation, farmers no longer will receive ``deficiency'' \n     payments if prices fall below target levels, or automatic \n     disaster aid-if crops fail.\n       The supposed benefit of the Farm Bill--the freedom to plant \n     any crop the farmer sees fit--is a bigger boon in areas where \n     a greater variety of crops will grow.\n       The legislation came about as soaring exports to the \n     booming economies of Asia pushed prices higher. These days, \n     Asia's demand for U.S. agricultural products has fallen along \n     with its nations' currencies.\n       In addition, foreign competitors, inspired by the higher \n     prices, brought more land into intensive production. Bumper \n     crops around the world have pushed wheat prices down nearly \n     20 percent in a year.\n       A healthy national economy has cushioned the trouble's \n     financial impact across the Northern Plains, but many \n     business leaders worry about the future.\n       ``It has an effect on all Main Street businesses,'' said \n     Jim Williams, general manager of a farm-implement dealer in \n     Arthur, N.D.\n       Sales at his 108-year-old Arthur Mercantile Co. have \n     declined as much as 20 percent annually for two years \n     running, and he expects the pinch to spread beyond the grain \n     elevators, fuel stations and others who deal directly with \n     farmers, he said. ``It's kind of grim.\n       Lenders, too, are concerned. On the plus side, most farmers \n     quitting these days have positive net worths, and those \n     remaining borrow more money because they have bigger farms, \n     explained Ken Knudsen, chief credit officer at Fargo's Farm \n     Credit Services. Yet lending in small towns has become \n     riskier as populations dwindle below sustainable levels.\n       ``When they leave the farm, they move to Fargo or Bismarck \n     or Grand Forks or Minot, not the town of 400,'' Knudsen said.\n       In fact, North Dakota's 17 towns with populations of at \n     least 2,500 now account for 56 percent of the population, up \n     from just 27 percent in 1950, according to demographer \n     Rathge. Meantime, 99 of the state's 100 smallest towns have \n     lost population in the 1990s. And the number of youths under \n     18 living on farms has plunged by 5,000, to 12,000, since \n     1990.\n       Some of the most progressive farmers are feeling intense \n     pressure too. Many rely on side businesses to boost their \n     incomes, even as they're taking on more acreage.\n       Dakota Growers Pasta Co., a co-op that makes private-label \n     pasta for supermarkets and food-service firms, has thrived as \n     farmers have sought to diversify. For every share they \n     purchase in the venture, farmers can sell the co-op one \n     bushel of wheat and receive a dividend based on the company's \n     profit.\n       Similar ventures are springing up all over, said Tim Dodd, \n     company president. ``There's been co-op fever in North \n     Dakota.''\n       All the same, surviving farmers such as Kozojed, a \n     mustachioed 41-year-old who farms 3,000 acres, predict the \n     business will only get tougher. ``Three years from now, we'll \n     probably be farming 5,000 acres if we're still doing it.'' he \n     said, digging into a plate of steak and eggs at the Country \n     Hearth Family Restaurant.\n       But isn't farming always cyclical? Wouldn't one good year \n     make a big difference? Kozojed stabs his toast into an egg \n     yolk and grins. ``I'd sure like to find out.''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on an emergency basis we give the \nPresident the opportunity to deal directly with the crisis that we are \nfacing right now in farm after farm, in rural community after rural \ncommunity. It only goes into effect in case of an economic crisis. It \ngives the President the discretion to control the extreme and \npersistent income losses by lifting the loan caps and extending their \nterms this year only. This authority expires this time next year.\n  Regardless of how my colleagues feel on lifting the caps, this \nmeasure would probably do more than any other I can think of in \nproviding immediate help--immediate relief--to farmers who are the \nvictims of the ``Harvest of despair''.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues have said, ``Look, we don't want to get \nback into that. We have had those battles.'' I understand that. But I \nalso understand, Mr. President, that we have very few options. And \nalmost categorically when we talk to farmer organizations, and farmers \nthemselves, they say, ``We have to have some other option than to force \nour grain on the market when it is this low. Give us an opportunity for \nsome breathing space. Give us some room.'' So that is what we are \ndoing.\n  Wheat loan rates would increase 64 cents a bushel--from $2.58 to \n$3.22. Corn loan rates would increase 36 cents a bushel--from $1.89 to \n$2.25. Soybean rates would increase 7 cents a bushel--from $5.26 to \n$5.33.\n  Keep in mind that we are talking about the 85 percent average over \nthe last 5 years.\n  They have flexibility. They have a little more certainty about what \nthey are going to get for their crop going into the market this fall.\n  Mr. President, that is as good as we think we can do under these \ncircumstances.\n  Would I like to see a higher loan rate? Absolutely. Would I like to \nsee even more substantive ways in which to ensure a better price? \nAbsolutely. But after very careful consideration, we said, ``Look, \nlet's do something that is reasonable. Let's do something that we \nbelieve the administration and most Members of Congress would recognize \nto be prudent and responsive to the problems we are facing in \nagriculture today.''\n  I know that we are scheduled to vote at 5:15. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa wanted to address this matter as well \nprior to the vote.\n  Just as soon as he appears in the Chamber, I will yield. I would like \nto yield the remainder of that time to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. President, the ``harvest of despair'' needs to be addressed. All \nwe are asking is an opportunity to address it in a way that is very \nprudent budgetarily, that very carefully addresses the emergency nature \nof the situation farmers are facing today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, \nfor really taking the bit here and moving ahead aggressively to answer \na real concern and a real need that we have in rural America. Well, I \nwould go beyond that--a crisis in rural America. Senator Daschle has \nalways been the leader in recognizing and understanding what is \nhappening in our farm economy. This time is no exception, so I thank \nSenator Daschle personally for his leadership in this effort.\n  I thank the managers of the bill, both Senator Cochran and Senator \nBumpers, for working with us on the language. I understand that we have \nthe language worked out in an agreed form on the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I am happy that we can come to a good resolution on that, \nand I guess that is what we will be voting on here at 5:15. I hope it \ngets an overwhelming vote because it will send a strong signal, I \nthink, to rural America that we do, indeed, recognize there is a \ncrisis, a crisis of immense proportions, as it does say the total farm \ndebt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion, the highest level \nsince 1985.\n  And so the sense of the Senate is just that. We recognize there is \nthe problem. Now, the amendment that Senator Daschle has just laid down \nthen takes that recognition of the problem and begins to do something \nabout it. By taking the caps off the loan rate and by extending for 6 \nmonths the period of the loan, it will at least give our farmers a \nlittle bit more, a little bit more in what they can get for their crop \nthis fall, and then give them the ability to market it in a more \norderly fashion over the next 15 months.\n  I have to say at the outset that this amendment is a modest \namendment, I mean a very modest amendment. I know that many farmers and \nothers in rural America will look at this and say, gee, this is not \nnearly enough. This doesn't come anywhere near the cost of production; \nit doesn't come anywhere near what I need. Well, I recognize that. It \nshould be more. I think I heard Senator Daschle say that, too. But we \nhave to face the reality of the situation.\n  I am just hopeful that this very modest amendment to raise the loan \nrate and put it back where it was under the 1990 farm bill will get \noverwhelming support. If we cannot even do this, if we cannot even give \nour farming sector this much support in an emergency situation, well, \nthen I guess what we are going to do is say, well, we recognize there \nis a problem out there, but we are not going to do anything about it. \nWe are just going to leave you farmers out there to take the brunt of \nEl Nino and take the brunt of floods and take the brunt of low prices \nand take the brunt of the Southeast Asian economic collapse and this \nGovernment, this representative Government of yours cannot do anything \nabout it.\n  I hope we do not say that. I hope we say two things: I hope we say, \nyes,\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nthere is a crisis out there. And then I hope we follow it up by saying, \nyes, we are going to do something about it. We are going to lift the \ncaps on the loan rate and at least give a few pennies--a few, a little \nbit--to farmers to hopefully get them through the crisis they are \nfacing this fall. And again, Mr. President, it is a crisis. It is a \nproblem of having the safety net there.\n  I am hopeful we can repair that safety net with just a few modest \nproposals we have.\n  I understand the vote is set at 5:15. Is that the idea?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3127, as modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted we were able to work out a \nmodification to the Daschle amendment. It is the pending business. I \nurge all Republicans to vote for the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nindicating that there are problems in agriculture; they need the \nimmediate attention of the President and the Congress.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3127 offered by the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIGIBILITY OF STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT \n                   STATIONS FOR CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Fund for Rural America.--Section 793(c)(2)(B) of the \n     Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2204f(c)(2)(B)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (iii), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (iv), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) a State agricultural experiment station.''.\n       (b) Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.--\n     Section 401(d) of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \n     Education Reform Act of 1998 (7 U.S.C. 7621(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) a State agricultural experiment station.''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am privileged to join today with my \nsenior colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to offer an amendment \nto the fiscal year 1999 agriculture spending bill to correct an \noversight which threatens the ability of the Connecticut Agricultural \nExperiment Station to continue its important research activities.\n  The Station has a long and proud history. It happens to be the first \nstate agricultural experiment station in the country, dating from 1875, \nand also happens to be the only state agricultural experiment station \nnot affiliated with a university. Consequently, it is not eligible to \napply for competitive grant funds from the Fund for Rural America or \nfrom the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The \namendment we offer today makes a minor technical correction to allow \nthe Station to compete for these grants just like every other \nexperiment station across the country. We're not asking for any special \nconsideration here. All we are asking for is an opportunity to compete.\n  The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station conducts research on \nplant pathology, horticulture, biochemistry, genetics, as well as many \nother science-based research projects. It also researches important \npublic health issues, as well, such as Lyme Disease, which is a \nparticular problem in our region, and now, nationwide. This important \nresearch should continue, and that is why we have brought this issue to \nthe attention of the Senate today. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, to do something here in the Senate that \nwill help the farmers back in our State.\n  As the Senate began debating the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for \nFY1999, it came to our attention that the Connecticut Agricultural \nExperiment Station was not eligible for certain federal grants under \nthe 1996 Farm Bill and the Agricultural Research, Extension and \nEducation Reform Act of 1998.\n  The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was established in \n1875 as the first agricultural experiment station in the country. The \nstation's mission is to put science to work for farmers and society. \nThe work of this agriculture experiment station includes research \nprojects on such issues as plant diseases, plant breeding, soil \nproblems, and insects.\n  The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is the only state \nbased station not affiliated with a land grant university in the \nnation. Unfortunately, the way the legislative language is written, \nthis station would be excluded from grants available to every other \nagricultural experiment station in the country. Therefore, I joined \nwith Senator Lieberman today to offer a technical correction amendment \nthat would remedy this situation.\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\n  This amendment will allow the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment \nStation to be eligible for these competitive federal grants. Allowing \nthis station to apply for grants will help our farmers, our citizens \nand our students who have questions or concerns about such topics as \nplants, insects, soil and water.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran and the \nranking member Senator Bumpers for their help with this amendment.\n  I hope that this amendment will be approved by the Senate.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment \nStation is the oldest experiment station in America. It has never been \na part of the land grant college, and under the research bill that we \njust passed not too long ago, there was a provision that you had to be \na land grant college in order to be qualified for these.\n  As I say, the experiment station in Connecticut has always received \nthese funds. But because of that, nobody was thinking about that \nexperiment station at the time. This bill corrects what really was an \nomission.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank both the manager and the ranking \nmember for their support. Senator Lieberman and I are very grateful. \nThis was really a technical amendment to correct this situation, and it \nallows us to continue to qualify, as the Senator said.\n  We appreciate their support very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3147) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3146\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. \non Wednesday, July 15, the Senate resume consideration of the Daschle \namendment numbered 3146 regarding marketing assistance loans. I further \nask that there be 3 hours for debate equally divided on the amendment \nand that, at the conclusion or yielding back of the time, Senator \nCochran be recognized to move to table the Daschle amendment. I further \nask that no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed the \nCrime Identification Technology Act of 1998, S. 2022.\n  I am proud to join Senator DeWine in supporting our bipartisan \nlegislation to authorize comprehensive Department of Justice grants to \nevery state for criminal justice identification, information and \ncommunications technologies and systems. I applaud the Senator from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, for his leadership. I also commend the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader for their strong \nsupport of the Crime Identification Technology Act.\n  I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last \n30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely \nfashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st \nCentury, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers \nwith the resources to develop the latest technological tools and \ncommunications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill \naccomplishes that goal.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act authorizes $250 million for \neach of the next five years in grants to states for crime information \nand identification systems. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, is directed to make grants to each state to be used \nin conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to use \ninformation and identification technologies and systems to upgrade \ncriminal history and criminal justice record systems.\n  Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, \ndevelop, update or upgrade:\n  State, centralized, automated criminal history record information \nsystems, including arrest and disposition reporting.\n  Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize \nfingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible \nwith systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III).\n  Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the \nInterstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy \nCompact.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility \ndeterminations.\n  Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and \ncommunicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, \nprosecution, and corrections.\n  Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms \neligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the \nNICS.\n  Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting \nof dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to \npromote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with \nother criminal justice information systems.\n  Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated \nwith the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics \nNetwork (NIBN).\n  Information, identification and communications programs for forensic \npurposes.\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\n  DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes.\n  Sexual offender identification and registration systems.\n  Domestic violence offender identification and information systems.\n  Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal \njustice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and \nother individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or \nstate law and administered by a government agency.\n  Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide \nstatistical and research products including incident-based reporting \nsystems and uniform crime reports.\n  Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and \nprograms.\n  Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share \nroutine and emergency information among federal, state and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont \nthat illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies across the country.\n  The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to \nharness the power of today s information age to prevent crime and catch \ncriminals. One way to work together is for state and local law \nenforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. \nFor example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of \nVermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-state IAFIS \nsystem to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would \nfoster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply \ntogether for grants.\n  Another challange for law enforcement agencies across the country is \ncommunication difficulties between federal, state and local law \nenforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice s \nNational Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the nation lack adequate communications systems to respond \nto crimes that cross state and local jurisdictions.\n  A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that \nleft four people dead including two New Hampshire state troopers, \nVermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police \ncruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between federal, \nstate and local law enforcement officers because the two states' police \nradios could not communicate with one another.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney s \nOffice and others have reacted to this communications problem by \ndeveloping the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the \nnorthern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine \nto integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better \ncoordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly.\n  Our legislation would provide grants for the development of \nintegrated Federal, State and local law enforcement communications \nsystems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights \nproject.\n  In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States \nmeet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For \ninstance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will \nrequire states to update their criminal justice systems for the country \nto benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other \nnational programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic \nviolence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act.\n  Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these \nnational crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by \nhelping the each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act provides a helping hand with \nthe heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. \nUnfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating \nminute detail changes that States must make in their laws to qualify \nfor Federal funds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide \nthe States with Federal support to improve their criminal justice \nidenfication, information and communication systems without prescriping \nnew Federal mandates\n  Mr. President, we have patterned the administration of the technology \ngrants under our bill after the highly successful DOJ National Criminal \nHistory Improvement Program (N-CHIP),which was created by the 1993 \nBrady Act.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety has received funds under the \nN-CHIP program for the past three years and I have been proud to \nstrongly support their efforts. With that Federal assistance, Vermont \nhas been achieved acquiring the automated fingerprint identification \nsystem in conjunction with Maine and New Hampshire, upgrading its \nrecords repository computer systems, as well as extending their online \nincident-based reporting system to local jurisdictions throughout \nVermont. Our bill builds on the Justice Department s existing \ninfrastructure under the successful N-CHIP program to provide fair and \neffective grant administration.\n  I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's \nleadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal \nhistory records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by \nproviding each State with the necessary resources to continue to make \nimportant efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to act quickly \non the Crime Identification Technology Act to ensure that each State \nhas the resources to capture the power of emerging information and \ncommunications technologies to serve and protect all of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8129-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8130-S8131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             INTERSTATE IDENTIFICATION INDEX (III) COMPACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed, \nS.2294, the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act. \nI want to thank Senators Hatch, DeWine and Daschle for their strong \nsupport of this legislation to enact the Interstate Identification \nIndex (III) Compact.\n  This Compact is the product of a decade-long effort by federal and \nstate law enforcement officials to establish a legal framework for the \nexchange of criminal history records for authorized noncriminal justice \npurposes, such as security clearances, employment or licensing \nbackground checks.\n  Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and \nlocal fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. \nToday, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. \nThese FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for \nboth criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes.\n  Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to \ninaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up \ndisposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a \nhuge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records \nraises significant privacy concerns.\n  In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice \npurposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon \nrequest, even if the State from which the records originated or the \nreceiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such \nrecords for noncriminal justice purposes.\n  The III Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of \nholding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history \nrecord, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once \nfully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file \nand a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State \nrecords repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for \nduplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the \nCompact. Eventually, when all the States become full participants in \nthe Compact, the FBI s centralized files of state offender records will \nbe discontinued and users of such records will obtain those records \nfrom the appropriate State s central repository (or from the FBI if the \noffender has a federal record).\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\n  The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative \nexchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, \nand create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the \nStates to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and \nprocedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance \nwith privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way \nexpand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal \nhistory records may be used under existing State or Federal law.\n  Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, \ncompleteness and privacy protection for criminal history records.\n  In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from \nestablishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the \nCompact, the FBI would hold only an index and pointer to the records \nmaintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer have to \nmaintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no longer have \nthe burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and charge/\ndisposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State would \nonly have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual \nidentification data for a person s first arrest.\n  With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, \nor complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records \ncloser to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the \nneed for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to \nthe FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests \nfor criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be \nsubmitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive \nidentification, to avoid mistaken release of records.\n  Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly created Council must \nestablish procedures to require that the most current records are \nrequested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is \nconducted.\n  Significantly, the newly created Council must establish privacy \nenhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records \nare only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. \nFurthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized \nrepresentatives from the State repository may have direct access to the \nFBI index. The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate \ninformation is released and, specifically, that record entries that may \nnot be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the \nresponse.\n  Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records \nto a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if \ndisposition records are available that the complete record be released. \nAlso, the Compact would require States receiving records under the \nCompact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with \nthe authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a \nState that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect \nto disposition-only policies in that State and not release that \ninformation for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the \nimpact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would \nbe positive.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a \nnumber of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the \nAdministration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the \nwork of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the \nprivacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not \ncovered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under \nthe Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, \nand (4) the Council s decisions, rules and procedures are available for \npublic inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register.\n  Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety \nsupports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will \nencourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal \nand noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can reap the benefits \nof cost savings and improved data quality. The Compact is also strongly \nsupported by the FBI and SEARCH.\n  We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history \nrecords maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State \nand Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to \nauthorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a \nsignificant step in the process of achieving that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8130-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8131-S8132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PERFORMANCE OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nrepeatedly postponed hearings regarding the performance of the Civil \nRights Division of the Justice Department, including one that had been \nnoticed for this morning. I am disappointed that this hearing was \ncanceled because it would have offered us a chance to look at the \noutstanding on-the-job performance of Bill Lann Lee, our Acting \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  At the end of last year, Bill Lee got caught up in one of the \npolitical whirlwinds that hit Washington every now and then. The result \nwas that he became a victim of the right wing anti-affirmative action \nlobby and was denied a fair chance at a vote by the full Senate on his \nnomination to head the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee was \nmischaracterized last fall as a wild-eyed radical and as someone ready \nto impose an extreme agenda on the United States. He was also mis-\nportrayed as a supporter of quotas.\n  I knew nothing could be further from the truth. After looking at Bill \nLee's record, I knew he was a man who could effectively lead the Civil \nRights Division, enforce the law and resolve disputes. I noted at the \ntime: ``He has been involved in approximately 200 cases in his 23 years \nof law practice, and he has settled all but six of them. Clearly, this \nis strong evidence that Mr. Lee is a problem solver and practical in \nhis approach to the law. No one who has taken the time to thoroughly \nreview his record could call him an idealogue.'' I recognized last fall \nthat Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the \njob, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the Nation's civil \nrights laws.\n  Last December, after this nomination was blocked from going to the \nSenate for an up or down vote, the President and the Attorney General \ndetermined that the right thing to do was to have Bill Lee proceed to \nact as the head of the Civil Rights Division and to resubmit his \nnomination to the Senate. The Nation needs leadership in this important \nposition. Bill Lee has been serving for seven months now, and he has \nestablished a solid track record. It is a shame that today's hearing \nwas canceled, because it would have been a chance to show the Nation \nwhat an outstanding job he is doing for all Americans.\n  In preparation for the scheduled hearing, I have had a chance to take \na close look at what Bill Lee has been doing while serving as the \nacting head of the Civil Rights Division. What I find is a record of \nstrong accomplishments. In addition, I see professionalism and \neffective problem solving. I find him enforcing the law in a sensible \nand fair manner.\n  Over the past seven months, the Division has focused most intensely \non three areas of the law: violations of our Nation's fair housing \nlaws, enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA''), and \ncases involving hate crimes. Bill Lee and his team of civil rights \nattorneys have made advances in each of these areas of the law.\n  The Division has resolved the following housing discrimination cases \nover the past few months:\n  An agreement was reached with two large New Jersey apartment \ncomplexes resolving allegations that the defendants had discriminated \nagainst potential renters based on family status and race. A housing \ndiscrimination case in Michigan was settled involving an apartment \nmanager who told black applicants that no apartments were available at \nthe same time that he was showing vacant apartments to white \napplicants. An agreement was also reached with the second largest real \nestate company in Alabama, which had been steering applicants to agents \nand residential areas based on race.\n  The Civil Rights Division has also focused on educating the public \nabout\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\nthe ADA and enforcing it where necessary. These cases have included: \nresolution of a case in Hawaii to allow those who are vision impaired \nto travel to the State without having to quarantine their guide dogs \nfor four months in advance of arrival; a consent decree with the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association so that high school athletes \nwith learning disabilities have the opportunity to compete for \nscholarships and participate in college athletics; an agreement with \nprivate hospitals in Connecticut to ensure patients who are deaf have \naccess to sign-language interpreters; and assistance to the State of \nFlorida to update their building code to bring it into compliance with \nthe ADA. Florida joins Maine, Texas and Washington State in having a \ncertified building code thereby ensuring better compliance with the ADA \nby architects, builders and contractors within the State.\n  The Civil Rights Division has also resolved several hate crimes cases \nover the past seven months, including: In Idaho, six men pled guilty to \nengaging in a series of racially motivated attacks on Mexican American \nmen, women and children, some as young as 9; in Arizona, three members \nof a skinhead group pled guilty to burning a cross in the front yard of \nan African American woman; and in Texas, a man pled guilty to entering \na Jewish temple and firing several gun shots while shouting anti-\nSemitic slurs.\n  The Division has also been vigorously enforcing its criminal \nstatutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas \ncharged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico \ncorrectional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it \nup; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, \nbeing lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and \nguilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to \nsell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery \ncontinuing in the U.S., Bill Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task \nForce to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I \ncommend Mr. Lee for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes.\n  Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled \nin the past few months include the following: several long-standing \nschool desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were \nterminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, \nUtah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were \ndeported and interned in the United States during World War II finally \nreceived compensation this year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. \nwere settled to allow women access to women's health clinics.\n  This record indicates that Bill Lee has been running the Division the \nway it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have lots of show \nhorses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public official who is \nworking hard to help solve our Nation's problems. I like people who get \nthe job done. I commend Bill Lann Lee and the many hardworking \nprofessionals at the Civil Rights Division.\n  Bill Lee has served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division for \nseven months now. Given the claims made by many in the Senate last fall \nthat Mr. Lee would lead the Division astray, you might expect that he \nwould be in the headlines every day associated with some extreme \ndecision. Instead, we have seen the strong and steady work of the \nDivision--solid achievements and effective law enforcement.\n  Just last week, I received a letter from Governor Zell Miller of \nGeorgia that is emblematic of the record that Bill Lee has established. \nGovernor Miller discusses Bill Lee's efficient and effective ability to \nsettle an action which involved Georgia's juvenile detention \nfacilities. He notes that he was not exactly a fan of the Civil Rights \nDivision before Bill Lee came along and writes that he ``was fearful \nthat Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to present \nour position, and that we would once again be compelled to engage in \nprotracted and expensive litigation.'' Governor Miller writes that his \nfears were unfounded, that the parties engaged in ``intensive and \nexpeditious negotiations'' and reached a fair agreement. Governor \nMiller also notes:\n\n       I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly \n     that he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism, \n     fairness, and respect during our negotiations. Under the \n     direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a potentially \n     divisive and litigious process was transformed into an \n     atmosphere where the State was able to have its case heard \n     fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting all \n     parties. This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division \n     should operate in its dealings with the states, and I am \n     pleased to commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in \n     this matter.\n\n  Bill Lee continues to build on his reputation as a professional and \neffective negotiator who routinely earns praise from opposing parties. \nI had high expectations for Bill Lee when he was nominated and I have \nnot been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job, and I know that he \nwill keep up the good work.\n  The President renominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in charge of the Civil Rights Division on January 29 of this \nyear. Given his outstanding performance over the past seven months, I \nhope Chairman Hatch and the other Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee will reconsider his nomination, review his record and \nfavorably report the nomination of Bill Lee to the Senate so that he \nmay be confirmed as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \nBill Lee deserves it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Governor Miller of \nGeorgia be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Georgia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                            Atlanta, July 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: It is my understanding that \n     you are conducting an oversight hearing concerning the Civil \n     Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. \n     The purpose of this letter is to advise you of the State of \n     Georgia's recent experience with the Civil Rights Division, \n     which ultimately resulted in a joint agreement concerning our \n     state juvenile detention facilities.\n       During much of 1997, representatives of the Civil Rights \n     Division investigated certain alleged conditions and \n     practices in detention facilities operated by Georgia's \n     Department of Juvenile Justice. The Justice Department \n     received full cooperation from state officials during its \n     investigation\n       When the Justice Department's findings letter was released \n     earlier this year, I was very upset with the manner in which \n     the letter was issued and many of the comments contained in \n     that correspondence. Frankly, given our state's prior \n     experiences with the Department of Justice in general, and \n     the Civil Rights Division in particular, I was fearful that \n     Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to \n     present our position, and that we would once again be \n     compelled to engage in protracted and expensive litigation.\n       I, members of my staff, and the Attorney General of Georgia \n     made these concerns known to Acting Assistant Attorney \n     General Bill Lann Lee and other Justice Department officials. \n     We indicated a willingness to discuss the Justice \n     Department's concerns and reach a reasonable resolution, as \n     long as the legitimate interests of the State of Georgia in \n     insuring public safety and developing its own policies would \n     be honored.\n       After intensive and expeditious negotiations, the State of \n     Georgia and the Department of Justice, through its Civil \n     Rights Division directed by Mr. Lee, arrived at a Memorandum \n     of Agreement which recognizes Georgia's legitimate interests \n     to protect its citizens and set its own policies while, at \n     the same time, improve services for youths in state custody. \n     I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly that \n     he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism, \n     fairness, and respect during our negotiations.\n       Under the direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a \n     potentially divisive and litigious process was transformed \n     into an atmosphere where the State was able to have its case \n     heard fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting \n     all parties.\n       This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division should \n     operate in its dealings with the states, and I am pleased to \n     commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in this \n     manner.\n       With kindest regards, I remain.\n           Sincerely,\n     Zell Miller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8131-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8132-S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8132-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 142\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the Comprehensive National Energy Strategy \n(Strategy) to the Congress. This report required by section 801 of the \nDepartment of Energy Organization Act (Public Law 95-91; 42 U.S.C. \n7321(b)), highlights our national energy policy. It contains specific \nobjectives and plans for meeting five essential, common sense goals \nenumerated in the accompanying message from Secretary Pena.\n  Energy is a global commodity of strategic importance. It is also a \nkey contributor to our economic performance, and its production and use \naffect the environment in many ways. Thus, affordable, adequate, and \nenvironmentally benign supplies of energy are critical to our Nation's \neconomic, environmental, and national security.\n  The Strategy reflects the emergence and interconnection of three \npreeminent challenges in the late 1990s: how to maintain energy \nsecurity in increasingly globalized energy markets; how to harness \ncompetition in energy markets both here and abroad; and how to respond \nto local and global environmental concerns, including the threat of \nclimate change. The need for research and development underlies the \nStrategy, which incorporates recommendations of my Committee of \nAdvisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) for improvements in energy \ntechnologies that will enable the United States to address our energy-\nrelated challenges. Advances in energy technology can strengthen our \neconomy, reduce our vulnerability to oil shocks, lower the cost of \nenergy to consumers, and cut emissions of air pollutants as well as \ngreenhouse gases.\n  This Strategy was developed over several months in an open process. \nThree public hearings were held earlier this year in California, Texas, \nand Washington, D.C., and more than 300 public comments were received. \nThis Strategy is not a static document; its specifics can be modified \nto reflect evolving conditions, while the framework provides policy \nguidance into the 21st century. My Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to implement the Strategy and to achieve its \ngoals in the most effective manner possible.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, July 14, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8133-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 143\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As provided by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended \n(Public Law 92-463; 5 U.S.C. App. 2, 6(c)), I am submitting the Twenty-\nsixth Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees, covering fiscal \nyear 1997.\n  Consistent with my commitment to create a more responsive government, \nthe executive branch continues to implement my policy of maintaining \nthe number of advisory committees within the ceiling of 534 required by \nExecutive Order 12838 of February 10, 1993. As a result, the number of \ndiscretionary advisory committees (established under general \ncongressional authorizations) was held to 467, or 42 percent fewer than \nthose 801 committees in existence at the beginning of my \nAdministration.\n  Through the advisory committee planning process required by Executive \nOrder 12838, the total number of advisory committees specifically \nmandated by statute has declined. The 391 such groups supported at the \nend of fiscal year 1997 represents a 4 percent decrease over the 407 in \nexistence at the end of fiscal year 1996. Compared to the 439 advisory \ncommittees mandated by statute at the beginning of my Administration, \nthe net total for fiscal year 1997 reflects an 11 percent decrease \nsince 1993.\n  Furthermore, my Administration will assure that the total estimated \ncosts to fund these groups in fiscal year 1998, or $43.8 million, are \ndedicated to support the highest priority public involvement efforts. \nWe will continue to work with the Congress to assure that all advisory \ncommittees that are required by statute are regularly reviewed through \nthe congressional reauthorization process and that any such new \ncommittees proposed through legislation are closely linked to national \ninterests.\n  Combined savings achieved through actions taken by the executive \nbranch to eliminate unneeded advisory committees during fiscal year \n1997 were $2.7 million, including $545,000 saved through the \ntermination of five advisory committees established under Presidential \nauthority.\n  During fiscal year 1997, my Administration successfully worked with \nthe Congress to clarify further the applicability of FACA to committees \nsponsored by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National \nAcademy of Public Administration (NAPA). This initiative resulted in \nthe enactment of the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 \n(Public Law 105-153), which I signed into law on December 17, 1997. The \nAct provides for new and important means for the public and other \ninterested stakeholders to participate in activities undertaken by \ncommittees established by the Academies in support of executive branch \ndecisionmaking processes.\n  As FACA enters its second quarter-century during fiscal year 1998, it \nis appropriate for both the Congress and my Administration to continue \nexamining opportunities for strengthening the Act's role in encouraging \nand promoting public participation. Accordingly, I am asking the \nAdministrator of General Services to prepare a legislative proposal for \nmy consideration that addresses an overall policy framework for \nleveraging the public's role in Federal decisionmaking through a wide \nvariety of mechanisms, including advisory committees.\n  By jointly pursuing this goal, we can fortify what has been a \nuniquely American approach toward collaboration. As so aptly noted by \nAlexis de Tocqueville in  Democracy in America (1835), ``In democratic \ncountries knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all other forms \nof knowledge; on its progress depends that of all the others.'' This \nobservation strongly resonates at this moment in our history as we seek \nto combine policy opportunities with advances in collaboration made \npossible by new technologies, and an increased desire of the Nation's \ncitizens to make meaningful contributions to their individual \ncommunities and their country.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe limitation on the amount of receipts attributable to military \nproperty which may be treated as exempt foreign trade income; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              defense jobs and trade promotion act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and \nTrade Promotion Act of 1998. This bill will eliminate a provision of \ntax law which discriminates against United States exporters of defense \nproducts.\n  Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate \nincome taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added \ntaxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of \ntheir exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that \nis not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax \npolicy.\n  In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. \ncompanies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which \nU.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits \nfrom FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate \nthe advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-\nadded tax rebates.\n  But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. \nThis 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 22 years ago \nas part of the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was \nnot based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the \ndifference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry \nwas so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nwere inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters \nshould be treated equally.\n  Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from \nforeign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over \nthe past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in \nmaintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to \nallow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle \nto exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international \nplaying field for U.S. defense product manufacturers.\n  The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even \nless sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to \na foreign government requires the determination of both the President \nand the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the \nUnited States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of \nfair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced \nwhen our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of \nits compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces.\n  The bill I am introducing today will repeal the provision of the \nForeign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense \nproduct manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. \ncompanies in world markets and our national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the distribution of certain \npublications in units of the National Park System under a sales \nagreement between the Secretary of the Interior and a private \ncontractor; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              national parks magazine proposal legislation\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee responsible for funding the National Park \nSystem's annual budget and as a long time resident of Washington \nState--home to some of the true crown jewels of the system, I have long \nheld both a personal and professional interest in ensuring that our \nparks are adequately funded and well maintained.\n  Unfortunately in recent years due to declining budgets, more units \nadded to the system, and substantial increases in visitation, our park \nsystem faces some serious challenges. All told, the total unfunded \nbacklog in maintenance, resource stabilization, infrastructure repair \nand employee housing alone is a staggering $8.7 billion.\n  While I have done everything I can to ensure that the National Park \nService receives annual increases at a time when overall funding for \nthe Department of Interior continues to decline, the fact is new, \ninnovative ideas are imperative to overcome this desperate situation. \nFor this reason, I have promoted such ideas in my Interior \nAppropriations bill.\n  One idea that was incorporated into our bill during the 104th \nCongress was the establishment of the recreation fee demonstration \nprogram. Under this three-year pilot program, individual units of the \nNational Park and National Forest systems that charge an additional \nentry fee get to keep 80% of the receipts collected from that fee \nwithin the park or forest unit to help address the backlog of \noperational and maintenance needs.\n  The user fee program is designed to give each unit more authority \nover the resources needed to maintain facilities, to repair roads and \nother areas in need of up keep. While nobody likes higher fees, I have \nlong believed that the public is willing to pay more to visit these \nnational treasures if it could be assured that such increases went to \naddressing critical needs at the parks they visited. The recreation fee \ndemonstration program is a small, but positive step forward in this \ndirection.\n  More recently, I have gotten behind the ideas and efforts of Senator \nCraig Thomas, Chairman of the authorizing subcommittee on national \nparks. Senator Thomas recently developed a comprehensive and forward \nthinking proposal to reinvigorate the park system. In addition to \nmaking my Recreation Fee Demonstration Program permanent and extending \nit to all units of the National Park System, Senator Thomas' proposal \nwhich passed the Senate last month contains a number of reforms which \nwould improve overall services at our parks and hopefully generate more \nrevenue. I am pleased to have supported Senator Thomas in this effort \nboth as a fellow member of the Senate Energy Committee and on the \nSenate floor.\n  In addition to my colleagues and my own ideas, I am also relying on \nthe suggestions of the recreation community in my state of Washington \nwhich is home to the Olympic, Mount Ranier, and North Cascades National \nParks. Recently, I was approached by Mr. John Taylor, a constituent of \nmine from the Seattle area, who came up with a thoughtful--albeit \nnarrower proposal--which only furthers the interests of the system. \nThis idea would create a National Park Service magazine similar to that \nestablished by the National Smithsonian Institution through its \npublication of the Smithsonian Magazine.\n  A National Park magazine would be created for people who visit or \nhave a particular interest in our parks, their programs, and purpose. \nThe plan is to create a high quality commercial consumer publication \nthat will have broad appeal and park specific sections that will \nprovide useful information and serve as a guide for the park where a \nspecific edition is distributed.\n\n  Revenue generated from the sale of advertising in the magazine as \nwell as from the sale of the publication itself would go directly to \nthe Park in which the magazines are sold. Proponents of such a project \ninform me that such a magazine would generate $45 million for the \nNational Park Service over the first 5 years of publication and $10-$12 \nmillion each year thereafter.\n  Unfortunately, current Park Service regulations severely restrict the \nsale of publications which contain advertising in units of the national \npark. Existing regulations are unnecessary in this case because a \nmagazine for the national parks would no more commercialize the parks \nthan the Smithsonian Magazine commercializes the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  Ads in a Park publication are very different than corporate signs and \ncorporate sponsorships in the parks. Magazines are invisible except to \nthose who purchase them. They don't enter the landscape in any way. \nThey don't alter infrastructure. They don't use facilities. They don't \nexpress or imply any kind of ownership or funding of any part of the \nParks by sponsoring companies. Nor do they imply an endorsement of the \nproduct by the National Park Service. Moreover, individual parks have \nfor years distributed information, maps and so on which contain ads \nfrom local community sponsors to cover their cost. A National Park \nService magazine is merely an expansion of this idea.\n  Because of current NPS administrative roadblocks, I am introducing \nlegislation which would correct this problem and allow the Park Service \nto begin consideration of magazine proposals. The entire cost of the \nproject will be covered by the advertising and sales revenue the \npublication will generate through the large anticipated readership. The \nPark Service not only gains a vehicle for educating and informing the \npublic about Parks--something that has been sorely needed for years--it \ndoes so at no cost. In fact under this proposal, it could do so while \ngenerating revenue for the Parks.\n  While the revenue generated from this proposal is a mere pittance \ncompared to the multibillion backlog our\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\nparks currently face, the continued development and implementation of \nideas such as this are critical to the long term restoration of our \nparks. I believe every Senator has an obligation to listen to good \nideas at the grass roots level that help solve this growing problem. \nWith budgets continuing to decline and demands only increasing for \nrecreational outlets. Congress must continue to rely on the interested \npublic for creative solutions that will generate more revenue for this \nimportant purpose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 2304. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe carryover of unused nontaxable benefits under cafeteria plans, \nflexible spending arrangements, and health flexible spending accounts; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 flexible spending accounts legislation\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to \nprovide individuals with greater control over their health care choices \nand dollars. This legislation will allow individuals enrolled in \nFlexible Spending Accounts (FSA) at year's end to move unutilized funds \nin the amount of $500 or less to other tax protected accounts such as: \na medical savings account, an individual retirement account or a 401k \naccount.\n\n  A flexible spending account is one of the options available to \nemployers as they provide benefits to their employees. At the beginning \nof the year the employer gives the employee a set number of pre-tax \nbenefit dollars which they can then allocate to any one or combination \nof the IRS approved FSA uses: health care, life insurance, day care, \nvacation, or retirement. The employee then must determine at the \nbeginning of the year the number of dollars they will put in each \naccount. In most cases the employee hopes they have made the \nappropriate allocation. If the employee has over funded a particular \naccount they lose those benefit dollars at the end of the year.\n  About 21.7 million Americans lose between $125 to $200 every year \nbecause of a 1984 Internal Revenue Service regulation that governs \nFSAs. Every year Americans lose between $4.3 and $2.7 billion due to \nthis IRS regulation! The regulation mandates that individuals with FSAs \nmust either ``use-it-or-lose-it.'' In other words, if you do not spend \nyour money by the end of the year, your employer gets to keep the money \nyou don't spend!\n  This legislation will allow individuals enrolled in flexible spending \naccounts at year's end to ``rollover'' or move up to $500 per year from \ntheir FSA into one of the approved accounts including: IRAs, MSAs, or \n401ks. The funds rolled over into an appropriate account would be \ntreated for tax purposes as a rollover contribution for the taxable \nyear from which it was unused. The $500 allowable rollover would be \nindexed in increments of $50 and rounded to the lowest multiple of $50.\n  I believe this small change would have a significant impact on \nindividuals and their health care. First, the incentive would be to \nspend these dollars only on health care services that are necessary, \nthus encouraging rational health care spending rather than the \nirrational health care spending promoted by the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' \npolicy. Second, individuals would be more inclined to open up a MSA, \nand in doing so they would have both greater portability and greater \nchoice. This would empower individuals by giving them greater control \nover their own health care dollars and expand access and choice. Third, \nmore rational spending is likely to translate into lower health care \ncosts and greater competition.\n  I hope the Senate will act swiftly to hold hearings and to move this \nlegislation through the committee process to the Senate floor for final \nconsideration. I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand would welcome their cosponsorship. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2305. A bill for the relief of Nizar Sweilem and Hassan Sweilem; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a private relief \nbill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would grant Nizar \nand Hassan Sweilem permanent residence in the United States. Nizar and \nHassan Sweilem are natives and citizens of Lebanon. They are also \nbrothers.\n  The Sweilem brothers have lived in Des Plaines, Illinois for fourteen \nyears and have made the most of this opportunity to obtain a first-\nclass education in this country. Nizar recently earned a Ph.D. in \nbiochemistry from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Hassan earned \na B.S. in Political Science and is completing a degree in Computer \nScience also at the University of Illinois.\n  Both Nizar and Hassan were born in Beirut, Lebanon. They entered the \nUnited States as children in August of 1983 to visit relatives. When \nthey entered the United States, they were accompanied by their mother, \nand their maternal uncle. Their uncle returned early to Lebanon and was \nkilled two weeks later when a rocket destroyed the Sweilem family home.\n  In April of 1984, because of her brother's murder and her own fear of \npersecution, Leila Sweilem applied to the INS for asylum in the United \nStates without the assistance of counsel. Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were \nincluded in their mother's application since they were her minor \nchildren. Since 1984, the Sweilem brothers have been pursuing the right \nto live legally in the United States as permanent residents.\n  In 1985, the INS denied the Sweilems' request for asylum and \ninitiated deportation proceedings against the family. Leila, Nizar and \nHassan renewed their application for asylum in their hearing before an \nImmigration Judge, but those requests were denied. The Sweilems \nappealed that decision, but before any decision was issued, the \nAttorney General designated nationals of Lebanon eligible for Temporary \nProtected Status on account of the extreme level of violence created by \nthe Lebanese civil war. TPS for citizens of Lebanon continued until \nMarch of 1993.\n  In August of 1993, Hassan and Nizar asked that their asylum appeal be \nreinstated and that their case be remanded to allow them to apply for \nsuspension of deportation. In November of 1994, Hassan and Nizar \napplied for suspension of deportation. While their application was \npending, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nResponsibility Act in September of 1996. This law retroactively made \nNizar and Hassan ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them \nwith no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of \ndeportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation \nof removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous \nresidence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant \nwith being removable. Despite the fact that at that time the Sweilem \nbrothers had twelve years of continuous residence in the U.S., the time \naccrued after the denial of their mother's initial asylum request does \nnot count.\n  Last year, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could \nresult in grave injustices to certain groups of people, so in November \nof 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act granted relief \nto certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several \nCentral American countries.\n\n  That law allowed several hundred thousand Central Americans and \nformer Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries, who came to the U.S. \nduring the civil strife of the 1980's to adjust to permanent resident \nstatus under more lenient hardship rules that existed prior to the 1996 \nchange. The U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here \nfor over a decade, during which time many of them established families, \ncareers and community ties. If Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were citizens \nof Nicaragua, El Salvador Guatemala or any of the former Communist \ncountries of Eastern Europe, they could continue to pursue their \napplications for suspension of deportation. The fact that they are \ncitizens of Lebanon makes them ineligible for relief.\n  Nizar and Hassan Sweilem have lived in the United States for almost \n15 years, since they were 12 and 14, respectively. They have taken full \nadvantage of their educational opportunities and are more than capable \nof caring for themselves. The brothers will face undue hardship by \nreturning to Lebanon, as evidenced by their uncle's murder. The Sweilem \nbrothers' extended family now resides in the United States, and the \nbrothers have strong ties to the local community. My office has \nreceived numerous letters\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nfrom the community on their behalf, including a letter from the \nDirector of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois. They have \nno family left in Lebanon and have never visited it in the last 15 \nyears.\n  The Sweilem brothers have spent more than half their lives in the \nUnited States. At every step, the Sweilems took American law at its \nword: they always attempted to follow the law only to have Congress \nsuddenly pull the rug out from under them. I think this is an injustice \nand these two brothers from Lebanon deserve the same relief that we \ngave people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Czechoslovakia. Mr. \nPresident, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to support these Lebanese \nbrothers by giving them permanent residence status and not depriving \nthem of the opportunity to become United States citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Nizar Sweilem and Hassan Sweilem shall be held and considered \n     to have been lawfully admitted to the United States for \n     permanent residence as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     upon payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Nizar Sweilem \n     and Hassan Sweilem, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of \n     State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the \n     appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total \n     number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country \n     of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2306. A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nmodify its duopoly rule for multiple ownership of television stations; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             federal communications commission legislation\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nwould eliminate the outdated broadcast ownership restrictions in place \nat the Federal Communications Commission. I am pleased to note that I \nam introducing this legislation with the co-sponsorship of the Chairman \nof the Commerce Committee. I welcome Senator McCain's support on this \nissue and look forward to working with him to make sure that these \nimpractical restrictions are eliminated.\n  Currently, the FCC disallows ownership of stations in separate \nmarkets if the broadcast signals overlap. For example, a broadcaster \nmay not now own a station in each of the Washington, DC, and Baltimore \nmarkets. I believe that ownership of stations with overlapping signals \nshould be allowed if the stations are licensed to communities in \ndifferent markets. Practical ownership policies will encourage the \nconstruction of new television stations and broadcast networks that \nwill promote increased consumer choice.\n  In the Senate Communications Subcommittee, I have recently held \nnumerous FCC oversight hearings on how best to create a regulatory \nframework for the age of competition. I believe this bill will help to \nmove in the direction of deregulation and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP RULES.\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission shall modify the \n     television contour overlap rule set forth at section 73.3555 \n     of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, to permit any party \n     (including all parties under common control), to own, \n     operate, or control television stations despite overlapping \n     contours if the television stations are licensed to \n     communities in different television markets (as defined in \n     section 76.55(e) of such title).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Nation's generally strong economy, in a \n     number of States agricultural producers and rural communities \n     are experiencing serious economic hardship;\n       Increased supplies of agricultural commodities in \n     combination with weakened demand have caused prices of \n     numerous farm commodities to decline dramatically;\n       Demand for imported agricultural commodities has fallen in \n     some regions of the world, due in part to world economic \n     conditions, and United States agricultural exports have \n     declined from their record level of $60 billion in 1996;\n       Prolonged periods of weather disasters and crop disease \n     have devastated agricultural producers in a number of States;\n       Thirty-two of the fifty States experienced declines in \n     personal farm income between 1996 and 1997;\n       Whereas, June estimates by the Department of Agriculture \n     indicate that net farm income for 1998 will fall to $45.5 \n     billion, down 13 percent from the $52.2 billion for 1996;\n       Total farm debt for 1998 is expected to reach $172 billion, \n     the highest level since 1985;\n       Thousands of farm families are in danger of losing their \n     livelihoods and life savings\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that \n     emergency action by the President and Congress is necessary \n     to

Mr. President, as we approached the final Senate \nvote on H.R. 2676, the IRS Reform and Restructuring bill, I was \nreminded of Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities''. As a conferee on this \nbadly needed piece of legislation, I am led to observe that it is the \nbest of bills, it is the worst of bills.\n  In its germane provisions reforming the operations of the Internal \nRevenue Service it represents the best of Congress in identifying and \nenacting legislation to address the real needs of American citizens. \nBut in its last minute, secretive addition of several extraneous \nmatters, most notably the ISTEA technical corrections, it represents \nthe Congress at its worst in circumventing public debate and scrutiny.\n  In its putting the emphasis on the ``Service'' part of the IRS it \ndemonstrates the best of policy-making in pursuit of the public \ninterest which should be the focus of our efforts as national \nlegislators. But, it also demonstrates the worst of our process in that \nin our haste to get something done rapidly, before the July 4 break, we \nare willing to cut some corners on important matters of national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I support, 100 percent, the public's right to know \nwhen a federal agency abuses a taxpayer, and I support the public's \ndemand for a remedy to that intolerable situation. I was extremely \nproud to have been chosen to serve as a member of the conference \ncommittee on the IRS bill. Chairman Roth, Vice Chairman Archer, Senator \nMoynihan, Congressman Rangel, and the remaining conferees from the \nSenate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee did \nyeoman's work in crafting one of the most significant acts of the 105th \nCongress--the IRS Reform and Restructuring bill.\n  This is groundbreaking legislation which recreates the IRS and puts \nin place dramatic changes which will make the agency more accountable \nto the American taxpayer. This bill revives the original purpose of the \nInternal Revenue Service: to collect tax revenue while providing the \nassistance and service taxpayers deserve.\n  Most importantly, taxpayers will receive overdue rights under the IRS \nReform and Restructuring Act. Under the new law, the burden of proof \nwill lie with the IRS, and taxpayers' rights in recovering civil \ndamages as a result of unacceptable collection practices by the IRS \nwill be expanded. An ``innocent spouse'' provision is also contained in \nthis legislation. This provides that all understated tax is transferred \nto the culpable spouse. Also, for couples who are divorced or have been \nlegally separated for more than 12 months, taxpayers are only liable \nfor the deficiency that is attributable to their income reporting. This \nis an important provision for those who have burdened with a tax bill \nfor which they are not responsible.\n  This conference report also reorganizes the tax collecting agency \naround the idea of taxpayer service. Knowledgeable employees who are \nspecialized in meeting the needs of specific taxpayer categories--like \nindividuals, small businesses, and corporations--will be available to \nanswer taxpayers' questions. And, the IRS Commissioner will have some \nhiring flexibility to offer special packages to qualified, successful \nprivate sector employees who will increase the professionalism and \nresponsiveness of the agency.\n  Because of these and other needed improvements, I endorse the IRS \nReform and Restructuring Act, and despite some misgivings I am about to \nenunciate, I will vote for the adoption of the conference report. \nHowever, I did not sign the report because, at the last minute, \nextraneous material was tacked on to this landmark legislation. Out of \nthe blue, and without being considered in either the House or Senate \nbill, the ISTEA technical corrections bill was included as part of the \nIRS conference report. Through this maneuver, Senator Rockefeller was \nprevented from offering his amendment on the floor of the Senate to \ncorrect an injustice done to disabled veterans with smoking-related \ndisabilities in the original ISTEA reauthorization bill. Through this \nmaneuver, the Senate and the American people were denied the \nopportunity for open debate and an up-or-down vote on an issue \naffecting America's veterans who put their life on the line for this \nnation.\n  Justice Louis Brandeis once said, ``Publicity is justly commended as \na remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the \nbest of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.'' I \ncould not vote to report out of committee the conference report because \nit runs counter to the open door, public process by which Congress \nshould responsibly pass our laws. Sadly, all too often conference \ncommittees are the vehicle by which lawmakers fast-track controversial \nmeasures behind closed doors in order to avoid unpopular votes. There \nare no fingerprints. Issues which were not in the House-passed bill, \nnot in the Senate-passed bill, too often mysteriously appear in the \nfinal conference report. Where is our accountability as the legislators \nof this country?\n  However, though I will vote for this conference report because on \nbalance it is good legislation which American taxpayers need and \ndeserve, I want to make it crystal clear that this issue of appropriate \ncompensation to veterans with smoking-related disabilities will NOT go \naway. When we come back into session after the July 4 break, I will \nwork with Sen. Rockefeller, and others, to correct the injustice done \nto our veterans in the ISTEA reauthorization bill. Specifically, I \nbelieve we need to strike the veterans' disability compensation offset \nwhich was included in the President's budget and in the ISTEA bill as \nmore of budget-saving device rather than as a clearly considered matter \nof veterans' benefit policy.\n  On another front, I am also troubled by two provisions in this \nconference report which I believe, unintentionally, compromise the \nsecurity of our nation. The first provision removes the lawful ability \nof the President, and most Cabinet members, to start or stop an audit \nor investigation of a taxpayer. Make no mistake: we all condemn the \nmisuse of power to halt legitimate investigations or audits. But the \nlack of an exemption in the case of national security and law \nenforcement jeopardizes critical efforts to protect American citizens. \nIt is my understanding that the Department of Justice has stated that \nthe provision is unconstitutional.\n  I have similar concerns about the second provision, which carves out \nan\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\nexception to the Inspector General statute, so that the Secretary of \nthe Treasury is prohibited from exercising his authority to stop an \ninvestigation by the Tax IG when national security or law enforcement \nissues are at stake. The Treasury Department and the Central \nIntelligence Agency are both opposed to this provision.\n  I worked with the other conferees to try to work out these national \nsecurity problems but ultimately those efforts fell short because of \ntime constraints.\n  On balance, though, I support, enthusiastically, H.R. 2676, the IRS \nReform and Restructuring Act. It will significantly improve the \nposition of American taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS. But I \nabhor the closed door process by which the ISTEA technical corrections \nbill was attached. However, this and the national security flaws are \ncorrectable, if not now on this legislation, then certainly before the \nSenate adjourns for the year. I pledge my efforts to achieve that \ngoal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8150-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a recent, near-tragic incident has \ncome to my attention; an incident which in my view casts significant \nlight on the debate over partial birth abortion.\n  According to the Associated Press, on June 30 of this year Dr. John \nBiskind delivered a full-term baby girl. Unfortunately, this little \ngirl was almost killed. She suffered cuts to her face and a skull \nfracture. Officials have refused to comment on her condition. She is \nscheduled to be adopted by a Texas couple, so it is my hope that she \nwill experience a full recovery.\n  But we should not lose track of the cause of her injuries: Dr. \nBiskind attempted to perform a partial birth abortion. The 17 year-old \nmother had come to Dr. Biskind's A-Z Women's Center seeking an \nabortion. The clinic performed an ultrasound, determining that what \nthey had here was a 23.6 week fetus, and determined to perform a \npartial birth abortion.\n  Dr. Biskind thought he was performing this inhuman procedure on a \nfetus two thirds of the way to term. That would be bad enough. But in \nfact Dr. Biskind's clinic made an unbelievable mistake in the \nultrasound. The girl actually was approaching full term. And Dr. \nBiskind did not realize this fact until he already had begun aborting \nher.\n  This is astounding, Mr. President. According to Dr. Carolyn Gerster, \na Phoenix physician and chairman of Arizona Right to Life, a 24-week-\nold fetus weighs an average of 2 pounds, whereas a 36 week-old fetus \nweighs about 6 and a half pounds. As Dr. Gerster commented, ``I don't \nknow how such a grave error could be made in estimating the size. There \nshouldn't be that kind of discrepancy in an ultrasound. It's \nhorrendous.''\n  Horrendous indeed, Mr. President. But this was not the first \nhorrendous mistake made by this abortionist. Dr. Biskind was censured \nby the medical board in 1996 when a patient bled to death after \nundergoing an abortion. He also was reprimanded in 1989 for \nmisdiagnosis or mistreatment of a patient, and in 1990 for improperly \nprescribing drugs. A similar complaint was dismissed in 1994.\n  This incident, and Dr. Biskind's deplorable record as a physician, \ncast on ugly light on an unfortunate procedure. Too many women in \nAmerica are being subjected to partial birth abortions. Whatever one's \nviews on the abortion issue itself, and I am strongly pro-life, there \nis no basis for defending partial birth abortion. The procedure is \nnever, let me emphasize that Mr. President, never necessary for the \nlife or health of the mother. It is in fact an unnecessarily dangerous \nprocedure that increases the chance of physical harm to the mother, and \nwhich most reputable doctors refuse to even consider performing.\n  Defenders of partial birth abortion have relied on a number of \nuntruths, including the false story that the procedure is performed \nonly in rare occasions. We now know, Mr. President, that that just \nisn't so. We also know that there are abortionists like Dr. Biskind out \nthere who let their patients bleed to death and who allow an ultrasound \nin their clinic to be botched so badly that they almost kill a fully \nformed baby girl.\n  It is time to shut down clinics like Dr. Biskind's. If defenders of \nabortion rights are really serious about defending women's health, they \nshould join with me and those of my colleagues who have sought to ban \npartial birth abortion. They also should fight with me to keep women \nfrom having to undergo any kind of abortion.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, America is not doing enough for her expectant \nmothers. Too many are abandoned by their husbands, boyfriends, and \nfamilies in their time of special need. Too many feel alone and \npowerless in the face of an unexpected pregnancy. Too many fall into \nthe hands of the Dr. Biskind's of this world because they have not been \nfully informed of their options, including the availability of loving \ncouples like the one that is adopting the girl Dr. Biskind almost \naborted.\n  I intend to work as hard as I can, Mr. President, to bring practices \nlike Dr. Biskind's to an end. It is long past time, in my view, for us \nto overturn President Clinton's veto of the ban on partial birth \nabortion. It also is long past time for us to make women more aware of \nthe adoption option as we seek to make the better choice--the choice of \nlife--easier to make.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the associated press \nstory, as it appears in the Washington Times, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From The Washington Times, Fri., July 10, 1998]\n\n    Abortion Aborted For Birth of Girl--Fetus' Age was Miscalculated\n\n       Phoenix (AP)--A doctor performing a partial-birth abortion \n     on what he says he thought was a 23-week fetus realized in \n     the middle of the procedure that the pregnancy was much \n     further along and instead delivered a full-term baby.\n       Police and the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners are \n     investigating Dr. John Biskind and the June 30 birth at A-Z \n     Women's Center, which terminates pregnancies through the 24th \n     week.\n       ``At this point, it doesn't appear anybody will be charged \n     with anything,'' Sgt. Mike Torres said.\n       The 6-pound, 2-ounce girl suffered a skull fracture and \n     cuts on her face and remained hospitalized yesterday. \n     Officials refused to comment on her condition. A Texas couple \n     plans to adopt the girl, authorities said.\n       The 17-year-old mother went to the clinic June 29 seeking \n     to undergo a procedure in which the doctor delivers a fetus \n     feet first up to its neck, punches a hole into its skull and \n     sucks out its brain through a tube, killing the child.\n       Ultrasound testing at the clinic determined her fetus was \n     23.6 weeks' developed, the doctor said.\n       During the procedure the next day, Dr. Biskind realized the \n     pregnancy was much further along, halted the abortion and \n     delivered the infant, police said.\n       A woman who answered the phone at the abortion clinic said \n     Dr. Biskind had no comment. ``We're dealing with the police \n     on this,'' said the woman, who would not give her name.\n       Police and the Maricopa County Attorney's Office are \n     investigating to determine whether a crime was committed.\n       Dr. Carolyn Gerster, a Phoenix physician who is chairwoman \n     of Arizona Right to Life, said the average weight for a 24-\n     week fetus is about 2 pounds and about 6\\1/2\\ pounds at 36 \n     weeks.\n       ``I don't know how such a grave error could be made in \n     estimating the size,'' she said. ``There shouldn't be that \n     kind of discrepancy in an ultrasound. It's horrendous.''\n       The medical board censured Dr. Biskind in 1996 after a \n     patient bled to death following an abortion. The patient's \n     family has a lawsuit pending against him.\n       He also was reprimanded in 1989 for misdiagnosis or \n     mistreatment of a patient and for improperly prescribing \n     drugs in 1990. A similar complaint was dismissed in \n     1994.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION'S YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR \n                              OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a very \nspecial Hawaii business person. Charles Wesley Fortner is the recipient \nof the 1998 U.S. Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneur of \nthe Year Award. Mr. Fortner, 28 years of age, is a resident of \nMililani, Hawaii, and the founder and president of the Honolulu-based \ntelecommunications firm, Island Page, Inc.\n  In 1994, Mr. Fortner had the courage to move to Hawaii to open the \nbusiness by himself. With two partners who gave him the paging rights \nto the Hawaiian Islands, Mr. Fortner established the business location \nand field tested\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nthe equipment that carries the paging signals by driving and walking \nall over the island.\n  In less than four years, Island Page has grown from a one-man \noperation to a company with a trained staff of 18 employees. Mr. \nFortner's motivational ability and management style encourage his \nemployees to operate the business with a strong customer service \nattitude. Those who know Mr. Fortner consider him the model of the new \nbusiness mentor for the next century.\n  Island Page sales totaled $280,000 in 1995 and increased 370 percent \nin 1996 to pass the $1 million mark. Sales for 1997 were expected to \nincrease another 50 percent. The company achieved a profit of 12 \npercent in 1996 and anticipated a 25 percent return in 1997.\n  Mr. Fortner is the man behind Island Page's popular ``Captain Beep \nBeep'' radio campaign. His creative abilities have also played a major \nrole in establishing the technical requirements of the company. He \nbrought with him to Hawaii a new line of equipment that allowed him to \noperate the business at a lower cost than his competitors. The company \nstarted in one location on Oahu, moved into the Dillingham community in \nthe second year and opened a third location in Hawaii Kai in 1997. \nMainland travelers can use the Island Page network and local \nsubscribers can travel anywhere in the country and receive a page from \nHawaii.\n  I am pleased that Charles Wesley Fortner has been named SBA's 1998 \nYoung Entrepreneur of the Year. I believe that he embodies the best \nHawaii has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8151-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO HERBERT C. GREEN: AN INSPIRATIONAL LEADER AND DEVOTED \n                                HUSBAND\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Herbert \nGreen from Norcross, Georgia for his service in the United Auto Workers \nUnion, and on 50 years of love and devotion to his lovely wife Autince \nas they celebrate their Golden Wedding Anniversary on Sunday, July 19, \n1998.\n  Walter Ruether, the great UAW leader, once said, ``the most important \nthing in the world is to fight for the other guy.''\n  This quote reminds me a lot of Herb Green because, for the last \nseveral decades, he has been organizing, educating and tirelessly \nfighting for the rights of working men and women in Georgia and our \nNation.\n  Many of us know how important the labor movement has been for the \nimprovement of working conditions and fair compensation for millions of \nAmericans. None of this would have happened if it had not been for \ntireless, visionary individuals who were willing to work on behalf of \ntheir coworkers, such as Herb Green. Prior to his retirement in 1987 as \nthe International Representative for Region 8, he focused his efforts \nin the educational and political arenas of the UAW and the State of \nGeorgia. His UAW involvement continues as a member of the UAW's \nAdvisory Council.\n  Herb's union work began in 1938 when he became a member of the Boot & \nShoe Workers Union, followed by membership in the Packing House Workers \nUnion from 1940 to 1942. After being hired at Local 10 (then GM BOP, \nnow GM CPC) in Doraville in January 1949, Herb established his first \nUAW membership. He quickly became an active participant in Local 10's \naffairs, where he served as an Alternate Committeeman, Trustee, member \nof the Building Committee, District Committeeman, and for a number of \nyears, Chairman of the Shop Committee.\n  In January 1962 he was appointed as a member of the Region's CAP \nEducation Staff by then Director, E. T. Michael, a job he held through \nmost of his union career, representing Georgia, Florida and South \nCarolina. He also served as a UAW International Representative of \nRegion 8, consisting of the states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, \nTennessee, four counties in south central Pennsylvania, the District of \nColumbia, and Berkeley County, West Virginia.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Herb for many \nyears. On issues like employee rights and education for our children, \nnobody has worked longer, fought harder or been more committed than \nhim. I am proud to call Herb a close friend and someone who I look to \nfor advice and guidance.\n  A long time activist in the political and civic life of Georgia, Herb \nhas served as a member of the Board of Review of the Georgia Employment \nSecurity Agency, the Urban League, Board Member of the United Way, Vice \nChairman of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, Member of the Board \nof Elections of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, Member of Georgia \nState University's Advisory Committee of Labor Studies, and Chairman of \nthe Trustees of Winter's Chapel Methodist Church, where he and his \nfamily have been members for many years.\n  Herb, who just celebrated his 77th birthday, was born on July 6, \n1921. He and his wife have two children, a daughter Kathy and a son \nTerry, and five grandchildren--the true inspirations of their lives.\n  I am pleased to call attention to Herb's nearly half a century of \ndedicated service to the UAW and to congratulate him and Autince on 50 \nyears of marital bliss. I know that they have many more years of \nhappiness ahead of them. I wish them both the best and look forward to \ncontinuing our cherished friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF ROMANIA\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, there has been a remarkable degree of \nbipartisan cooperation in moving this bill forward. I would like to \nthank Senator Biden, Senator Chafee, and Senator Leahy for their help \nin drafting the Senate bill, which is a companion to H.R. 2870, \nintroduced by Representatives Portman, Kasich and Hamilton. I would \nalso like to thank my twenty nine additional Senate cosponsors from \nboth sides of the aisle for their important support. I would especially \nlike to thank Senator Helms for cosponsoring the bill and moving it \nexpeditiously through the Committee on Foreign Relations, which \napproved it by voice vote on May 19, 1998.\n  Senator Biden and I have worked together on international \nenvironmental issues for many years. The original debt-for-nature bill \nwas the Biden-Lugar Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act of \n1989. This was followed by President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas \nInitiative (EAI), which also linked debt reduction and environmental \nprotection in the developing nations of Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n  S. 1758, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, allows lower and \nmiddle income developing countries to reduce certain debts owed to the \nU.S. Government under the Foreign Assistance Act and the Agricultural \nTrade and Development Assistance Act. In return, they must place local \ncurrencies in a tropical forest fund to protect outstanding tropical \nforests in their own country.\n  The tropical forest fund in each country would be administered by a \nlocal board. These boards would be comprised of representatives of its \ngovernment, our government and environmental, community development, \nforestry, scientific and academic organizations with expertise in the \nprotection of tropical forests. A majority of the\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\nlocal board would have to represent these nongovernmental \norganizations. Oversight would be accomplished through expanding the \nEnterprise for the Americas Board to fifteen members, with eight \nmembers representing federal agencies and seven representing \nnongovernmental organizations with expertise in the protection of \ntropical forests. All grants of more than $100,000 would have to be \napproved by this Board.\n  The United States has a strong interest in helping to protect \ntropical forests in developing countries. Our world food security \ndepends on tropical forests, which provide genetic materials to enhance \nworld food production and which regulate the hydrological cycles on \nwhich world agriculture depends. The fight against cancer depends upon \nplants in tropical forests. Tropical forests also store carbon, \nmitigating the build up of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere.\n  I urge the Senate to support S. 1758 along with the technical and \nclarifying amendments which Senator Helms, Senator Biden and I have \noffered to the Committee reported bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I join with my friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Indiana, to urge my colleagues to support the \nTropical Forest Protection Act of 1998.\n  Mr. President, this bill marks a real victory for sensible, \nbipartisan action on an issue of global importance. Just looking at the \nlist of our cosponsors--thirty-one of our colleagues, evenly divided \nbetween our two parties--shows me that good policy is good politics.\n  Right now, as we speak today, fires are burning in tropical forests \naround the world, the result of a combustible mix of unusually dry \nweather with unsustainable human activity. Slash-and-burn agriculture, \nlogging, and the road cuts to support those activities, have exposed \none of our planet's most important resources to a deadly threat.\n  Rainforests have a profound effect on our planet's weather, through \ntheir ability to absorb the most important greenhouse gas, carbon \ndioxide. They influence rainfall, and are therefore the sources of many \nof our most important rivers, that in turn support the farms and \nfisheries that feed us.\n  They are home to rich biological diversity--both flora and fauna--\nthat we are just now realizing hold the secret to disease-resistant \ncrops and new medicines.\n  But as the nations that contain our most significant rainforests \nenter the world economy, they are under increasing pressure to turn \nthese irreplaceable assets into cash, for both their own short-term \ndomestic needs and to service debts owed to the industrial nations, \nincluding the United States.\n  That's why this bill is so important. It allows the reduction of the \ndebt those nations owe us, if they use the savings to protect those \nrainforests. This will help to break the tie between debt and the \ndestruction of rainforests, to the benefit of everyone. It won't put \nout those fires, but it will remove some of the financial arrangements \nthat fuel them.\n  I am particularly pleased to join again with my friend, Senator \nLugar, to expand on earlier Lugar-Biden legislation that has been on \nthe books since 1989, and that is part of the 1990 Enterprise for the \nAmericas Initiative.\n  And I am honored to be joined in this effort by the distinguished \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, and so many other of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President I am pleased to be here today with my \ndistinguished colleagues to offer my support for the Tropical Forest \nConservation Act of 1998. This bipartisan legislation addresses one of \nthe most important global environmental issues today--the protection \nand preservation of tropical rain forests.\n  Since 1950 the world has lost as much as half of its tropical \nforests, and the destruction is continuing unabated. The most \ncomprehensive survey of global deforestation estimated that, last year \nalone, we lost more than 30 million acres of tropical rain forest--an \narea the size of the State of Washington. This is a devastating loss \nbecause of the potential biological impacts deforestation can have both \nregionally and globally.\n  Tropical forests contain the world's richest stores of biological \ndiversity, and their health is essential for life on Earth. Scientists \nestimate that more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial \nbiological diversity is contained within these forests, which account \nfor less than 2 percent of the planet's land surface. Almost 40 percent \nof all terrestrial plants and at least 25 percent of terrestrial \nvertebrate species are endemic to these areas. Many of these species \nare found only in a small area of the forests. And as the forests are \ndestroyed, Mr. President, the species are permanently lost through \nextinction.\n  Tropical forests also function as carbon ``sinks,'' storing \ngreenhouse gasses that could otherwise contribute to global climate \nchange. While there are still many scientific uncertainties related to \nclimate change, it is undeniable that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels \nare rising rapidly. A significant number of scientists believe that \nhumans have already influenced our global climate. In order to lessen \nthe risks associated with this change, such as sea level rise, extreme \nweather conditions, and higher average temperatures, it is important \nthat the United States join with other nations to take preventative \naction. Protecting our tropical rain forests, and thus preserving their \nvital function of reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is one \nsuch action.\n  Many of the world's tropical forests are located in developing \ncountries that, since the international debt crisis of the 1970s, have \nbeen unable to repay loans to foreign lenders. These countries are in \nneed of hard currency, and to come up with cash, they have resorted to \nexploiting their natural resources with little regard for environmental \nplanning. Vast areas of tropical forests are destroyed each year for \nlogging, agriculture and livestock operations. This trend will continue \nas debt continues to mount.\n  Mr. President, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act will help turn \nthe tide against this deforestation. This legislation builds upon \nPresident Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, or EAI. EAI \ncreated a system by which Latin American and Carribean governments \ncould restructure some of their official debt to the United States, \nwhile channeling local currency into funds to support environmental and \nchild development programs.\n  Using so-called ``debt-for-nature swaps,'' EAI restructured bilateral \ndebt to provide $154 million to environmental trust funds in Latin \nAmerica. Under these swaps, a nation's debt is modified, rescheduled, \nor written off, in return for the borrower nation's commitment of its \nown currency towards local conservation. The legislation before us \ntoday would extend the debt-for-nature mechanism of the EAI to the \nprotection of significant tropical forests in lower and middle income \ncountries throughout the world, not just those in Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will authorize $325 million over \nthree years to be used for debt-for-nature swaps with developing \ncountries that have forests with the greatest biodiversity and the \nhighest risk of threat. S. 1758 assists countries with tropical forests \nthat are globally outstanding in terms of their biodiversity, and \napplies to any lesser developed country with tropical forests and \nqualified U.S. debt. The authorized amount would be used to compensate \nthe Treasury Department for any revenues lost due to the restructuring \nof outstanding debt.\n  The legislation gives the President authority to reduce debt owed to \nthe United States as a result of any credit extended through specific \nloan programs. In exchange, the developing countries would establish \nfunds in their local currency to preserve and restore tropical forests. \nTo ensure accountability, funds shall be administered and overseen by \nU.S. Government officials, environmental nongovernmental organizations \nactive in the beneficiary country, and scientific or academic \norganizations.\n  To qualify for assistance, countries must meet the criteria \nestablished by Congress under EAI, including that the government must \nbe democratically elected, has not provided support for acts of \ninternational terrorism, is not failing to cooperate on international\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nnarcotics control matters, and does not participate in a consistent \npattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is an important bill that will go a \nlong way in helping protect some of the world's most ecologically \nsensitive and vital areas. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act \npromotes debt reduction, investment reforms, community based \nconservation and sustainable use of the environment. In addition, it \nstretches limited Federal dollars making an effective use of \ninternational environmental assistance. I urge my colleagues here in \nthe Senate to support S. 1758.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to, the committee amendments be agreed to, and \nthe bill be read a third time.\n  The amendment (No. 3148) was agreed to.\n  The Committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1758) was read the third time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I further ask unanimous consent that the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n2870, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1758, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and, finally, S. 1758 be placed back \non the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2870), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2870) entitled ``An Act to amend the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 to facilitate protection of tropical forests \n     through debt reduction with developing countries with \n     tropical forests.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3156, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (H.R. 3156) to present a Congressional Gold Medal to Nelson \nRolihlahla Mandela.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to encourage Senate passage \nof H.R. 3156, a bill to authorize the President to present Nelson \nMandela with the Congressional gold medal. President Mandela is a \ncourageous world leader who has championed rights for freedom and \nequality for decades.\n  Nelson Mandela was born in South Africa in 1918, the son of a Tembu \ntribal chief. His tribal name, Rolihlahla, means, ``one who brings \ntrouble upon himself.'' The name seems to have led the young Mandela \ninto a life of challenge, from the time he chose to enroll in college \nin pursuit of a law degree over his right to become tribal chiefdom, to \nhis more than 25 years spent incarcerated as a political prisoner in \nhis native South Africa. Nelson Mandela continually led the cause for \nliberation of his people.\n  Mr. President, who could forget the image as multitudes of South \nAfricans stood in long lines on April 27, 1994 to cast their first vote \nin the country's first-ever democratic elections. In his inaugural \naddress, President Mandala presented himself as the right man to lead \nall people of South Africa into a time of healing for peace, justice, \nand democracy. His blueprint for South Africa is one for all citizens \nof that country regardless of race, religious affiliation or gender, \nworking together to build a nation of prosperity.\n  Nelson Mandela is known throughout the world for his long struggle in \nthe fight against apartheid and has received a number of prestigious \nhumanitarian awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. It is \nonly fitting that this country recognize Nelson Mandela's life of \ndedication and sacrifice and his victory over racial inequality not \nonly for South Africa, but for all peoples everywhere.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3156) was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/14/senate-section/article/S8159-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 15, 1998\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.
