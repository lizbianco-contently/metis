Mr. President, the amendment we have offered would \neliminate the marriage penalty, and that is an item of discussion we \nwant to discuss this morning--the Senator from Missouri and myself. A \nnumber of people have been involved in this discussion. The Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, has been one of the leading proponents \nof this particular issue of doing away with the marriage penalty.\n  Our amendment to eliminate the marriage penalty, which is being \ncosponsored by Senator Ashcroft, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, would \nreinstate income splitting and provide married couples who currently \nlabor under the onerous burden of our Tax Code with much needed relief.\n  Our amendment doubles the standard deduction for married couples. It \nis a very simple amendment. It doubles the standard deduction for \nmarried couples.\n  Currently, the single standard deduction is $4,150, while the \nmarriage standard deduction is only $6,900. Our amendment would raise \nthe standard deduction for all married couples to $8,300, precisely \ndouble what it currently is for single people.\n  That is just the heart and soul--that is the guts of what this is \nabout. We are trying to make the field the same for married couples as \nit is for singles. We think this will send a powerful signal to the \ninstitution of marriage that is central to family involvement in this \ncountry and saying that if you get married, we are not going to tax you \nmore than if you are single living together.\n  That is the simple statement here. You ask people across the country, \nIs this a good thing to do? And they clearly say, yes. It makes no \nsense that right now we tax married couples, tax two-wage-earner \nfamilies more than we do single individuals. This much needed amendment \nwould provide hard-working American families with the tax relief they \ndeserve but have not gotten from this Congress.\n  Over the past month, the Senate has considered several spending \nbills, bills which increase the size of Government and which call upon \nthe taxpayers to yield even more of their personal income to the \nFederal Government.\n  As many of my colleagues know, during consideration of the budget \nresolution, I, along with several of my colleagues, Senator Ashcroft, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith, Senator Grams, called \nfor larger tax cuts to be considered this year. Unfortunately, it \nappears with only a little amount of time left in this session that we \nare running out of time.\n  We have to put this issue forward now. We need to give the American \ntaxpayers relief. We ought to have the integrity to keep our promises \nto the American people by eliminating the marriage penalty this \nsession. The Senate leader has been very supportive of this effort. \nThis is his top priority as well, to eliminate the marriage penalty. \nThe American people sent us to Congress to lower taxes and to cut \nGovernment spending. And this Congress has gotten some of that done, \nbut not enough. Clearly, we need to keep moving forward on tax cuts. \nLet us get our work done now and let us get it done for the American \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, because we have failed to get a resolution that calls \nfor elimination of the marriage penalty, I am offering this amendment, \nalong with five of my colleagues, in order to give the taxpayers the \nrelief they deserve.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will be calling for the yeas \nand nays. I just want to make a point about what this amendment does. \nWe currently have in our Tax Code that if you have a two-wage-earner \nfamily, and their combined income is between $22,000 and $70,000, you \nhave what is called effectively a marriage penalty. You pay more tax if \nyou exist in this category--a two-wage-earner family between $22,000 \nand $70,000--you pay more tax than if the two people would just live \ntogether. It is called the marriage penalty. It amounts to about $150 \nbillion over a 5-year time period that we are taxing people.\n  I have letters here, testimonials of people who said, ``You know \nwhat? We were thinking about getting married, and then we couldn't \nbecause of the tax structure that was penalizing us for getting \nmarried.''\n  Listen to this gentleman. He is from Columbus, OH, a gentleman by the \nname of Thomas, who I will leave out his last name.\n\n       Thank you so much for addressing this issue. I am engaged \n     to be married and my fiance and I have discussed the fact \n     that we will be penalized financially. We have postponed the \n     date of our marriage in order to save up and have a ``running \n     start'' in part because of this nasty, unfair tax structure.\n\n  There are two economists in this country who every year get divorced \nat the end of the year so that they can file separately and then are \nmarried the first part of the next year and then use the money to have \na celebration with. Is that the sort of tax policy that we should have \nin America that encourages that type of situation to take place?\n  This is a lady from Alberton, MT:\n\n       My husband and I both work. We are 50 and 55 years old. \n     This is a second marriage for both of us. We delayed our \n     marriage for a number of years because of the tax \n     consequences, and lived together. I caused a great deal of \n     stress and lots of anguish amongst our family as this was not \n     the way we were raised. We finally took the tax hit--\n\n  Listen to that--\n\n       We finally took the tax hit and married to make my family \n     happy. This marriage penalty is awful!\n\n  That is from Alberton, MT, that that couple writes.\n  Is that the sort of thing we want to encourage our couples to be a \npart of or to have that sort of difficulty? I just don't think so.\n\n  This one from Iowa: ``I think the marriage penalty is an outrage, yet \nanother way the government stops us from being moral citizens.'' Can \nyou believe that? They are writing, it ``stops us from being moral \ncitizens.''\n  ``I really hope this bill passes. I'm taxed enough as it is. I don't \nmind paying taxes, but enough is enough.'' That is Joe from Des Moines, \nIA, writing that.\n  This from Wichita, KS, my home State: ``I appreciate you helping me \nand millions of other Americans.'' And I should mention, this affects \n21 million American families--21 million American families--many of \nthem just getting started as family members. ``I\n\n[[Page S9165]]\n\nappreciate your helping me and millions of other Americans who are \nstruggling to keep their families together. I work full time for county \ngovernment. My wife is a stay at home mom who works. I have four \nchildren and it is a challenge to pay the bills but we still do it. It \nwould help us if the government helped us and killed the marriage \npenalty. A fair tax system would certainly be helpful to us.''\n  They go on and on. I have pages of people who are writing in about \nthe marriage penalty and the impact that it has had upon them. Listen \nto this from Union, KY: ``Before we set a wedding date, I calculated \nthe tax implications. Since we each earned in the low $30,000s, the \nFederal marriage penalty [was how this gentleman cited it] was over \n$3,000. What a wonderful gift from the IRS.'' Are those the sort of \ngifts we want to send?\n  This is from Indiana: ``I can't tell you how disgusted we both are \nover this tax issue. If we get married, not only would I forfeit my \n$900 refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. \nDarrell and I would very much like to be married and I must say it \nbreak our hearts to find out we can't afford it.'' Can't afford to get \nmarried, thanks to the marriage penalty.\n  From Ohio: ``I'm engaged to be married and my fiance and I have \ndiscussed the fact that we will be penalized financially.''\n  Here is from Baltimore, MD: ``I am a 23-year-old, a marriage penalty \nvictim for 4 years now. I'm a union electrician who works hard to put \nfood on the table to take care of my family.'' Then he asks a simple \nquestion: ``Why is the government punishing me just because I'm \nmarried?''\n  That is a simple question that Senator Ashcroft from Missouri and I \nand a number of other people ask who want to do away with this most \nonerous, wrongheaded, bad signal of a tax. That is the marriage \npenalty. That is why we are putting this bill forward here today, to \ndeal with this particular situation. It is time we do it.\n  I want to address one other topic on this before allowing other \nSenators to speak, because I know a number want to address this \nparticular issue; that is, whether or not we can pay for this issue. \nLet me say simply we can pay for this issue and wall off all the \npayments coming to Social Security that are in surplus for Social \nSecurity. You are going to hear a number of people attacking from the \nother side, saying we cannot do this because it will take from Social \nSecurity. Then they try to pit Social Security against marriage. It is \na false choice.\n  We can preserve the entire flow of resources going to Social \nSecurity, the entire payroll tax, and do this marriage penalty lifting, \nwhich ought to be done for a positive signal and for the working \nfamilies of this country.\n  CBO last week said we had $520 billion surplus they projected over \nthe next 5 years--$520 billion. We are talking, with this particular \nmarriage penalty, just over $151 billion. So about $1.5 out of $5. Any \nsurplus that is coming into Social Security we wall off and we say that \nshould go to Social Security, and we can do it. Do not listen to the \nother side saying we are taking from Social Security to deal with the \nmarriage penalty. We are not. We don't have to do it that way. We are \nnot doing it that way. I do not support doing it that way.\n  We support keeping Social Security safe and sound, and any flow of \nresources into Social Security stays in there. We should create a real \ntrust fund and actually put the resources there. We can and we should. \nI believe we must, for the foundational institution of this democracy, \nthe family, and particularly the marriage, do this repealing of this \nmarriage penalty that penalizes two-wage-earner families making between \n$22,000 and $70,000. Many of those are newlywed, starting a family, \nwith young children involved. This involves 21 million American \nfamilies. It is time we do away with this terrible tax penalty.\n  At a later date, I will respond to some of the accusations I think \nwill probably be coming from the other side. The Senator from Missouri, \nSenator Ashcroft, has been a key champion of this particular issue, as \nI have noted, and a number of other people have as well, including \nSenator Hutchison of Texas, and I know they want to speak on this \nparticular issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri on this particular amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following be \nthe only amendments in order, other than the pending amendment to the \npending legislation, subject to relevant second-degree amendments.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment, the \nBrownback-Ashcroft amendment, to eliminate the marriage penalty in the \nTax Code. I do so with a sense of enthusiasm.\n  As I have had the opportunity to engage citizens in my home State of \nMissouri, or whether I am in some other location, I have found, and I \ndo find on a regular basis, that people understand that the most \nimportant component of this culture is not its Government in\n\n[[Page S9166]]\n\nWashington, DC. It is not even the governments that we find in the \nState capitals of the United States. The best and most important \ncomponent of governing America is to be found in families. As a matter \nof fact, I had the privilege of saying on this floor several weeks ago \nthat if moms and dads in America can do their job, governing America \nwill be easy. But if moms and dads in America can't do their job, \ngoverning America will be impossible.\n  I think this is an understanding that we share and is shared from \nBoston to Brooklyn to Bozeman. It doesn't matter what town you are in, \npeople understand that the future, the success, the survival of this \nRepublic in the next century is probably more related to whether or not \nwe have successful families than any other single component of what \nhappens in this society. Sure, it is important what we do in Congress. \nSure, it is important what happens on Wall Street. But what happens on \nMain Street and on Elm Street and in the subdivisions of America where \nfamilies exist, where families work to transmit values from one \ngeneration to the next, in an institution which has long been revered \nand always will be revered, an institution which shapes the character \nof our culture--that is what is truly important.\n  As I rise to support this amendment that would eliminate the attack \non the family that is leveled by our Tax Code, I do so with a sense \nthat this elimination is long overdue. If we really want to be \nsuccessful in the future--and I think that is the business of \ngovernment, helping create an environment in which individuals can \nsucceed and in which institutions can succeed-- there are lots of \nreasons to think we are here. But I think we simply want to build a \nsetting in which we have the right conditions for people to flourish, \nfor people to grow, for people to reach the maximum of the potential \nthat God has placed within them. If we are going to do that, we need to \ndo things that encourage structures like the family, instead of attack \nstructures like the family.\n\n  The marriage penalty attack is really not just on the family, but it \nattacks the core institution of the family. A marriage is what a family \nis built around. It is built on the durable, lasting, legally \nsanctioned, and enforced commitment of individuals to be together and \nto help each other as long as they live. There aren't very many things \nthat work that way in our culture. There are a few things they claim to \nhave lifetime guarantees on, and the like. But I don't think there are \nany institutions that are quite as lasting and helpful, which really \nstrengthen our culture as effectively as families do.\n  You can get products that say they are guaranteed for life. I was \namused by the fellow who said he was running a parachute company. \nSomebody asked, ``Are they any good?'' He said, ``We guarantee them for \nlife.'' I don't know if we would be particularly impressed with that. \nBut the family is focused on and built on marriage, which is designed \nto be a lasting, durable relationship, sanctioned by law. I think we \nshould do what we can to foster it, since it is most likely to be the \nthing that provides the basis for our success. This isn't something \nnew, as a matter of fact, in our culture.\n  America hasn't been great because we had great government or because \nwe had great business; we have had greatness in America because of the \nhearts of the people. Alexis de Tocqueville, about 160 years ago, came \nhere from France to try to assess what is it about this country that \nmakes it dynamic, that makes this country something that is catching \nthe eye of the entire world. He wrote back--and I have to paraphrase--\nthat he didn't find the greatness of America in the Halls of Congress, \nbut he found it in the homes of the people. He didn't find it in \npolitics; he found it in pulpits. He was really saying that the \ngreatness of America is something that is resident in the values and \ncharacter of America. He focused on the fact that that happens down \nbeneath the big, overarching concerns of Government, found in the \ninstitution that is singularly identified as the most important \ninstitution in our culture--the family.\n  So it is no wonder that people raise their eyebrows when they finally \nlearn what is happening to the family as a result of the Tax Code. I \nsupport this effort to eliminate the penalty that the Tax Code imposes \non people when they get married. I commend the Senator from Kansas for \nhis outstanding recounting and relating the individual details of the \ncouple from Montana and another couple from Indiana, and different \npeople around the country, who have written to say, for goodness' sake, \nstop penalizing us and making it impossible for us to really make the \nkind of marriage that we want to have, making Government attack \nmarriage through the Tax Code.\n  Frankly, American policy should reflect the principles of the \nAmerican people. It is time, instead of our policy attacking the \nprinciples, to reinforce the principles. One principle is that we don't \nwant to say to people: Don't get married. We don't want to say that we \nwill make it more expensive to get married, we will fine you or \npenalize you. We want to say: Look, we think marriage is a good thing, \nand we understand that the values that are transmitted in marriages, \nthe character that is formed there, is the basis for societal success, \nnot only in this but the next century. We want to encourage it.\n  So it is time for us to get out our eraser, if you will, and to \nreturn America to a tax policy that does not discriminate against \nmarriage. I say ``return'' America, because we haven't always had a \ndiscriminatory policy against marriage. But the marriage penalty began \nto creep into our tax law a couple of decades ago. Its onerous, \nnegative impact on this most important institution is really a scar on \nthe body politic, and it is a wound that we can ill afford to allow to \ndeepen. We must close this wound and restore this culture to the kind \nof health that has made America great.\n  Last April, a group of like-minded Senators and I, including the good \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and others, stated our \nintention to oppose the Senate's budget resolution, unless meaningful \ntax cuts were added. We have noted that the United States of America is \nnow charging people to live here more than we have ever charged people \nto live here before--the highest tax rates in history. Our Government \nis charging more. We are taking more of people's money for Government, \nleaving less of people's money for themselves and their families than \never before in the history of the country.\n  For some, I guess, who like Government and prefer not to make their \nown decisions about how they live and want to have a bureaucrat buy for \nthem what is to be purchased in the less than efficient system known as \n``Government,'' that might be OK. But to me, I am shocked. Why in the \nworld should we be paying the highest taxes in history when we are not \nat war? As a matter of fact, the highest taxes have not even gone to \nsupport defense. I think a number of us are a little bit alarmed about \nthe condition of the Nation's defense. We have slashed the defense \nbudget. We have curtailed it immeasurably to the point where I am not \nsure we are ready to prepare ourselves. We have skyrocketed other \nbureaucratic spending in Government. While we have slashed the spending \nof the defense establishment, we have also slashed the capacity of \nfamilies to spend their own money. So we are rocking along at the \nhighest tax rates in history, and it is peacetime.\n  So last April, a group of us said we were not going to vote for a \nbudget from this Senate, unless we put meaningful potentials for tax \nrelief in that budget. We were promised that eliminating the marriage \npenalty would be the Senate's top priority for 1998. The leadership of \nthe Senate promised us we would not only have an opportunity to try to \nreduce taxes substantially and significantly--not the $30 billion \ngesture over 5 years--incidentally, $30 billion over 5 years would buy \nabout one cup of coffee per month per person, if you left a little tip. \nThat is really not tax relief.\n  So here we are; today is July 29 and there are only 31 legislative \ndays left in the session. Yet, we are not any closer to giving the \nAmerican people tax cuts than we were 3 months ago. I have led the mini \nrevolt against the budget in order to get real potentials for tax \nrelief on the table. I believe it is time for us to say we need real \ntax relief, and the marriage penalty would be the brightest and best \nopportunity to provide tax relief that not only reduces\n\n[[Page S9167]]\n\ntaxes, but it would begin to align the policy of the United States with \nthe principles of the American people. Of course, that embracing \nprinciple that everybody understands is the need for strong families.\n  Now, to add insult to injury--I don't know whether it is an insult or \nnot--but the Congressional Budget Office came out with new numbers on \nthe projected Government surplus. Here the Senate had agreed that we \nwould do $30 billion, maybe, in tax cuts. The Congressional Budget \nOffice just announced in the last 10 days that the projected surplus is \nover $520 billion. Wait a second--$30 billion to let the people have, \nwhich they earned, and we were going to take the other $490 billion and \nspend it, in spite of the fact that we were already taxing people at \nthe highest rates in history. I wonder about that.\n  So we have come forward today. I thank Senator Brownback and Senator \nHutchison for sponsoring this kind of legislation. I am honored to be a \nperson who is helping organize this approach to say we need substantial \nand significant tax relief. We are not asking that we take the entire \n$520 billion. We are not even asking that we take a majority. But we \nare asking that at least the onerous affront to the values of the \nAmerican people, this attack on marriages, be taken from our Tax Code.\n  It would cost about $151.3 billion, I think, to do this over 5 years. \nSo, if you subtract that from the $520 billion, you could figure out \nthat you still have about $360 billion over the next 5 years. That is \nan amazing sum.\n  We are not even asking for 1 out of 3 dollars, or what would be \nequivalent to 1 out of 3 dollars, of the surplus to say leave it in the \npockets of people who work hard to earn it. Don't sweep that money away \nto be spent by the bureaucracy. And, for heaven's sake, let's not send \na signal to people, don't get married in this culture, don't begin to \nform the basis for this most important institution of America. We need \nto say, indeed, we want marriages; we want intact families; we want the \nlasting, durable--yes, legally recognized--formal commitments of \nmarriage upon which to build our family.\n  We stand here at the end of July on the heels of a month-long recess \ncoming up in August. And there is a real possibility that Congress will \nnot pass a budget reconciliation and will not deliver on the tax cut \nthat was promised to the American people. We ought to shout at the top \nof our lungs, ``No, no.'' We do not want to miss this opportunity, with \nthis substantial capacity in our system, to begin to grant relief to \nthe people, especially to have a cease-fire on American marriages. It \nis time for us to declare peace instead of declaring war on the \nprinciples of the American people when it comes to tax policy. We need \na tax policy that represents the people's principles. Let's declare \npeace in terms of our policy on marriage.\n  Mr. President, our society has affirmed the importance of marriage \nand family for a long time. Most Americans would agree that persistent, \ndurable marriages and strong families are absolutely necessary if we \nare to succeed as a nation in the 21st century. Yet, for 30 years--\nnearly 30 years--in the last three decades politicians have idly \nwatched as the Federal Income Tax Code has systematically penalized \nmillions of people for having been married. In fact, this last year, 42 \nmillion married taxpayers collectively paid $29 billion--that is with a \n``b,'' not with an ``m''--$29 billion more in taxes than they would \nhave paid had they been single.\n  I find it important for me to once in a while review what $1 billion \nmeans.\n  We all know that $1 million is a lot of money. One billion dollars is \n1,000 million dollars. So we have 29,000 billion dollars in tax penalty \nbecause people are married. When you boil that down to what it means to \nthe average marriage penalty for a family what this tax anomaly, this \ntax assault, is, it turns out that is about $1,400 per family. I have \nto say that is about $1,400 of after-tax income. If you relieve them of \nthat, that is actually spendable money. In order to have a spendable \nresult of about $1,400 of more money for a family to spend, I think you \nhave to allow in terms of a salary of about $2,000. So this would give \nthose families about a $2,000 increase in their wages, or about $1,400 \nin spendable income.\n  Or, another way, that is well over $100 a month that families could \neither add to their payments for better housing, they could add to \ntheir budget for better nutrition, they could add to their clothing \nbudget so that their children could be better clothed and that they \ncould be better clothed. This is $1,400 they could use to promote \nthings that are beneficial to the community.\n  Yet here we have this marriage penalty that sweeps that $1,400 right \noff the kitchen table at budget time merely because these individuals \nare married.\n  I believe this marriage penalty is a grossly unfair assault on the \nbedrock of our culture and civilization. As a matter of fairness, \nprinciple, and public policy, Congress should put an end to the Tax \nCode discrimination against marriage. The marriage penalty exists today \nbecause Congress legislated ill-advised changes to the Tax Code in the \nlate 1960s. Fortunately, eliminating the marriage penalty simply \nrequires Congress to amend the code.\n  I want to just mention that the marriage penalty tax has a pretty \nsubstantial negative impact on women. It hurts marriages when their \nincome is equivalent to their husband's income. When their income is \nequivalent, it hurts them most of all. We enact policies to help women \nin the workplace, yet we have a Tax Code which penalizes those women \nonce they earn income that is comparable to that of their spouse. There \nis significant evidence that such tax consequences have a direct impact \non women's labor participation choices. People make judgments based on \nthese taxes.\n  We have already heard from our good friend, the Senator from Kansas. \nAs a matter of fact, he stated that single people are living together \nin a way that many of them feel bad--disappointed their families, set \nbad examples for the communities--and they didn't want to do this.\n  The amendment which Senator Brownback, Senator Grams, and Senator \nInhofe, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and Senator Hutchison have \nproposed would eliminate the marriage penalty. And, of course, I am \nproposing it with them by allowing husbands and wives to split incomes \nas equivalent and filing as if both were single.\n  Over the next 5 years, the Federal Government is expected to collect \n$9.6 trillion in revenues. Eliminating the marriage penalty will reduce \nthat total by 1.6 percent, and that is less than a third of the \nprojected surplus. That is, the surplus is expected to be $520 billion. \nThat is money in excess of what we expect to spend. If we continue to \nmake plans to spend it, we ought to make plans to give it back at least \nto curtail the marriage penalty.\n  There is no excuse for withholding tax relief from American families, \nespecially tax relief that is necessary to allow them to continue to be \nAmerican families. We have no reason to continue to punish Americans \nwith a Tax Code that is designed to make it tough for them to be \nfamily. For years Washington has told taxpayers, ``You send it, we \nspend it.'' We ought to change that. It is time for a new message to be \nsent to America. It should be, ``You earned it, we returned it.''\n  I rise today to say that I find it unconscionable that the policy of \nthe United States would be an assault on the principles of the American \npeople, especially a sacred principle of American families that are \nbuilt on the core institution of marriage, and that this Government, \nfrankly, should hang its head in shame to think that it has agreed to \nspend the money of individuals and that it would not provide relief \nfrom this war on the principles of America called the ``marriage \npenalty.''\n  In my judgment, we have but one alternative, especially in the face \nof the kind of projected surplus which we have before us. That \nopportunity is to say that we are going to declare peace when it comes \nto the American family, and we are going to tell people that, ``We will \nnot penalize you any longer because you have chosen to be married; as a \nmatter of fact, we are going to provide a way for you to enjoy the same \nkind of treatment under the Tax Code that you would have if you were to \nhave remained single.''\n  The end of the 105th Congress is coming quickly upon us. I call upon \nmy\n\n[[Page S9168]]\n\ncolleagues to join me for the elimination of the marriage penalty once \nand for all.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFaircloth be added as a cosponsor to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to give a couple of facts and \nsome figures that I think are important to have.\n  The average marriage penalty in this country for people who are \npaying the marriage penalty is just over $1,400 a year; $1,425 a year \nis the average amount that families are paying for the marriage penalty \nin America. I think that is just far too high.\n  It may not seem like a lot to some people. But in paying electric \nbills, you could pay an average one for over 9 months. For some \nfamilies, it would pay for a week-long vacation at Disneyland. It would \nmake four payments on a minivan. You can go out to dinner, buy over \n1,000 gallons of gasoline, you can buy over 1,200 loaves of bread. \nThose are important things to do with $1,425.\n  I want to show this chart to my colleagues as well. There are some \nwho suggested last time when we entered into this debate that there is \nalso a marriage bonus, and that if you will do away with the marriage \nbonus, we will do away with the marriage penalty. I have no problem \nwhatsoever giving a bonus to people who are married. I think that we \nshould honor this institution, and if they want to propose raising \ntaxes on people who are married, they can go ahead and do so. I oppose \nthat.\n  But I want to show who it hits. Again, you are talking about the \nhighest proportion of the marriage penalty going to those families when \nthe higher-earning spouse is making somewhere between $20,000 and \n$75,000. These are middle-income, a lot of times just starting to be \nwage-earner families, and it hits two-wage-earner families as \nwell. These are the people that we should be trying to help out the \nabsolute most. I just find it a completely wrongheaded policy, at a \ntime when we are struggling so much in this country with the set of \nvalues we are putting forward, to say we are not only going to not help \npeople making between $20,000 and $75,000, or are just starting a \nfamily, we are actually going to tax them, we are going to tax them \nmore.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It occurs to me you said this has its most substantial \nincidence in young families where people are getting started, both \nindividuals working.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator aware that when they interview people \nabout family problems, and when families break up, that there is a high \nincidence of correlation between families that are overstressed \neconomically and those that do not make it to last as families?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Missouri for the question. \nAbsolutely. You hear that in any number of cases where people are \nbreaking up, frequently the No. 1 cited problem is financial stress. \nBut it then embellishes and builds into further stresses on them.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So if the average marriage penalty is $1,445 a year, \nyou wonder about how many marriages might actually survive if the \nGovernment were not in there with its bureaucratic hand, extracting an \nextra $1,445 a year. You wonder in how many marriages the stress would \nbe relieved enough that some of that financial friction that eventually \nsometimes flares into the flame which consumes the marriage, and burns \ndown the house, could just be avoided.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Senator raises a good consideration. We don't know \nthe number of marriages that would be saved. But we do know that a lot \nof times people know this tax is on them. I think too many times my \ncolleagues think people don't really know this tax exists on them, and \nthat it exists there, but it is not a real tax, it is not one that \nanybody cites to. But we found, time and time again, people act \nrationally. They act economically rationally. So if you send a signal \nthat you are going to tax something, they will do less of it. And if \nyou send a signal you are going to subsidize something, they do more of \nit. So we tax marriage, and what do you think happens in that type of \nsituation where you put more financial pressure on the family? The \n$1,445 is the average. There are some that are taxed substantially \nmore.\n  I read to my colleagues, and the Senator from Missouri, letters from \na number of people who have written in and said, ``I cannot believe you \nguys would talk about family values, all of you, everybody saying that \nfamilies are critical, families are important, yet here is such a \nclassic example of where you are penalizing the family, and it still \nexists, and you guys are still talking about family values.''\n  One thing I am very pleased about is the majority leader, Trent Lott, \nhas been a strong proponent of doing away with this marriage penalty \nbecause he knows the importance of what this is about. He knows people \nact economically rationally and is supportive of this debate and is \nsupportive of our efforts to try to get the marriage penalty done away \nwith. I think it is important, and he has cited to it as well. This is \nnot for high-wage-earning families, I point out to my colleagues as \nwell. We are talking about hitting families the most where the highest \nearning spouse earns somewhere between $20,000 and $75,000. That is \nimportant.\n  Just because some of these testimonials are so touching, I want to \nread some more of them to my colleagues, because I think they are very, \nvery telling. This is not just about statistics. This is not just about \neconomists saying this has an impact. This is about real people looking \nat their real situation of real taxes they are paying. Listen to this \none--Steve from Tennessee:\n\n       My wife and I got married on January 1, 1997. We were going \n     to have a Christmas wedding last year, but after talking to \n     my accountant, we saw that instead of both of us getting \n     money back on our taxes, we were going to have to pay in, so \n     we postponed it. Now, after getting married, we have to have \n     more taken out of our checks just to break even and not get a \n     refund. We got penalized for getting married.\n\n  And then he says something that I think is prophetic and simple and \nstraightforward. He just says, ``. . . and that is just not right.''\n  That is our point with this tax. We have the wherewithal to pay for \nit in the surplus. We will not touch Social Security surpluses coming \ninto it. And this tax ``is just not right.''\n  Here is one from Dayton, OH:\n\n       Penalizing for marriage flies in the face of common sense. \n     This is a classic example of government policy not supporting \n     that which it wishes to promote. In our particular situation, \n     [he gives us his own situation] my girlfriend and I would \n     incur a net annual penalty of $2,000, or approximately $167 \n     per month. Though not huge, this is enough to pay our monthly \n     phone, cable, water and home insurance bills.\n\n  We may sit here and look at this and say $2,000 a year, $167 a month, \nthat is not a big deal--it is a big deal. It is a big signal we are \nsending to families that we are going to tax you and penalize you if \nyou decide to get married. People act economically rational. They are \ngoing to look at this and they will understand it. They will also act \neconomically rational if we say we are doing away with this marriage \npenalty. We think this is a bad tax, bad tax policy. It is not a place \nthat we ought to tax, and they will act rationally there as well, and \nit sends a signal to families.\n  This is one I thought was excellent, from Marietta, GA.\n\n       We always file as ``married filing separately'' because \n     that saves us about $500 a year over ``married filing \n     jointly.'' When we figured our 1996 return, just out of \n     curiosity, we figured what our tax would be if we lived \n     together instead of married. Imagine our disgust when we \n     discovered that, if we just lived together instead of being \n     married, we would have saved an additional $1,000. So much \n     for the much vaunted ``family values'' of our government. Our \n     government is sending a very bad message to young adults by \n     penalizing marriage this way.\n\n  That is from Bobby and Susan in Marietta, GA.\n  Is that the sort of signal we want to send? Listen to this one from \nOhio:\n\n       No person who legitimately supports family values could be \n     against this bill. The\n\n[[Page S9169]]\n\n     marriage penalty is but another example of how, in the past \n     40 years the federal government has enacted policies that \n     have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the \n     strength of this country from the start.\n\n  That is Thomas from Ohio that writes that in.\n  I have studies here. We have Joint Economic Committee studies of the \nimpact of a marriage penalty. We have studies from other institutions, \nciting about the marriage penalty. None of them could put it more \nsuccinctly than Thomas has right here: ``This is but another example of \na policy that has broken down the fundamental institutions that were \nthe strength of this country from the start.''\n  Let us hear the people. Let us hear their cry. Let us hear them say \nwhat they are saying to us, that this is a wrongheaded idea, what we \nare doing.\n  This one, David from Indiana:\n\n       This is one of the most unfair laws that is on the books. I \n     have been married for more than 23 years and would really \n     like to see this injustice changed [And then he says, not for \n     himself, but, he says] so my sons will not have to face this \n     additional tax. Please keep up the great work. We need more \n     people in office who are interested in families.\n\n  Then this one from North Carolina:\n\n       It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy \n     against the noble and sacred institution of marriage.\n\n  Here is somebody, Andrew from North Carolina, who is looking at his \nFederal Government and he says:\n\n       It is unfortunate the government makes a policy against the \n     noble and sacred institution of marriage. I also feel it is \n     unfortunate it seems to hit young, struggling couples the \n     hardest.\n\n  Let us hear the people. Let us hear their sense of what they are \nsaying about this particular situation, about this particular tax that \nis in place.\n  This gentleman, Michael from California:\n\n       I believe a majority of families do not realize the \n     government is stealing from them because of this marriage \n     penalty and indirectly has created this pressure to have both \n     parents work to get by and pay for their family's future. \n     This indirectly is driving a wedge between families.\n\n  Michael in California.\n  I disagree with the first portion of it, where I think the families \ndo know about this, but in the last portion of it he is saying, ``This \nindirectly is driving a wedge between families.''\n  I think anybody here on this floor, if you ask people about this \nparticular bill, ``Do we want to drive a wedge between families?'' \nThere would be 100 Senators here saying ``No, we don't want to drive a \nwedge between families.''\n  That being the case, then why aren't we doing something at this point \nin time when we have a chance to deal with this particular issue?\n  Mr. President, I want to cite some of the studies in case people \nthink we are just citing the people calling in who want a tax cut.\n  I have a Joint Economic Committee study, ``Reducing Marriage Taxes, \nIssues and Proposals,'' that talks about the various bills that are put \nforward within the marriage penalty. What we are talking about is \nputting in income-splitting proposals. They are similar.\n  This is the study on page 10, ``. . .to optional filing because they \nadjust for differences in the tax schedules between single and joint \nfilers.'' This is the Joint Economic Committee report.\n\n       However, the proposals differ from optional filing because \n     they make no distinction regarding the division of income \n     between spouses. In other words, couples are treated as if \n     each spouse earns half of their total income regardless of \n     which spouse actually generates that income. Income splitting \n     would, therefore, provide all couples with the most favorable \n     tax treatment by effectively treating them like two singles \n     with a 50-50 income split. This favorable treatment would \n     reduce taxes for nearly all married couples. Couples with \n     equal incomes would receive equal tax cuts, thus maintaining \n     horizontal equity.\n       Moreover, income splitting would create marriage bonuses \n     for most couples and increase bonuses for couples already \n     receiving them, including one-earner couples. Thus, the \n     proposals reduce marriage neutrality by [they are saying] \n     heavily favoring marriage.\n\n  This is in the study they are putting forward. They are saying, ``OK, \nwe are going to create a positive situation for some and we are going \nto do away with disparity for others.''\n  I say, Mr. President, this is a good thing. This is the sort of thing \nthat we ought to do in doing away with this marriage penalty, and this \nis according to the Joint Economic Committee study that we have.\n  I showed you the chart earlier about the differences between marriage \npenalty and bonuses. What we are trying to get at is this zone of \npeople making between $20,000 and $75,000 and just do away with the \nmarriage penalty. That is a good thing, and that is the signal we ought \nto send.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be happy to. But first I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Abraham from Michigan be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I wonder if the Senator from Kansas is aware of the \nfact that among people who are concerned about the culture, they have \nnot only been concerned about families that are dissolved, and the \ndivorce problem that we have, but the absence of family formation, the \nfact that there are lower rates of marriage than people had \nanticipated, than we have had in the past. I wonder, if given that \nsituation, which individuals who have studied our culture are concerned \nabout, I wonder if the Senator from Kansas might comment on whether or \nnot the fact that we have a penalty on a number of people taxwise if \nthey enter a marriage, if that might affect this challenge to our \nculture where we have had lower rates of individuals getting married?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate the question, and I think it is \nabsolutely right on target that we are having a reduction in family \ncreation. If you ask people in this body is that a good thing to have \ntaking place, they would say no. We need to have more families, not \nless families, and part of the problem with government is we have had \nto create more and more government doing more and more things because \nwe have fewer and fewer families proportionally doing less and less \nthings.\n  If there is anything that we have been about, it is trying to \nreinstill a sense of family and values and virtues in this culture, and \neverybody agrees with that. Here you have a direct policy that is \nhurting creation of families, hurting creation of that foundational \nunit within a society and culture, that if it is weakened, the \nGovernment is weakened; if it is stronger, the Government is going to \nbe stronger, too, because you have that foundational unit.\n  You can't create enough police forces or militaries or welfare \ninstitutions to take the place of the family. We have had a decline \npercentagewise in the creation of cohesive family units. This policy \ncontributes to that of having a marriage penalty. The removal of that \npolicy would help in the other direction of creating a family unit \ntogether.\n  I might note to the Senator from Missouri and to my colleagues, when \nwe were looking at the welfare reform debate, we were very concerned \nabout what has happened to our families and saying, ``Are we sending \nthe right signals or wrong signals to family creation?'' We decided we \nwere sending the wrong signals and we needed to change them to the \nright signals.\n  Do you know what is taking place? In my State of Kansas, we have a \nreduction in welfare rolls of 50 percent. I have met with a number of \npeople who are off welfare now who were on welfare. I asked them, \n``What do you think of the changes we did?'' And they said, ``Thank \ngoodness you did it. Welfare, to me, was like a drug. I got hooked on \nit. I got addicted to it, and you said, `If you can work, you have to \nwork, and we are going to let the States decide if we are going to \nsubsidize additional children born out of wedlock.' ''\n  They were thanking me for forcing them to do something that they \nneeded to do. That was a policy signal that we sent from the \nGovernment. For many years we said if you don't want to work, you don't \nhave to work; if you can work and you don't want to work, you still \ndon't have to work; if you want to have more children out of wedlock, \nfine, we will pay you for doing that.\n  We said, ``No, no, no, if you can work, you need to work.'' Here \nlet's support marriage.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It occurs to me what you are saying, because families\n\n[[Page S9170]]\n\nhave begun to replace welfare in a number of settings, they have done a \nbetter job and people are becoming independent; that the number of \npeople on welfare is going down, and when the number of people on \nwelfare goes down, the cost to government goes down.\n  It seems to me that as these costs go down, when families begin to do \ntheir jobs and do them well, we ought to share some of the reduced \ncosts of government with families by reducing the cost of families so \nthat we can actually--and I wonder, if you will agree that since \nfamilies are helping us reduce the cost of government by reducing the \ncost of welfare, if you agree that it might be appropriate for us, \ngiven the fact that families are helping us in this respect, to say to \nfamilies, ``and thank you very much, and we would like to reduce your \ncosts now that you are helping us reduce ours.''\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you for the question. My guess is--and we ought \nto probably have an economic study done on this--that for every dollar \nwe help out the families, we probably get $10 in reduction of costs to \nthe government. I don't have that based upon studies, but I do have \nthat based upon personal experience of families reaching out and how \nmuch more effective they are with heart and soul and arms that can hug \nand love instead of a cold government check that really doesn't do \nanything other than make people hooked to it. We need to support, and \nwe need to encourage that.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to have additional people wanting to \nbe added as cosponsors. Senator Lott has asked to be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. Mr. President, these are \ncommonsense issues. They are commonsense results of what we need to \nhave. If we support marriage, if we support the family, we will have \nless cost to government. This is a good thing. This is something we \nought to support. It is something we ought to readily do. It is \nsomething that should pass with 100 votes.\n  We will shortly have a chance to vote on this particular issue. \nWhether we get a vote directly on it or we vote on a motion to table, I \nam asking my colleagues to support us in this effort to do away with \nthe marriage penalty when this comes up. It is not taking the entire \nsurplus of the $520 billion that the CBO is now projecting. It would \nactually score CBO $151.3 billion. I support walling off Social \nSecurity for flow of payments for Social Security. This is a statement \nof marriage to families. We don't have to pay a Social Security against \nmarriage. We don't have to do this.\n  I support what the President has been saying, ``Let's keep Social \nSecurity to Social Security. Let's create a real trust fund.'' We have \nreal problems there. We also have real problems in marriage. We also \nhave real problems with families in this country. We can do this.\n  Mr. President, $1.50 of every $5 coming in on the surplus would \naddress this marriage penalty that is a horrific signal we are sending \nout to the country right now, that we would actually tax marriage more.\n  Perhaps this is getting somewhat long with people when they keep \nhearing from folks. These are the commonsense responses from people \nacross country.\n  A gentleman in Texas:\n\n       If we are really interested in putting children first, then \n     why would this country penalize the very situation--\n     marriage--where kids do best? When parents are truly \n     committed to each other through their marriage vows their \n     children's outcomes are enhanced.\n\n  And that is Gary from Houston, TX.\n  This one I could not believe. This lady is from Virginia.\n\n       I am a 61-year-old grandmother still holding down a full-\n     time job, and I remarried 3 years ago.\n\n  A 61-year-old grandmother, full-time job, remarried 3 years ago.\n\n       I had to think long and hard about marriage over staying \n     single as I knew it would cost us several thousand dollars a \n     year just to sign the marriage license. Marriage has become a \n     contract between two individuals and the Federal Government.\n\n  This one is from Pennsylvania:\n\n       My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of \n     obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or \n     believes in, especially myself.\n\n  He said he was the product of a marriage that has difficulty, but \nthey were considering divorce. He says ``simply because my family \ncannot afford to pay the price.''\n  This is Jeffrey from Pennsylvania who says that.\n  This gentleman from Illinois says:\n\n       You try and be honest and do things straight, and you get \n     penalized for it. That's just not right.\n\n  That is Mike from Illinois who sent that letter in.\n  Person after person coming in and writing in saying that, ``Look, \nthis just isn't right.''\n  This one from Sarah that was published in the Ottawa Daily Times:\n\n       The marriage penalty is essentially a tax on working wives \n     because the joint filing system compels married couples to \n     identify a primary earner and a secondary earner, and usually \n     the wife falls into the latter category. Therefore, from \n     accountants' point of view, the wife's first dollar of income \n     is taxed at the point where her husband's income has left \n     her. If the husband is making substantially more money than \n     the wife, the couple may even conclude it is not worth it for \n     the wife to earn income. In fact--\n\n  And she is quoting from a book by a Professor McCaffrey at the \nUniversity of Southern California.\n\n       In fact, McCaffrey's book details the plight of one woman \n     who realizes her job was actually losing money for her \n     family--\n\n  Actually losing money for her family.\n\n     by her working.\n\n  We are overtaxing the American public now anyway, with people having \nto pay roughly about 40 percent of their income in taxes, taxes at all \nlevels--Federal, State, and local, with Federal being the highest \nportion. I think that ought to be lowered. But, clearly, you hear there \nare cases where they are not only being taxed but we are forcing people \nwith two-wage-earner families to work and one just working for the \nGovernment, but even in that case you are even taxing them more, to the \npoint where it isn't even worth working.\n  Mr. President, this amendment needs to pass. We need to have this \ndebate. We can afford to do this. We can do this and still set Social \nSecurity, payroll taxes, aside; and I am calling on my colleagues to do \njust that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that Heather Oellermann be \ngiven floor privileges during the duration of this debate. She serves \nin my office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask that my name be added as a \ncosponsor to the Ashcroft-Brownback amendment to S. 2312.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise to speak further in support of the elimination \nof the marriage penalty. Some people have asked, ``Well, isn't there \nalso a marriage bonus, or isn't there a situation in which people might \ndo better because they are married than if they're not married?'' And \nthere are areas of the Tax Code where some individuals do slightly \nbetter, but they are supported by very sound logic. I would like to \ntalk for a few moments about them, those instances.\n  I indicate that in no way do I think that the existence of this so-\ncalled ``marriage bonus'' in some places in the Tax Code--that that \nbonus really is any reason why we should impose a penalty in some other \narea of the Tax Code. As a matter of fact, there are sound reasons for \nus to support the concept of the marriage bonus where it exists.\n\n[[Page S9171]]\n\n  Currently, the standard deduction for a single person is $4,150, \nwhile the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is \nonly $6,900. I did not major in mathematics, but I did one time have \nthe privilege of serving as the State auditor. I can add $4,150 twice; \nthat would be $8,300. And when you put the $8,300 that you would get \nfor two single people together, and you look at the $6,900 deduction \nthat you get for a married couple filing jointly, you clearly \nunderstand there is a $1,400 deduction that simply does not exist.\n  The marriage penalty elimination amendment that Senator Brownback and \nI, and others, including the majority leader, have offered today will \nincrease the standard deduction for a married couple to equal twice \nwhat it is for singles--that would be the $8,300 figure.\n  Now the Government rationale for the difference in deduction for \nsingles and married couples is to reduce the so-called marriage bonus \nthat occurs when only one spouse works. So the idea is, why should a \nspouse get a full deduction if the spouse isn't actually in the \nworkforce? I think that sort of partakes of a myth that we ought to \ndisabuse ourselves of and that I think most people understand. The \nsuggestion that if someone works outside the home they are working, but \nif someone isn't working outside the home they are not working--I don't \nthink that is really the case.\n  I think what we really indicate is not so much a bonus if we give a \ndeduction for the person who is nonworking outside the home but stays \nhome, it is a recognition of the substantial contribution that the \nnonemployed spouse makes to the family.\n  We have had a pretty substantial experience with marriage in my \nhousehold. There are three decades plus that my wife and I have been \nmarried. There have been times when both of us have been employed, \ntimes when only my wife was employed, times when only I was employed. I \nthink in every one of those instances to ignore the sort of \ncontribution that the nonemployed spouse makes to the work product, \neven of the employed spouse and of the household, would be a tremendous \ninjustice.\n  I think what we really have, instead of the so-called marriage bonus, \nis just a recognition of the fact that the nonemployed, in-a-formal-\nsense, spouse is contributing to the income that comes to that \nhousehold by virtue of the capacity that is expanded to the other \nspouse who is employed and by virtue of the expanded well-being of the \nfamily. American families need help from the ever-increasing tax load \nwhich we are imposing on them. Men who stay at home or women who stay \nat home to care for the children should not be penalized by the Tax \nCode.\n  I have been somewhat distressed in recent years that we have begun to \nextend this myth and to provide incentives for people not to stay at \nhome, to have a prejudice against people who would stay at home. Our \nGovernment policy should work in favor of children, not against them. \nSometimes when we have a massive tax prejudice in favor of both parents \nleaving the house, that is not in the best interests of children. I \nthink most of the data we have seen in recent years is that children \nreally thrive when they have the attention of parents, and, obviously, \nif you have one of the parents who can stay at home, it really helps \nchildren significantly.\n  Our current Tax Code rewards the dependent child tax credit for \nfamilies who put their children in child care, for example, and, \ntherefore, provides an incentive for people to institutionalize their \nchildren rather than to care for them in the home. A mother who stays \nat home with her child makes the sacrifice in the total combined \npaycheck for the family and for her career, perhaps, or the father who \ndoes the same, should that family be penalized? I think the answer is \nclearly no. As a matter of fact, that person may be doing our culture a \ngreat favor by providing attention from a loving, compassionate parent \nin a way that no institution would be able to provide attention or \ntraining for that child.\n  The Tax Code should acknowledge that contributions made by spouses \nwho stay at home, be they male or female--and we have done it both ways \nin my household from time to time; there have been times when my wife \nwas the earner and I was either doing something at home or running for \noffice or the like--and either way, we should acknowledge that the \ncontributions by the so-called nonemployed spouse are not ignored, and \nno marriage bonus could ever begin to compensate those individuals for \ntheir contributions to the family.\n  Now, if Members on the other side of the aisle want to eliminate the \nsmall ``bonus'' in the Tax Code, I think that would be ill advised. I \npredict it would be soundly defeated, as it should be. It is \nantifamily, it is antimarriage, and given the fact that most of these \nare women in this setting, it is antiwomen to suggest a full-time \nhomemaker provides no value that should be recognized in the Tax Code. \nI believe their contribution should continue to be recognized and \napplauded. The marriage bonus is a way to recognize some of the non-\neconomic contributions of stay-at-home spouses.\n  What we are really here for, I don't think there is a serious legal \nattempt to take away those recognitions, but there is a very serious \nassault on the values of American families. When we are taxing the \naverage family that endures the marriage penalty, we are taxing them \n$1,400 a year more in taxes than we would if they were single. It seems \nto me that assault on the values of the American public is a tragic, \ntragic invasion of the strongest institution which we need desperately \nfor the success and survival of our country. We should recognize that \nwe need to eliminate that penalty on marriage.\n  It is with that in mind that I am pleased so many Senators have \nagreed to cosponsor this measure. I hope we will vote to make sure that \nthis becomes a part of the philosophy and policy of American \nGovernment. A government which is at war with the values of its people \ncannot long endure. No value is more cherished in America than the \nvalue of durable families. We simply have to eliminate the assault on \nmarriage, the assault on our families, that is included in a Tax Code \nwhich undermines and curtails the value of families in our culture.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the efforts that have \nbeen brought to the floor by the Senator from Kansas. I would like to \nmake a few comments and observations about tax cuts and some \nmisconceptions. I was somewhat distressed at the beginning of this \nadministration when a statement was made by Laura Tyson, who was the \nchief financial advisor at that time. She said--and this is almost a \ndirect quote--that there is no relationship between the level of \ntaxation that a country pays and its economic activity. If you would \ncarry that to its logical conclusion, you would say you could tax \nsomebody by 100 percent and they are going to be just as motivated to \nwork hard and to contribute to the economy and take risks and to hire \npeople as if they had no tax at all. As we know, history has shown us \nthat this is not true.\n  One of the interesting things that is so overlooked by many of the \nliberals nowadays is that for every 1 percent increase in economic \nactivity, it produces new income of approximately $24 billion. Three \ntimes in this century we have had administrations that have had massive \ntax cuts, and each time this has happened we have actually increased \nthe revenue. What I am hoping we will get to is a discussion and a \ndebate along the lines that you can actually increase revenue by \nreducing taxes. History has shown us that, in fact, this is true. The \nfirst time this happened was in the 1920s, during the Warren Harding \nand Calvin Coolidge administrations. They had consecutive tax cuts, \nreducing the top tax rate from 73 percent to 25 percent. The lower \nrates of taxation helped expand the economy dramatically. In fact, \nbetween 1921 and 1929, in spite of--or maybe because of--dramatic \nreductions in personal income tax rates, revenues increased from $719 \nmillion in 1921 to $1.16 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 60 \npercent. Now, over a 10-year period, that would have been about a \ndoubling of the tax revenues that came as a result of reducing tax \nrates.\n\n[[Page S9172]]\n\n  Then in the 1960s, along came the Kennedy administration. Of course, \nwhen you hear some of the things that President Kennedy said at the \ntime that didn't sound that prophetic, they turned out to be true. At \nthat time, he said we needed to have more revenues and the best way is \nto reduce our tax rates and expand the economy. Again, going back to \nthe assumption that has been proven over and over again that your tax \nrevenues increase with certain types of marginal tax rate reductions, \nin the 1960s, President Kennedy initiated a series of tax cuts where he \ntook the top income tax rate and reduced it from 91 percent to 70 \npercent. These cuts, in part, helped increase the growth by some 42 \npercent between 1961 and 1968. So again, you have a very similar type \nof growth that we experienced back in the 1920s.\n  Then in 1980, we remember so well Ronald Reagan coming along and the \ncriticisms that he has had. At that time, he was working with a \nCongress that was not that friendly--at least a House that wasn't that \nfriendly. He was able to probably make the most dramatic reductions in \nthe tax rates than at any period during any administration in this \ncountry's history, knocking the top tax rates from 70 percent in 1980 \ndown to 28 percent by 1988.\n  The results of this were very interesting in that if you look at \ntotal revenues raised to run this country in 1980, it was $517 billion. \nBy 1990, that figure was increased to $1.3 trillion. So revenues \ndoubled during that period of time that he reduced the tax rates. As \nfar as the revenues that were generated from the marginal rates, or \nfrom income tax, that went from $244 billion in 1980 to $466 billion in \n1990. So you have almost a doubling in that case, also.\n  So I think those people who are saying that we don't want to reduce \ntaxes are saying we don't want to reduce the revenues. We have need for \nmore revenues when, in fact, some of the tax reductions that we will be \ntalking about could have the opposite effect. I can remember in Ronald \nReagan's speech--one of the speeches he made called ``A Rendezvous With \nDestiny'' in the sixties, it was prophetic. He said, ``There is nothing \ncloser to immortality on the face of this Earth than a Government \nagency once formed.'' I think this is one of the problems we are \ndealing with now, in that it is so difficult to cut down the size of \nGovernment.\n  Sometimes it is necessary to reduce taxes in order to overcome that \ntemptation to spend the money that is out there. We know the political \nreality of that. By the way, when many of the Democrats--liberals--were \nsaying, ``Look at how the deficits increased during the Reagan \nadministration,'' yes, that is true, they did, but that was not as a \nresult of reducing taxes; that was a result of increased spending. I \nthink that, in retrospect, the President should have adopted a policy \nof issuing more vetoes, and I don't think we would have had the \ndeficits that we had.\n  The bottom line is that we are not an undertaxed Nation. We are a \nNation that needs to reduce taxes. This is an opportunity to do it. I \ncan't imagine that in this day and age when we have the projected, huge \nsurpluses that are out there, we would consider anything less than \nmaking major tax reductions. The tax reduction that has been promoted \non the floor by the various speakers regarding the marriage penalty is \ncertainly one that is justified. I would like to see, in addition, some \nmarginal rate reductions. I hope we will be able to do that before this \ndebate is all over.\n  Lastly, we have come so dangerously close to what has been stated in \nhistory. People have observed this country. When Alexis de Tocqueville \ncame here, he came to study the penal system and to write about that. \nAfter he saw the great wealth in this Nation and the freedoms, he wrote \na book about the wealth. In the last paragraph, he said that once the \npeople of this country find that they can vote themselves money out of \nthe public trust, the system will fail. I think we have come \ndangerously close to that. This is the time to reduce taxes and allow \nindividuals to have more control of the money they earn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Ashcroft \namendment on marriage penalty tax relief. Let me quickly point out that \nI strongly support the Senator from Kansas' intentions and believe that \nmost, if not all, of my Senate colleagues do as well. Americans should \nbe free to marry or remain single based on much more important \nconsiderations than those related to tax liability.\n  That said, the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill is not \nthe proper context for the marriage penalty debate. Now is simply not \nthe right time or place. The Senate voted in favor of marriage tax \nrelief during debate on the tobacco bill. And we all look forward to \nresuming this debate if and when we are able to take up, and it's my \nhope that we do take up, a comprehensive tax relief measure later this \nyear. The marriage tax relief issue should be debated at that time, in \nthe context of our overall budget priorities. Simply put, we've come \ntoo far in our efforts to enforce fiscal discipline to change course \nnow and arbitrarily adopt major and expensive tax policy mesaures on \nappropriations bills.\n  I will oppose the Aschcroft amendment and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to state my views on the elimination \nof the marriage penalty.\n  Before 1969, the federal income tax treated married couples like \npartnerships, in which husbands and wives shared their incomes equally. \nThis practice was called income-splitting. It was ended in 1969, \ncreating what is commonly known as the marriage penalty--the extra \ntaxes couples have to pay because they are married rather than single. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, about 21 million couples \nnow pay these penalties, which average about $1,400 per couple.\n  This unfair treatment of married couples is fundamentally wrong. The \ntax code ought to treat married couples no worse than it treats single \npeople. It ought to recognize that marriages are partnerships in which \nhusbands and wives share their incomes equally for the good of their \nfamilies. Until it does this, the tax code is punishing the most \nimportant institution our society has.\n  This amendment is explicitly pro-family. It is a direct way of \nletting families keep more of their hard-earned money, which can be \nused for child-care, taking care of a sick parent, education expenses \nor whatever else the family wants to do with it. It sends a message to \nthe American people that marriage should be a welcome occasion, not \njust another excuse for higher taxes.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to \neliminate the marriage penalty.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are a lot of things wrong with our \nnation's Tax Code, but two things in the code that have always struck \nme as particularly egregious are the steep taxes imposed on people when \nthey get married and when they die. Today, we will have a chance to \nvote to end the marriage penalty.\n  All of us say we are concerned that families do not have enough to \nmake ends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for child care or \ncollege, or to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a system that \novertaxes American families.\n  According to Tax Foundation estimates, the average American family \npays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes to federal, state, and \nlocal governments. To put it another way, in families where both \nparents work, one of the parents is nearly working full time just to \npay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, then, that parents do not \nhave enough to make ends meet when government is taking that much. It \nis just not right.\n  The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an \nextra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, \nand the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner \nfamilies making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight \npercent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest \npercentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 \nand $30,000 per year.\n  Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their \npockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they \nchoose to send a child outside the home--or\n\n[[Page S9173]]\n\nmake it easier for one parent to stay at home to take care of the \nchildren, if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make \nfour to five payments on their car or minivan. They could pay their \nutility bill for nine months.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that if couples need advice about their \ndecision to marry, they should be encouraged to look to their minister \nor rabbi, or their family, not their accountant or the Internal Revenue \nService. This amendment represents an effort to strengthen families and \ngive them a chance to spend their hard-earned money in the way they \nbest see fit.\n  Given that federal revenues as a share of the nation's income, as \nmeasured by Gross Domestic Product, will set a peacetime record this \nyear--a whopping 20.5 percent of GDP--and given that we are \nanticipating a budget surplus of more than $63 billion, it seems to me \nthat there is no excuse for the Senate to allow the marriage-penalty \ntax to continue any longer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in voting to end the egregious \nmarriage-penalty tax.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nBrownback-Faircloth marriage penalty relief amendment.\n  In fact this amendment is the same as the legislation I originally \noffered with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and many others to provide \nrelief from the marriage penalty tax.\n  Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues, I find very little \nopposition to the notion that couples should not be penalized with \nadditional taxes simply because they choose to marry.\n  As several members have stated, the Congressional Budget Office has \ndetermined that married couples are taxed an extra $1,400 on average \nmore than singles. This legislation would correct that problem.\n  Relief from the marriage penalty tax is an idea which enjoys broad, \nbipartisan support in the Senate. In fact, legislation which I offered \nas an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget resolution established \nmarriage penalty tax relief as among the highest priorities of the \nSenate this year. That amendment passed this body by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  Clearly, there is no objection to providing this much needed relief.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that the bill before us is not \nthe appropriate bill to serve as a vehicle for this tax relief. In \nfact, the only objections I can find to this amendment are based on \nprocedure, and not about the merits of the issue.\n  I understand the concerns raised about procedure, but I would urge my \ncolleagues to consider the injustice of this marriage penalty tax, and \njoin me and the other sponsors of this amendment to eliminate this \nunfair burden. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to table \nthe Brownback-Faircloth amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment offered by \nSenator Brownback. I appreciate the work he and others have done. I \nagree with the premise of this amendment.\n  We need to provide much needed marriage penalty relief to American \nfamilies. We all know how unfair the marriage penalty is. We have heard \nfrom our constituents. We see how it cuts into the family budget. We \nrealize that it must be changed. Our laws should not penalize married \ncouples and their families.\n  Over the years, I have been a forceful advocate for marriage penalty \nrelief. In fact, during the recent consideration of the tobacco bill, I \ncosponsored an amendment that would have provided such relief. I have \nalso stated many times that marriage penalty relief should be included \nin any package of tax cuts. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nremain committed to that position.\n  As we look to real and meaningful tax reform, we will take care of \nthe marriage penalty. This will be one of our top priorities. But \naddressing this important issue must be done at the proper time and in \nthe proper way. This is not the time, nor is this appropriations bill \nthe appropriate vehicle to proceed with this amendment. This is a tax \nissue. It does not belong on this appropriations bill. It did not come \nthrough the committee of jurisdiction. That committee is the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I know many of my colleagues agree with me when it comes to the \nmarriage penalty. They are seeking an opportunity, as I am, to address \nit and find a remedy as quickly as we can. This will be our objective \nin the future. We intend to take care of this in the right way. I ask \nour colleagues outside the committee to support it.\n  Adoption of this amendment at this time would not only disrupt the \nproper order of things and result in the loss of appropriate and \nconstructive debate within the Finance Committee, but, equally \nimportant, it would subject the entire Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill to a blue slip from the House of Representatives. Revenue measures \nmust originate in the House. If not, any Member--I emphasize ``any \nMember''--of the House can raise an objection. The result would be that \nthis appropriations bill dies. And that is not in anyone's interest.\n  While I completely agree with the objective and necessity of this \namendment, while I remain a staunch ally of those who seek to provide \nmarriage penalty relief, I cannot vote for this amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote with me. Allow the Finance Committee and \nthe Senate to address this important issue in a way that is correct and \nwill bring real and lasting tax relief to married couples and families.\n  Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Texas \nwants to address this matter.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before the Senator would make any \nmotion, I would like to be able to speak for a few minutes on the \namendment. I didn't want to be shut out.\n  If that is the Senator's intention, I would just ask if he would \nallow me at the appropriate time----\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, because I wanted to be able to speak on this matter. I have \njust come from a committee markup. But the bill that is on the floor as \nan amendment is actually a bill that Senator Faircloth and I \nintroduced.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Brownback and Senator Ashcroft and \nothers have pursued this, because I think it is at the core of what we \nshould be doing in this Congress; that is, to try to give people back \nthe money they worked so hard to earn.\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\n  It is so important that we address the issue of the couple from \nHouston whom I met recently. He is a police officer. He makes $33,500 a \nyear. She is a teacher in the Pasadena Independent School District. She \nearns $28,200 per year. They were married and immediately had to pay an \nincreased tax of over $1,000.\n  Mr. President, this is a young couple who just got married who want \nto begin to save to purchase a new home, and they are hit with a $1,000 \npenalty because they got married.\n  This is of the utmost importance. It is an issue that we must address \nthis year.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from Delaware, who is the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, has said if we have tax cuts, this will be the \nfirst priority. I know he agrees with us on the merits. He may disagree \non process or on whether we use this bill as a vehicle. That is \nunderstandable. But in the end, Mr. President, it is very important \nthat we speak for the working young people of our country to make sure \nthey get a fair shake when it comes to taxes.\n  Twenty-one million couples are paying a penalty because they are in \nthat middle-income level, and when they get married, they get assessed \nan average of $1,400 a year more. Simply because they wanted to get \nmarried and raise a family, they are penalized by the U.S. Government.\n  We must correct this inequity. That is what our bill, the Faircloth-\nHutchison bill does. That is what Senator Brownback and Senator \nAshcroft are trying to do with this amendment. We are together on this.\n  If this isn't the right process, if this isn't the right time, let's \nfind the right time. Let's commit to the right time, because we must \ncorrect this inequity. I hope the Senate will speak very firmly that \nthis is our priority.\n  I want to address one last issue, and that is Social Security.\n  Do we have to compete between tax cuts and Social Security? \nAbsolutely not. In fact, I think many of us are going to support all of \nthe surplus of the Social Security system going into saving Social \nSecurity. That is our first priority. We are going to have a budget \nsurplus that is separate and apart from the surplus in Social Security. \nWe are saying that the surplus should go to tax cuts, because those of \nus who have been around here for a few years have begun to see that if \nthere is any excess revenue in this budget, all of a sudden we get very \ncreative about how to spend taxpayer dollars. We must remember, the \nmoney does not belong to us, it belongs to the people who work so hard \nto earn it. And it must be returned to them before somebody gets very \ncreative with some new program that would take the money from the \nfamilies who earn it. That is the issue.\n  Let's set aside the surplus from Social Security. And let's start the \nprocess of saving Social Security and making it even better, which I \nthink we are going to be able to do in a bipartisan way in this Senate. \nBut let's also take the surplus from the revenue that is coming in and \ngive it back to the people who earn it--the people to whom it makes a \nbig difference. If they have that $1,400, that is six or seven car \npayments, several payments on a student loan or maybe the couple is \nsaving for their first home. We can help them with those expenses, and \nwe should.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware for allowing me to make those points.\n  I hope we will do the right thing. I hope we will make this our \nhighest priority in this Congress, along with saving Social Security. \nWe can do both.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also would like to rise and join Senators \nBrownback and Ashcroft in offering an amendment to correct the \ninjustices of the marriage penalty. I want to take a few minutes to \nspeak on behalf of that. It is vitally important, I believe, that \nCongress pass this amendment, and as quickly as possible.\n  I also would like to note that Senator Helms of North Carolina would \nlike to be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have debated this issue now for quite some time. It \nis clear to me that this is noncontroversial and should have support \nfrom all Members of this body.\n  Everyone in this debate agree that the family has been and will \ncontinue to be the bedrock of American society. We all agree strong \nfamilies make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong \nAmerica. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married \ncouples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the marriage \npenalty is unfair.\n  But still Washington refuses to get rid of this bad tax policy that \ndiscourages marriage--the most basic institution of our society.\n  As a result, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more \ntaxes simply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage.\n  A 1997 study by the Congressional Budget Office, entitled ``For \nBetter or Worse: Marriage and the Federal Income Tax,'' estimated 21 \nmillion couples, or 42 percent of couples incurred marriage penalties \nin 1996. This means 42 million individuals pay $1,400 more in taxes \nthan if they are divorced, or living together.\n  But marriage penalties can run much higher than that. Under the \ncurrent tax law, a married couple could face a Federal tax bill that is \nmore than $20,000 higher than the amount they would pay if they were \nnot married.\n  Again this is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of \nCongress when it created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by \nseparating tax schedules for married and unmarried people.\n  The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both \nworking. It discriminates against low-income families and is biased \nagainst working women.\n  The trends show that more couples under age 55 are working, and the \nearnings between husbands and wives are more evenly divided since 1969. \nAs a result, more and more couples have received, and will continue to \nreceive, marriage penalties and while fewer couples receive bonuses.\n  The marriage penalty creates a second-earner bias against married \nwomen under the federal tax system. The bias occurs because the income \nof the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary earner's \nincome.\n  As a result, the secondary earner's income may be taxed at a \nrelatively higher marginal tax rate. Married women are often the \nvictims of the second earner bias.\n  During the 1970's and 1980's, as more and more women went to work, \ntheir added incomes drove their households into higher tax brackets. \nToday, women who return to the work force after raising their kids face \na tax rate as high as 50 percent.\n  The CBO study also found ``small but statistically significant \neffects of marriage penalties in reducing the likelihood of marriage \nfor women.''\n  Mr. President, what this finding means is that the marriage penalty \ntax has discouraged women from marriage.\n  This is shameful. This is a direct insult to our most basic and most \nstable institutions. We must put an end to it.\n  American families today are taxed at the highest levels since World \nWar II, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family's budget going to \npay taxes on the Federal, State, and local level. They deserve a tax \nbreak. Last year's tax relief was too little and too late. More \nmeaningful tax relief must be provided.\n  In the next 5 years, the Federal Government will take $9.6 trillion \nfrom the pockets of working Americans. The revenue windfall will \ngenerate a huge budget surplus. This surplus comes directly from taxes \npaid by the American people. It is only fair to return it to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American Families to keep \n$1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for health insurance, \ngroceries, child care, or other family necessities.\n  Mr. President, some argue that repealing the marriage penalty will \nonly benefit the affluent. This is completely false. The fact is, the \nelimination of the injustice of the marriage penalty will primarily \nbenefit minority, low- and middle-class families. Data suggests the \nmarriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower income working \nfamilies hardest.\n  According to the CBO, couples at the bottom end of the income scale \nwho incur penalties paid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes, \nwhich represented 8 percent of their income.\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\nEight percent, Mr. President. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income \nfamilies will immediately have an 8 percent increase in their income or \nan 8 percent cut in their taxes.\n  Some also argue that repealing the marriage penalty would affect \nfamilies receiving marriage bonuses. This is not true either. Although \nthere are couples who receive marriage bonuses, this doesn't justify \nthe Federal Government penalizing another 21 million couples just for \nbeing married.\n  We should give more bonuses to all American families in the form of \ntax relief, whether both spouses or only one of them are working.\n  In closing, I must point out that this amendment takes the approach \nof income splitting to repeal the marriage penalty. Married couples \nwould be allowed to split their income down the middle, regardless of \nwho earned it, and be taxed at the lower rate. This would protect \nworking couples without punishing women who remain at home.\n  In his book ``The Decline (And Fall?) of the Income Tax,'' Michael \nGraetz, former Treasury Department tax whiz, writes ``A tax system \ncan't survive when it departs from the fundamental values of the people \nit taxes''. I couldn't agree with him more.\n  Mr. President, it is unfair and immoral to continue the marriage \npenalty tax. Today, let us just get rid of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in very strong \nsupport of the marriage penalty amendment. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment. I want to say, under our current tax \nsystem, getting married increases your taxes. That does not make a lot \nof sense.\n  The typical family pays more than $100 per month in extra taxes \nbecause of the marriage penalty. I have looked at this matter for years \nand never understood the rhyme or reason for the policy in the first \nplace. Why on Earth such legislation would ever pass the U.S. Congress \nis mind-boggling. I guess there are some out there who think the \ninstitution of marriage has no special importance.\n  Even if there are those people who feel that way, it would be hard \nnot to acknowledge that taxing people simply because they got married \nis discriminatory, pure and simple, no matter how you feel about \nmarriage. Why should you be discriminated against in the Tax Code \nbecause you get married?\n  Let's not overlook the importance of marriage and the family to our \ncountry's success. Children do best when they are raised by two happily \nmarried parents. We have some in the liberal establishment who would \nprobably take issue with that as well, but I believe that is the case. \nI think the statistics speak for themselves. Study after study \nindicates that children raised in such families are more successful in \nschool, are less likely to commit crime, do drugs, or bear illegitimate \nchildren. They do better in the workplace when they get out of school. \nThey do better and they are more likely to stay married as adults if \nthey have that kind of family unit to learn from.\n  So, imposing a tax penalty on marriage is probably one of the most \nantichild and antifamily policies that we could have. Often, those \nhardest hit by the marriage tax are those young married couples who are \njust trying to get started. We hear all the time from our \nconstituents--I know I do--about this. Here is a letter from a young \nman in Salem, NH. I am not going to have the letter printed in the \nRecord, just for the purpose of protecting the individual's privacy, \nbut let me quote from that letter:\n\n       You see, Senator, my wife and I are both working very hard \n     to make a decent life for ourselves and our future children, \n     if we can ever afford to have them. Unfortunately, we made a \n     tactical error some 15 months ago. We decided that we loved \n     each other enough to get married, and now I realize that \n     before making such a decision, I should have consulted the \n     Tax Code to see what the incremental tax liabilities would \n     be. In 1997, our tax liability was approximately $1,100 more \n     than it would have been had we simply decided to live \n     together out of wedlock.\n\n  That is a very powerful statement from a young couple who love each \nother, who got married, and then paid a penalty in the Tax Code for \ndoing that.\n  There is one other letter from a constituent in Lee, NH.\n\n       My husband and I got married this past August. He is a \n     police officer and I started a new job as a project engineer \n     for a large plastics manufacturer. We purchased our first \n     home together in September, thinking we would get taxed on \n     our savings for a home. We thought we were establishing \n     ourselves quite well as a young married couple. It was to our \n     surprise that when we met with our CPA we found out that \n     there was a couple of thousand dollars tax penalty just for \n     being married, which has cost us $2,700. This, of course, \n     increased the amount of money that we owed to the IRS. We \n     both expected to owe taxes, a small amount, due to the fact \n     that we are a double income family without children as yet.\n       However, the last thing we expected to be taxed on was our \n     marriage. This has placed a very large burden on my husband \n     and me and since it wasn't in our budget it is affecting our \n     home security.\n       In our country, I think that one of the last things we need \n     to penalize is marriage. We have enough divorcees, deadbeat \n     parents, and abusive families to worry about. Does it really \n     make sense to attack the families that do not fall into these \n     categories? I understand the money has to come from \n     somewhere, but families like ours also have to control our \n     expenses. Why can't the Government bring in funds without \n     this tax penalty and control its expenses?\n\n  Mr. President, these constituents are very perceptive. I agree with \nthem. There is no excuse for withholding tax relief from American \nfamilies. I agree with them. There is no better place to start cutting \ntaxes than the marriage penalty. There is no excuse for maintaining a \ntax policy that undermines children and marriage.\n  This amendment, which would allow a husband and a wife to each claim \nhalf of their joint incomes and be taxed in the lower brackets that \napply, will send a very clear message to the American people from this \nCongress that marriage is a valued institution, that we want to \nencourage it, not discourage it, and that we ought not to be penalized \nin the Tax Code for being married. We want to adopt a policy that does \nnot discriminate against marriage by effectively eliminating this \nmarriage penalty.\n  New CBO projections call for Federal budget surpluses exceeding $500 \nbillion over the next 5 years. Thus, the full elimination of the \nmarriage penalty would equal less than one-third of the projected \nbudget surplus. This surplus gives us the opportunity to have a \npositive impact upon millions of American families, hard-working \nAmerican families who are trying to do the right thing to raise their \nchildren in the right way and send a message saying that marriage is \nimportant to our culture.\n  This amendment is long overdue--long overdue--and I agree with the \nSenator from Missouri that the business of Government is to create an \nenvironment in which the family can flourish, and we need to encourage \ninstitutions like the family. The more we encourage the family, the \nless need we are going to have for Government to step in. Maybe that is \nthe reason why we had the marriage penalty in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. There \nwill be all kinds of reasons given why we shouldn't, but I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to eliminate the penalty that the \nTax Code imposes on the American family. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join with my \ncolleagues from Missouri and Kansas in their amendment to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. There has been a growing level of frustration amongst \nmost of us in the Senate and, I am sure, our colleagues on the other \nside of the Rotunda, as the Congressional Budget Office and others \npredict and justify by their analysis higher and higher budget \nsurpluses, as to what we will do with this revenue. As most of my \ncolleagues know, I, amongst others, have fought for decades to bring \nabout a balanced budget knowing that from that budget we would have \nopportunities to significantly change the way our Government does \nbusiness, but most importantly, the way our Government impacts the \nlives of American citizens in the form of rules and regulations and \nlaws, because balanced budgets limit Government, but most importantly, \nas a result of the kind of impact the Federal Government, through its \ntaxing policies, have on wage earners' ability to\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\nearn and to spend their money for themselves, for their families, for \ntheir children.\n  Over the course of creating tax policy the last good number of \ndecades, one of the great tragedies that I think the public recognizes \nis that Congress can use tax policy as a form of social engineering. \nYou can cause the public to move their moneys in one direction or \nanother by the way you tax them. You can also cause the public or \nindividuals to act differently.\n  There was a recent article in a newspaper, a national wire story just \nthis past week. More couples are living together without being married \nthan ever in the history of our country. They cited a lot of reasons. \nOne of the reasons they didn't cite was tax policy. But in talking with \ncitizens of my State and couples who have chosen to live together \nwithout marriage, the marriage penalty is clearly one of those issues.\n  Tragically enough, that is either by intent or by mistake, but the \nreality is clear: Tax policy driven by this Congress and by the \nAmerican Government has caused a lifestyle change in our country, a \nchange in the forming of the family unit that many of my colleagues \ntoday have said, and rightfully spoken to, as being the foundation of \nour society, the strength of our communities and, therefore, the \nstrength of our country.\n  Tax policy should not do that, and here we are in an opportune time, \nan opportunity that we have never had in the years I have spent here, \nto make these kinds of changes, and we ought to do it.\n  I must also tell you that with the projected surplus over the next 5 \nyears of $500 billion plus, there are a lot of other things we can do. \nFor future generations, we ought to fix the Social Security system. Fix \nit, I mean by not making it a chain letter, by not creating a \ntremendous precipice of problems as it relates to the year 2018 or \nwhenever the spiking of the baby boomers arrives and those necessary \nchecks must go out to our citizens. We ought to fix it now.\n  On that issue--I don't often side with this President--but I think he \nis right. We ought to use this opportunity to stabilize and change and \nadjust the Social Security system.\n  By offering this amendment today, what my colleagues are not saying \nis don't fix Social Security. They are saying we have an opportunity to \naddress a nagging problem inside the tax structure of this country, \nwhile at the same time we ought to deal with Social Security. I hope \nthe House and the Senate, before we adjourn this fall, speak very \nclearly to these issues. The public deserves a tax cut. When you have a \nsurplus that you have collected from the American taxpayer, you ought \nto give it back, or at least you ought to give a substantial portion of \nit back.\n  Polling shows that the American public also expects us to pay off the \ndebt, and one of the ways you pay off the debt or you eliminate a major \nportion of the debt structure of this country is by dealing with Social \nSecurity, because the debt is, in fact, the money that we have borrowed \nfrom the Social Security trust funds by the character of the unified \nbudget under which we finance the activities of our Government.\n  I am going to support Senator Ashcroft and Senator Brownback today in \ntheir effort. We must deal with this. It is timely that we deal with it \nnow, and I think it is important that the Senate express itself with \nthis opportunity. The marriage penalty is a major first step in \naddressing what needs to be significant tax reform in this country that \nI hope can come in the 106th Congress that will convene in January of \nnext year.\n  I applaud my colleagues today for bringing this issue to the floor \nfor debate and for a vote, and I hope the Senate will concur with them. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this morning we will vote on an \namendment that brings to light a particularly glaring injustice of the \nFederal Tax Code, and that is the marriage tax penalty.\n  In recent months, the Senate has debated this issue more than once. I \nthink these efforts are significant. I congratulate Senators Brownback \nand Ashcroft for offering this amendment and also the many other \nMembers who have championed the elimination of the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  Let me also say this: The U.S. Senate should not rest until we are \nable to eliminate this counterproductive, unfair, and regressive \npolicy. I will continue to support amendments to end the marriage tax \npenalty until we are successful.\n  I ask myself one fundamental question before I make up my mind on any \nissue we deal with on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is: Does this \npolicy make sense for the American people?\n  Let us apply this question to our current Federal Tax Code, which \nquite simply penalizes a working couple for getting married. Should \nfolks pay more tax because they are married? Absolutely not.\n  The marriage tax penalty raises revenue for the Government but it is \npoor public policy. It most often raises taxes on lower- and middle-\nincome families who claim the standard deduction. That is wrong. We \nmust strengthen the bonds of family to strengthen the fabric of our \nsociety.\n  Before 1969, marriages were treated by the Federal Tax Code like \npartnerships--allowing husbands and wives to split their incomes \nevenly. In 1969, the practice of income splitting was ended. By doing \nthis, the Government did nothing less than penalize American couples \nfor marrying.\n  Since that time, with the Nation's progressive tax rates, tax laws \nhave meant that working married couples are forced to pay significantly \nmore money in taxes than they would if they were both single. \nCurrently, 42 percent of married couples suffer because of the marriage \ntax penalty.\n  Let me provide an example. A single person earning $24,000 per year \nis taxed at a rate of 15 percent. If two people, each earning $24,000, \nget married, the IRS, by taxing them on their combined income, taxes \nthem in the 28-percent bracket.\n  This amendment will phase out the marriage tax penalty by allowing \nmarried couples to file a combined return. By doing this, each spouse \nis taxed using the rates applicable to unmarried individuals so that \none spouse's lesser income does not push a couple's combined income \ninto a higher tax bracket.\n  Some might argue that it is the job of the Federal Government to \npromote good behavior; others might disagree. But I think that we could \nall agree on one issue: The Federal Government should not be penalizing \nmarriages, a sacrosanct institution and the bedrock of our social \nstructure. It is time for the Federal Government to end this injustice \nto the American family. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  How many times have we heard, Mr. President, statements by Senators \non the floor of this institution talking about family values--family, \nthe fabric of this society? Yet, here we have tax policy that penalizes \nfamilies. It is time to end the injustice. Again, I support Senator \nBrownback and Senator Ashcroft and the leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am in the contradictory position of \nagreeing in substance with this amendment. There is no question in my \nmind that it is wrong to penalize married couples who pay more taxes \nthan if they were single. As I have said, it is a matter that must be \ncorrected. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I shall work mightily \nto see that this is accomplished.\n  But the fact is that this is a revenue measure. If this amendment is \nadopted, it subjects the entire Treasury-Postal appropriations to a \nblue slip from the House of Representatives. Under our Constitution, \nrevenue measures must originate in the House. If not, any Member--and, \nagain, I emphasize any Member--of the House can raise an objection. The \nresult would be that this appropriations bill dies. I do not think that \nis in anyone's interest. For that reason, I move to table the \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is the amendment that I put \nforward----\n  Mr. GRAMM. May we have order, Mr. President, so we can hear the \nSenator from Kansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3359, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate greatly everybody's \nsupport of the notion that we should do away with the marriage penalty. \nIt is the appropriate signal, and it is the appropriate thing for us to \nsay to the American public. It is the appropriate sort of tax cut that \nwe can certainly pay for it at the present time. I am particularly \nappreciative of the leadership's support and Senator Lott's commitment \nto provide that sort of working relief to American taxpayers.\n  I am withdrawing my amendment because the Constitution does not allow \ntax-cutting legislation to originate in the Senate. This vote, however, \nsends a strong message to the House that we want to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. And that is what we hope to be able to get done yet \nthis session of Congress.\n  I would like to yield to one of the cosponsors of this amendment, the \nSenator from Missouri, for comments as well.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Kansas for \nhis outstanding work on this issue. I believe that it is simply wrong \nfor America to launch through the tax system an assault on one of the \nmajor principles of our culture--enduring, lasting marriages. But I \nconcur with his judgment that this would subject this bill to what is \nknown as a blue slip in the House and could disrupt the business that \nwe ought to be conducting. I commend him for withdrawing the amendment. \nI thank him for the excellent work that he has done.\n  I think this vote is a clear signal that this body understands this \nassault on the values of America, known as the marriage penalty, does \nnot belong in the policy of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank those who supported this \nparticular effort and hope that we will have an opportunity to rally as \npublic servants to eliminate this scar on the body politic whereby we \nwound the primary institution of stability in our culture, the family, \nby penalizing marriages. It is time for us to stop that. I believe we \ncan and will, and this vote demonstrates it.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the request of the Senator from Kansas, the \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3359) was withdrawn\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't want anyone to misinterpret the \nvote just taken. Obviously, there are a lot of motivations in offering \namendments like this on the appropriations bill. As the Senator from \nMissouri just noted, this legislation would have been blue-slipped had \nit gone over to the House. I appreciate the actions just taken in \nwithdrawing the amendment.\n  So that there will be no doubt, we will be offering a similar \nmarriage penalty amendment this afternoon--a marriage penalty amendment \nthat will be paid for, that will be targeted, that will offer a far \ngreater opportunity to address the real issue without using the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  The previous amendment would have, without question, used Social \nSecurity to pay for it's tax benefits. One hundred billion dollars over \nthe next 5 years out of the Social Security Trust Fund surplus is \nsomething most Democrats are unprepared to support. We don't have to \nuse the Social Security trust fund. We don't have to use the surplus. \nWe don't have to use a broad-based, completely untargeted approach to \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  So we will have another opportunity this afternoon to vote on the \nmarriage penalty in a reasonable and a direct and a far more \nresponsible way. And I look forward to that debate as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Dakota yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am trying to understand the difference. We voted on a \ntabling motion. We went actually to a recorded vote on a tabling motion \non this amendment. Then, immediately after the tabling motion failed, \nthe author of the amendment said he was going to withdraw it because \napparently it would be blue-slipped and, therefore, inappropriate, and, \nsecond, violates the Budget Act.\n  What is the difference between voting to table and then being the \nauthor and deciding it violates the Budget Act and it is also a blue-\nslip problem, and therefore I am going to withdraw it? Is there any \ndistinction between a vote to table and a decision by the author to \nwithdraw, in the Senator's opinion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota raises a good question. I \ndon't know what motivation there may have been to simply put the Senate \non record one more time. As everyone recalls, we had this debate on the \ntobacco bill. We had two versions of the marriage penalty proposed--the \nDemocratic version and the Republican version. There are some very \nconsiderable differences. But, voting against the tabling motion and \nthen withdrawing it seems somewhat of a convoluted approach to \nlegislating. I am unclear as to what the motivation may have been.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Certainly, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad the Senator reminded us that we had this \nmorning penalty issues on the tobacco bill. The Senators who voted to \ntable that tobacco bill had actually voted to table the marriage \npenalty then, did they not?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is correct. There was a motion \nto table the amendment at that time. They voted to do so at that time. \nObviously, they will probably be voting again this afternoon to table a \nmarriage penalty vote that we will be offering.\n  It will be interesting to see how this plays out. But, clearly, I \nthink there\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\nwas a political motivation as much as a substantive motivation on the \npart of our Republican colleagues. That was evidenced in the tobacco \nbill debate, and it will be evidenced again today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For those of us who want to make certain the surplus is \nused first to guarantee the longevity and solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, are we going to have an opportunity with the \namendment that the Senator is going to offer to support tax reform \nconsistent with that goal of protecting Social Security first?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. We \ndon't have to use Social Security trust funds. We don't have to use the \nsurplus to pay for a marriage penalty amendment. We can find an \nappropriate offset and delineate that offset, which is what I think is \nthe responsible thing to do. There was no delineation of an offset in \nthe previous amendment, so one has to assume that the Republican \namendment was, again, more of a demonstration of rhetoric than genuine \neffort to provide responsibly-funded tax relief. The rhetoric we get \nfrom our colleagues on the other side that they will not use the Social \nSecurity trust funds. The facts are otherwise. For example, in this \namendment, $100 billion in Social Security trust funds were likely to \nbe used.\n\n  There is a difference between our approaches to fiscal \nresponsibility, protecting Social Security, and providing tax relief. I \nthink that ought to be made clear in the Record. We will have an \nopportunity once more to debate that this afternoon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I inquire of the Senator from South Dakota, the \nrepresentation was made by the author of the amendment, after the vote, \n``We now have some expression of who in the Senate wants to abolish the \nmarriage tax penalty.'' We have had other votes on that constructed in \ndifferent ways, constructed in ways that don't use the Social Security \ntrust funds in order to provide this kind of tax relief. But, could one \nalso not make the point that those who voted against tabling were \ncasting a vote to violate the Budget Act? If, in fact, the amendment as \noffered violated the Budget Act, could one not construe a vote in \nopposition to tabling to say, by those who cast that vote, we would \nlike to violate the Budget Act here? I mean, there are all kinds of \nmotives, I suppose. I don't want to ascribe motives to anyone. But it \nseems to me, to have a tabling vote here on the floor of the Senate and \nthen decide by that tabling vote who cares or does not care about the \nmarriage tax penalty, and then withdraw the amendment and then stand up \nand say, ``Now we know who cares and doesn't care,'' it seems to me you \ncould also put different interpretations on that same vote. Perhaps the \npeople who decided they didn't care whether it violated the Budget Act \ncast a vote to say we didn't care about the Budget Act. Would that be a \nfair construction?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think it is a fair construction. I give great credit \nto the chairman of the Finance Committee for making that point. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee did the responsible thing and was \ncertainly showing, once again, his leadership in this regard in making \nsure everyone understood this is not a tax bill. This is an \nappropriations bill. There is a time to address taxes. There is a time \nto address spending through appropriations. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee drew that distinction, as did most of us.\n  So, again, we will have another opportunity to discuss this matter, \nbut I simply wanted at this point in the Record to be sure everyone \nunderstood what motivations there may have been for those of us who \nfeel we ought to take a more responsible view with regard to the \nmarriage penalty itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to explain \nto my colleagues what the issue was just about. I appreciate the \nopportunity, as well, to be able to address the question of motivation.\n  Make no mistake about the motivation here. Our motivation is to \neliminate the marriage penalty tax. That is pure and simple. That is \nwhat we have been saying for the last couple of hours. It is to \neliminate the marriage penalty tax.\n  We wanted to have this debate at this point in time and juncture \nbecause there are less than 30 legislative days until we finish up. \nSignals that have been coming out haven't been much about tax cuts. \nThey have been mostly about spending. We wanted to send a very clear \nsignal we are for cutting taxes, and in particular, first and foremost, \nthe marriage penalty tax.\n  We needed to have some way to be able to have that debate. We spent a \nlot of time here on the Senate floor--we spent 4 weeks on a tobacco \nbill. We spent a lot of time on a lot of other issues. We have not \nspent much time on tax cuts. We are limited on the number of things we \ncan talk about, and the vehicles we can talk about them on. This was \none we could, and we decided it is getting to the end of this session, \nwe have to start talking about tax cuts. We have to start talking about \nfamilies. This is one of the things that we can talk about, the \nmarriage penalty tax.\n  Anybody looking at the Constitution can say, ``Wait a minute; this \nhas to originate in the House.'' And it does. Then there is a blue slip \nprocedure in the House, which exists. We are soon to be going out for \nthe August break, and we wanted to be able to say to our colleagues in \nthe House: There is support for marriage penalty tax elimination. We \nwanted to get that debate started and moving on forward and to say that \nto them. That is what this debate was about. That is what the vote was \nfor. That is what our motivation is. If anybody is questioning that, we \nhave been standing here for 2 or 3 hours saying that is what we want to \ndo.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us, \nwhen it comes back from the House, to eliminate the marriage penalty \ntax. It is a ridiculous tax. I hope most of them would stand up and \nvote with us at that point in time. If they want to change their vote \nthis time, maybe we can try it again here later on, to send that \nstronger signal to the House that the Democrat side supports this as \nwell. That is what we are about and that is what we are trying to get \nthrough.\n  I think we spent plenty of time debating that and making that point \nclear. So if there is a question about motivation, that is what it is \nabout. It is eliminating that marriage tax penalty and sending that \nsignal back over to the House.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Kansas makes a fair point. I think he \nmakes his point with some credibility on the issue of the marriage tax \npenalty. I understand that. I think most people find most Members of \nthe Senate agree with him. When, in the Tax Code, you have a penalty \nwith respect to the income tax for certain married couples, we ought to \ndo something to address that. I just observed, however, that the \nSenator from Kansas and the Senator from Missouri offered an amendment \nthat addresses it and then withdrew the amendment because it apparently \nviolates the Budget Act and would be blue-slipped in any event because \na revenue measure of this type must be advanced first in the House of \nRepresentatives by the Ways and Means Committee.\n  The reason I stood, following the vote on tabling this amendment, was \nI did not want this to be interpreted as the Senator from Kansas was \ninterpreting it, that this tabling motion was a description of who in \nthe Senate cares about the marriage tax penalty. I think there are many \nMembers of the Senate who agree with the Senator that the marriage tax \npenalty ought to be eliminated. It ought to be eliminated. We ought to \nfind a way to do that. We ought to find the right way to do that.\n  The question is, When you eliminate the marriage tax penalty, as the \nSenator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee indicated,\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\nwhere do you make up the revenue? Exactly how do you construct \nsomething that makes up the revenue you lose when you eliminate the \nmarriage tax penalty? I think it is a worthy effort for this Congress \nand future Congresses to embark upon. But as we have discussed before, \nthe proposition that was offered this morning would lose a substantial \namount of revenue we now have. The proposal did not offer methods by \nwhich that would be made up. I think we have to do that. That is \nprecisely why it violated the Budget Act.\n  I have heard a great deal of debate by a number of Senators here on \nthe floor--the Senator from Kansas, from Missouri, and others. As the \nSenator knows, there have been other proposals to address the marriage \ntax penalty on the floor of the Senate that have also gotten a number \nof votes, and I have voted for addressing that issue, because I think \nit is a worthy issue to address.\n  So I just thought it was curious that we had a proposal that I think \ncosts over $100 billion or so that had a blue slip problem and a \nproblem of violating the Budget Act, that we debate it and then we have \na tabling motion, and we allow people to vote not to table it, and then \nstand up and say those who voted not to table it care about dealing \nwith the marriage penalty and, by inference, those who voted to table \nit do not care. Then the vote is over and it is not tabled, it is still \nprevailing here in the Senate, still pending as the Senate business, \nand then it is withdrawn precisely because it has the problems those \nwho voted to table it allege that it had.\n  I just want to make the point, you will find support and we will find \nsupport, I think, when you and a number of us together address the \nmarriage tax penalty in a thoughtful way and in a way that does not \nbust the Budget Act and does not create a blue slip and does not \npropose solutions for which there are not revenues in order to make up \nthe shortfall.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Senator from Kansas and the Senator \nfrom Missouri. Let me end by saying, again, it is a worthy subject for \nthe Senate to consider, but we cannot consider it in ways that violate \nthe Budget Act.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank \nthe Senator from North Dakota. This is a matter that deserves our \nattention. It is an affront to the very institution that is most \ncritical to the future of America. Some might say since this is not \ngoing to be included in a part of this bill because of the problems of \noriginating such a measure in the Senate, that perhaps this was an \nendeavor which lacked merit.\n  I really think it is important for us to keep the pressure on in this \narena. It is important for a very simple reason, and that is that there \nare proposals to spend, spend, spend constantly. They are insistent. \nThey always have the support of the bureaucracy. They would fund a \nbigger and bigger Government, more bloated and more bloated. It is \nessential that we elevate into the consciousness of this body and to \nthe consciousness of the American public that there are very important \nplaces in which we ought to provide relief to American families, \nparticularly as it relates to the marriage penalty, which is an attack \nby our Government on a central value of our culture, that value of \nmarriage.\n  You had but to look at this year and to see what it has contained. We \nstarted the year in January with some suggestion we were going to have \nadditional revenues. The President came out virtually every day in \nJanuary while we were preparing to come into session with what I call \nthe ``program du jour.'' It was like going to the diner and having the \nspecial. Every day there was a new program to expand spending, to \nenlarge the consumption of Government, and implicitly, to contract the \nability of people to spend the money that they earned as families.\n  For those people who believe the success of America in the next \ngeneration is going to be based on Government, then that is, I think, a \ngood strategy. But for those of us who believe the real success of \nAmerica is not going to be based on Government programs, but is going \nto be based on whether or not we have solid families, then I think a \nstrategy should exist to bring attention to the fact that we are \npenalizing, at the rate of $29 billion a year, people simply for being \nmarried. Some people think, ``We need to be spending this money in \nGovernment.''\n  Frankly, we ought to ask ourselves, do we think we are going to do \nmore to foster the No. 1 institution in American culture, the family, \nby taking money from them and spending it in the bureaucracy, or \nletting those families spend the money on their own families in order \nto do what they need to do and to provide for a strong America.\n\n  This isn't a question about whether moneys are going to be spent or \nnot. This is a question about whether people are going to spend money \non their families or the bureaucracy is going to spend money on \nGovernment. Which do we believe builds a stronger America?\n  Frankly, the number of spending proposals that we are the recipient \nof continues to skyrocket. I have to say that the rules of this \norganization, the rules of the Senate, the rules of the Congress favor \nspending. It is hard to get something through to give money back to the \npeople, and it should not be. But for so long, we have been so \nprejudiced toward taking money, and it has finally gotten to a point \nthat is unacceptable. We are at the highest overall tax rate in \nGovernment in American history right now. It is time for us to say no \nmore, especially as it relates to an assault on the American family.\n  It is true this measure has been withdrawn because it is awkward and \nnot in accordance with the rules as relates to this measure, but it is \ntime for us to begin to elevate this and to say, ``Wait, we have to \nstop this insistent consumption by the Government that keeps us from \nbeing able to spend our own resources as families.''\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for an outstanding job. I was pleased \nto march shoulder to shoulder with him in this effort. I, frankly, \nwelcome people from both sides of the aisle who feel keenly about this. \nWe do need relief for American families, I don't think there is any \nquestion about it. I am delighted that some are expressing that and \nwill continue to do so.\n  I have been delighted at every turn of the debate when individuals \nhave understood that the future of America is far more likely to be \nguaranteed and ensured by strong families than it is by big Government. \nIt is time for us to reflect that in our tax policy.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I look forward to working with \nhim toward the realization of this goal of declaring peace on America's \nfamilies. For too long, we have made war with our tax policy on \nAmerica's families. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we are only going to be another 10 \nminutes or so, and there are several Senators who want to make \nunanimous consent requests.\n  Since we only have a few minutes, and I hate to burden the two \nSenators who are waiting, I will wait and send the remainder of the \namendments to the desk after the break. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3362\n\n(Purpose: To require Federal agencies to assess the impact of policies \n          and regulations on families, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Faircloth, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Helms, Mr. Coverdell and \n     Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an amendment numbered 3362.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ASSESSMENT OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND POLICIES ON \n                   FAMILIES.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) require agencies to assess the impact of proposed \n     agency actions on family well-being; and\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\n       (2) improve the management of executive branch agencies.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given the term \n     ``Executive agency'' by section 105 of title 5, United States \n     Code, except such term does not include the General \n     Accounting Office; and\n       (2) the term ``family'' means--\n       (A) a group of individuals related by blood, marriage, or \n     adoption who live together as a single household; and\n       (B) any individual who is not a member of such group, but \n     who is related by blood, marriage, or adoption to a member of \n     such group, and over half of whose support in a calendar year \n     is received from such group.\n       (c) Family Policymaking Assessment.--Before implementing \n     policies and regulations that may affect family well-being, \n     each agency shall assess such actions with respect to \n     whether--\n       (1) the action strengthens or erodes the stability of the \n     family and, particularly, the marital commitment;\n       (2) the action strengthens or erodes the authority and \n     rights of parents in the education, nurture, and supervision \n     of their children;\n       (3) the action helps the family perform its functions, or \n     substitutes governmental activity for the function;\n       (4) the action increases or decreases disposable family \n     income;\n       (5) the proposed benefits of the action justify the \n     financial impact on the family;\n       (6) the action may be carried out by State or local \n     government or by the family; and\n       (7) the action establishes an implicit or explicit policy \n     concerning the relationship between the behavior and personal \n     responsibility of youth, and the norms of society.\n       (d) Governmentwide Family Policy Coordination and Review.--\n       (1) Certification and rationale.--With respect to each \n     proposed policy or regulation that may affect family well-\n     being, the head of each agency shall--\n       (A) submit a written certification to the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget and to Congress that such \n     policy or regulation has been assessed in accordance with \n     this section; and\n       (B) provide an adequate rationale for implementation of \n     each policy or regulation that may negatively affect family \n     well-being.\n       (2) Office of management and budget.--The Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget shall--\n       (A) ensure that policies and regulations proposed by \n     agencies are implemented consistent with this section; and\n       (B) compile, index, and submit annually to the Congress the \n     written certifications received pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) Office of policy development.--The Office of Policy \n     Development shall--\n       (A) assess proposed policies and regulations in accordance \n     with this section;\n       (B) provide evaluations of policies and regulations that \n     may affect family well-being to the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget; and\n       (C) advise the President on policy and regulatory actions \n     that may be taken to strengthen the institutions of marriage \n     and family in the United States.\n       (e) Assessments Upon Request by Members of Congress.--Upon \n     request by a Member of Congress relating to a proposed policy \n     or regulation, an agency shall conduct an assessment in \n     accordance with subsection (c), and shall provide a \n     certification and rationale in accordance with subsection \n     (d).\n       (f) Judicial Review.--This section is not intended to \n     create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \n     enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its \n     agencies, its officers, or any person.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of the hour, I will only speak \nbriefly about this amendment now and then move to set it aside so the \nSenator from Delaware can speak, and then we can return to this \nsometime later today.\n  This is an amendment, obviously, to the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. This amendment, essentially, accomplishes a very \nspecific purpose: to reinstate an Executive order which was in effect \nfor over 10 years intended to ``ensure that the autonomy and rights of \nthe family are considered in the formulation and implementation of \npolicies by Executive departments and agencies.''\n  I am offering the Family Impact Statement Act as a relevant amendment \nto the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill because it is this bill \nwhich funds the agency which will oversee its implementation and \nenforcement; namely, the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I believe that today, in an era during which observers and social \nscientists from all parts of the political spectrum have come to \nrealize the profound importance of the family on character development, \nwe should be doing everything we can to protect the health, security \nand autonomy of the American family.\n  This belief lay behind President Ronald Reagan's signing of the \nfamily impact Executive order in 1987. In my view, President Clinton \nmade a mistake last April when he revoked this order as part of an \nExecutive order on environmental policy. Now I believe, more than ever, \nwe need to make our bureaucracy more supportive and respectful of \nfamilies' interests. I believe my colleagues will have no trouble \ngiving their enthusiastic support to this amendment.\n  Simply put, this amendment will require Federal agencies to assess \nthe impacts of their policies and regulations on America's families. It \nprovides that each agency assess policies and regulations that may \naffect family well-being.\n  This assessment will aim to determine:\n  One, whether the action strengthens or erodes the stability of the \nfamily and particularly the marital commitment;\n  Two, whether the action strengthens or erodes the authority and \nrights of parents in the education, nurturing and supervision of their \nchildren;\n  Three, whether the act helps the family perform its function or \nsubstitute governmental activity for that function;\n  Four, whether the action increases or decreases disposable family \nincome;\n  Five, whether the benefits of the proposed action will justify its \nfinancial impact on the family;\n  Six, whether the governmental action may be carried out by State or \nlocal government or by the family itself;\n  And seven, whether the action establishes an implicit or explicit \npolicy concerning the relationship between the behavior and personal \nresponsibility of young people and the norms of society.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, agencies will be directed to assess \nwhether proposed rules and policies will help or hurt families as they \nseek to provide mutual support and carry out their vital function of \nforming children into good adults, good citizens, good workers, and \ngood neighbors.\n  On finishing this assessment, the agency heads will submit a written \ncertification to the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress \nthat the assessment has been made and provide adequate rationale for \nimplementing each policy or regulation that may adversely affect family \nwell-being.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will then use \nthis information to ensure that agency policies and regulations are \nimplemented consistent with this amendment, and compile, index, and \nsubmit annually to Congress the written certifications made by agency \nheads.\n  To ensure that no proposed policy or regulation that could adversely \naffect the family goes unassessed, this legislation also provides that \na Member of Congress may request a family impact assessment and \ncertification.\n  In addition, the Office of Policy Development will be directed by \nthis amendment to assess proposed policies and regulations in \naccordance with it, provide evaluations to the Office of Management and \nBudget, and advise the President on policy and regulatory actions that \nmay be taken to strengthen marriage and the family in the United \nStates.\n  In my view--and I will limit my statement at this time--I believe \nthat most Members of this body, as we have already seen expressed today \nfrom both sides of the aisle, are very concerned about America's \nfamilies and want to be on the side of strengthening families.\n  There are a variety of ways to do this, and the Executive order which \nwas enacted in 1987 by President Reagan made unelected persons in our \ngovernmental bureaucracies responsible for assessing the impact on \nfamilies of new rules and regulations before they were implemented. To \nme, that is a sensible thing to require of our Government regulators.\n  The decision to revoke that requirement, which was made last year, in \nmy judgment, was a step in the wrong direction. This amendment seeks \nto, in effect, reinstitute those policies so that the concerns and the \nimpact on families of governmental regulations will be assessed prior \nto--prior to--the creation of and implementation of new Federal \nregulations.\n  I think that makes sense, Mr. President. For that reason, I offer the\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\namendment on behalf of myself and a number of other Senators who \ncosponsored our original legislation. In light of the hour and the \ndesire on the part of others to speak at this time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this amendment be set aside for further consideration \nlater today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. I remind the \nSenator that under the previous order, the Senate will recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we stay in \nsession until I complete my statement, which will be roughly 10 to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I am sorry, I did not hear \nthe Senator's closing comment. That we stay in session until what time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Until I complete my statement, which will be roughly 10 to \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

LAND CONVEYANCE, UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY/\n                   ALTERNATE TIME SERVICE LABORATORY, FLORIDA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--If the Secretary of the Navy \n     reports to the Administrator of General Services that the \n     property described in subsection (b) is excess property of \n     the Department of the Navy under section 202(b) of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 \n     U.S.C. 483(b)), and if the Administrator of General Services \n     determines that such property is surplus property under that \n     Act, then the Administrator may convey to the University of \n     Miami, by negotiated sale or negotiated land exchange within \n     one year after the date of the determination by the \n     Administrator, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the property.\n       (b) Covered Property.--The property referred to in \n     subsection (a) is real property in Miami-Dade County, \n     Florida, including improvements thereon, comprising the \n     Federal facility known as the United States Naval \n     Observatory/Alternate Time Service Laboratory, consisting of \n     approximately 76 acres.

If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3363) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3364\n\n(Purpose: To establish requirements for the provision of child care in \n                          Federal facilities)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. Jeffords, \n     for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kohl, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3364.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \nAmendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment before us on the Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill concerns the provision of child care \nservices located in federally-owned and -leased buildings. This \namendment will go a long way towards ensuring that child care services \nlocated in federally-owned and leased buildings are safe, positive \nenvironments for the children of federal employees.\n  I have been working closely with the Senate Committee on Government \nAffairs which has jurisdiction over this legislation. Chairman Thompson \nand his staff have been extremely helpful, as has the ranking member of \nthat committee, Senator Glenn. The Senate Rules Committee was \ninstrumental in crafting the language related to the Senate Employees' \nChild Care Center. I want to thank Chairman Warner, and Senator Ford \nand their staff for their assistance.\n  This amendment was first introduced as a stand-alone bill on November \n7, 1997. It was drafted because of several serious incidents which \noccurred in federal child care facilities. At that time, it came to my \nattention that child care centers located in federal facilities are not \nsubject to even the most minimal health and safety standards.\n  As my colleagues know, federal property is exempt from state and \nlocal laws, regulations, and oversight. What this means for child care \ncenters on federal property is that state and local health safety \nstandards do not and cannot apply. This might not be a problem if \nfederally-owned or leased child care centers met enforceable health and \nsafety standards. I think most parents who place their children in \nfederal child care would assume that this would be the case. However, I \nthink federal employees will find it very surprising to learn, as I \ndid, that, at many centers, no such health and safety standards apply.\n  I find this very troubling, and I think we should be embarassed that \nchild care in federal facilities child care cannot guarantee that \nchildren are in safe environments. The federal government should set \nthe example when it comes to providing safe child care. It should not \nturn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards simply because \nstate and local regulations do not apply to them.\n  My amendment will require child care services in federal buildings to \nmeet a standard no less stringent than the requirements for the same \ntype of child care offered in the community in\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\nwhich the federal child care center is located. The child care provider \nwould not be required to obtain a state or local license, although that \nis an option open to them. The Government Services Administration would \nbe responsible for establishing the rules and regulations necessary to \nensure that each child care facility in a federal building meets the \nsame level of standards applicable to other child care services in the \ncommunity.\n  In 1987, Congress passed the ``Trible amendment'' which permitted \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a \nportion of federally-owned or leased space for the provision of child \ncare services for federal employees. The General Services \nAdministration (GSA) was given the authority to provide guidance, \nassistance, and oversight to federal agencies for the development of \nchild care centers. In the decade since the Trible amendment was \npassed, hundreds of federal facilities throughout the nation have \nestablished on-site child care centers which are a tremendous help to \nour employees.\n  The General Services Administration has done an excellent job of \nhelping agencies develop child care centers and have adopted strong \nstandards for those centers located in GSA-leased or -owned space. \nHowever, there are over 100 child care centers located in federal \nfacilities that are not subject to the GSA standards or any other laws, \nrules, or regulations to ensure that the facilities are safe places for \nour children. Most parents, placing their children in a federal child \ncare center, assume that some standards are in place--assume that the \ncenters must minimally meet state and local child care licensing rules \nand regulations. They assume that the centers are subject to \nindependent oversight and monitoring to continually ensure the safety \nof the premises.\n  Yet, that is not the case. In one case a federal employee had strong \nreason to suspect the sexual abuse of her child by an employee of child \ncare center located in a federal facility. Local child protective \nservices and law enforcement personnel were denied access to the \npremises and were prohibited from investigating the incident. Another \nemployee's child was repeatedly injured because the child care \nproviders under contract with a federal agency to provide on-site child \ncare services failed to ensure that age-appropriate health and safety \nmeasures were taken--current law says they were not required to do so, \neven after the problems were identified and injuries had occurred.\n  In addition, I believe that the federal government can and should \nlead by example. Federal facilities should always try to meet the \nhighest possible standards. In fact, the GSA has required national \naccreditation in GSA-owned and leased facilities, and has stated that \nits centers are either in compliance or are strenuously working to get \nthere. This is the kind of tough standard we should strive for in all \nof our federal child care facilities.\n\n  For that reason, this amendment requires that within five years, all \nchild care services located within federal facilities must become \naccredited by a professionally recognized child care accreditation \nentity. While state and local child care requirements generally ensure \nthat those services meet the basic health and safety needs, child care \ncredentialling entities go further. Accreditation also includes \nrequirements that developmentally appropriate activities are an \nintegral part of the program, that staff is trained, and that the \nprogram is a positive environment that contributes to the healthy \ndevelopment of children receiving child care services.\n  There are several child care accreditation entities providing these \nservices around the country. The National Council for Private School \nAccreditation is a coalition of 13 entities providing private school \naccreditation, many of which issue credentials to child care service \nproviders. The Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and \nChildren, Inc. has developed standards and guidelines that are used by \nseveral child care accreditation entities to ensure a high quality of \ncare for children. The National Association for the Education of Young \nChildren provides accreditation for child care centers throughout the \ncountry. The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has been accrediting child \ncare services longer than any other entity.\n  Child care providers in federally-owned and leased facilities will be \nable to choose which child care accreditation they will obtain. In \naddition, the General Services Administration is permitted to develop a \nchild care accreditation process to add to the choices already \navailable to programs in federal facilities.\n  Federal child care should mean something more than simply a location \nin a federal facility. The federal government has an obligation to \nprovide safe care for the children of its employees, and it has a \nresponsibility for making sure that those standards are monitored and \nenforced. Some federal employees receive this guarantee. Many do not. \nWe can and must do better.\n  Senators Landrieu and Dodd are original co-sponsors of this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to help ensure high quality child care \nin federally owned and leased facilities by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Senator Jeffords and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nMary Landrieu, in cosponsoring an amendment to require federal child \ncare facilities to lead by example when it comes to child care quality.\n  Up to this point Mr. President, we in the federal government have not \nshown strong leadership when it comes to child care quality.\n  Many parents of children in federal child care facilities have been \nsurprised to discover that these facilities are exempt from the state \nand local quality standards that apply to non-federal centers. Many \nparents have been surprised to find that the federal government does \nnot require its centers to be accredited.\n  With this amendment, for the first time, the more than 200 federal, \nnon-military, child care centers would be required to meet all state \nlicensing standards. For the first time, these centers would be \nrequired to demonstrate that they provide high quality child care by \nbecoming accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.\n  Child care shouldn't be like going to Las Vegas--where you roll the \ndice and hope for the best. Parents should be confident that when they \nare not able to be with their children, their children will still be \nwell cared for. We shouldn't be gambling with our children's health and \nsafety.\n  This legislation will go a long way toward giving parents of children \nin federal facilities peace of mind.\n  I should point out, Mr. President, that many of the child centers run \nby the federal government provide an invaluable service and excellent \ncare to the children of federal workers and other families in the \ncommunity. Many federal centers have even received accreditation from \nthe National Association for the Education of Young Children--an \noutstanding private, non-profit accrediting entity.\n  But this excellence is not uniform. In some federal agencies, only a \nminority of child care centers are accredited. Too many centers are \nfalling through the cracks. And too many children are unnecessarily \nbeing placed at risk.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we are asking our states and \ncommunities to take notice of the important research about brain \ndevelopment in young children--at a time when we all acknowledge how \ncritical high quality child care is to helping children achieve their \npotential--shouldn't we, as federal government lead the way when it \ncomes to providing the best care possible for our children?\n  Mr. President, this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. It \nwas incorporated into the CIDCARE bill that I co-sponsored with Senator \nJeffords and was a part of the Child Care ACCESS Act that I offered \nwith 27 of my Democratic colleagues earlier this year.\n  This is an important step in improving the quality of our Nation's \nchild care. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment relates to Federal child \ncare facilities. This amendment has been cleared by both sides of the \naisle. I ask for its adoption.\n  Mr. KOHL. We accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3364) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3362\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks on \nthe family impact statement amendment offered by Senator Spencer \nAbraham earlier today. It is an amendment that I supported last year. I \nthink it is a very, very important signal and an important event for \nthis Government.\n  I rise today in strong support of this important amendment and to \nvoice my complete disagreement with antifamily action taken by \nPresident Clinton.\n  In 1997, President Ronald Reagan, recognizing the importance of the \nAmerican family and the need to be aware of the negative impact that \nFederal laws and regulations can have on the family, signed Executive \nOrder 12-606. The purpose was to ensure that the rights of the family \nare considered in the construction and carrying out of policies by \nexecutive departments and agencies of this Government.\n  Mr. President, even though we are faced with a staggering increase in \nout-of-wedlock births, rising rates of divorce, and increases in the \nnumber of child abuse cases, apparently President Clinton does not \nbelieve that considering the impact of regulations on families is good \npolicy.\n  Much to my dismay, on April 21, 1997, President Clinton signed \nExecutive Order 13045, thus stripping from the American family any \nexisting protection from harm in the formulation and application of \nFederal policies.\n  President Reagan's Executive Order 12606, placed special emphasis on \nthe relationship between the family and the Federal Government. \nPresident Reagan directed every Federal agency to asses all regulatory \nand statutory provisions ``that may have significant potential negative \nimpact on the family well-being. * * *'' Before implementing any \nFederal policy, agency directors had to make certain that the programs \nthey managed and the regulations they issued met certain family-\nfriendly criteria. Specifically, they had to ask:\n  Does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of \nparents in educating, nurturing, and supervising their children?\n  Does it strengthen or erode the stability of the family, particularly \nthe marital commitment?\n  Does it help the family perform its function, or does it substitute \ngovernment activity for that function?\n  Does it increase or decrease family earnings, and do the proposed \nbenefits justify the impact on the family budget?\n  Can the activity be carried out by a lower level of government or by \nthe family itself?\n  What message, intended or otherwise, does this program send \nconcerning the status of the family?\n  What message does it send to young people concerning the relationship \nbetween their behavior, their personal responsibility, and the norms of \nour society?\n  The elimination of President Reagan's Executive Order 12606 is just \nthe latest in a series of decisions that indicates the Clinton \nadministration's very different approach to family issues. From the \noutset of President Clinton's first term, it became clear that his \nadministration intended to pursue policies sharply at odds with \ntraditional American moral principles. White House actions have ranged \nfrom the incorporation of homosexuals into the military to the \nprotection of partial-birth abortion procedures, to opposing parental \nconsent in cases involving abortion for minors.\n  Mr. President, many have suggested it is community villages, in other \nwords government, that raise children. But really it's families that \nraise children. Families are the ones who are there night and day to \nlove, to care for, and to nurture children.\n  Many bureaucratic regulations produce little benefit, but can have \nunintended consequences. The examples are too numerous to mention.\n  What our amendment will do is to require the ``regulators'' to stop \nand take a moment to think through their regulations to make sure that, \nthe most fundamental institution in civilization--the family, is not \ndamaged by their actions. This is a reasonable and wise policy.\n  Mr. President, I find it very odd that of all the Executive orders \nthat exist, President Clinton would reach down and lift this one up for \nelimination. This body should speak out forcefully on this subject and \nI am confident we will. The families of America deserve no less.\n  This amendment is a sound and reasonable piece of legislation which \nwill restore a valuable pro-family policy that had been established for \n10 years.\n  I urge all my colleagues to stand united, Republicans and Democrats, \nto show that the preservation of the family is not a partisan issue. \nOur voices united will send a loud and certain message to the President \nand this Nation that we consider family protection to be one of \nAmerica's most important issues and we will not accept decisions that \nmark a retreat from our steadfast commitment to our Nation's families.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that American families must be \nconsidered when the Federal Government develops and implements policies \nand regulations that affect families. Therefore, I am honored to be an \noriginal cosponsor for this amendment, which will reinstate the \nExecutive order of President Reagan.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Abraham, Faircloth, \nHutchinson, for their dedicated work and help on this issue.\n  As we know, there is some dispute and controversy and concern in this \nbody concerning the President's proclivity to utilize executive \nregulations to carry out various policies that he wants to carry out. \nHe eliminated this regulation of President Reagan by his own Executive \nOrder, and in fact has stated and reflected his view that the American \nfamily is not at times jeopardized by the actions of this Government, \nand special watch and attention is not necessary to that.\n  I just want to say this. Governmental policy in this country ought to \nconsider what is good, wholesome, and healthy. The American family \nrepresents the finest opportunity to affect the growth, health, well-\nbeing, the mental attitude, and the lawfulness of a young person. \nHealthy families tend to raise healthy children. It is not always so. \nIt is not always so. Families that have trouble raise good kids a lot \nof time, and families that are personally good have troubled children.\n  But fundamentally and historically we know, and there has been much \ndata in recent months and years--you remember the article, ``Dan Quayle \nWas Right.'' So we know that there is a general consensus today that a \nhealthy family is important.\n  I think it was a bad signal. I think it is sad that in this entire \nmonumental bureaucracy of this Federal Government that involves $1.7 \ntrillion in expenditures every year, you don't have to give special \nconcern to your actions with regard to how they might impact the \nAmerican family.\n  I think in that regard the President made a serious error, and he \nsent a signal to this great Government and those who work for him \nwithin the executive branch that they don't have to give special \nscrutiny to it. I believe it was a mistake. Senator Abraham's amendment \nwould restore that.\n  I thank Senator Campbell for his interest and concern on these issues \nand for giving me a few moments to make these remarks.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3365\n\n         (Purpose: To provide for marriage tax penalty relief)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside \nthe Abraham amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3365.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text \nof the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \nMr. Daschle, is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, as I noted this morning, Democrats have supported and \ncontinue to support tax relief for working families. In 1993, we \nsupported tax cuts for millions of working families making less than \n$30,000 per year through an expansion of the earned income tax credit. \nLast year, we supported major tax relief proposals, including a $500-\nper-child tax credit, a $1,500 HOPE education tax credit, a 20-percent \nlifetime learning credit, the reinstatement of student loan deductions, \nfull deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed, \na cut in capital gains taxes for investors and small businesses, and an \nexpansion of estate tax relief for family farms and businesses. All of \nthese tax cuts for working families had one thing in common. They were \nconsistent with a balanced budget; they were fully paid for.\n  Democrats continue to have an ambitious agenda of tax relief for \nworking families. But we also continue to insist that tax cuts be \nconsistent with fiscal responsibility. This is because we understand \nthat fiscal responsibility equals economic growth, and economic growth \nequals more jobs and higher wages.\n  Part of our continuing agenda to provide working families with tax \ncuts is to provide them with substantial relief from the marriage \npenalty. In many families, married couples pay more in income taxes \nthan if they had remained single. Democrats would like to remedy this \nundesirable aspect of our tax system.\n  The amendment that I have just offered would let families deduct 20 \npercent of the income of the lesser-earning spouse. This deduction \nwould be phased out for families making between $50,000 and $60,000 a \nyear. The 20-percent deduction would be an ``above-the-line'' \ndeduction, ensuring that that everyone could claim it, regardless of \nwhether they chose the ``EZ'' form or itemized their deductions on a \nmore complicated tax form. Also, the deduction would be factored into \nthe earned income tax credit calculation; that is, it would help people \nmaking less than $30,000 who may have no income tax liability against \nwhich to take the deduction.\n  But, Mr. President, perhaps most important, contrary to the amendment \noffered this morning, this amendment is fully offset. The offsets \ninclude a number of proposals from the President's budget that have \nattracted broad support. Most of them would terminate unwarranted tax \nloopholes for corporations and investors. Because the amendment is \nfully offset, it is in keeping with the tradition and the practice that \nwe have maintained all through the tax debate this year and previous \nyears.\n  To summarize, unlike the Brownback-Ashcroft amendment offered this \nmorning, the Democratic amendment, first, focuses roughly 90 percent of \nits tax cut on families who are actually penalized., compared with \nabout 40 percent to 45 percent for the Brownback amendment offered this \nmorning.\n  Second, it is fully offset. Its gross cost is $7 billion over 5 years \nand $21 billion over 10; but its net effect on the budget is zero. By \ncontrast, the Brownback-Ashcroft amendment would have drained the \nTreasury and the Social Security trust fund by about $125 billion over \n5 years and $300 billion over 10 years.\n  Therefore, if Senators are interested in delivering meaningful \nmarriage penalty tax relief rather than simply grandstanding about it, \nthey will want to support our amendment. Here are two examples of just \nhow much tax relief our amendment would provide:\n  First, a couple making $35,000, split $20,000 and $15,000 between two \nspouses. With our 20-percent, second-earner deduction, this couple \nwould receive an additional deduction of $3,000, or 20 percent of the \n$15,000 income of the second earner. That translates into an annual \nfamily tax cut of about $450.\n  Second, a couple making $50,000, in this case split $25,000 each \nbetween the two spouses. Under our 20-percent, second-earner deduction, \nthe couple would receive an extra $5,000 deduction, or about $1,400 in \nactual cash-in-the-pocket tax relief.\n  Mr. President, my amendment provides Senators with an opportunity to \nhelp hard-working married couples without busting the budget or \nendangering our efforts next year to restore the Social Security system \nto solvency for future generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President. I want to take a moment to explain my \nsupport for the Daschle amendment on marriage tax relief. As you know, \nearlier today I opposed the Ashcroft-Brownback amendment on the same \nsubject. My concerns related to the wisdom of attaching such a \nsubstantial tax policy change to an appropriations bill. Also, the \nBrownback amendment was not offset--it would have thrown the budget off \nbalance by approximately $125 billion. The marriage tax debate belongs \nwithin the context of a balanced budget and a comprehensive tax bill. \nAnd let me again state my hope that we will approve such a tax bill \nlater this year.\n  However, it's clear that today's debate is primarily about political \nmessages and maneuvering. And, in that case, the record should \ndemonstrate that my voice and vote definitely stands with those calling \nfor the elimination of the marriage penalty. Our tax code should be \nfamily friendly. Couples who want to get married should not be \ndiscouraged from doing so based on how much they will owe in taxes. And \ntax policy changes should be fully offset and respect the principles of \na balanced budget. For these reasons, I intend to support the Daschle \nmarriage penalty amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we spent almost 2 hours on the Ashcroft \namendment. I assume that much of the debate that we have already gone \nthrough will be repeated.\n  I don't think there is anyone on this floor who doesn't want to do \nsomething about the marriage penalty. We are all very comfortable with \nthe fact that it is punitive, and I think all of us want to get rid of \nit, if we can. The question really has been, What is the vehicle to be \nable to do that?\n  I ask the minority leader, since we have spent so much time on this \nalready in the previous debate, if he would be interested in trying to \nwork out some kind of a time agreement, because we have about 56 \namendments that we haven't cleared yet. It looks like it is going to be \na long night, and a long day tomorrow, if we don't get some withdrawn, \nor some agreement on some of them.\n  I ask the minority leader if he would be interested in a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nColorado makes a very good point, and our desire is certainly not to \ncomplicate his efforts and the efforts of the distinguished ranking \nmember to complete action on this bill. I know there are some Senators \nwho wish to be heard on this particular version of the amendment, but I \ndo believe that we can accommodate those Senators. I would be willing \nto enter into a time agreement of 30 minutes, if we could assume that \nthere isn't going to be a great deal of debate on the other side. I am \nnot sure we have to equally divide it. I propose we ask unanimous \nconsent the vote on this amendment occur no later than 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I concur with that, but we have not \nchecked with the majority leader yet. So if I could perhaps ask for a \nquorum call until we confer with him? I appreciate the Senator's offer \nto limit that time to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, Senator DeWine has been patiently \nwaiting for a while to make a statement\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nand possibly offer an amendment. I ask unanimous consent at the \nconclusion of his comments, I be allowed to suggest the absence of a \nquorum at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator from Ohio yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly would.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield to allow me this opportunity to \ncall up the reauthorization of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy? I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to do so.\n  Let me withhold.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be more than happy to yield the floor for the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized and \nretains the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator withhold on the amendment? As I \nunderstand, we can do it at this time and it will only take a minute.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending Daschle amendment be set aside \nwith the understanding we will immediately come back to it after my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3367\n\n (Purpose: To extend the authorization for the Office of National Drug \n      Control Policy until September 30, 2002, and to expand the \n responsibilities and powers of the Director of National Drug Control \n                    Policy, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 3367.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the reauthorization of the office \nof the drug czar, National Drug Control Policy. I do believe it has \nbeen accepted by both sides. It is critical that we have this amendment \nagreed to at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection--the Chair will observe the \nChair is having difficulty hearing the Senator. Perhaps, if the Senator \ncould speak up, it would be very helpful.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is an amendment to reauthorize the Office of the \nNational Drug Control Policy.\n  In this era of passivity and neglect toward what I believe should \nremain a vigorous war on drugs, we as Americans must refuse to give up \nthe fight against a youth drug plague that is threatening to erode the \nvery core of our society. To do this, we must mount an unflappable \neffort against this drug scourge that continues to tighten its grip on \nour nation's children.\n  Faced with such an ominous task, it is essential that the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy be maintained as the principal clearing \nhouse for the formulation and implementation of our nation's \ncomprehensive counter-drug strategy. As a nation we simply cannot \ncontinue to turn our backs while drug abuse continues to run rampant \namong our youth.\n  For this reason I implore each of my colleagues to support the Hatch/\nBiden amendment, a substitute to H.R. 2610. This amendment truly \nrepresents a bipartisan effort to craft legislation that gives the \noffice a meaningful reauthorization period and strengthens ONDCP's \nauthority over drug control program agencies. In an effort to erase \nthis Administration's abdication of its responsibilities to the \nCongress, the bill requires enhanced reporting requirements on the \neffectiveness of the National Drug Control strategy thus imposing far \ngreater accountability to the Congress. It also disposes with an annual \nstrategy that, under the Clinton administration, simply has served as \nan opportunity to grandstand in an effort to show that the President \nwas going to take the drug war seriously in the future to make up for \nhis past disinterest. Instead, the bill recognizes the comprehensive \nlong term strategy drafted last year, and further requires an annual \nreport that requires each administration to report on the success or \nfailures of its strategy in the previous year.\n  This substitute differs principally from the House bill in that it \ncalls for a 4-year versus a 2-year reauthorization period; and, in that \nit does not statutorily mandate ``hard targets'' that must be achieved \nby 2001. Rather, consistent with ONDCP's previous authorization, it \nrequires that ONDCP establish annual measurable objectives and long \nterm goals. In addition, the legislation also officially authorizes \nONDCP's Performance Measurement System which will provide the Congress \nand the American people with the specific data needed to ascertain \nwhether the strategy is working and where changes are necessary.\n  The legislation also provides flexibility in the event of a change in \nPresidents or ONDCP Directors. In such case, the incoming President or \nDirector has the option of either adopting and continuing with the \ncurrent strategy, or abandoning it in favor of an entirely new \nstrategy. In addition, at any time upon a finding by the President that \nthe current strategy, or certain policies therein, are found not to be \nsufficiently effective, the President may submit a revised strategy.\n  We have worked with ONDCP, the Armed Services Committee, and Senator \nBiden to resolve a significant disagreement concerning ONDCP's \ninvolvement in, and authority over, the development of budgets of other \nagencies. We have crafted a process which allows ONDCP to have input at \nall stages of the budget drafting process and to decertify budgets \nwhich are inadequate to fulfill the responsibilities given to that \nagency. It also allows agencies who are forced to alter their budgets \nat the direction of ONDCP to submit an ``impact statement'' describing \nhow such changes might affect the ability of that agency to fulfill its \nother responsibilities.\n\n  I oppose a proposal by the administration to disband the office of \n``Supply Reduction'' headed by a deputy director, which was established \nto coordinate all law enforcement and interdiction programs, both \ndomestic and international. As recognized by the legislation recently \nintroduced by Senator DeWine, which I cosponsored, supply reduction is \nan integral part of our anti-drug efforts, and we need a deputy \ndirector specifically responsible for these efforts. We have, however, \nincorporated significant reorganizations of the leadership of ONDCP, \nincluding the new position of Deputy Director and a Deputy Director for \nState and Local Affairs.\n  We have also strengthened the ONDCP office in many respects, \nincluding: (1) Clarifying the Director's authority by adding to his \nresponsibilities that he shall represent the administration before the \nCongress on all issues relating to the National Drug Control Program, \nand that he shall serve as the administration's primary spokesperson on \ndrug issues; (2) Requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to give \nONDCP an annual assessment of the acreage of illegal domestic drug \ncultivation; and (3) In order to strengthen ONDCP's ability to obtain \ninformation from its program agencies, adding provisions that require, \nupon the request of the Director, heads of departments and agencies \nunder the National Drug Control Program to provide ONDCP with \nstatistics, studies, reports, and other information pertaining to \nFederal drug abuse programs.\n  I might also point out that the definition of ``drug control'' has \nbeen modified in the reauthorization to include underage use of alcohol \nand tobacco. This change codifies ONDCP policy begun under Republican \nadministrations.\n  While I recognize that there remain some concerns over reauthorizing \nthis office in light of the Clinton administration's abysmal record on \ndrugs, it is my belief that we must employ every possible weapon that \nis available to fight the drug war, including the authorization of a \nnational drug office with teeth, which will be held accountable to take \nreal action in combating illegal drug abuse. This bill achieves\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\nthat goal. For this reason, I urge each of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment, and to work in a bipartisan manner to address \nlegitimate concerns as we go to conference.\n  Let me highlight why this issue is so pressing. Drug use by teenagers \nis one of the most serious domestic problems facing our nation today: \nIn my mind, it may be the most crucial issue for our nation's ability \nto craft productive and law-abiding citizens. The worsening problem of \ndrug abuse among our children and teens wreaks havoc on the lives and \npotential of thousands of young people each year. If we do not act \ndecisively, we will pay a heavy price.\n  According to the highly respected Monitoring the Future study \npublished by the University of Michigan, drug use among young people \nbegan a steady decline in the early 1980's which continued until 1992. \nSurvey after survey demonstrated that we were on the right track in \nraising children free from drug abuse.\n  These declines, which I believe were largely the result of the strong \nleadership of Presidents Reagan and Bush, are not just statistics. The \n1980's and early 1990's produced a generation of young adults with low \nrates of substance abuse. We reap the benefits of that fact every day \nas those young men and women succeed in the workforce and build their \nfamilies and communities. We see the benefits of our work in the 1980's \nand early 1990's in the lower drug abuse rates and declining crime \nrates we find among adults today.\n  But just as we are realizing some benefit today from the hard work of \nthe last decade, we will pay the price for the failures of the 1990's. \nYoung people are being raised in an environment lacking in definition \nof moral leadership. As I saw these trends developing, I spoke out and \ndemanded that this administration reverse course: I particularly \nrecall, in 1993, President Clinton's first drug czar--Lee Brown--saying \nthat drug control was no longer ``at the top of the agenda'' for the \nadministration. Indeed, the administration's first drug control \nstrategy in 1993 noted that there was developing ``a loss of public \nfocus which has also allowed the voices of those who would promote \nlegalization to ring more loudly.'' Mr. Brown's concerns regarding \nlegalization, as we all know, were realized in some States. I feared \nthen that the blame for this loss of public focus on the drug war would \nbe laid at the feet of the Clinton administration. The Committee's \nwarnings were frank, continuous, and bipartisan. In recent years, under \nthe leadership of General Barry McCaffrey, we have seen some efforts to \nmake up for the years of neglect. Yet, notwithstanding his efforts I \nbelieve drug control--and ONDCP--lack the full backing of President \nClinton and the results are indisputable.\n  The steady downward trends of the 1980's and early 1990's were \ntragically reversed. Remember that each percentage point we discuss \nrepresents thousands of teens who are much more likely to become bigger \nproblems for society as they become adults.\n  As measured by use in the past month, drug abuse by high school \nseniors jumped 27 percent in 1993, 20 percent in 1994, and an \nadditional 9 percent in 1995. Past-monthly abuse by 10th graders \nskyrocketed by 27 percent in 1993. The 1996 National Household Survey \non Drug Abuse published by Health and Human Services, published last \nyear, shows that between 1992 and 1996 the number of 12- to 17-year-\nolds having used marijuana in the past year more than doubled--from 1.4 \nmillion to 2.9 million.\n  The annual use of any illicit drug among high school students has \ndramatically increased since 1991--from 11 percent to 24 percent in \n1996 for 8th graders, from 21 percent to 38 percent for 10th graders, \nand from 29 percent to 40 percent for 12th graders.\n  Lifetime use statistics show a similar trend--from 19 percent in 1991 \nup to 31 percent in 1996 for 8th graders, from 31 percent up to 45 \npercent for 10th graders, and from 44 percent to 51 percent for 12th \ngraders.\n  As for marijuana use for 8th graders, it is clear that marijuana use \nshot from 10 percent in 1991 to 23 percent in 1997.\n\n  Although marijuana is still the most readily available drug across \nthe United States, teenagers can obtain just about any drug they desire \nwith little problem. Today, illegal drugs are more easily obtained than \nalcohol or tobacco.\n  To those who suggested that marijuana does not serve as a gateway to \neven more harmful drug use, there are very few instances that I am \naware of where the first drug a child ever tried was heroin or \nmethamphetamine. Most teens tell you that they first experimented with \nmarijuana. Studies show that if kids smoke marijuana, they have an 85 \ntimes greater propensity to move on to experiment with harder drugs. \nGeneral Barry McCaffrey should be commended for his personal leadership \nin fighting the trends towards tolerance for marijuana use.\n  While marijuana use increasing, the use of other drugs--harder \ndrugs--is growing at a dramatic rate. The use of methamphetamine has \nskyrocketed in the Western half of the country. Easy manufacturing and \nthe increasing market have helped make methamphetamine cheaper and more \navailable to kids.\n  What is the reason behind this surge in teen drug consumption? I \nbelieve several things. First, in recent years there has been a decline \nin anti-drug messages from elected leaders--like President Clinton--and \nsimilar messages in homes, schools, and the media, Second, the debate \nover the legalization of marijuana and the glorification of drugs in \npopular culture has caused confusion in our young people. Third, \ndisapproval of drugs and perception of risk has declined among young \npeople. The percent of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who ``disapproved'' \nor ``strongly disapproved'' of use of various drugs declined steadily \nfrom 1991 to 1995. In 1992, 92 percent of 8th graders, 90 percent of \n10th graders, and 89 percent of 12th graders disapproved of people who \nsmoked marijuana regularly. By 1996, however, those figures had dropped \nsignificantly.\n  Previous administrations recognized that education and treatment \nprograms were only effective if coupled with tough criminal deterrence \nand effective interdiction. Statistics clearly show that as the \ninterdiction dollars go down, drugs use goes up.\n  I was recently pleased to hold a hearing on teen drug use. We heard \nfrom a teenager named Rachel who recounted her personal experience with \ndrug addiction. We also heard testimony from two physicians, Dr. Nancy \nAuer and Dr. Sushma Jani who have seen in our emergency rooms and \nhospitals the devastating effects that drug abuse has had on our \nnation's youth. Lastly, we heard from Chris, an individual who works as \nan undercover officer in high schools in Ohio--to protect his continued \nability to provide this valuable service, his identity was shielded \nduring the hearing.\n  In conclusion, I think it is clear that the rates of youth drug abuse \nare neither stable nor acceptable, but are instead rising sharply. I \nwas therefore very surprised to hear President Clinton claim on the \nworld stage in his recent speech before the United Nations that ``drug \nuse by our young people is stabilizing, and in some categories, \ndeclining.'' I believe that we are in the middle of a crisis and that \nthe time for action long since passed.\n  Passage of this legislation will be a crucial part of that action.\n  As I understand it, this is acceptable to both managers of the bill. \nSo I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment with \nSenator Hatch to reauthorize the Drug Director's Office. Senator Hatch \nand I have been assisted by several other Senators in this effort, and \nI would just note that the reauthorization bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee last year was cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, \nDeWine, Coverdell, and Feinstein.\n  I would also note that since then, we have worked closely with \nSenator McCain to meet some concerns that he had raised relating to the \nDrug Director's budget certification powers. And, the language we have \nnegotiated with Senator McCain  is incorporated into the text offered \nin this amendment.\n  This bipartisan legislation will, I hope, result in speedy action to \nkeep the Drug Director's Office in place--no matter what perspective \nany of us have on any specific drug policy, this legislation is about \nwhether we will have a\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\nDrug Director and Drug Office to be responsible for--and accountable \nto--a national drug policy.\n  In 1987, before my legislation creating the Drug Office finally \nbecame law, There was no official in charge of the administration's \ndrug effort; and, because there was no Cabinet official in charge, \nevery Cabinet official could duck responsibility to talk about tough \ndrug policy issues--and, guess what, that meant no administration \ntalked about drugs and no administration was accountable on drugs.\n  Just as with my original drug czar legislation, the Hatch-Biden \namendment retains its central goal--holding every administration and \nevery President accountable on the drug issue.\n  The Hatch-Biden amendment does so in several ways:\n  First, and this was one of Chairman Hatch's top priorities, Hatch-\nBiden requires the Clinton administration to identify measurable \nobjectives for the National Drug Strategy, and provide on February 1, \n1999, specific answers about whether these objectives have been met;\n  Second, Hatch-Biden retains the current law about the administration \nsubmitting a detailed annual drug budget--every line of which is \nreviewed and changed in the annual congressional appropriations \nprocess.\n  To this, Hatch-Biden adds a requirement--called for by General \nMcCaffrey--for budget projections covering the next 4 years. In other \nwords, this prevents any ``pie-in-the-sky'' promises, which are not \nbacked up by specific budget projections.\n  Third, and this is the major change proposed by General McCaffrey and \nincluded in Hatch-Biden, instead of the overall drug strategy, it \nrequires a detailed annual report which will focus the administration \nand the Congress on the ``nuts and bolts'' of implementing the \nstrategy.\n  As Senator Hatch points out--instead of a strategy in which an \nadministration tells us what it is going to do about drugs; this report \nwill force any administration to tell us what they have accomplished \nagainst drugs.\n  Hatch-Biden includes specific language requiring:\n  That the annual report include any necessary modifications of the \ndrug strategy;\n  A whole new strategy if the current strategy proves ineffective;\n  An annual assessment of the progress on the specific, measurable \ngoals identified in the drug strategy;\n  Goals that are required by law to address--current drug use; \navailability of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana; drug \nprices, and purity among many others; and\n  That any new President or new Drug Director submit a new drug \nstrategy.\n  Finally, the key addition of the annual report included in Hatch-\nBiden is the ``performance measurement system''--which would add nearly \n100 detailed measures, each with a definite timetable.\n  These measures are all about holding the 50 drug agencies and offices \naccountable to the drug policy goals of the administration--the one \ntask that all Drug Directors have found exceedingly difficult to \nactually implement.\n  Just to identify a few of these specific measures:\n  Increase asset seized from drug traffickers by 15 percent; increase \ndrug trafficking organizations dismantled by 20 percent in high \nintensity drug trafficking areas; and reduce worldwide coca cultivation \nby at least 40 percent.\n  Of course, we would all like each of these measures to be achieved \nimmediately--but, even if we could do this efficiently, the costs would \nbe staggering--an additional $60-$90 billion over just the next 3 \nyears. So, achieving these goals will take time.\n  One final point on the general's performance measurement system--if \nwe are to give him a fighting chance to increase the accountability of \nall the drug agencies, we have to put this system in law. For, if we do \nnot, mark my words, the general will be defeated by all the career \nofficials in all the drug agencies who want to stop this increased \naccountability.\n  Another element of General McCaffrey's proposal which has been \nincluded in Hatch-Biden is to require that the No. 2 official in the \noffice--the Deputy Director--have to come before the Senator for \nconfirmation just like the demand deputy, supply deputy and State and \nlocal deputy.\n  I favor this because the hearing, committee, and floor votes on the \nDeputy Director would give the Senate another important opportunity to \nhold any administration accountable on drugs.\n  In addition, the key mission of the Drug Office--holding the nearly \n50 agencies and offices with drug policy responsibilities accountable--\nrequires having officials with the credentials of Senate confirmation.\n  The Hatch-Biden amendment also includes specific language calling for \n``scientific, educational, or professional'' credentials for whomever \nis nominated for the demand deputy job.\n  This is an issue that Senators Grassley and Moynihan have really been \nthe leaders on--and I just acknowledge their key role in this aspect of \nHatch-Biden.\n  I also note that, at the chairman's insistence, the length of time of \nthis reauthorization has been drastically shortened.\n  While the general initially proposed to authorize the office for 12 \nyears, Hatch-Biden reauthorizes for 4 years through September 30, 2002.\n  In closing, I would point out that this legislation has been through \na long process here in the Senate and that this process has resulted in \na strong, bipartisan bill.\n  I understand that the two managers of the bill, Senators Campbell and \nKohl, are willing to accept this amendment. I appreciate their support, \nand the support of the full Senate for the reauthorization of the Drug \nDirector.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I might add this amendment is acceptable \nto both sides. It is a very, very important program. It is basically \nthe drug czar's program. We know we have spent an awful lot of money on \nthis program in the last few years, but clearly it is having an effect \non reducing teenage drug use in particular. I just wanted to add my \ncomments to those of the Senator from Utah that this is a good \namendment.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3367) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3354\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to pay for an abortion or to pay \nfor the administrative expenses in connection with certain health plans \n                  that provide coverage for abortions)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I believe my amendment is already at the \ndesk. I call up my amendment in regard to Federal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment of the \nSenator from South Dakota is set aside, and the clerk will report the \namendment of the Senator from Ohio.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Brownback and Mr. Santorum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3354.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n       Sec.  . No funds appropriated by this Act shall be \n     available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative \n     expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal \n     employees health benefit program which provides any benefits \n     or coverage for abortions.\n       Sec.  . The provision of section ___ shall not apply where \n     the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were \n     carried to term, or the pregnancy is the result of an act of \n     rape or incest.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an \namendment on behalf of myself, Senator Abraham, Senator Sessions, \nSenator Brownback, and Senator Santorum.\n  This is an amendment that would maintain in force--and let me \nemphasize that--would maintain in force the current law, the status \nquo. This amendment would remain and keep in force the current Federal \nlaw restricting Federal employee health insurance\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\ncoverage for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the \nlife of a mother.\n  This is the same amendment that was accepted by voice vote during the \ndebate for fiscal year 1998, the Treasury-Postal appropriations. This \nis the same amendment that was accepted by this body during the debate \nfor fiscal year 1996. And, in fact, this is the same language that has \nbeen consistently supported by a bipartisan group of Senators and \nRepresentatives from 1983 to 1998, with the exception of only 2 years. \nSo from 1983 to 1998, that has been the law of the land with the \nexception of only 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I mention this to you and to my colleagues to make it \nclear that this amendment stakes out no new ground. It merely confirms \nwhat the status quo is today, what this body and what the other body \nhave consistently voted in favor of.\n  The principle that we are dealing with today is a very simple one, \none that goes beyond the conventional pro-life, pro-choice boundaries. \nI think everyone in this Chamber knows that I am pro-life and, \ntherefore, wish to promote the value of protecting innocent human life.\n  I point out that the vast majority of Americans on both sides of the \nabortion issue--on both sides of the abortion issue--strongly agree \nthat they should not pay for someone else's abortion, and that is what \nwe are talking about today. Fairly stated, this amendment is not about \nabortion, it is not about the morality of abortion, or the right of \nwomen to choose abortions. This is a narrowly focused amendment that \nanswers a key question: Should taxpayers pay for these abortions?\n  Mr. President, Congress has consistently agreed that we should not \nask the taxpayers to promote a policy, in essence, of paying for \nabortion on demand for a Federal employee.\n  Again, this amendment would maintain the status quo. It limits \nFederal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of \nrape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother.\n  The vast majority of Americans oppose subsidizing abortions. That is \nclear. Employers, as a general principle, determine the health benefits \ntheir employees receive. Taxpayers are the employers of our Federal \nworkforce, and a large majority of taxpayers simply do not want their \ntax dollars to pay for these abortions. Taxpayers provide a substantial \nmajority share of the funds to purchase health insurance for the \nFederal civilian workforce. Over three-quarters of that premium on an \naverage is paid for by taxpayers.\n  This amendment addresses the same core issue. It simply says that the \nFederal Government is not in the business of funding abortions. \nAbortion is a contentious issue, and we simply should not ask taxpayers \nto pay for them.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been debated time and time and time \nagain on this floor. I will say the identical language has been debated \ntime and time and time again.\n  Everyone in this Chamber has voted on this issue. Current law limits \nabortion availability in Federal employee health care plans to cases, \nagain, of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. That is set \nin law. This has been the bipartisan position of the Senate and the \nbipartisan position of the House, and it has been approved by the \nPresident last year and the year before. We should not voluntarily take \nthe money of many Americans who find abortion wrong to pay for those \nabortions. We should not go against the will of the people of this \ncountry. We should uphold the current law, and that is what this \namendment would simply do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, for offering this important amendment.\n  This amendment will maintain in force the current law restricting \nFederal funding for abortions to cases of rape, incest, or life of the \nmother.\n  This amendment would leave in place the restriction on Federal \nEmployee Health Benefit Plans which prevents those plans from paying \nfor abortions except in the case of rape or incest, and when the life \nof the mother is in danger.\n  The principle here is simple: Should the taxpayers, regardless of \nwhether they are pro-life or not, be forced to pay for abortions?\n  Make no mistake about it, abortions provided under the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Program would be subsidized by the taxpayers. \nAlthough employees are charged for the health plan they elect, a \nsignificant portion of the cost of those plans is offset by the \nGovernment using taxpayer dollars.\n  Therefore, by participating in a health plan, employees who oppose \nabortion are effectively subsidizing abortions when they pay their \nhealth insurance premiums. If the major health plans all fall in line \nand start paying for abortions, employees who are morally opposed to \nabortion are put in a very difficult position.\n  There are millions of Americans, myself included, who feel very \nstrongly that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life. It is \nunconscionable to ask taxpayers to subsidize elective abortions.\n  Whatever your position on abortion is, this is one point we should \nall be able to agree on.\n  Congress has consistently agreed that we should not ask taxpayers to \npromote a policy, in essence, of paying for abortion on demand by a \nFederal employee.\n  This is the same amendment that was accepted by voice vote during the \ndebate for fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal Appropriations; accepted by \nthis body during the debate for fiscal year 1996; and in fact, this is \nthe same language that has been supported by a bipartisan group of \nSenators and Representatives from 1983 to 1998.\n  Madam President, I will just say this. People in this country can \ndisagree about the sensitive issue of abortion. The laws are as they \nare. Some people like them, some people don't like them. But with \nregard to the question of whether or not taxpayers ought to be required \nto fund abortions, this country and the law and the vote of almost \nevery State and this Congress has been not to fund that, and not to \ntake taxpayers' money from individuals who feel very, very deeply and \npersonally about this issue and expend that money to eliminate life. \nThat is not a choice that we believe this Congress ought to make. We \nought to prohibit it as part of this legislation. Maybe we won't even \nneed a vote on it. But if we do, so be it. I think it will pass again \nthis year, as it has.\n  Again, I appreciate the work of the Senator from Ohio for \nreestablishing this year this important principle.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the DeWine \namendment which would prohibit female federal employees from accessing \naffordable, safe and legal abortion related services as part of their \nhealth insurance benefits.\n  I am always tempted to say, ``here we go again.'' Another assault on \nwomen's health and another barrier for women to safe, affordable \nreproductive health services. For some of my colleagues, the 1973 \nlandmark Roe versus Wade decision was not clear enough or they continue \nto attempt to restrict a women's right guarantee in this decision.\n  Instead of standing up and arguing that a woman should not have \nchoices or that women should not be allowed to access safe, affordable \nreproductive health services, some of my colleagues hide behind the \nissue of federal funding.\n  Health benefits have been, and always will be for the benefit of the \nfederal employee. It is a form of compensation. Every worker knows that \nhealth insurance is part of their compensation package, not a gift, not \na loan, but something that they have earned. Health benefits are part \nof one's salary. This is no different for a federal employee or an \nemployee of Boeing.\n  We would never see an amendment on the floor of the Senate dictating \nto federal employees how they spend their salary. As long as the \nemployee spends this compensation on a legal commodity, we cannot \nrestrict his or her decisions. Simply because they are employed by the \nAmerican taxpayer does not mean that we can dictate how they spend \ntheir salary.\n   However, some of my colleagues are proposing to do just that. We are \ntelling female federal employees how they can or cannot spend their \nhealth insurance benefits. In addition to denying federal employees the \nbasic constitutional rights afforded every other\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\nwoman, we are proposing to dictate how they spend their compensation.\n  Not only are health benefits considered employee compensation earned \nby the employee, federal employees are also responsible for up to 40 \npercent of the cost of the premiums as well as any deductibles or \ncopays. So in fact we are telling female federal employees how to spend \ntheir take home pay as well.\n  If a federal employee uses his or her own salary to purchase a \nfirearm is this federal funding of handguns? I would argue no. Even \nthough there are federal taxpayers who oppose handguns, we do not \nrestrict the right of federal employees to use their federal salary to \npurchase one. But, telling female federal employees how they can spend \ntheir insurance benefits is just as offensive. Only in this case it is \nprobably more detrimental as it denies female federal employees access \nto safe, affordable reproductive health service.\n  One could argue that female federal employees should pay out of \npocket for certain reproductive health services and not depend on her \nhealth benefits to cover or provide this protection. I would like to \npoint out that federal employees by and large are not well paid CEOs. \nThey live pay check to pay check and many are single mothers. Covering \na $600 or $1,000 health care bill is just not possible. Economic \nbarriers are just as solid as legal or social barriers. Denying health \ninsurance coverage for a full range of reproductive health services, is \ndenying access to these services for many female federal employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts to make second class citizens \nof female federal employees. They deserve our support and they deserve \nto be treated with dignity and respect. Instead of attacking a woman's \nright to make her own personal health decisions let's work to prevent \nunintentional pregnancies. I urge my colleagues to support federal \nfamily planning programs and contraceptive equity. The Supreme Court \nhas already said that abortion with some restrictions is a legal right \nafforded all Americans. Let's not force federal employees to pay the \nprice of political football, but rather let's do more to improve access \nto safe, affordable family planning benefits.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator DeWine.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable \nfederal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion \nservices.\n  The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in \ncases of life endangerment, rape or incest. It would continue a ban \nwhich has prevented federal employees from receiving a health care \nservice which is widely available for private sector employees.\n  I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is an \nassault on the earned benefits of federal employees. Secondly, it is \npart of a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would \nendanger women's health.\n  We have seen vote after vote designed to roll back the clock on \nwomen's reproductive rights. Since 1995, there have been over 81 votes \nin the House and Senate on abortion-related issues. It's clear that \nthis unprecedented assault on a woman's right to decide for herself \nwhether or not to have a child is continuing, as this amendment \ndemonstrates.\n  Well, I support the right to choose. And I support federal employees. \nAnd that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment.\n  Let me speak first about our federal employees. Some 280,000 federal \nemployees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. \nThey are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go \nout on time. They make sure that our nation's veterans receive their \ndisability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding \ncures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and \nAlzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way \nby the hard work of a federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our \nsupport.\n  Instead, federal employees have suffered one assault after another in \nrecent years. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, as \ngovernment has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 federal jobs. \nTheir COLA's and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They \nhave faced the indignity and economic hardship of three government \nshutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with \ngovernment, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous \nservice they provide to our country and to all Americans.\n  I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful public \nservants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of federal \nemployees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to \nwhich all federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance \ncoverage are shared by the federal government and the employee.\n  I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for \nfederal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer \nfunding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about.\n  If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the \nban, we would prohibit federal employees from obtaining abortions using \ntheir own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the \ntaxpayers.\n  But no one is seriously suggesting that federal employees ought not \nto have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. \nAnd we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health \ninsurance federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Plan.\n  About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for \ntheir medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services \nis essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it \nmore difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the \nlikelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to \ncontinue a high-risk pregnancy.\n  If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions \nonly in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest, the 1.2 million \nwomen of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have \naccess to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We \nwill be replacing the informed judgement of medical care givers with \nthat of politicians.\n  Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close \nconsultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the \nbasis of medical judgement, not on the basis of political judgements. \nOnly a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and \nmake the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and \nhealth.\n  It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on \ninsuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular \nset of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply \nbelieve that women's health will suffer if we do so.\n  I believe it is time to quit attacking federal employees and their \nbenefits. I believe we need to quit treating federal employees as \nsecond class citizens. I believe federal employees should be able to \nreceive the same quality and range of health care services as their \nprivate sector counterparts.\n  Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support \nfederal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the \nDeWine amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the DeWine amendment, which will \ncurb the rights of women who work for the federal government to obtain \nabortion services through their health insurance. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Over one million women of reproductive age rely on the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program for their medical coverage. This \namendment will stop them from using their own insurance to exercise \ntheir right to choose an abortion. The exceptions in this ban are \ninadequate to protect the rights of women.\n  Women who are employed by the Federal Government work hard. They pay \nfor their health premiums out of their own pockets. They deserve the \nsame, full range of reproductive health benefits as women who work in \nthe private sector.\n  The question is: Should female federal employees or their dependents \nbe treated the same as other women in the work force, or should they be \ntreated differently, singled out, with their rights taken away from \nthem?\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\n  In 1993 and 1994, Congress voted to permit federal employees to \nchoose a health care plan that covered abortion. Unfortunately, this \nRepublican Congress over-turned that right.\n  This bill provides funding for the full range of health benefits \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. We should ensure \nthat these benefits remain in the bill by opposing this amendment.\n  Anti-choice forces are chipping away at the right of women in this \ncountry to obtain safe, legal abortions. They are making a woman's \nability to exercise that choice dependent on the amount of her paycheck \nand the employer who signs it. It's simply unjust.\n  If there were an amendment to stop a man who happens to work for the \nFederal Government from getting a perfectly legal medical procedure, \none that might protect his health, there would be an uproar on this \nfloor. People would say, how dare you do that to the men of this \ncountry? Why not treat the men who work for the Federal Government the \nsame way we treat men who work in the private sector?\n  Decisions about health care--including reproductive health care--\nshould be made by patients and their doctors--not by HMO bureaucrats or \npoliticians. Decisions about abortion are tough, personal, and private. \nWe need to trust women to make that choice.\n  Let's ensure that all federal employees have the rights, the \nprotections, and the healthcare coverage they deserve. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I am \ntruly sorry we have to address it every year.\n  The bill we passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee treats \nfederal employees just as private employees with health insurance \ncoverage are treated: they are permitted to join a health care plan \nthat covers a full range of reproductive health services, including \nabortion. The bill returns us to the policy that was in place before \nNovember of 1995. Currently, two-thirds of private fee-for-service \nhealth plans and 70% of HMOs provide abortion coverage.\n  Like so many of my colleagues, I support a woman's right to choose, \nand I support policies that will keep abortions legal, safe, and rare. \nI also support anyone's right not to participate in a health plan that \ncovers abortion, and federal employees can choose such plans under the \nbill as we passed it out of Committee.\n  Adding this amendment, and continuing the unfair policy of the past \nfew years, will impose real consequences, and real pain for government \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters that tell what these consequences were for two families of \nfederal workers.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Compounding A Tragedy: Congress Gives Medical Advice\n\n                                                September 6, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: I've been a federal employee for 13 years. My \n     husband and I were elated this summer when I became pregnant. \n     At age 36, I was in the ``advanced maternal age'' category, \n     so my insurance company, Kaiser Permanete offered us genetic \n     screening as routine pre-natal care. They didn't mention that \n     Congress had erased the option to terminate a pregnancy, even \n     on the advice of my physician.\n       I was scheduled for a sonogram at 14 weeks to make sure \n     we'd correctly estimated how far along I was. My husband, my \n     mother and my sister accompanied me to the ultrasound waiting \n     room because seeing this baby was a big event.\n       I realized something was odd when both the sonogram \n     technician and the radiologist spent so much time looking at \n     my baby's head. The radiologist had detected abnormalities \n     and recommended that only my husband be allowed in to see the \n     sonogram. The radiologist termed it severe hydrocephalus--we \n     saw an empty skull. A week later, the perinatologist at \n     Fairfax Hospital's Antenatal Testing Center gave an even \n     colder picture. She called it holoprosencephaly and said the \n     fetal development was incompatible with life. All of the \n     doctors I saw agreed there was no hope for the fetus, and \n     recommended terminating as soon as possible.\n       We were devastated. To compound the tragedy came the news \n     that as of January this year, companies insuring federal \n     workers are prohibited from covering abortions. I have since \n     learned that federal employees are the exception--coverage \n     for medically necessary abortions is provided for others by \n     my insurance company. In the end, we paid a very high fee to \n     have the abortion because the fetal anomaly made the \n     procedure more complicated.\n       My husband and I question whether Congress is implying we \n     were immoral for aborting this fetus and hoping to get \n     pregnancy with a healthy child. Our decision was no wanton or \n     frivolous; it was heartbreaking. My abortion was the day \n     before my 37th birthday, and each year I face a higher \n     probability of having to terminate another pregnancy because \n     of a genetic problem. Yet, we really want to raise a family \n     and will keep trying.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Susan Alexander and\n\n                                                 Christopher Durr,\n     Alexandria, VA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 10, 1997.\n       Dear Representative: My name is Kim Mathis.I live in \n     Talladega, Alabama with my husband who works at the Federal \n     prison in town. We are both covered under my husband's health \n     insurance plan for federal employees and their families.\n       In February of last year, we learned that I was pregnant. \n     During a routine appointment my doctor performed a standard \n     A.F.P. test. This is a test that they offer to check for \n     neural tube defects and other problems. About a month later, \n     my doctor told me that the test came back positive and he \n     wanted me to go to a specialist for more tests.\n       I immediately scheduled an appointment with the specialist. \n     During my exam, they performed an ultrasound and found that \n     my A.F.P. test results were elevated because I was carrying \n     twins.\n       My next appointment was in May. This time the doctor \n     studies the ultrasound for almost and hour. After the doctor \n     was finished, he wanted to talk with us privately. It was at \n     that time that I knew that something was wrong. He told us \n     that was an unusually rare pregnancy. He told me that my \n     twins, which were boys, suffered from Twin-to-Twin \n     Transfusion Syndrome. Both babies shared the same blood \n     vessels. Because of this, the baby on top was giving his \n     blood and water to the baby on the bottom. The smaller twin \n     was about one month smaller in size than the larger twin. The \n     doctor said the larger twin was growing too fast. He also \n     told us that the smaller twin did not have kidneys and his \n     heartbeat was very slow. At that time, he gave us a 20% \n     chance of one of the twins surviving the pregnancy.\n       After consulting with the doctor, my husband and I decided \n     that the best thing to do would be to end the pregnancy.It \n     was the hardest decision of my life.\n       After we made our decision our doctor asked us what kind of \n     insurance we had. My husband told him and the doctor informed \n     us that he had never had a problem with their coverage. When \n     we arrived home that evening, we looked in my husband's \n     benefit plan book for 1996 which plainly stated that ``legal \n     abortions'' were covered.\n       A few weeks after the termination we received the first \n     letter from our insurance company. The letter stated that our \n     claims were denied. After further inquiries we learned that \n     they denied our claims because Public Law 104-52 was enacted \n     on November 19, 1995 which limited federal employees health \n     benefits plans coverage of abortion.\n       By this time, the hospital was harassing us. They turned \n     our accout over to collections agency. We received countless \n     threating letters and telephone calls at work. In the \n     October, my husband and I were forced to file bankruptcy. Our \n     lives and financial future have been ruined.\n       I am writing this letter so you will know what happened to \n     us and so that you can change this law. Families like ours \n     should not have to go bankrupt in order to receive \n     appropriate medical care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kim Mathis.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. One had to abort a fetus with no brain. Not only did they \nhave the heartbreak of a failed pregnancy, but they also faced the high \nfinancial burden of a major operation not covered by insurance. The \nsecond letter tells of a family that had to abort non-viable twins. The \ncost of this complicated and necessary abortion bankrupted them.\n  I understand and respect the deeply held convictions of both sides in \nthe abortion debate. But it is not fair to allow our heated political \ndebate to do real harm to the people who work for the government. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Ohio came to the \nfloor, we were in the process of trying to get a time agreement on the \nDaschle amendment. I ask the Senator if he would mind laying his \namendment aside so we might finish the Daschle amendment as soon as we \nhear from the majority leader.\n  Mr. DeWINE. No objection.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3365\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Daschle amendment and ask that there be 20 minutes, equally \ndivided, prior to the motion to table, and I then be recognized to make \nthe motion to table and with no second-degree amendments in order prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the next 20 minutes, the floor would be open for \ndiscussion on the pending amendment, or Senators could speak on other \nissues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, while we are waiting, we are making \nprogress in reaching agreements on other amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the adjustment of status of certain Haitian \n                               nationals)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. Graham, \n     for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3368.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that will bring justice to \nthousands of Haitian nationals who fought for democracy and freedom \nagainst the greatest odds.\n  Last November, Congress passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act to protect those who fled Communism and oppression \nin Central America during the 1980s.\n  But while that legislation was a monumental step forward for \nfairness, it left one deserving group completely unprotected.\n  Just as brave Central Americans resisted tyranny in their native \ncountries, Haitians struggled to free themselves from oppression.\n  In fact, many Haitians seeking asylum in our country are here because \nthey challenged a regime that was wantonly violating basic human \nfreedoms.\n  Mr. President, these brave Haitians have suffered greatly for the \ncauses of freedom and democracy.\n  They should not be forced to endure serious disruptions in their life \nonce again.\n  Even though conditions in Haiti have improved greatly since 1994, \nAmnesty International reports that human rights abuses still occur.\n  As people who contribute mightily to the strength of our communities, \nthe Haitians living in the United States should not be forced to risk \nreturning to the scene of their prior persecution . . . to face the \npossibility that it might happen again.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan effort. Senators Mack and I--along \nwith the cosponsors of the bill I introduced last year, Senators \nKennedy, Abraham, Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Moynihan, Feinstein, Kerry of \nMassachusetts, Durbin, and Lautenberg--have joined together to ensure \nthat the Haitian people who have sought fairness and justice for so \nlong receive it in 1998.\n  We have the bipartisan support of leaders ranging from President \nClinton to Republicans like Jack Kemp and my Florida colleagues Ileana \nRos-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz Balart.\n  Mr. President, we have left no stone unturned in crafting this \nlegislation. We've asked for input from all sources.\n  Senator Abraham held a hearing on this bill in December of 1997. The \nbill was marked up and passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nApril 23, 1998.\n  I have personally met with Senator Lott and explained the importance \nof this legislation to my state of Florida.\n  Now we ask our Senate colleagues to take action. The 40,000 Haitian \nnationals in the United States face deportation in December if Congress \ndoes not act.\n  Our nation was built as a bastion of freedom and a haven for those \nfleeing oppression around the world. We embrace that heritage in this \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, our bill helps three groups of individuals--a total of \n40,000--adjust their status to legal residency.\n  Those who were paroled into the United States from Guantanamo Bay, \nafter careful screening by immigration personnel.\n  These individuals were flow to the United States for review because \ntheir asylum cases were deemed to be valid and credible.\n  Our bill also helps those who were not paroled from Guantanamo, but \nwho came to our nation and filed an application for asylum before \nDecember of 1995.\n  Finally, it reaches out to a small group of unaccompanied or orphaned \nHaitian children.\n  The members of each of these three groups are legally here in our \ncountry.\n  They have followed all the laws of our land. This legislation will \ngive them the chance to continue working here. It will help them as \nthey build small businesses. It will keep their U.S. citizen children \nin school.\n  Most importantly, it will keep their vibrant spirit and determined \nwork ethic alive in our cities and communities.\n  During our field hearing, I saw the problem that Haitians face \nthrough the eyes of a bright, young student. She couldn't come to the \nhearing because she was working at one of the two jobs she holds to pay \nher community college tuition. Alexandra Charles is eighteen years old.\n  She is an orphan who came to the United States when she was ten years \nold--after her mother was brutally murdered by Haitian military \nofficials.\n  She has over a dozen relatives in the United States who are legal \nresidents, but who are not closely related enough to be sponsors.\n  She has virtually no relatives left alive in Haiti.\n  Like many individuals in similar circumstances, Ms. Charles was \ngranted a suspension of deportation.\n  But this relief was withdrawn after the Board of Immigration Appeals \nruled that the 1996 immigration law retroactively affected cases like \nhers.\n  Alexandra's future in the United States looks bright.\n  She is a hard worker and a model student.\n  But without this legislation, our nation will lose the benefit of her \nspecial skills and her dedication to our community.\n  Alexandra is just one of the thousands of law-abiding, hard working \nindividuals who will not be allowed to pursue their valid asylum claims \ndue to the retroactive nature of our 1996 immigration law.\n  I ask for your help in this fight for justice and fairness.\n  Let us prove once again that our nation values those who put their \nlives on the line in the struggle for freedom and democracy.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Graham/Mack \nimmigration amendment to the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill. I \nstrongly believe that this amendment is the right thing to do for the \nHaitian community and that it is consistent with our treatment of \nsimilarly-situated immigrant groups.\n  I would like to provide the Senate with some background information \non what has led Senator Graham and me to introduce this amendment, a \nbrief explanation of the amendment, and the policy rationale behind the \namendment.\n  First of all, some legislative history on events leading up to the \nintroduction of this amendment. Last year, Senator Graham and I \nintroduced legislation which was intended to ease the transition into \nimplementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, otherwise known as IRAIRA. Our bill simply \nclarified that immigrants who were in the administrative pipeline for \nsuspension of deportation when IRAIRA was enacted would have their \ncases for suspension considered under the rules in\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nplace when they applied for suspension, not the new rules contemplated \nby IRAIRA. I was concerned with the unfairness of changing the rules on \npeople midstream.\n  While this bill was under consideration in the Senate, an agreement \nwas reached in the House of Representatives which gave even greater \nrelief to the Nicaraguan community--the ability to adjust to legal \npermanent resident status.\n  Once it was apparent that Nicaraguans would be granted the \nopportunity to adjust to legal permanent resident status, the Haitian \ncommunity made an attempt to be included in the relief. Although they, \ntoo, had a compelling case, it was not possible to include them in the \nfinal bill at that point in the negotiations. However, Senator Graham \nand I made a commitment to seek appropriate relief for the Haitians \nthis Congress, and received assurances from the Administration that \nthey would defer potential deportation decisions of the affected \nHaitians until after Congress had an opportunity to consider \nlegislative relief.\n  This amendment, identical in text to Senate bill 1504, which was \nreported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee, would provide \npermanent resident status to certain Haitians who fled Haiti after the \nAristide regime was toppled in a brutal military coup in 1991 and were \neither paroled into the country or applied for asylum by December 31, \n1995.\n  This amendment is more narrow than the legislation passed last year \nwhich gave permanent resident status to Nicaraguans, since the scope \nand number of people covered is much smaller. Under last year's bill, \nnearly every Nicaraguan in the United States before December 1, 1995 \nwas made eligible to adjust their status, approximately 150,000 people. \nOur amendment helps only a limited class of Haitians, estimated at \n30,000-40,000, who have sought the help of the United States in fleeing \npersecution. Let me emphasize that point again--this amendment is for \nthose who have actively sought U.S. help, not those who came illegally \nand sought to evade detection.\n  There are two different categories of Haitians involved. The first \ncategory are those paroled into the country after being identified as \nhaving a credible fear of persecution. Nearly all in this category, \napproximately 11,000 Haitians, were pre-screened at Guantanamo Bay and \nfound to meet a credible fear of persecution test. These 11,000 \nHaitians represent approximately 25% of those screened at Guantanamo, \nthe other 75% were returned to Haiti. The second category are those \nHaitians who have applied for asylum by December 31, 1995. In the case \nof those in the second category, they are people who have been caught \nin an asylum backlog not under their control and may have a difficult \ntime now, due to the passage of time, demonstrating a credible fear of \npersecution. In the meantime, they have put down roots in this country \nand are making positive contributions to their communities.\n  I am talking about a twenty-five year old woman, Nestilia Robergeau, \nwho fled Haiti, where she had been beaten and raped and her brother was \nmurdered. Even though she was screened into this country through \nGuantanamo in 1992, she is still waiting for an asylum interview. In \nthe meantime, she has graduated from high school and hopes to attend \ncollege to become a nurse. She works most days from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. \nto support herself and her teenage brother.\n  And then there is a little fourth grade girl in Miami, Florida, \nLouiciana Miclisse. Both of her parents were shot and killed in Haiti, \nand the only relative she has now is her Aunt Nadia, who came with her \nfrom Haiti. She wants to grow up to be a doctor. She has applied for \nasylum, but her case has still not been considered. Do we really want \nto send this child back to Haiti where she has no family? Is that what \nthis country is all about? I believe we are more compassionate than \nthat.\n  It's also important to mention that conditions in Haiti are not safe \nfor the return of these people. At an immigration subcommittee field \nhearing last December, the committee was informed that the Haitian \ngovernment has not yet established the civil institutions necessary to \nprotect these refugees from further retribution by those who \nperpetrated human rights crimes. In fact, it appears that these \ncriminals continue to operate with impunity.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, this amendment is consistent with our \ntreatment of similarly-situated immigrant groups. As Grover Joseph \nRees, former General Counsel of INS under President Bush, testified at \nthe subcommittee field hearing last December, it has been the rule \nrather than the exception that when a human rights emergency has led to \nthe admission of large numbers of parolees from a particular country, \nsuch refugees and others similarly situated have been subsequently \ngranted permanent residency through Congressional action. Congress has \ngranted permanent residence on this basis in the past to Hungarians, \nPoles, Soviets, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodians, Laotians, Cubans, and, \nmost recently, Nicaraguans. This action for the Haitians is entirely \nconsistent with our past treatment of similarly-situated groups from \nother countries.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do, and this is the right time \nto do it. The Haitians who are affected by this situation have been \nleft in limbo far too long. I urge my colleagues to support the Graham/\nMack amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nGraham, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham and our other distinguished \ncolleagues in supporting legislation to provide permanent residence to \nHaitian refugees. Last year Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment \nand Central American Relief Act, which enabled Nicaraguan and Cuban \nrefugees to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants. That \nlegislation also enables Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Eastern Europeans \nand nationals from the former Soviet Union to seek similar relief on a \ncase-by-case basis.\n  Haitian refugees deserve no less.\n  Haitians have seen their relatives, friends and neighbors jailed, or \nmurdered, or abducted in the middle of the night and never seen again. \nLike other refugees, they have fled from decades of violence and brutal \nrepression by the Ton Ton Macoutes, and later the military regime which \noverthrew the first democratically elected president of Haiti.\n  The Bush and Clinton Administrations found that the vast majority of \nthese refugees were fleeing from political persecution in Haiti. \nThousands of these Haitians were paroled into the United States after \nestablishing a credible fear of persecution. Many others filed bona \nfide applications for asylum upon arrival in the United States.\n  This legislation also includes a significant number of unaccompanied \nchildren and orphans who did not have the capacity to apply for asylum \nfor themselves. Senator Abraham and I proposed an amendment which was \napproved by the Senate Judiciary Committee to include these deserving \nchildren in this legislation.\n  This legislation concerns basic fairness. The United States has a \nlong and noble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the \nyears, we have enacted legislation to provide Hungarians, Cubans, \nYugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, and many \nother refugees with permanent protection from being returned to \nunstable or repressive regimes.\n  Last year, we adopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans, Cubans and \nothers, but, the Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. The \ntime has come for Congress to remedy this flagrant omission and add \nHaitians to the list of deserving refugees.\n  By approving this legislation, we can finally bring to an end the \nshameful decades of unjust treatment to Haitians. Throughout the 1980s, \nless than 2 percent of Haitians fleeing the atrocities committed by the \nDuvalier regimes were granted asylum. Yet, other refugee groups had \napproval rates as high as 75 percent. Haitian asylum seekers were \ndetained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, while asylum \nseekers from other countries were routinely released while their asylum \napplications were processed. Until recently, Haitians have been the \nonly group intercepted on the high seas and forcibly returned to their \nhome country, without even the opportunity to seek asylum.\n  Like other political refugees, Haitians have come to our country with \na strong love of freedom and a strong\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\ncommitment to democracy. They have settled in many parts of the United \nStates. They have established deep roots in their communities, and \ntheir children born here are U.S. citizens. Wherever they have settled, \nthey have made lasting contributions to the economic vitality and \ndiversity of our communities and the nation.\n  This legislation has strong bipartisan support. It is also supported \nby a range of nation-wide organizations, including the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the Church World Service, the American Baptist Churches, \nthe Mennonite Central Committee, the Council of Jewish Federations, the \nLutheran Immigration Refugee Service, the United Methodist General \nBoard of Church and Society, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and many, \nmany more.\n  We should do all we can to end this current flagrant discrimination \nunder the immigration laws. Haitians refugees deserve too--the same \nprotection we gave to Nicaraguans and Cubans last year. We need to pay \nmore than lip service to the fundamental principle of equal protection \nof the laws.\n  Finally, the amendment has been modified to resolve a budget problem, \ndeeming approximately 1000 Haitians ineligible for Supplemental \nSecurity Income and Medicaid. A similar budget concern was not raised \nlast year when the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief \nAct was considered. I am hopeful that this new injustice can be \nremedied as the Haitian legislation moves forward. I urge the Senate to \naccept this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This amendment is acceptable to both sides. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3368) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3369\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that a postage stamp should \n                  be issued honoring Oskar Schindler.)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. \n     Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 3369.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Since during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Oskar Schindler \n     personally risked his life and that of his wife to provide \n     food and medical care and saved the lives of over 1,000 Jews \n     from death, many of whom later made their homes in the United \n     States.\n       Since Oskar Schindler also rescued about 100 Jewish men and \n     women from the Golezow concentration camp, who lay trapped \n     and partly frozen in 2 sealed train cars stranded near \n     Brunnlitz;\n       Since millions of Americans have been made aware of the \n     story of Schindler's bravery;\n       Since on April 28, 1962, Oskar Schindler was named a \n     ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem; and\n       Since Oskar Schindler is a true hero and humanitarian \n     deserving of honor by the United States Government:\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Postal Service \n     should issue a stamp honoring the life of Oskar Schindler.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, this amendment has been cleared by \nboth sides. I urge its immediate adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3369) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Daschle \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3370\n\n(Purpose: To improve access to FDA-approved prescription contraceptives \n                              or devices)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Ms. Snowe, for \n     herself and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3370.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be expended by the Office of Personnel Management to enter \n     into or renew any contract under section 8902 of title 5, \n     United States Code, for a health benefits plan--\n       (1) which provides coverage for prescription drugs, unless \n     such plan also provides equivalent coverage for all \n     prescription contraceptive drugs or devices approved by the \n     Food and Drug Administration, or generic equivalents approved \n     as substitutable by the Food and Drug Administration; or\n       (2) which provides benefits for outpatient services \n     provided by a health care professional, unless such plan also \n     provides equivalent benefits for outpatient contraceptive \n     services.\n       (b) Nothing in this section shall apply to a contract with \n     any of the following religious plans:\n       (1) SelectCare.\n       (2) PersonalCare's HMO.\n       (3) Care Choices.\n       (4) OSF Health Plans, Inc.\n       (5) Yellowstone Community Health Plan.\n       (6) and any other existing or future religious based plan \n     whose religious tenets are in conflict with the requirements \n     in this Act.\n       (c) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``contraceptive drug or device'' means a drug \n     or device intended for preventing pregnancy; and\n       (2) the term ``outpatient contraceptive services'' means \n     consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical \n     services, provided on an outpatient basis and related to the \n     use of contraceptive methods (including natural family \n     planning) to prevent pregnancy.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Reid, to offer an amendment to the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill that will produce two critical results: It will \nprovide women who work for the federal government the equality in \nhealth care and the affordable access to prescription contraception \ncoverage they need and deserve; and it will help reduce the number of \nunintended pregnancies and abortions in this country.\n  The Snowe-Reid amendment says that if a health plan in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, provides coverage of \nprescription drugs and devices, they must also cover FDA-approved \nprescription contraceptives. It also provides that plans which already \ncover outpatient services also cover medical and counseling services to \npromote the effective use of those contraceptives.\n  That's it, Madam President. That's the extent and scope of the Snowe-\nReid amendment. It only prevents health plans in the FEHBP from carving \nout exceptions for FDA-approved prescription contraceptives that \nprevent pregnancy.\n  It does not cover abortion in any way, shape or form. It does not \ncover abortion related services such as counseling a woman to seek an \nabortion. And it does not require coverage of RU-486, because RU-486 is \nnot a method of contraception. Let me repeat, this amendment does not \nrequire coverage of RU-486.\n  The Snowe-Reid amendment also respects the rights of religious plans \nthat, as a matter of conscience, choose not to cover contraceptives. \nAgain, I want to make it clear that this amendment clearly exempts such \nplans.\n  Finally, the Snowe-Reid plan isn't going to break the bank or burden \nAmerican taxpayers. In fact, CBO has estimated that the cost to the \nfederal government would be less than $500,000, and under CBO's \npractice of scoring bills to the nearest million dollars, CBO stated: \n``this provision would have no effect on the budget totals in FY \n1999.''\n  So the Snowe-Reid amendment is a practical, common sense, cost \neffective approach to effecting the kind of public health policy that \nshould set an example for the rest of the nation's insurers to follow.\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\n  The need for this visionary measure is clear. Today, nearly 9 million \nFederal employees, retirees, and their dependents participate in the \nFEHBP. Fully 1.2 million are women of reproductive age who rely on \nFEHBP for all their medical needs. Unfortunately, the vast majority of \nthese women are currently denied access to the broad range of safe and \neffective methods of contraception.\n  In fact, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which \nadministers the FEHBP, 81 percent of plans do not cover all five of the \nmost basic and widely used methods of contraception and 10 percent of \nthese plans do not cover any type of contraception at all.\n  The ramifications of this are dramatic. When 8 out of 10 women \nenrolled in the FEHBP aren't covered for the leading methods of \ncontraception, their choices are unfairly limited. Who are we to pick \nand choose what method works best--or is most medically suited--for \neach individual woman?\n  The fact is, different women require different methods of \ncontraception due to a variety of factors. If there is only one method \nof contraception her plan offers, where does that leave her? And even \nmore to the point, why do we leave this decision to her health care \nplan, instead of her health care provider?\n  Across America, this lack of equitable coverage for prescription \ncontraceptives contributes to the fact that women today spend 68 \npercent more than men in health care costs. That's 68 percent. And this \ngap in coverage translates into $7,000 to $10,000 over a woman's \nreproductive lifetime.\n  So I ask my colleagues: with 25 percent of all Federal employees \nearning less than $25,000--and nearly 18,000 Federal employees having \nincomes below or slightly above the Federal poverty level--what do you \nthink is the likely effect of these tremendous added costs for these \nFederal employees?\n  Well, I'll tell you the effect it has: many of them simply stop using \ncontraceptives, or will never use them in the first place, because they \nsimply can't afford to. And the impact of those decisions on these \nindividuals and this nation is a lasting and profound one.\n  Women spend more than 90 percent of their reproductive life avoiding \npregnancy, and a woman who doesn't use contraception is 15 times more \nlikely to become pregnant than women who do. Fifteen times. And of the \n3.6 million unintended pregnancies in the United States, half of them \nwill end in abortion.\n  I can't think of anyone I know, no matter their ideology, party, or \ngender, who doesn't want to see the instances of abortion in this \nnation reduced. Well, imagine if I told you we could do something about \nit, and do it at almost no cost to the federal government.\n  That is what the Snowe-Reid amendment does. When the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute estimates that the use of birth control lowers the likelihood \nof abortion by a remarkable 85 percent, how can we ignore a provision \nlike the Snowe-Reid amendment that will make the use of birth control \nmore affordable to our Federal employees, and do so with negligible \ncost to the Federal government?\n  And yet, as thoughtful an approach as the Snowe-Reid amendment may \nseem, I know that there will still be some in this body who will argue \nagainst it. Well, I believe these arguments do not withstand scrutiny, \nand I would like to take just a few minutes to explain why.\n  Some may voice concern that the Snowe-Reid amendment requires \ncoverage of abortion of drugs that induce abortion, such as RU-486. To \nwhich I will reiterate, the Snowe-Reid amendment only requires coverage \nof FDA-approved methods of contraception--that means contraception to \nprevent pregnancy.\n  It is important to make it clear that we are only talking about \nmethods of contraception under this amendment. And I might add, methods \nof contraception which will reduce the number of abortions in this \ncountry--so the fact is--if you want to see fewer abortions performed \nin the United States, you should support this amendment.\n  When it comes to the incredibly personal issue of abortion we should \nbe celebrating common ground, not condemning it. This amendment \nachieves that goal. It does not pretend to settle the issue of abortion \nin America--far from it. It does, however, provide a rallying point for \nthose who want to see abortions reduced--all of us, I would think--and \nthat's the reason people like Senator Reid who is prolife, support it \non one side of the abortion debate and people like me on the other.\n  Some opponents may say that pregnancy isn't really a medical \ncondition, and therefore we shouldn't be requiring its coverage in the \nFEHBP. Obviously, anyone who says this hasn't been through pregnancy or \nchildbirth. If pregnancy isn't a medical condition, then I'd like to \nknow what is!\n  And in this day and age when prevention is the buzzword--as it should \nbe--how is it we can support prescription coverage to treat a variety \nof biological conditions but not to prevent one of the most dramatic \nand life-altering conditions of all?\n  Still others may argue, ``Pregnancy is a lifestyle choice, and \nshouldn't be covered like diseases that are not''. Such an argument \nsimply ignores reality as well as the facts.\n  As Luella Klein, the director of women's health issues at ACOG, put \nit: ``There's nothing `optional' about contraception. It is a medical \nnecessity for woman during 30 years of their lifespan. To ignore the \nhealth benefits of contraception is to say that the alternative of 12 \nto 15 pregnancies during a woman's lifetime is medically acceptible.''\n  Of course, we shouldn't be too surprised at the attitude of our \nopponents. Indeed, it wasn't until 1978--only twenty years ago--that \nCongress passed a law requiring that maternity benefits be covered like \nany other medical care. Before we passed the Pregnancy Discrimination \nAct, 43 percent of insurance policies didn't include coverage of \nmaternity care. Sound familiar?\n  So here we are, twenty years later, battling some of the same \ninsurance companies that in 1978 didn't want to provide the same \ncoverage we now take for granted. How can they still not cover the \nmeans to prevent what they already acknowledge through existing \ncoverage as a medical condition?\n  The fact is, all methods of contraception are cost effective when \ncompared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. And with unplanned \npregnancies linked to higher rates of premature and low-birth weight \nbabies, costs can rise even above and beyond those associated with \nhealthy births.\n  As the American Journal of Public Health estimates, the cost under \nmanaged care for a year's dose of birth control pills is less than one-\ntenth of what it would cost for prenatal care and delivery.\n  So the question, then, is not ``How can we afford to expand coverage \nto prescription contraceptives?'' but ``How can we afford not to?''\n  No, the cost argument doesn't hold water, Mr. President, and neither \ndo any of the other arguments. The bottom line is, the Snowe-Reid \namendment makes sense from a standpoint of fairness, from the \nstandpoint of compassion, from the standpoint of cost effectiveness and \nfrom the standpoint of good public health policy.\n  Maybe that's why the concept is supported by such diverse groups as \nthe American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive \nMedicine, the American Medical Women's Association, and the Society for \nAdolescent Medicine.\n  Whatever the reason, as an employer and model for the rest of the \nnation, the federal government should provide equal access to this most \nbasic health benefit for women. This amendment would allow federal \nemployees to have that option, one already provided an option for \ncontraceptives through the Medicaid program. Why shouldn't the same \nfederal commitment be extended to women employed by the federal \ngovernment?\n  In closing, Madam President, let me say that if we, as a nation, are \ntruly committed to reducing abortion rates and increasing the quality \nof life for all Americans, then we need to begin focusing our attention \non how to prevent unintended pregnancies. The Snowe-Reid amendment is a \nsignificant step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to thank Senators Snowe and\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\nReid, for offering this important amendment today. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the Snowe amendment. I am also proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Snowe-Reid bill on which this amendment is based.\n  This amendment is about two things--it's about equity and it's about \nwomen's health.\n  The Snowe amendment would help to narrow the gender gap for women in \ninsurance plans. What it does it really is quite simple. It requires \nthat any health plan for federal employees that covers prescription \ndrugs must also cover prescription contraceptives.\n  Federal Employee Health Benefit plans routinely cover prescription \ndrugs. But they routinely discriminate against women by not including \nprescription contraceptives. In fact, 81% of the plans under FEHBP fail \nto cover all five of the leading types of contraceptives. Ten percent \noffer no coverage at all.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am \nproud that so many of them call Maryland their home. They work hard in \nthe service of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's \nfighting for fair COLAs, against disruptive and harmful shutdowns of \nthe federal government, or fighting to prevent unwise schemes to \nprivatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can \ncount on me.\n  Today, I am fighting for equity in health insurance coverage for \nfederal employee women. The failure of the majority of federal health \nplans to cover all forms of prescription contraceptions results in \nunfair physical and financial burdens for women. It forces women of \nreproductive age to spend 68% more for out-of-pocket health care costs \nthan men.\n  This amendment would help to correct that inequity. That is one \nreason why I so strongly support it.\n  I also support the Snowe amendment because it will help to safeguard \nwomen's health. As a member of the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, I have worked hard for women's health. Whether it was \nestablishing the Office of Women's Health Research at NIH, fighting for \ninclusion of women in clinical trials, or ensuring that women receive \nsafe and accurate mammograms through the Mammography Quality Standards \nAct, I have fought to make sure that women's health needs are met.\n  Contraception is a part of basic health care for women. This \namendment will ensure that federally-employed women will have the tools \nthey need to plan their families, to avoid unintended pregnancies and \nto reduce the need for abortion.\n  Access to family planning is one of the most important issues facing \nwomen today. Family planning improves maternal and child health. We \nknow that unwanted pregnancies are associated with lower birth weight \nbabies and jeopardize maternal health. They also too often put a young \nwoman's future academic and personal achievement in jeopardy. When the \nresources are available to help women make good, responsible choices \nabout parenthood and their futures, we have no excuse for not making \nthose tools available.\n  I am proud that my own state of Maryland has been a leader in this \narea. Earlier this year, Maryland became the first state in the nation \nto require insurers that cover prescription drugs to also cover FDA-\napproved prescription contraceptives. Maryland has once again shown \nitself to be on the leading edge of progressive health care policy.\n  Today, the Senate has an opportunity to take the first steps in \nfollowing Maryland's example. We can adopt the Snowe amendment. We can \nensure that women in the federal workforce have equitable access to \nprescription contraceptions.\n  I hope we will adopt this amendment today. And I hope we will bring \nto the floor soon the Snowe-Reid bill to ensure that all insurance \nplans that cover prescription drugs include contraceptive drugs and \ndevices in that coverage.\n  Ms. MURRAY. Madam. President, I want to thank the sponsor of this \nimportant amendment for all his work and effort on behalf of women's \nhealth. As a Senator who has long championed women's health issues and \nfought to protect women's health, I commend him for his efforts. I am \npleased to join with him today in support of women's health equity.\n  There has been a great deal of debate lately regarding contraceptive \nequity. Let me first start by explaining what this amendment does not \ndo. It does not mandate benefits. Let me repeat that, this is not a \nmandate. If a plan does not have a prescription drug benefit then they \ndo not have to add contraceptives. If a plan has a copy of deductible \nfor prescription benefits, then contraceptives would also have the same \ncopy or deductible. If a plan requires payments or deductibles for \nsurgical services, then family planning benefits would also have the \nsame copayments and deductibles. This is not a mandate. It simply says \nthat plans cannot treat contraceptives any differently than medication \nto treat high blood pressure or to treat diabetes.\n  This amendment does not increase federal spending. CBO has scored \nthis amendment as having a minimal effect on spending. The cost is such \nthat CBO cannot even estimate as it falls below their threshold for \ncalculating or determining budgetary impact. I would argue that in fact \nit will have a positive impact on spending. Currently, 50 percent of \nall pregnancies in this country are unintentional. Increasing access to \nsafe, affordable family planning can only reduce this number. The \naverage cost annually of oral contraceptives is estimated at $400 to \n$500. The cost of an uncomplicated delivery is close to $4,000, this \nexcludes any prenatal or postnatal care. It does not take a budgetary \nexpert to conclude that there will actually be savings from this \namendment.\n  This amendment is also not about abortion. Let me make this very \nclear. This is not an abortion debate. No part of this amendment would \nrequire federal funding of abortions. It simply goes to those \ncontraceptives that are currently approved by the FDA to prevent \nunintentional pregnancies. RU486 is not currently available in the \nUnited States. No plan would be required to cover RU486. If you ask any \nwoman if there is a difference between abortion and contraceptives I \ncan assure you that the answer would be yes.\n  Now let me tell you all what this amendment does. This amendment goes \nto the heart of women's health. Reproductive health and effective \nfamily planning are women's health issues. It is hard to go a week \nwithout hearing one of my colleagues talk about the importance of \nwomen's health. There are probably well over 500 pieces of legislation \npending that impact women's health. Every member strives to have a \nsolid record on women's health issues. Every member claims to be a \nchampion of women's health. Yet denying access to safe, affordable \ncontraceptives for federal employees poses a serious threat to women's \nhealth. On average, without effective, safe family planning, most women \ncould expect to endure 12 to 13 pregnancies in her life time. While \nmost women have safe and healthy pregnancies, for some it still can be \nlife threatening. And for most women 12 or 13 pregnancies does pose a \nserious health threat.\n  In order to protect women's health and reduce infant mortality it is \ncritical to plan for pregnancy. To place economic barriers for women to \nreceive safe family planning services is to place a significant health \nburden upon us.\n  Many women may not even be aware, but women can expect to pay up to \n68 percent more in out of pocket health care costs than men. Ask any \nwoman if she is willing to pay 68 percent more for housing, or food or \ntransportation and I can assure you the answer would be a resounding \nno. But, for health care this is actually what women face. I stand \ntoday to say we must reverse this trend. We already know that women can \nexpect to earn 71 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Now we want \nto say that they should pay 68 percent more for health care or for any \nconsumer product.\n  This is a basic question of equity and fairness. This is even more \nevident in the federal work force. By and large the federal work force \nis younger and paid less than the private sector. Effective family \nplanning is even more essential in a younger work force. Many federal \nemployees who live pay check to pay check. Yet, female federal \nemployees have no guarantee that their insurance will not discriminate \nagainst them. If there is a health care benefit\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nprogram that should offer a wide range of affordable reproductive \nhealth benefits, I would argue it must be the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan.\n  There are some of my colleagues who will argue it should be up to the \nplan or even some who will argue that Members of Congress should decide \nwhat methods of family planning are covered. It is these very Members \nof Congress who also argue that only the physician and patient should \nbe making health care decisions. Not health plans or politicians. I \nurge my colleagues to think very carefully about who they want making \nlife and death health care decisions. I would hope that my colleagues \nwould concur that only physicians and the patient should be making \nthese decisions. This is why the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists endorses this amendment. They know how dangerous it is to \nmake life or death decisions based solely on economics or other \narbitrary criteria.\n  Economic barriers and discriminatory insurance practices do threaten \nwomen's health. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \ndetermined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if \nall women not desiring pregnancy used contraceptives.'' With one action \nwe could be reducing our tragic infant mortality rate in this country. \nThe Institutes of Medicine's Committee on Unintended Pregnancy \nrecommended that ``financial barriers to contraception be reduced by \nincreasing the proportion of all health insurance policies that cover \ncontraceptive services and supplies.'' As the largest purchaser of \nprivate health insurance in this country, the Federal Government should \nset the example for the private market. We should listen to the \nevidence of the medical community and research scientists and tear down \neconomic barriers within the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan.\n  I urge my colleagues to let women and their doctors decide, not \npoliticians and certainly not economics. Having access to the most \nappropriate family planning method without economic sanctions is a \nwomen's health issue. Each woman must have the ability to make this \ndecision based on the recommendations of her doctor. To most women, \nthis is a major women's health vote. This is a question of equity and \nfairness but more importantly it is an issue of access to safe, \naffordable reproductive health care services.\n  How would any Member of this body feel if we found out that our \ninsurance policies would only provide access to one form of high blood \npressure medication, regardless of the side effects? How would we react \nif a plan operating in the FEHBP said that they would charge a higher \ncopayment for prescription drugs to treat heart ailments? How we would \nrespond to these discriminatory practices that threaten quality, \naffordable health care for FEHBP participants? I can tell you how this \nmember would respond. I would be on the floor offering amendments to \nend discriminatory insurance practices that result in nothing more than \neconomic sanctions that diminished access to safe health care services.\n  We owe our federal employees more and we should be a leader on \nwomen's health. I urge my colleagues to vote for women's health instead \nof just talking about it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I urge the Senate to approve the \namendment by Senator Snowe and Senator Reid to provide fairness in \nprescription coverage for family planning.\n  The provisions of this amendment will benefit millions of American \nwomen by helping to make the cost of preventing unintended pregnancy \nmore affordable. They will also help to reduce the number of unintended \npregnancies by providing women with greater access to a broad range of \nsafe and effective family planning services.\n  Too often, insurance companies refuse to cover these costs. Only a \nthird of all private health plans currently cover oral contraceptives--\nthe most widely used prescription method of family planning. According \nto a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, nearly half of all large-\ngroup plans do not cover such prescriptions--despite the fact that 97 \npercent of traditional fee-for-service plans routinely cover \nprescriptions for other medicines and medical devices. In a recent \ncolumn in the Washington Post, David Broder called this lack of \ncoverage ``one of the great stupidities in the health care system.''\n  The result in that women are too often forced to rely on family \nplanning without the full range of available methods. Women pay 68 \npercent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs--in large part \nbecause of the high cost of preventing unintended pregnancies. As Ellen \nGoodman noted in a column in The Boston Globe, ``Some women are making \nhard economic choices between paying their bills and buying pills.''\n  Too often, women are forced to settle for the family planning method \nthat is most affordable, rather than the one that is most effective. \nInevitably, many of them are forced to settle for no method at all. The \nresult is large numbers of unintended pregnancies each year, and large \nnumbers of abortions. Clearly, greater access to reliable methods of \nbirth control will substantially reduce the number of abortions.\n  In the United States, it is estimated that half of all pregnancies \neach year are unintended. Three million women use no method of birth \ncontrol, and they account for half of all unintended pregnancies. \nGreater access to insurance coverage will significantly reduce this \nnumber. As an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health points \nout: ``Contraception is the keystone in the prevention of unintended \npregnancy.''\n\n  The vast majority of women who use some form of birth control do not \nhave insurance coverage to defray the cost. Often, they are forced to \nchoose inexpensive methods with high failure rates. The proposal by \nSenator Snowe and Senator Reid is an important step in the right \ndirection. It requires private insurance companies to cover FDA-\napproved, prescription birth control drugs and devices in a manner \ncomparable to all other prescription drugs and devices.\n  Just as more effective birth control means fewer unintended \npregnancies and fewer abortions, it also means more savings in health \ncosts. An April, 1995 study in the American Journal of Public Health \nestimated that women who use prescription contraceptives will avoid far \nmore in other health costs than the cost of the prescriptions.\n  According to the Guttmacher Institute, the increased cost to \nemployers who provide this coverage to their employees would be $17.00 \na person per year. That's an increase of just one-half-of-one percent \nover current costs per employee.\n  This bill is sound public policy. It is supported by all major family \nplanning organizations and by the vast majority of the American people. \nIn surveys, 75 percent of Americans express support for increasing \naccess to family planning services. And, 73 percent of survey \nrespondents continue to be supportive, even if contraceptive coverage \nmodestly increases their insurance premiums.\n  Support for increasing this coverage clearly crosses party lines. It \nis sound public policy that has been too long in coming. I urge the \nSenate to approve it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, over the past few years we have become \nincreasingly aware of the need to improve women's health. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 766, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and \nContraceptive Coverage Act and am proud to support Senators Snowe and \nReid today in their amendment to ensure contraception coverage for all \nwomen covered by the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.\n  I held a hearing on this issue in the committee on Labor and Human \nResources on July 21, 1998, and am pleased to see interest in and \nsupport for this issue growing. It has been too long in coming, but I \nam glad to have the opportunity to be part of providing equity in \nhealth care for women. I look forward to the day when all American \nwomen will enjoy the same equity in coverage this amendment provides to \nwomen employed by the federal government.\n  Out-of-pocket health care expenses for women are 68 percent higher \nthan those for men, and most of the difference is due to noncovered \nreproductive health care. It is disturbing how rapidly some insurance \nplans began covering Viagra when it has taken so\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\nlong for many of them to begin covering contraceptives. This bill helps \nachieve gender equity in health benefits, and its passage would be a \nvictory for women across the Nation.\n  ``EPIC'' provides that if a health insurance plan covers benefits for \nother FDA-approved prescription drugs or devices, it also must cover \nbenefits for FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs or devices. \nFurther, ``EPIC'' provides that if the plan covers benefits for other \noutpatient services provided by a health care professional, it also \nmust cover outpatient contraceptive services.\n  The bill does not require special treatment of prescription \ncontraceptives or outpatient contraceptive services compared to other \nprescription drugs or outpatient care.\n  Each year more than half of all pregnancies in the United States--\napproximately 3.6 million pregnancies--are unintended, and almost half \nof all unintended pregnancies end in abortion. Reducing unintended \npregnancies by making effective contraception more widely available \nwould reduce the need for abortion. For that reason, surveys suggest \nthat most people favor increasing coverage of contraception by health \ninsurance plans.\n  The vast majority of private insurers cover prescription drugs, but \nmany exclude coverage for prescription contraceptives. In contrast to \nthe lack of coverage for reversible contraception, most plans do cover \nabortion and sterilization.\n  The gender equity issue has been highlighted recently by the \nwillingness of many health insurance plans to cover Viagra. A Kaiser \nFamily Foundation national survey on insurance coverage of \ncontraception conducted in May of this year demonstrated that 75 \npercent of Americans 18 years and older supported coverage of \ncontraception, but only 49 percent supported coverage of Viagra.\n  The Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) has estimated that \nthe extra cost to employers who do not now cover reversible medical \nmethods of contraception is about $16 per employee per year--or less \nthan one percent of current health care premiums.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to express my support \nfor the amendment offered by Senators Snowe and Reid.\n  I applaud the efforts of these two Senators in bringing to our \nattention the inequities that exist for men and women in federal health \ncare plans.\n  Most federal employee health care plans (FEHBP) cover a wide range of \nprescription drugs without covering prescription contraceptive drugs. \nIn fact, almost all federal insurance plans fail to cover all five of \nthe most widely used forms of contraception. Ten percent have no \ncoverage of contraception at all.\n  A health care plan's refusal to cover contraception is effective \ndiscrimination against women. Access to contraception should be a basic \nhealth benefit for female federal employees. And women should be able \nto choose the best method of contraception for them, depending on their \nmedical history and personal health care needs.\n  If adopted, this amendment will certainly help lower the rate of \nunintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. That result is \nsomething positive on which we can all agree.\n  The Federal Government should be conscientious and fair about how it \ntreats its employees. It should be a model for private insurance plans, \nguiding them to provide the best health care possible for those who \nenroll in government-sponsored plans. Not allowing access to a full \nrange of contraceptive services to the women who work in our own Senate \noffices, to the civilian employees in the Pentagon, to FBI and DEA \nagents, and to the female officers on the Capitol Police Force, to name \na few examples, is unfair and essentially creates a two-tiered health \ncare system for public and private sector employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I strongly support my colleague's \namendment to require Federal Employee Health Benefits plans to treat \nprescription contraceptives the same as all other covered drugs. This \namendment is critical to improving both equity and health care for \nfederal employees.\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits plans should be a model for \nhealth insurance coverage for all Americans. Unfortunately, they fall \nfar short when it comes to reproductive health. Ten percent of Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits plans have no coverage for contraception. 81 \npercent of plans do not cover the range of contraceptive care for \nwomen, including the most commonly used reversible contraceptives, \nincluding (oral contraceptives, diaphragm, IUD, Depo-Provera, and \nNorplant.\n  This is an issue of gender equity. Women spend 68 percent more in \nout-of-pocket costs for health care than men. Much of this difference \nis due to reproductive health costs. For many women, contraceptives \ncost an additional $400 or more each year. By passing this amendment, \nwe can take an important step toward eliminating this economic \ndisparity.\n  I note with some concern that this amendment allows certain plans to \nexempt themselves from complying with this requirement. This exemption \nwill limit the scope of these gains for American women. It was my hope \nthat we could ensure contraceptive parity for all, not some.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to pursue that aim, but I \nacknowledge that effort must be left for another day.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this amendment, ``yes'' for \nequity, and ``yes'' for the reproductive health of our Federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. It would require Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) \nplans that cover prescription drugs to also cover FDA approved \nprescription contraceptives. This same amendment was included in the \nHouse version of our bill by a vote of 239-183.\n  The issue of family planning should be one that brings together both \nsides of the abortion debate. Close to half of all pregnancies in the \nUnited States are unintended, and tragically, those unintended \npregnancies often lead to abortion. By providing federal workers with \nthe most appropriate and safe means of contraception, we can reduce the \nnumber of abortions performed and increase the number of children who \nare born wanted, planned for, and loved.\n  I thank Senators Reid and Snowe for their leadership on this issue, \nand I hope the Senate follows the House's lead and gives this amendment \nour overwhelming support.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this amendment will help to create gender \nequity in health care, will provide for healthier mothers and children, \nwill lower the rate of abortion and it will cost the government \nnothing--in fact it may save money.\n  We can do all of this requiring the Federal Employee Health Benefits \n(FEHB) plans to cover prescription contraception just as they cover \nother prescriptions.\n  Currently, women of reproductive age spending 68 percent more in out \nof pocket health costs than men.\n  The proposed amendment would require FEHB plans to treat prescription \ncontraceptives the same as all other cover drugs. In so doing, it would \nhelp to achieve parity between the benefits offered to male \nparticipants in FEHB plans and those offered to female participants, \nthere by narrowing the gender gap in insurance coverage.\n  The vast majority of FEHB plans offer prescription drug coverage, but \nfail to cover the full range of prescription contraceptions.\n  I have said it many times now, but I believe if men were the ones who \nneeded prescription contraceptives, I have no doubt they would have \nbeen covered by insurance years ago.\n  the FEHB Program should be the model for private plans. the United \nStates Government, as an employer, should provide basic health benefits \nfor women and families insured through FEHB.\n  Eight-one percent of FEHB plans do not cover all five leading \nreversible methods of contraception. (Oral contraceptives, diaphram, \nIUD's, Norplant and Depo-Provera)\n  Ten percent of FEHB plans have no coverage of contraceptives--they do \nnot cover any of the five leading methods.\n  Women should be receiving health care coverage equal to the coverage \nthat every man receives from the federal employee health care benefits\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\nplan--which is probably a majority of the male Senators in this \nchamber.\n  Contraceptive services also help to promote healthy pregnancies and \nhealthy birth outcomes. A study of 45,000 women suggests that women who \nused family planning services in the 2 years before conception were \nmore likely to receive early and adequate prenatal care.\n  The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality estimated that 10 \npercent of infant deaths could be prevented if all pregnancies were \nplanned; in 1989 alone, 4000 infant lives could have been saved.\n  Now, we have all gone through the long abortion debates on this \nfloor. they are heated passionate debates.\n  Senator Snowe and I come from opposite sides of that debate. I am \npro-life. Senator Snowe is pro-choice. But we have one thing in common \nregarding this issue: We both believe that abortions are to be avoided \nand that the number that occur in this country every year needs to be \nreduced.\n  How do we reduce the number of abortions? We reduce the number of \nunintended pregnancies by providing women with the means to acquire \nbirth control.\n  Contraceptive help couples plan wanted pregnancies and reduce the \nneed for abortion. There are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in this \nNation each year--about 60 percent of all pregnancies. And almost half \nof these unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n  I have a chart here that shows as the unintended pregnancy rate \ndrops, so does the number of abortions.\n  From 1981 to 1987 the unintended pregnancy rate dropped by about 1 \npercent and the abortion rate also slightly dropped. the unintended \npregnancy rate dropped 8.8 percent from 1987 to 1994, and the abortion \nrate per 1000 women during those years dropped from 24 to 20. Given \nthis trend, I think it would be wise to do whatever we can to speed up \nthe drop in unintended pregnancies.\n  The cost effectiveness of family planning is well documented. Studies \nindicate that in the private sector, for every dollar invested in \nfamily planning, between $4 and $14 are saved in health care and \npregnancy related costs.\n  CBO has estimated that this amendment will cost less than $500,000. \nUnder CBO's practice of scoring bills to the nearest million dollars \nthis provision would have no effect on the budget total in fiscal year \n1999.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3371 to Amendment No. 3370\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a rule of construction relating to coverage)\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3371 to amendment No. 3370.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued to read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following new \n     subsection:\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require \n     coverage of abortion or abortion related services.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3365\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, as I stated earlier today, I am a strong \nproponent of fixing the marriage penalty. it is a top priority of the \nFinance Committee in our efforts to reform the Tax Code. But it must be \ndone properly. And such is not the case with this amendment--nor with \nthe amendment proposed this morning. As I said this morning, the bill \non which my colleagues are trying to attach marriage penalty \nlegislation is an appropriations bill. It is not a tax bill.\n  As this Treasury-Postal appropriations bill is not a revenue \nmeasure--and as all revenue measures must originate in the House of \nRepresentatives--this one amendment could subject the entire bill to a \nblue slip. In other words, Madam President, adding a revenue measure \nthat originates in the Senate to a nonrevenue bill, will sink the \nentire bill. Under the rules, any member in the House can raise an \nobjection and kill this appropriations bill. And that is in no one's \ninterest.\n  So while I agree in principle with the objective of reforming the \nmarriage penalty--I would be remiss in my duties if I did not make it \nclear that passing this amendment at this time is inappropriate. \nWhether the marriage penalty fix is paid for, or not, it must be \nhandled in Congress as the Constitution requires. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, with regret, I must oppose Senator \nDaschle's amendment to provide for marriage tax penalty relief. \nAlthough I support the idea of a revenue-neutral solution to the \ninequitable situation created by the Internal Revenue Code for millions \nof married couples, an appropriations bill is not the proper forum for \ndebating and voting on resolution of this matter. To attach this \namendment to this bill would violate the constitutional requirement \nthat revenue measures originate in the House, and it would kill this \nimportant appropriations legislation.\n  I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, that the issue of the marriage penalty should first be \nconsidered by the Finance Committee and proceed to the floor in the \nmanner normally associated with tax legislation. I look forward to \nworking with him, and all the members of the committee in coming to a \nbipartisan agreement on a measure that provides relief to taxpayers \nsaddled with the marriage penalty and is properly offset under the \nbudget rules.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I further call for the regular order \nwith respect to the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I further tell Members, the majority side yields back \nall time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remains on the minority side for \nthis amendment, controlled by the minority leader or his designee. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Daschle amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \nDaschle amendment?\n  Mr. REID. And, if necessary, the DeWine amendment, which is next in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \nDaschle amendment and the DeWine amendment? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3370, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on the Snowe-Reid amendment which is now \npending, on page 2 of the amendment, line 3, the word ``all'' is \nlisted. I would like to modify my amendment and delete the word \n``all.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request? \nWithout objection the amendment will be modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3370), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be expended by the Office of Personnel Management to enter \n     into or renew any contract under section 8902 of title 5, \n     United States Code, for a health benefits plan--\n       (1) which provides coverage for prescription drugs, unless \n     such plan also provides\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\n     equivalent coverage for prescription contraceptive drugs or \n     devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or \n     generic equivalents approved as substitutable by the Food and \n     Drug Administration; or\n       (2) which provides benefits for outpatient services \n     provided by a health care professional, unless such plan also \n     provides equivalent benefits for outpatient contraceptive \n     services.\n       (b) Nothing in this section shall apply to a contract with \n     any of the following religious plans:\n       (1) SelectCare.\n       (2) PersonalCare's HMO.\n       (3) Care Choices.\n       (4) OSF Health Plans, Inc.\n       (5) Yellowstone Community Health Plan.\n       (6) and any other existing or future religious based plan \n     whose religious tenets are in conflict with the requirements \n     in this Act.\n       (c) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``contraceptive drug or device'' means a drug \n     or device intended for preventing pregnancy; and\n       (2) the term ``outpatient contraceptive services'' means \n     consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical \n     services, provided on an outpatient basis and related to the \n     use of contraceptive methods (including natural family \n     planning) to prevent pregnancy.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3365\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order brings back the amendment by \nSenator Daschle. The time is being charged against the amendment on the \nminority side. All time has been yielded back on the majority side.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I have been asked to yield back the rest \nof our time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back on both sides.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. On behalf of the majority leader, I move to table the \nDaschle amendment. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nDaschle.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3372.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GRAINS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) importation of grains into the United States at less \n     than the cost to produce those grains is causing injury to \n     the United States producers of those grains;\n       (2) importation of grains into the United States at less \n     than the fair value of those grains is causing injury to the \n     United States producers of those grains;\n       (3) the Canadian government and the Canadian Wheat Board \n     have refused to disclose pricing and cost information \n     necessary to determine whether grains are being exported to \n     the United States at prices in violation of United States \n     trade laws or agreements.\n       (B) Requirements.--\n       (1) The Customs Service, consulting with the United States \n     Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce, shall \n     conduct a study of the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     requiring that all spring wheat, durum or barely imported \n     into the United States be imported into the United States \n     through a single port of entry.\n       (2) The Customs Service, consulting with the United States \n     Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce, shall \n     determine whether such spring wheat, durum and barley could \n     be imported into the United States through a single port of \n     entry until either the Canadian Wheat Board or the Canadian \n     Government discloses all information necessary to determine \n     the cost and price for all such grains being exported to the \n     United States from Canada and whether such cost or price \n     violates any law of the United States, or violates, is \n     inconsistent with, or denies benefits to the United States \n     under, any trade agreement.\n       (3) The Customs Service shall report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations and Finance not later than ninety days after \n     the effective date of this act on the results of the study \n     required by subsections (1) and (2), above.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment asks the Customs Service \nto conduct a study regarding Canadian wheat. It has been agreed to by \nboth sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3372) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we are not making very good progress on \nthis bill. We have only cleared 14 amendments and we have yet to deal \nwith 43. I just say to all of the Senators that this is our second day. \nWe have been in here since 9:30 this morning. I urge them to help us \nexpedite the process of dealing with these outstanding 43 amendments. \nIt may be a very long evening and into the day tomorrow if we don't \nstart clearing some of them. So I ask the Senators are watching the \nproceedings to come to the floor and help us move these forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ellen Brown \nof my staff be allowed floor privileges for the duration of the \ndiscussion of the amendment that I am about to bring up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we brought up yesterday amendment No. \n3353 to the bill. Senator Harkin had a situation he had to attend to \nyesterday, so we set it aside for the consideration of other business. \nNow Senator Harkin is here. I think he will be joining us momentarily. \nWe wanted to take advantage of the opportunity at this time to bring it \nup. I have been discussing this item with Senator Harkin to see if we \ncould reach an agreement. I don't believe that we are going to be able \nto.\n  Just basically, in summary, Mr. President, this has to do with \nprocurement legislation. This is a very complex area. I can't think of \nan area that is more boring and more complex than the procurement laws. \nFor that reason, the staff of our committee--the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction generally over the procurement laws--\nspent many, many hours on this subject. The last two Congresses have \nproduced reform legislation that balances the interest in the \nprocurement field between the government and those who are selling \ngoods and services to the government.\n  This provision, section 642 in this Treasury-Postal bill, essentially \nis a procurement piece of legislation. It has to do with child labor. \nIt essentially prohibits the Government from buying from those who use \nchild labor any goods or services produced by child labor. That is a \nlaudable goal. I support that. My amendment incorporates that goal. I \npoint out that it is already against the law. But it is certainly fine \nwith me if we put in this Treasury-Postal bill another law that says we \ncannot procure services or goods from those who do that sort of thing.\n  My problem, other than the fact that I believe the best way to \nlegislate in this matter is to have hearings on a complex subject like \nthis, is that it sets up a procedure that basically is overreaching and \nunfair, and probably unconstitutional. Because with regard to this \narea, as in no others, a contractor is required to sign a statement \nwith the Government that will allow a Government official at any time \nat his discretion to come in and look at the books and records, or talk \nto the individual at any time at his discretion to see whether or not a \nchild labor law has been violated. He should not be required to give up \nthe fourth amendment rights in order to contract with the Government.\n  As I say, trafficking in those kinds of goods and services is against \nthe criminal law. There is provision that prohibits such immoral \nactivity by that company when dealing with the Federal Government as it \nis. But it certainly does not call for an abrogation of rights that we \notherwise hold near and dear.\n  It says that the Secretary of Labor shall publish a list of items \nthat might have been produced by child labor. And then the contractor \nhas to certify that he is not using any of those items. Evidently, it \nis difficult to determine sometimes whether or not child labor has been \nused. The Government's only responsibility is to determine whether or \nnot they might have been used. And, yet, the contractor is required to \ncertify that they have not been used.\n  I am afraid this is a Catch-22 with regard to people in good faith \nwho are out trying to do the right thing and certainly would not \nconsider using child labor; but would allow unlimited access and \nunfettered access, under the language of this statute as it is now \nwritten, and would allow any Government official to come in and have \nunlimited access to books and records.\n  One other feature of this provision that I think is erroneous is the \nexception. This does not apply to countries that have signed NAFTA, for \nexample. There are a couple of other exceptions. But I will just \nconcentrate on that.\n  If a foreign country has signed the NAFTA agreement, then presumably \ncompanies of that country do not have this law applied to them.\n  We are focusing in on our own companies. We signed NAFTA. But we are \nfocusing in on our own companies requiring this kind of intrusion with \nregard to our own contractors, and we are not applying the same \nstandard to contractors of another country who might be supplying child \nlabor.\n  I don't think that is right. I don't think that is fair. I do not \nwant to make a mountain out of a molehill.\n  I think this is important. I feel a responsibility, as chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, to bring this to the attention of \nthe Senate, and simply say that in matters that are this complex that \nrequire a balancing of interests, we should go through the committee \nprocess.\n  Senator Glenn had a piece of legislation that we considered last \nyear. We\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\nhave had the Clinger-Cohen Act, and lots and lots of working hours put \ninto this in trying to reach the right balance.\n  We should not come in with a provision in an appropriations bill that \nbasically upsets that balance and places new responsibilities, new \nrequirements, new intrusions on contractors that in the wisdom of their \ndeliberations the committees, after considering this thing for years, \nhave not decided to do.\n  I respectfully urge the support of my colleagues with regard to my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will \nnot object, but if the Senator will hold off just a moment. Apparently, \nwe cannot find our copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me supply a copy.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator. If he would like to proceed, I \nhave the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That amendment has been temporarily set aside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, do I have the floor? I believe I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I was not aware the amendment was set aside. I called \nit up. No one moved that it be set aside that I am aware of. Maybe I am \nmistaken. I thought we were on it. Senator Harkin is prepared to \naddress it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee could call for the \nregular order, which would bring his amendment back.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I call for the regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We have two different views. Might I ask what regular \norder is? Is regular order the Abraham amendment that I have now \nsecond-degreed? Or not? I was under the impression that it was.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3353\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the underlying Thompson \namendment. When we finish that, we will return to the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend and colleague \nfrom Minnesota. Senator Thompson and I were prepared to engage in some \ncolloquies and debates and things on this amendment. I was surprised. I \nthought it had been called up. I apologize to my friend from Minnesota. \nWe were scheduled to start this debate on the issue of child labor.\n  Mr. President, the Thompson amendment, which is the pending \namendment, seeks to strike from the bill a provision that was \nincorporated at the committee level--subcommittee level and committee \nlevel--by unanimous consent. I don't know of any votes that were held \non it. It seemed to be adopted overwhelmingly. No one raised any \nquestions about it in full committee or anything like that.\n  The provision deals with setting some parameters on procurement \npolicy for the Federal Government, to the maximum extent possible to \npreclude the Federal Government from purchasing items made by forced or \nindentured child labor.\n  I hardly know where to begin to respond to some of the issues raised \nby my friend from Tennessee, but let me attempt to start here. First of \nall, right now it is true that there are certain laws that we have that \ncover child labor in this country. But that gets to the point where if \nsomething happens, then you can take someone to court and you can fine \nthem and debar them and all that. There is a long process and procedure \nfor that.\n  What this provision that was put in the committee bill seeks to do is \nto set up a structure to try to avoid or to preclude this from \nhappening in the first place. So that those who sell to the Federal \nGovernment would be on notice that, first of all, there is a list of \nitems that would be promulgated--published by the Department of Labor \nin consultation with the Department of State and Department of the \nTreasury--a list of items which would be very small in number because \nthere are not that many items, a list of items that have historically \nand traditionally been made with the use of forced or indentured child \nlabor; that if you are a seller to the Federal Government and if you \nare procuring or selling those kinds of items--like hand-knitted \ncarpets, for example, or certain leather items, some apparel, rattan \nfurniture, things like that--where the Department of Labor over the \nlast 4 years in studying this issue has issued about four volumes on \nthe use of forced and indentured child labor and the products that are \nmade and that type of thing. These are very extensive studies that are \nmade by the Department of Labor. What this provision in the bill does \nis it sets up a list. They put out a list. Then, if you are selling to \nthe Federal Government, you check a little box that you attest--\n``attestation'' they call it--you attest that the item that you are \nselling to the Federal Government was not made using forced or \nindentured child labor. That is basically it.\n  The list is necessary for two reasons. First, it would narrow the \nscope to only suspect industries, thus preventing a sort of widespread \nkind of provision or a burdensome requirement on industries where the \nuse of forced or indentured child labor does not occur. For example, I \nheard some mention made of Boeing aircraft. Boeing aircraft does not \nmake things made by forced or indentured child labor. There has never \nbeen a scintilla of evidence to show that, so none of their products \nwould be on the list. So we narrow the scope right away to just a few \nsuspect industries.\n  Second, the list is necessary because procurement officers need \nguidelines to enforce the intent of the legislation. Again, this list \nwould be compiled based on the four child labor studies already \nreleased by the Department of Labor. Furthermore, the only companies \nthat would be affected by this are\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\nones that sell an item that appears on the list. If you don't sell an \nitem that appears on the list, you will not be affected by this. You \nwould not have to attest; you would not have to check the box and \nattest that the item was not made by forced or indentured child labor \nif you are not even on the list. Boeing and all those wouldn't even be \non the list, so they would not have to check the box. That is the first \nthing. We keep it narrow, and that is why we have the list.\n\n  Mention was made by the Senator from Tennessee about the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, that we already have this law. I say to the Senator from \nTennessee that this law doesn't cover U.S. embassies abroad purchasing \ngoods. For example, we could have an embassy, say in Pakistan, India, \nor whatever country, buying glassware or buying hand-knitted carpets or \nbuying rattan furniture--I mentioned that--but they are not covered by \nthis at all. I would like to have them covered by it. That is the \nintent of the provision that is in the committee bill. They are not \ncovered by it. They would be covered by this. U.S. law, the Fair Labor \nStandards Act applies to the United States, but not to other countries. \nThat is why this provision is necessary.\n  These are not new requirements, as I have said before and in private \nconversation with the Senator from Tennessee. There are similar \nrequirements for companies that sell to the Armed Forces. I will get \ninto that in a second. Even though it has to do with different types of \ncontracts, they are similar. I think there is a difference without a \ndistinction, but they are similar, and I will get into that in a \nsecond.\n  They said it would be duplicative. It is not really duplicative. \nForced and indentured child labor is already illegal in interstate \ncommerce, that is true, but what I am seeking to do, for debarment \npurposes, and what this amendment will do is have them attest up front \nthat they are not using child labor. There are no provisions, as I \nunderstand, in law for that at this time.\n  Next, there was a question raised about the constitutionality of the \nprovision. It requires a contractor to agree to allow official access \nto the records of the employees and premises. As I said, we already \nhave such a provision, and as I said, we discussed that in private.\n  FAR, title 10 of Armed Forces, 10 U.S.C. section 2313 says:\n\n       Agency authority. Section 2313, examination of records of \n     contractor.\n       (1) The head of an agency, acting through an authorized \n     representative, is authorized to inspect the plant and audit \n     the records of:\n       (A) a contractor performing a cost reimbursement, \n     incentive, time and materials, labor hour or price \n     redeterminable contract or any combination of such contracts \n     made by that agency under this chapter and,\n       (B) a subcontractor performing any cost reimbursement, \n     incentive, time and materials, labor hour or price \n     redeterminable subcontract or any combination of such \n     contracts under a contract referred to in subparagraph (A).\n\n  The head of an agency, acting through himself or through an \nauthorized representative can already have access to premises and to \nrecords under Armed Forces procurement law, and that is under FAR.\n  I understand this has to do with different types of contracts. That \nis OK, but that is, I think, a difference without distinction. It may \nbe a time reimbursable or cost reimbursement or labor hour or price \nredeterminable contract. It is all fine and good, but I don't think \nthat is really a distinct difference with a contract that provides \ngoods or services to the Federal Government. So I say I don't think we \nhave any kind of a constitutional problem there.\n  Senator Thompson did raise, I believe, a good point, and I am going \nto correct that with a technical amendment, to track the wording that \nis already in the FAR and in title 10. I am going to make it \nspecifically that it is the head of an agency, acting through an \nauthorized representative, so that not just anyone would have access, \nbut that it would have to come from the head of an agency.\n  There is another question that the Senator from Tennessee raised, and \nthat is, why do we exempt NAFTA or WTO countries. I say to my friend \nfrom Tennessee, I wish we didn't have to, but I am told we have to \nbecause it is a treaty that we signed on NAFTA and WTO. My amendment \nwill exempt those countries that are parties to these two agreements. I \nam not happy about it, but it is the current U.S. law. It is treaty, \nand I guess we have to adhere to it, as I understand. We can't change \nthis law or negotiate new procurement agreements.\n  I will just point out that the Committee on Government Procurements, \nthe parties to this under WTO and NAFTA, basically are countries we \nreally don't have a problem with--Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany \nand places like that we really don't have much of a problem. The only \nproblem that we do have, I say, in NAFTA is perhaps with Mexico. But \nthen, again, that is part of the NAFTA agreement and, quite frankly, we \nare stuck with that for right now on that issue.\n  The Federal Acquisition Regulations govern acquisition by executive \nbranch agencies. Much of this regulation implements various statutes \nand Executive orders. My amendment is not unique under the FAR in \nseeking to implement U.S. standards and policies.\n  For example, Federal agencies cannot acquire supplies or services \noriginating from sources within or that are located in or transported \nfrom or through North Korea, Cuba, Libya, Iran, Sudan and Iraq. We \nalready have that.\n  In addition, my amendment is not unique in seeking to address a \npolicy concern, such as protecting domestic industries through Federal \nprocurement legislation. For example, the Buy America Act provides an \nadvantage to U.S. domestic producers through the competitive bidding \nprocess.\n  As a matter of fact, I include Senator Thompson's amendment as part \nof my provision already. However, I crafted my provision to be more \ntargeted. My provision does treat forced or indentured child labor \ndifferently than other procurement regulations because of the illegal \nand hidden nature of the act it seeks to prevent.\n  For example, all goods shipped to the United States must carry a \ncountry of origin label. No such provision in current Federal \nprocurement regulations exist for forced or indentured child labor. \nLikewise, the Buy America Act model is different because it operates \nthrough the bidding process. No such procedure exists for forced or \nindentured child labor. You don't know where the forced or indentured \nchild labor is.\n  Therefore, it was necessary to create a special targeted mechanism to \naddress this issue in a meaningful way that is the least burdensome to \ncontractors. In short, to accomplish this, the provision that is in the \nbill, one, calls on the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the \nSecretaries of Treasury and State, to draft a list of items which they \nfeel historically has been made with forced or indentured child labor. \nThat keeps the perspective narrow.\n  Next, this provision requires the contractor to sign an attestation \nthat their products were not made with forced or indentured child labor \nand, yes, to provide access to records, premises and persons for a \nlawful investigation arising from allegations that forced or indentured \nchild labor was used to produce the product.\n  Again, I read that other one that is already in Armed Forces, that \nthe head of an agency, acting through an authorized representative, can \ninspect a plant and audit the records of, et cetera.\n  Lastly, this provision provides a debarment option for 3 years for \nmaking a false certification. In other words, if you certify that you \ndid not use child labor, and inspections prove otherwise, then you \ncould be debarred for up to 3 years for making a false certification.\n\n  Senator Thompson's proposal, his amendment, is not targeted enough \nfor two reasons: One, procurement officers need specific information in \norder to apply a statute. Senator Thompson's amendment will take away \nthe list which gives contract officers specific areas to look for \nforced or indentured child labor problems. By removing this self-\ncertification, and the threat of debarment for a false certification, \nyou ensure that the provision will never be effectively enforced \nbecause the Federal Government may never be able to track the forced or \nindentured child labor practices of all of its contractors, much less \never investigating them.\n  Quite simply, I do not believe that signing a simple attestation, if \nyou are providing items to the U.S. Government which appear on a list \nof problem\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\nitems, will prove a very difficult burden. It will be burdensome if you \nare illegally employing children. Then it will be burdensome. But if \nyou are not, then it will not be. So again, this provision seeks to \ndeter child labor, stopping it before it happens, or before the U.S. \nGovernment buys goods made with forced or indentured child labor.\n  Obviously, the Thompson amendment seeks to debar those who have been \nconvicted or fined for using child labor. Nothing wrong with that. But \nthat is included in the provision that is in the bill already. But what \nhe carves out is a provision that seeks to prevent it from happening in \nthe first place by saying that if you use it, the U.S. Government just \nsimply will not do business with you.\n  I say, the difference might be that Senator Thompson's approach is: \n``We'll do business with you. Now, if we can take you in and prove \nthrough a lengthy court process and stuff, then we'll debar you.'' But \nmine comes up front and says, ``Look, if you are using child labor, and \nyou are on this list, you are making these items, you have to attest \nthat you are not using child labor.'' That right away puts them on \nnotice--puts them on notice that they are going to be in for some \nproblems if they are on that list and that they would be subject to a \nhead of an agency to come in and inspect them and inspect their records \nto see whether or not they actually were using child labor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Would the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I would be glad to, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The child labor issue is important to all of us. I \npoint out something I mentioned awhile ago. I say to the Senator, we \nhave 43 amendments yet to clear. I wonder if the Senator would agree to \na time limit on the debate. I talked to Senator Thompson. He is \nagreeable to a 20-minute time debate equally divided on both sides. \nWould the Senator from Iowa also agree with that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Twenty minutes equally divided; 10 minutes on each \nside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will consider that. Just a second. Let me finish my \nstatement. It does not sound totally unreasonable.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, you might ask, well, why should they have to look \nfor this? Why should procurement officers have to be concerned about \nthis? Under 48 CFR 9.406-2, ``Causes for Debarment,'' there is a whole \nlist of things that they should look for that they made. The ``Made in \nAmerica'' inscription that I have mentioned, violations of the Drug-\nFree Workplace Act--there is a whole list of things about which they \nhave to be concerned.\n  The fact is, they do not have to be concerned about child labor right \nnow. It is not even a concern of theirs. So we find ourselves in a \npeculiar position that procurement laws for the Federal Government say \nthat you have to meet certain standards--a drug-free workplace; you \nhave to have a ``Made in America'' inscription if it is made in \nAmerica; you have to have country of origin--but you do not have to be \nworried about child labor. I find that rather odd.\n  What this all really arises out of is that in the 1930 Tariff Act, a \nprovision was added that barred the entry into this country of any item \nmade with forced or indentured labor. That has been part of our law \nsince 1930.\n  Well, forced or indentured labor--what does that mean? It has been \ninterpreted to mean prison labor. There are other forms of forced or \nindentured labor. A year ago I wrote a letter to the Department of the \nTreasury asking for a clarification of this: Did forced or indentured \nlabor cover forced or indentured child labor? The letter they wrote \nback was sort of: ``Well, yes, we think it does because we say `forced \nor indentured labor.'' ' We didn't specify it has to be adult labor, \nbut it has never really been clarified. So we have sought to clarify \nthat.\n  Again, procurement officers have to take into account they have to be \naware of whether or not something is made by prison labor. Can the \nFederal Government buy items made by prison labor? The answer is no, \nabsolutely not. Can the Federal Government today buy items made by \nforced or indentured child labor? The answer is yes. We do it all the \ntime overseas. We buy carpets, we buy furniture, we buy glassware, we \nbuy leather. We buy a lot of items made by forced or indentured child \nlabor. And that is what this provision seeks to get to.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act does not reach that far, does not reach \noverseas, does not reach to these items. Our procurement policies do \nnot reach to our embassies abroad, for example. They are part of the \nFederal Government. They are part of the executive branch. They do buy \nitems. But right now they are blind as to whether something is made by \nforced or indentured child labor. That is why this provision is in the \nbill.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I just point out that the administration is in \nsupport of this section, 642, of the Treasury-General Government \nappropriations bill. I have a letter here from Secretary Alexis Herman \nsaying that this provision, a prohibition against the Federal \nGovernment's purchase of Federal products made by forced or indentured \nchild labor ``would establish a system to ensure that contractors take \nsteps to avoid providing products to the Government that have been \nmined, produced, or manufactured using forced or indentured child \nlabor.\n\n       The Administration agrees that we should tap the purchasing \n     power of the U.S. government in our efforts to eliminate \n     egregious forms of child labor. In addition, the President's \n     FY 1999 Budget includes an $89 million increase to address \n     both international and domestic child labor abuses. We \n     believe [this] amendment, coupled with our FY 1999 \n     initiatives, will help reduce the prevalence of these forms \n     of child labor.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n\n  Again, I think that the provision stands foursquare on constitutional \ngrounds. I do not believe there is any constitutional problem with it. \nI do not believe it runs far afield of provisions that we already have \nin present procurement law. It simply identifies one aspect, that is, \nlike the ``Made in America'' or the ``drug-free workplace'' or ``prison \nlabor.'' It identifies another one, and that is ``forced or indentured \nchild labor'' as one of those items that we want to put up front and to \nhave those who seek to sell items to the Federal Government attest that \nthey are not using forced or indentured child labor in the provision of \nthose goods.\n  Again, this will be based upon the list. There will be a list, yes, \npublication of a list of prohibited items.\n  The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of \nTreasury and the Secretary of State, shall publish in the Federal \nRegister every other year a list of items that such officials have \nidentified that might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by \nforced or indentured child labor.\n  So we work from that list. And that list has to be published.\n       The head of an executive agency shall include in each \n     solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of \n     an item included on a list published under subsection (b) \n     [the list I just mentioned] the following clauses:\n  Again, the clauses stating that the contractor has not indeed used \nforced or indentured child labor in the production of any of the items \nthat are on that list.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the \nSenator from Tennessee. The Senator, I believe, shares the concerns of \nthose of us who drafted section 642--we want to make sure the Federal \ngovernment does not buy goods made with child labor. However, his \namendment, by eliminating the list of suspect goods that Section 642 \nrequires the Department of Labor to make, will make it very difficult \nfor Federal contractors to know whether they are buying a product \nmanufactured by children.\n  Section 642 requires the Department of Labor print a list of products \nthat may have been produced with forced child labor. Any federal \ncontractor that sells these products to the government will be put on \nnotice that the items he or she sells might have been produced by child \nlabor. Those businesses then will have to check their suppliers and get \nassurances that they are not illegally selling a goods produced by \nchildren to the government.\n  The importance of this list of products that are potentially made \nwith\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\nchild labor cannot be underestimated. This list will allow federal \nagencies to focus on specific industries that use child labor most \noften. It will allow us to be vigilant in our efforts to stop the \nprocurement of such goods. When the government buys soccer balls for \nthe West Point soccer team, we need to be sure they were not sewn \ntogether by children. When the government buys tea for the cafeterias \nand commissaries of federal facilities, we ought to know those leaves \nwere not picked by children.\n  I want to commend Senator Harkin for his tireless work on behalf of \nthe exploited children of the world. By putting in place a process by \nwhich Federal contractors can know about and be held accountable for \nproducts they sell to the government, Senator Harkin has done a \nsignificant patriotic act. He has ensured that the United States is not \nin any way sanctioning, promoting, or even tolerating shameful \nexploitation of children.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment--and to \nvote against diluting protections against government purchase of goods \nmade with child labor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Colorado that \nI think I will need perhaps 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. If the Senator from Iowa is willing to agree to a time \nagreement, I will make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a couple of other items, then I will be ready to \nyield.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Would 10 more minutes be enough?\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said, after I get the floor again.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, a couple of comments with regard to the \nremarks of my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  First of all, let's keep in mind my amendment makes the use of child \nlabor grounds for disbarment and suspension. We need to keep that in \nmind. We set it out in bold type. It is already against the law, and \nnow we are saying in addition to that you can't do business with the \nFederal Government if you engage in that kind of activity. So we get \nthat out of the way to start with.\n  That is not the issue. The issue here is whether or not we want to \nset up a mechanism whereby some Federal official has unlimited access \nto your books and records and persons. Now, this whole area was \nentirely rewritten in 1994. Senator Glenn's bill, the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, provided for very circumspect, specific \naudit authorities for agencies, and GAO provided some subpoena \nauthority in a very limited way. All this was debated and considered on \na bipartisan basis and the competing interests were balanced out over a \nperiod of several days, and we came up with a law that we have now.\n  What we have here in the bill that we are seeking to amend departs \nfrom that substantially. There can be no comparison with the bill \ncurrently in force with existing law. Existing law under section 2313, \nchapter 137, procurement generally, is so long and detailed that I am \nnot going to burden the record by going into it, but suffice it to say \nthat there are very limited circumstances. Only certain kinds of \ncontracts, certain circumstances are dealt with where subpoena \nauthority is issued under certain kinds of contracts--limited \nauthority, over contracts over $100,000.\n  Compare that with what we have before us in the bill today that says \na clause that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully to provide \naccess for it says any official--I understand that will be changed--but \nyou must agree to provide access for some Government official of the \nUnited States to the contractors' records, documents, persons, or \npremises, if requested by the official, for the purpose of determining \nwhether forced child labor is being issued. It is a total fishing \nexpedition. You are not only going to have to give unlimited access to \nyour books and records, but unlimited access to your person.\n  There is nothing I know of like this in law, much less procurement \nlaw. We are really doing something substantially different here. We can \ncover the child labor situation without opening up Pandora's box and \nrunning contractors away from us.\n  One of the reforms that Senator Glenn and others carried out had to \ndo with the fact that we want to bring more contractors in. It is \nbetter for the taxpayer to have more competition, more people coming in \nto compete for these things.\n  My distinguished friend from Iowa suggests that we need to have a \ncertification on the front end. Prior committee action got rid of all \ncertification under the Governmental Affairs Committee and armed \nservices jurisdiction for the simple reason, first, if you are going to \nviolate the law, if you are going to use child labor, you are not going \nto certify something on the front end. It will not make you quit doing \nit.\n  Secondly, we got tired of raising so many hoops and intruding so much \nthat we were discouraging people from coming in and contracting with \nthe Government. Therefore, costs of things are higher than they ought \nto be. This whole area has been addressed. It cannot even be discussed \nin a limited period of time because it is so extensive.\n  But with regard to the question of opening up books and records and \npersons by some anonymous Federal official to see whether or not you \nmight have done something wrong, and when they get in there they are \nnot limited to look just for the thing that you say they are looking \nfor. Their eyes can gaze on whatever it is they are to be gazed upon.\n  When you deal with something like that, you are dealing with very, \nvery, important constitutional rights and nobody is going to put up \nwith that. Nobody is going to contract or agree to do business with the \nGovernment if they have that kind of burden. It has been well thought \nout, it has been considered, it has been deliberated upon for a long, \nlong time, and we should not address something this important and this \ncomplex in this fashion.\n  I respectfully urge this amendment be adopted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this provision is not unconstitutional and \ndoes not interfere with the Constitution, and it does not interfere \nwith the exercise of any fourth amendment right a Government contractor \nmight have.\n  The provision makes it possible for the Federal Government to ensure \nthat it does not purchase items produced with forced or indentured \nchild labor. Without ready Government access to records, workers and \nworker places, meaningful enforcement would be impossible.\n  Now this principle applies in a whole range of worker protection \nlaws. Now there is no need for a statutory probable cause requirement \nor a statutory procedure for challenging a search by a Government \nagency. A contractor who believes that a Federal agency had no probable \ncause to inspect his business would be free to refuse entry to the \nagency. It is a constitutional right. The agency would then be required \nto seek a warrant from a court, and if necessary, to ask the court to \nenforce the warrant. In this way, the court would ensure that the \nfourth amendment was followed.\n  Lastly, this is how the process works under comparable statutes, like \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act. Applying the fourth amendment, \nthe Supreme Court has held that OSHA must show probable cause or the \nlegal equivalent if an employer refuses OSHA entry. There is no \nstatutory probable cause requirement and no statutory procedure for \nchallenging a search. Government agencies can be expected to develop \nreasonable and neutral criteria for seeking access. They would do so in \norder to comply with the fourth amendment which the courts will apply.\n  OSHA, for example, has adopted such criteria, although the \nOccupational Safety Health Act does not prescribe this, and they have \nbeen upheld by the courts. Only Government agencies with a legitimate \nneed for access would be entitled to access. The access provision in \nsection 642 makes clear that the contractors' obligation is to provide \naccess only to the head of an agency, a Federal officer, and only for \nthe purpose of\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\ndetermining whether forced indentured child labor was used.\n  So there is no reason to believe this provision would be invoked by \nan official acting without authority. But, if it happened, the \ncontractor could not be sanctioned for refusing to cooperate, for \nexample.\n  The fourth amendment may not apply in these certain cases in any case \nuntil a contractor's consent to providing access is required to provide \naccess. The accession provision is intended to be incorporated in a \nGovernment contract. The contract provision would be required only for \ncompanies who wish to supply the Federal Government with an item from a \nlist of items that may have been introduced by forced or indentured \nchild labor.\n  I keep coming back to that. The Senator raises the specter that you \nwill have the Government people all of a sudden going into Boeing and \nplaces like that. That won't happen, first of all, because they won't \nhave anything on the list. So they won't have that. There will not be \nitems that have been identified produced by forced or indentured child \nlabor. Companies which choose to supply such items and which accept the \nterms of the contract have agreed to provide access.\n  As I said, there is no constitutional problem with this provision \nwhatsoever.\n  Now, again, Mr. President, what we do have a problem with, and what \nthis amendment really gets to, and for which there is no provision in \nlaw, is, when an arm of the Federal Government, such as the executive \nbranch, acting through embassies overseas, procures items and those \nitems are identified as having been produced by forced or indentured \nchild labor, there is nothing that we can do about that--unless we \nadopt this provision, of course. And this is a good and reasonable \nplace for this provision to be, in this appropriations bill, since we \nare providing appropriations for the running of the Government. So this \nis an appropriate place for the amendment.\n  I think there is some urgency to this also. The urgency is that we \nare gaining more and more information around the world about the use of \nforced or indentured child labor. The United States has, quite \nappropriately--and I am happy to see it--taken a forward position on \ntrying to do away with forced and indentured child labor. I mentioned \nthe letter from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the President \nhad already asked for, I think, $89 million in the budget to address \nchild labor abuses both here and abroad. We participate heavily in \nIPEC, the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor, \nwhich has been increased this year from $30 million, up from $3 \nmillion.\n  So the U.S. Government has--and also through our work on the \nInternational Labor Organization, UNICEF, and others, we have been \ntaking a very strong position against forced indentured child labor, as \nwe should. But if one arm of our Government overseas is openly \nprocuring items made by forced and indentured child labor, what kind of \na signal does that send? So that is what this provision in the bill \nseeks to end, and would end, if this provision remains in.\n  Now, the things that the Senator from Tennessee is talking about we \nalready incorporate in our amendment. There is a debarment procedure \nprovision in the bill. That is already there. That debarment procedure \nis already there. What the Senator's amendment does is, it takes away \nthose preliminary steps of publishing a list and then say to a \nprocurement officer, look out for these items, and if you are buying \none of these items, have that company attest on the form that they are \nnot using forced and indentured child labor. If they do, then they are \nagreeing that you can, as we have under FAR--that the head of an agency \nis authorized to inspect the records of that company.\n  As I said earlier, the Senator from Tennessee, I think, raised one \npoint that I think was very legitimate, and that was in the original \namendment. It says, on page 99, the words ``any official of the United \nStates.'' Quite frankly, that is too broad. As we look at the FAR and \nat title X for the Department of Defense, it uses the words ``the head \nof an agency.'' So I have a perfecting amendment that I am going to \noffer that would strike out ``any official of the United States'' and \ninsert in lieu thereof ``the head of the executive agency or the \ninspector general of the executive agency.''\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3374 to Amendment No. 3353\n\n    (Purpose: To provide a substitute that limits the scope of the \n     requirement relating to inspection of a contractor's records)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3374 to amendment No. 3353.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after Sec. 642.'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     PROHIBITION OF ACQUISITION OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY FORCED OR \n                   INDENTURED CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--The head of an executive agency may not \n     acquire an item that appears on a list published under \n     subsection (b) unless the source of the item certifies to the \n     head of the executive agency that forced or indentured child \n     labor was not used to mine, produce, or manufacture the item.\n       (b) Publication of List of Prohibited Items.--(1) The \n     Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the Secretary of State, shall publish in the \n     Federal Register every other year a list of items that such \n     officials have identified that have been mined, produced, or \n     manufactured by forced or indentured child labor.\n       (2) The first list shall be published under paragraph (1) \n     not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (c) Required Contract Clauses.--(1) The head of an \n     executive agency shall include in each solicitation of offers \n     for a contract for the procurement of an item included on a \n     list published under subsection (b) the following clauses:\n       (A) A clause that requires the contractor to certify to the \n     contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an \n     incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the \n     contractor has made a good faith effort to determine whether \n     forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, \n     or manufacture any item furnished under the contract and \n     that, on the basis of those efforts, the contractor is \n     unaware of any such use of child labor.\n       (B) A clause that obligates the contractor to cooperate \n     fully to provide access for the head of the executive agency \n     or the inspector general of the executive agency to the \n     contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if \n     requested by the official for the purpose of determining \n     whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, \n     produce, or manufacture any item furnished under the \n     contract.\n       (2) This subsection applies with respect to acquisitions \n     for a total amount in excess of the micro-purchase threshold \n     (as defined in section 32(f) of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)), including \n     acquisitions of commercial items for such an amount \n     notwithstanding section 34 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Act (41 U.S.C. 430).\n       (d) Investigations.--Whenever a contracting officer of an \n     executive agency has reason to believe that a contractor has \n     submitted a false certification under subsection (a) or \n     (c)(1)(A) or has failed to provide cooperation in accordance \n     with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B), \n     the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter, for \n     investigation, to the Inspector General of the executive \n     agency and, as the head of the executive agency determines \n     appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       (e) Remedies.--(1) The head of an executive agency may \n     impose remedies as provided in this subsection in the case of \n     a contractor under a contract of the executive agency if the \n     head of the executive agency finds that the contractor--\n       (A) has furnished under the contract items that have been \n     mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured \n     child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in \n     mining, production, or manufacturing operations of the \n     contractor;\n       (B) has submitted a false certification under subparagraph \n     (A) of subsection (c)(1); or\n       (C) has failed to provide cooperation in accordance with \n     the obligation imposed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of such \n     subsection.\n       (2) The head of the executive agency, in the sole \n     discretion of the head of the executive agency, may terminate \n     a contract on the basis of any finding described in paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a \n     contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the \n     basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act \n     described in paragraph (1)(A). The period of the debarment or \n     suspension may not exceed three years.\n       (4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on \n     the List of Parties Excluded\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\n     from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs \n     (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation) each person that is debarred, \n     suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared \n     ineligible by the head of an executive agency or the \n     Comptroller General on the basis that the person uses forced \n     or indentured child labor to mine, produce, or manufacture \n     any item.\n       (5) This subsection shall not be construed to limit the use \n     of other remedies available to the head of an executive \n     agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the \n     basis of a finding described in paragraph (1).\n       (f) Report.--Each year, the Administrator of General \n     Services, with the assistance of the heads of other executive \n     agencies, shall review the actions taken under this section \n     and submit to Congress a report on those actions.\n       (g) Implementation in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.--\n     (1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised \n     within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) to provide for the implementation of this section; and\n       (B) to include the use of forced or indentured child labor \n     in mining, production, or manufacturing as a cause on the \n     lists of causes for debarment and suspension from contracting \n     with executive agencies that are set forth in the regulation.\n       (2) The revisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation \n     shall be published in the Federal Register promptly after the \n     final revisions are issued.\n       (h) Exception.--(1) This section does not apply to a \n     contract that is for the procurement of any product, or any \n     article, material, or supply contained in a product, that is \n     mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country or \n     instrumentality, if--\n       (A) the foreign country or instrumentality is--\n       (i) a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement \n     annexed to the WTO Agreement; or\n       (ii) a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement; \n     and\n       (B) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater \n     than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement \n     on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement, whichever is applicable.\n       (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``WTO \n     Agreement'' means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade \n     Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.\n       (i) Applicability.--(1) Except as provided in subsection \n     (c)(2), the requirements of this section apply on and after \n     the date determined under subsection (2) to any solicitation \n     that is issued, any unsolicited proposal that is received, \n     and any contract that is entered into by an executive agency \n     pursuant to such a solicitation or proposal on or after this \n     date.\n       (2) The date referred to is paragraph (1) is the date that \n     is 30 days after the date of the publication of the revisions \n     of the Federal Acquisition Regulation under subsection \n     (g)(2).\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this perfecting amendment does, very \nsimply, is it takes the suggestion of the Senator from Tennessee and \nstrikes out ``any official of the United States'' and inserts in lieu \nthereof ``the head of the executive agency or the inspector general of \nthe executive agency.''\n  Secondly, it strikes the word ``might'' from page 99, because in the \noriginal language it said that they shall publish in the Federal \nRegister every other year a list of items that ``might have been mined. \n. ..'' We strike that out. That is a great suggestion, to say that they \nhave to publish a list of items that such officials have identified \nthat ``have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or \nindentured child labor.''\n  So this perfecting amendment tightens up my original amendment in two \nways. It provides that only the head of an agency or the inspector \ngeneral of that agency may be the one to do the inspection or authorize \nthe inspection. Secondly, it says that the published list can only be \nof items that have been identified as having been mined, manufactured, \nor produced by forced or indentured child labor.\n  The rest of the provision remains the same as it is in the bill, but \nthis tightens up those two provisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill, I know there are amendments that are pending. They \nare trying to work out something on that. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to agree to reasonable time limits, and let's have a \nvote. But I am directing my remarks now more to other Senators who are \nnot on the floor who may have amendments.\n  We need to make it clear that we are going to finish this bill \ntonight. We should be able to be through by 6 o'clock. But we still \nhave a number of amendments that have not been resolved and haven't \nbeen worked out, or accepted, or offered.\n  We are going to have to just keep going. That could mean another late \nnight. The managers of the bill would like cooperation to get this \ncompleted. But we are either going to be having votes at 11 or 12 \no'clock, or we are going to agree to some process whereby we can finish \nthe amendments that are still out there and get final votes on them in \nthe morning in a stacked sequence. We can agree to that. But one of the \nthings that is required is that Senators who do want to offer \namendments have to come over here and offer them.\n  I am going to talk with Senator Daschle. I believe that he will \nsupport me in supporting the managers. If at a certain hour tonight \nSenators have not offered their amendments and have not come over here \nto debate those amendments, we will go out of session, and all \namendments that have been agreed to would be stacked in sequence if \nthey have to have votes in the morning.\n  Once again, while this week has been a difficult week because of the \nsadness we have all experienced, everybody has tried to be \nunderstanding of that, but now we are beginning to get back into the \nold routine. We have far too many amendments left on the bill that \nreally shouldn't be that difficult to finish.\n  I plead again with my colleagues to come over here and offer their \namendments. Let's get an agreement on how we are going to handle them \nand get votes on those amendments. If we don't get amendments, I can \nforce votes tonight at all hours of the night. I don't want to do that. \nBut it is going to take some cooperation again.\n  Mr. President, do we have an agreement on how to dispose of the \npresent amendment? Do Senator Thompson and Senator Harkin have \nsomething worked out in terms of a time agreement on this, or do I just \nneed to move to table everything right where we are?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the leader will give us just a moment, I think we \ncan ask for the yeas and nays momentarily.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be very helpful.\n  Mr. President, unless somebody seeks the floor, I observe the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In response to the leader's request, I ask my colleague \nfrom Iowa, is he agreeable to having an up-or-down vote on the Harkin \namendment, immediately followed by an up-or-down vote on the Thompson \namendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I agree with that. Are we prepared to vote?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am prepared to move forward with that agreement right \nnow.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent, pursuant to that \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair informs Senators the yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Thompson amendment, \nand ask that vote occur immediately following that on the Harkin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there \na sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 244 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3374) was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I are working with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to identify the remaining serious \namendments. I have here a list that looks like it is about 20, but I \nthink that we can probably identify half a dozen or so amendments.\n  Senator Daschle, do you have some information on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In response to the majority leader, we have, I think, \nfour amendments that currently would require a rollcall vote. There are \ntwo of those four that may actually still get worked out, so I think we \nare getting relatively close to coming to closure on this bill. I hope \nall Senators who wish to offer amendments will stay on the floor \nbecause this could happen fairly quickly. I think it would be very \nhelpful if you are right on the floor to offer the amendment. It would \nexpedite our ability to complete our work on this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle.\n  We have, it looks like, probably no more than two amendments left on \nour side that might require a vote. With regard to one of the four you \nidentified, I believe Senator Baucus has an amendment. We are working \nvery hard to see if we can't get some agreement on that right now.\n  For the information of Senators, with regard to schedule, we think \nthe best thing to do is just keep going and not have a break for the \nmealtime because we think that actually might wind up wasting time. If \nwe would stay on the floor and focus here, we could finish this by 8 \no'clock and would be through with this bill and then could decide--\nSenator Daschle and I need to discuss further--then, exactly whether we \nare going to go to health care or go to the DOD appropriations bill. We \ncould get on that tonight, and then that would be the final business \nfor the week.\n  We need your cooperation. When you do offer an amendment, agree to a \nshort time so we don't have to go straight to a motion to table. We \nwant everyone to have a chance to explain their case. With your \ncooperation, we can finish this at 8 o'clock.\n  I also note there are some Senators who would like to be able to go \nto the funeral in the morning. If we could finish this at a reasonable \nhour tonight, we wouldn't have to have stacked votes in the morning. We \ntried very hard to not have a lot of late nights, but we are going to \nhave to in order to finish this, but with your cooperation we could \nfinish it in a couple of hours.\n  I urge Members to do that. I thank Senator Daschle. Let's keep this \nworking and see if we can't get this down to no more than two or three \nvotes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask the yeas and nays on the Thompson amendment be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Thompson \namendment numbered 3353.\n  The amendment (No. 3353) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I enter a motion for reconsideration of the \namendment numbered 3368.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is that motion debatable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been entered but it has not \nbeen made.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I move to table the motion to reconsider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not before the body, so the \nmotion to table would not be in order at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What is the pending business?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3373 to Amendment No. 3362\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate is the \nWellstone amendment numbered 3373.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could ask my colleague, I know Senator Graham \nwants 10 seconds to dispose of an amendment, but I ask unanimous \nconsent as soon as he does this that I then have the floor and go for a \nvote on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making a unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer, in his capacity as a \nSenator from the State of Michigan, objects.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the pending business is this amendment, \ncorrect, the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The pending \nbusiness is amendment No. 3373, the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me explain this amendment and speak on it for a \nshort period of time. I don't know that there will be a vote within the \nnext 2 or 3 minutes, I say to colleagues.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, which is a second-degree amendment to \nthe Abraham amendment, expands on what Senator Abraham is trying to do. \nIt applies to the Congress and not just to the administration. \nFurthermore, what my amendment says is that when the Congress prepares \nits report on family well-being --which I think is a real important \nconcept; I think it is something that we should be about--the Congress \nalso reports on the impact of our legislation on children.\n  The amendment doesn't strike the Abraham amendment. It expands on the \namendment. I believe that my colleagues, if I am given a little bit of \ntime, will want to support this.\n  Mr. President, I think the reason when we pass legislation out of \ncommittee, that in our report language we need to talk about the impact \nof children, is because of the reality of the lives of children in \nAmerica. Part of our definition of family well-being, surely, has to do \nwith parents, and we ought to make sure that parents are able to do \ntheir very best by their children, because when parents do their very \nbest by their children, they do their very best by our country. It is \nalso true if we are going to talk about parents, we have to talk about \nthe impact of our legislation on children.\n  Mr. President, one out of every four children in our country under \nthe age of 3 is growing up poor. One in three children will be poor at \nsome point in their childhood. One in five children today under the age \nof 6 is poor today in America. One in three is a year or more behind in \nschool. One in four children is born to a mother who did not graduate \nfrom high school. One out of every four children lives with only one \nparent. One out of every five children\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\nlives in a family receiving food stamps. One out of every five children \nis born to a mother who received no prenatal care in the first 3 months \nof her pregnancy. One out of every seven children have no health \ninsurance. One out of every eight children are born to teenage \nchildren. One out of every 12 children has a disability. One out of \nevery 13 children is born at low birthweight. One out of every 25 \nchildren lives with neither parent. One out of every 132 children in \nAmerica dies by the age of 1. And 1 in 680 children is killed by \ngunfire before the age of 20.\n  Let me do it a different way as to why I believe when we pass \nlegislation we ought to talk about the impact of this legislation on \nchildren, and we ought to make it clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I will say to my colleagues, if I \ndon't get order, I will talk for a long time about this, because I \ndon't think there is anything inappropriate about having a focus on the \nstate of children in America.\n  So I hope that we can have order in the Chamber and I will be able to \ngo on. I will take as long as necessary.\n  Mr. President, every day in America, one mother dies in child birth. \nEvery day in America, three people under the age of 25 die from HIV \ninfection. Every day in America, six children or young people commit \nsuicide. Every day in America, 13 children and youths are murdered. \nEvery day in America, 16 children and youths are killed by firearms. \nEvery day in America, 36 children and youths die from accidents. Every \nday in America, 81 babies die. Every day in America, 144 babies are \nborn at very low birth weight. Every day in America, 311 children are \narrested for alcohol offenses. Ever day in America, 316 children are \narrested for violent crime. Every day in America, 403 children are \narrested for drug offenses. Every day in America, 443 babies are born \nto mothers who receive late or no prenatal care. Every day in America, \n781 babies are born at low birth weight. Every day in America, 1,403 \nbabies are born to mothers younger than 20. Every day in America, 2,377 \nbabies are born to mothers who are not high school graduates. Every day \nin America, 2,556 children--babies--are born into poverty. Every day in \nAmerica, 3,356 young people drop out of high school.\n  Colleagues, when I cite these figures from the Children's Defense \nFund Report of this summer--this last report was July 17, 1998. When I \ncite the statistics that every day in America 3,356 high school \nstudents drop out, there is a higher correlation between high school \ndropouts and winding up in prison than between cigarette smoking and \nlung cancer. Surely, we ought to be looking at the state of children in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, one quarter of all the homeless people in America are \nchildren under the age of 18, and 100,000 of these kids live on the \nstreets right now. Mr. President, 5.5 million children go hungry in the \nUnited States of America today.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his emphasis on families. I \ncommend my colleague for wanting to say that we want to do everything \nwe can to enable parents to do well by their children. I want to \ncommend my colleague for making the point that we want to make sure \nthat parents are really able to exercise their responsibilities as \nparents with their children.\n  But I also want to say something else to my colleagues, which is that \nthis second-degree amendment adds a lot of strength to what is on the \nfloor. I don't think there should be any vote against this, because \nwhat the second-degree amendment says is, let's also apply this to the \nCongress. We simply say that whatever we vote out of committee, we \nalso, in report language, have a very careful child impact statement. I \nsee my colleague from Connecticut on the floor--probably the leading \nSenator for years when it comes to focusing on children. I say to my \ncolleague, I think this is really an excellent idea. I think it is \nimportant for us to be looking at the impact.\n  Mr. President, I have one question that I can't let go of in my own \nmind, which I pose for every single colleague here: How can it be that \nright now in the United States of America, at our peak economic \nperformance, we have one out of every four children under the age of 3 \ngrowing up poor in our country, and one out of every two children of \ncolor growing up poor in our country today? This is the most affluent \ncountry in the world, the most powerful country in the world, with \nrecord low unemployment, record economic performance, low inflation, a \ncelebrated GDP, and we have a set of social arrangements that allow \nchildren to be the poorest group of Americans in our country. That is a \nnational disgrace.\n  Now, Mr. President, I just want to go on and make one other point. In \nsome of the debate that we have had over the years, colleagues have \nsaid, look, all right, Senator Wellstone, you disagree about proposed \ncuts in affordable housing, or Head Start; you disagree with proposed \ncuts in the Food Stamp Program, which is the major safety net food and \nnutrition program for children in America; you disagree with some of \nour other priorities, but we want to tell you that in no way, shape, or \nform are we not committed to children in America. I accept that in good \nfaith. But what I want to say tonight is that, if so, we ought to at \nleast be willing to look at our actions. We ought to be willing to look \nat our legislation, and we ought to be willing to analyze the impact on \nchildren in America.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled not just in Minnesota, but in our \ncountry, and the one thing that troubles me the most is, I just think \nwe have to do a lot better for kids, a lot better for kids in our \ncountry.\n  We talk about low SAT scores; that is there. We talk about high rates \nof high school dropouts; that is there. We talk about children being \narrested for substance abuse; that is happening. We talk about too many \nchildren taking their own lives; that is happening. We talk about too \nmany children that are murdered; that is happening. We talk about too \nmuch violence in our schools; that is happening. We talk about too many \nhungry children in America; that is happening. We talk about too many \nchildren that are 3 and 4 years old and are home alone because the \nsingle parent is working and because there is no child care; that is \nhappening. Second graders and first graders come home alone with no \nparent there, sometimes in very dangerous neighborhoods; that is \nhappening. We talk about the poverty in our country and the number of \nchildren that are homeless children.\n  I say to the Chair, because of his commitment to veterans, that one \nof the most disgraceful things going on in our country is that about \none-third of all the homeless are veterans--many Vietnam veterans. That \nis a scandal; that is simply unconscionable.\n  But the fact of the matter is that all of us say that we are for the \nchildren. All of us say that they are 100 percent of our future. All of \nus say that we care about children. All of us want to have our pictures \ntaken next to children. All of us say that we are parents and \ngrandparents and that this is our commitment. Well, I am saying that \nSenator Abraham has brought a good piece of legislation on the floor. \nHe wants to talk about the importance of parental responsibility. He \nwants to talk about the importance of families. And what I believe is \nthat this second-degree amendment expands on his work, and I certainly \nhope that this amendment will be accepted by my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I know there is a lot that we are trying to do \ntonight, and I have a lot more to say. In deference to colleagues--the \nmajority leader has been gracious enough to come over here and say that \nthis amendment will be accepted.\n  I just say to colleagues that, if so, I am delighted, I say to the \nSenator from Colorado. Might I ask my colleague one thing?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. There is no opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Knowing of the commitment of the Senator from Colorado \nand just sort of knowing the way things work here, I wonder whether I \ncould ask my colleague something. I am sort of tempted to have a vote \nbecause I would like to show a lot of support for this. I ask my \ncolleague whether or not he would be willing to fight hard to keep this \nin conference committee?\n  I know my friend from Colorado being an honorable Senator--I am \ndelighted that it will be taken--I am\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nwondering whether my colleague would give me some sense of whether or \nnot he supports this, whether I can count on his support in the \nconference committee so this doesn't get taken out.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I can't speak for everyone in the conference, but from \nmy own perspective I am very supportive.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That means a great deal to me.\n  I don't know whether my colleague from Wisconsin is on the floor \nright now, Senator Kohl, but I believe that I can count on his support.\n  Is the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, on the floor?\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I am delighted that the \namendment is accepted. We can vote on it.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, there is no opposition on the majority \nside to the Abraham amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I voice my support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Wellstone \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 3373) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3362, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we got ahead of ourselves on the \namendment of the Senator from Tennessee.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk about a critical \nenergy issue facing the country today that calls for urgent action.\n  That is the price collapse that we have seen for crude oil. We are \nnear historically low prices for crude oil in the world, in real terms, \ndue in part to the economic turmoil in Asia. This is leading to several \nserious problems.\n  First, we are threatened with the loss of a major domestic industry. \nWhen the wellhead price of crude oil is in the vicinity of $10 a \nbarrel, as it has been recently in the Permian basin and elsewhere in \nthe country), we drive producers of oil from marginal wells out of the \nbusiness. There are about a half million marginal wells in this \ncountry. The employment from operating those wells puts food on the \ntable for a lot of families all over the country, and we need to be \nconcerned about their economic future.\n  Second, low prices mean we lose royalty and tax revenues that fund \npublic education. Since October 1997, the drop in crude oil prices has \ntriggered a revenue shortfall in the States totaling $819 million. \nThat's close to a billion dollar loss for public education in less than \none year. In New Mexico, counties and towns are canceling planned \nschool construction and renovation projects.\n  Third, our national energy security is threatened. During the Arab \noil embargo of the 1970s, we imported 30 percent of our oil. Today, \nit's 56 percent. Even before the current price decline, the Energy \nInformation Administration was predicting that imports would go to 68 \npercent by 2015. With lower prices, though, EIA's projection rises to \n75 percent oil import dependence.\n  Finally, international stability is put at risk by current oil \nprices. Earlier this month, the IMF approved $11.2 billion in aid for \nRussia. $2.9 billion of that amount was to make up for shortfalls in \nRussia's export earnings. Over half of Russia's oil is exported, but \nthe benchmark price for that oil has declined by 25 percent in this \nyear alone. Continued low world oil prices could undo whatever gains in \nstability are accomplished in Russia by IMF funding. The same is true \nof other major oil-producing countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.\n  The Senate has recently focused on the problems confronting farmers \ngrowing out of collapsing world commodity prices. When it considered \nthe agriculture appropriations bill, the Senate agreed to help address \nthis urgent farm crisis by providing the Secretary of Agriculture with \n$500 million, under an emergency appropriation, to help agricultural \nproducers, including family farmers, to stay in business. We need to do \nthe same thing for the domestic oil industry.\n  The amendment that I have sent to the desk does just that. It is an \nemergency appropriation to allow the Administration to buy back all the \noil the government has sold out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for \nbudgetary purposes since the Gulf War. That amount comes to 28 million \nbarrels.\n  We sold this oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay for \nother unrelated spending on appropriations bills. In effect, we were \nusing one of the country's prime energy security tools as a giant ATM \nmachine. The Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and I led an \neffort last year and this to put a stop to such sales.\n  I am gratified that the Committee on Appropriations is not proposing \nany further sales this year. But the energy security concerns that I \nhave mentioned, particularly our continuing and growing reliance on \nforeign oil imports, make repurchase of the oil for the SPR a good \nidea. Also, at current world oil prices, the oil we put back will cost \nless than what we sold it for. At an estimated cost of $15 per barrel \ndelivered to the SPR, this amendment would require a $420 million \nemergency appropriation.\n  The use of an emergency appropriation in this case is well justified. \nIt is somewhat less than what the Senate has done for farmers who are \nfacing similar financial losses from the same sort of world economic \nforces and collapsing prices. And there can be no doubt that the \neconomic implosion that threatens the oil-producing regions of the \nSouthwest, if we allow current trends to continue, qualifies as an \nemergency.\n  This amendment gives the kind of help that does the most good here in \nthe United States and internationally. It gets excess oil off the \nmarket. This would have a significant beneficial impact on wellhead \nprices, but not enough to trigger a price spike for refined oil \nproducts.\n  I think this is a good amendment. I think it is consistent with our \nconcern for our long-term energy security. I think it is a very good \ninvestment. This is the time when we should, as a country, be thinking \nabout replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I hope very much \nthe managers of the bill will be able to accept this amendment and that \nwe will be able to add it to this piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman, will you add me as a cosponsor, \nplease?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am very pleased to add Senator Domenici as a \ncosponsor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it probably will come as a big surprise \nthat, for example, the current price for a gallon of crude oil is \ncheaper than the price for a gallon of bottled water. Many people will \nsay, ``That is great.'' Those who look at the American economy and \nforget about our oil production and our oilfield workers, they would \nsay, ``Great.'' But if you are looking at how far we have gone in our \noil dependence, you will see the small producers of oil in the United \nStates are in the most serious problem they have been in in modern \ntimes. The prices are so low that I had two of them come to see me the \nother day.\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\n One last year had $15 million invested in new wells; this year, zero. \nOne drilled 31 new wells last year; this year, 1. We have hundreds of \nthousands of small wells, called stripper wells, producing 15 barrels a \nday or less. Many of those, if they shut them in, the oil is gone. The \nentire reserve is lost.\n  We are not sure how to fix that. It is a very complicated problem. \nBut the amendment that is being offered, which I join in, is saying, \nwith prices this low and the fact that we used a lot of our expensive \noil during the Iraqi war, we ought to replenish with $420 million worth \nof purchases. At least it will stabilize somewhat the faltering prices \nhere and may stabilize the stripper wells that are going down the tube \nand will not be available to America for the production of oil. The way \nit is paid for is to say: If the President of the United States deems \nit to be an emergency, then it will be an emergency under the budget. \nThat is not exceptional. We do that for emergencies all the time. We \nthink the oil patch is in a state of emergency.\n  Mr. President, the head of the National Stripper Well Association, \nestimated that small producers already have closed 100,000 wells this \nyear, and cut production by 300,000 barrels a day and has been forced \nto eliminate 10,000 jobs because of falling prices.\n  Small oil companies are sinking with crude oil prices.\n  Behind the price drop is the reduced demand in Asia because of its \nfinancial crisis, the prospect of Iraq selling more oil and the \ninability of the OPEC to agree on production cuts.\n  The state, receives about 30 percent of its funds from oil and gas. \nEach dollar drop in the price of a barrel of oil translates roughly \ninto a drop of $20 million in state revenues.\n  In Oklahoma, the continuation of low oil prices could lead to the \npermanent abandonment of about three-fourths of Oklahoma's almost \n90,000 oil wells.\n  This amendment will direct the Secretary of Energy to purchase and \ntransport and additional $420,000,000 of oil for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve upon a determination by the President that the \ncurrent market conditions are imperiling domestic oil productions from \nmarginal and small producers.\n  This is a small step to show support for our domestic oil industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9181-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9211-S9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, I ask Senator Bingaman to allow \nSenator Daschle and I to bring up an issue we have been wanting to do, \nand also say we are working with a number of Senators to see how we \nmight deal with this, see if it can be handled without having to go to \na recorded vote. We need a few more minutes. In the meantime, Senator \nDaschle and I would like to do an exchange here with regard to a \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, we need to try to clear up what we are going to do for \nthe balance of the week. Senator Daschle and I have been working, back \nand forth, since the middle of June, trying to come to a unanimous \nconsent agreement on how to handle the health care Patients' Bill of \nRights issue. We have had a number of suggestions back and forth. We \nhave not been able to come to agreement. There are ways that \nlegislation could be brought to the floor anyway. But I am sure there \nwould be objections if it were done in a way where there could not be \namendments or, from this side, if there were unlimited amendments. But \nwe need to try to see that there is one final opportunity for us to get \na way to bring up the health care issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent the majority leader, after notification of \nthe Democratic leader, shall turn to S. 2330 regarding health care. I \nfurther ask, immediately upon its reporting, Senator Nickles be \nrecognized to offer a substitute amendment making technical changes to \nthe bill, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, Senator \nKennedy be recognized to offer his Patients' Bill of Rights amendment, \nwith votes occurring on each amendment with all points of order having \nbeen waived.\n  I further ask that three other amendments be in order on each side, \nfor a total of six, to be offered by each leader or their designees, \nregarding health care. Following the conclusion of debate and following \nthe votes with respect to the listed amendments, the bill be advanced \nto third reading and the Senate proceed to H.R. 4250, the House \ncompanion bill, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of \nS. 2330, as amended, if amended, be inserted, and the Senate proceed to \nvote at no later than 3 p.m. on Friday, July 31.\n  To sum up, what I am asking is we would have debate on the two \nunderlying bills, six amendments, three on each side, and of course the \nvotes that would be ordered as a result of that, and finish, then, by 3 \non Friday, the 31st. I think we could have a good debate, have some \nvotes, and complete that debate.\n  I further ask that following the vote, the Senate bill be returned to \nthe calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would certainly want to reiterate what \nthe majority leader said at the beginning of his comments, which is \nthat we have been negotiating now for some time in an effort to \ndetermine how we might bring to the floor the health care bills offered \nby the Republican caucus as well as the Democratic caucus. I see \nSenator Graham standing. There are other bills that may be contemplated \nin this debate as well.\n  Our view is that it would be very difficult to have a debate of the \nimportance of what we consider this to be, with the limit of amendments \nthat the majority leader has proposed. We had 56 amendments on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. We disposed of them. We had 82 \namendments on the Commerce-State-Justice bill. We disposed of them. I \nwould not say, in either case, people felt that was too long a debate \nto have on an important bill like those two appropriations bills. We \nhad 150 amendments on the Defense authorization bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's request be \nmodified to provide for relevant amendments--to limit it to relevant \namendments. I think we can have a good debate. We are prepared to limit \nthem to relevant amendments. I have asked my colleagues not to offer \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights amendment to other bills because, in large \nmeasure, we have been working in good faith to try to see if we can \naccommodate a schedule that will allow us to bring it to the floor.\n  Certainly, I think having an agreement that would allow a debate, \nlimited to relevant amendments, would certainly take into account the \nconcerns that many of our colleagues have raised about being too \nlimited on a bill, and a debate that is as consequential as is this \none. So I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. Would that be with the agreement that we finish it and have \nfinal passage on the two underlying bills by a time certain on Friday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We would not know when we would finish. Obviously, we \ncouldn't agree to a time limit on the bill because we really don't know \nhow long the relevant amendments would take at this point.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be our concern, then. There would be no way of \nknowing how many amendments or how long it would go on.\n  As the Senator knows, this year we have attempted some bills and we \nnever could quite bring them to a conclusion. I really want to be able \nto get the Senate to actually vote on a bill that goes to conference. I \nbelieve Senator Daschle wants that, too. I am afraid, if we just go \ninto it with relevant amendments with no limits--we only had 18 \namendments, as I recall, on the tobacco bill. We stayed on that for 4 \nweeks. We only have 5 weeks and 2 days left, so I don't think we could \ndo that.\n  Let me say to Senator Graham, I know he and others are working on \nanother bill. What we could do, we do have, under my proposal, three \namendments on each side. We could make their substitute one of those \nthree amendments. I presume that would be\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nwhat we would probably do on our side, if there is one that is \ndeveloped as an alternative.  Alternatives would have an opportunity \nunder that proposal.\n\n  Since we couldn't get any kind of guarantee that we will get it to a \nconclusion, I have to object to the addition that Senator Daschle \nproposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In that case, I will have to object to the offer made by \nthe majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9211-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

It will be our \nintent to stay on it, with cooperation from both sides of the aisle, to \ncomplete that very important Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to clarify a comment just made by the \nmajority leader, I know that he has indicated to me we will move to the \nExecutive Calendar before the end of the week.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, we have a number of nominations that I believe we can \nclear, that we need to clear. We will be working on that beginning \ntomorrow night. I thought maybe we could do some tomorrow night and \nthen some more on Friday, after we complete the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill.

Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been working to \nidentify the remaining amendments and the time that will be necessary \nto debate those amendments. I thank Senator Daschle, again, for the \ntime he spent on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments, as previously \nidentified on the consent agreement, be limited to the following times, \nto be equally divided:\n  Senator Bingaman with regard to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 20 \nminutes;\n  Senator Baucus regarding post office closings, 10 minutes;\n  Senator McConnell regarding the Federal Elections Commission, 10 \nminutes;\n  Senator Glenn regarding FEC, 10 minutes;\n  Senator Harkin regarding drug control, 30 minutes;\n  And Senator Wellstone regarding naming of a post office, 10 minutes.\n  We will continue to work with the Senators on this list to see if we \ncan work them out and get them accepted, but we need to get this order \nlined up and identify what those amendments are to be.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if we can have 15 \nminutes on my side. We have a couple of people who want to make short \nremarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would modify that request, then, so we will have 15 \nminutes on each side?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now we are talking 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is right, instead of 20.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then Senator McConnell will need 30 minutes. So you are \ntalking about 30 minutes on each side--30 minutes equally divided or 30 \nminutes total?\n  Mr. GLENN. Thirty total.\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be 30 minutes equally divided on the McConnell \namendment and 30 minutes on the Glenn amendment.\n  I remind our colleagues, it is a quarter till 7. I can't think of any \nprofound statement that can be made that will take 30 minutes that will \naffect one iota the vote or its outcome. If the Senators will be \nwilling to yield some of that time, that will be very helpful.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate my amendment being on the \nlist. I would like 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Baucus amendment, 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Objection on two parts. First of all, with regard to \nthe Gene McCarthy Post Office, if we are going to debate this, I would \nlike to have that 20 minutes equally divided. And second of all, I did \nnot agree--I thought we might reach an agreement--I did not agree to \nwithdraw my other amendment. There is another amendment that should be \nadded to the list that will deal with mental health or substance abuse \nas it affects Federal employees. I would like to have 20 minutes \nequally divided on that.\n  Mr. President, let me just add, I have been here in the afternoon \nready to go with amendments, so I am not trying to delay anything.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time did the Senator want on the second \namendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Twenty minutes equally, if it is not accepted--maybe \nit will be acceptable--20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe this is sprouting wings here. I \nthink I am going to at this point withdraw this agreement and notify \nMembers I will move to table all amendments when offered. Unless we can \nget reasonable time agreements--we are now talking 1 hour, 2 hours, \n3\\1/2\\ hours. What the heck, I will just move to table, and we will \nhave a vote on each one of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the leader, I am willing to reduce mine down to \n2 minutes if the Senator will agree to my amendment. (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. That would take unanimous consent. You might get my \nagreement, but I am not sure you will get the rest of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I get your agreement, I will reduce mine to 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield for and observation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the majority leader, Senator Glenn suggested \nthat my amendment will require 30 minutes, 15 minutes on a side, and \nthen he wanted 30 minutes for his amendment. I had offered him earlier \nin the day that we could adopt them both on voice vote which will \nrequire no time at all for the Senate. If I understand the Glenn \namendment, it is adding $2.8 million for the FEC; is that the Glenn \namendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me renew the request because Senator Daschle and I have \nother things we would like to do. If you want to talk and have votes, \nwe will just be having votes every 20 minutes the rest of the night. We \nare not going to stack them. You need to be reasonable. The request as \nit now stands--does Senator Graham have an addition?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The central Florida drug trafficking area amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand you have an amendment in there which they are \nattempting to work out.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I hope we can work it out. I want to be certain I am \nprotected in the event.\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew my request with the present conditions:\n  Bingaman amendment for 20 minutes;\n  Baucus amendment for 20 minutes;\n  McConnell amendment for 30 minutes;\n  Glenn amendment for 30 minutes;\n  Harkin amendment for 30 minutes;\n  And Senator Wellstone, two amendments, 20 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if you are \nnot on this list, does this mean you are precluded from offering your \namendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. No, you would be in the order about 10 or 11 o'clock.\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to make sure I am protected to offer my amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator's reservation is recognized, and if the issue \nis not worked out, he will have an opportunity to offer it and vote on \nit. Senator Daschle has a suggestion to make.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think we ought to add the Graham amendment and then \nlimit it to the ones on this list. I don't want to see this list grow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let's add Senator Graham to the list for 10 \nminutes. I don't think we can lock it in at this point because we have \nthe managers' amendment and other problems could be caused doing that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the very least, why don't we proceed \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to a vote on a \ntabling motion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree. I further ask that no second-degree amendments be \nin order prior to a vote on a tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest as amended by the minority leader? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3376\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, with regard to the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  Among the great attributes of our country, historic memory may not be \nour greatest strength. It was only 25 years ago that America found her \neconomy crippled by attempts made to compromise her national security \nby an oil embargo placed upon states that disagreed with fundamental \naspects of our national foreign policy.\n  The 1970s may be a memory, but we have been revisited by the low oil \nprices that preceded the oil embargo of that decade.\n  Mr. President, because of the foresight of this Congress in creating \na Strategic Petroleum Reserve, there is now space for 120 million \nbarrels of oil. This Congress had the foresight, during and after the \noil embargo, to plan to preserve our foreign policy independence, to \npreserve a large capacity to store oil so we could not be intimidated.\n  What is missing now is the foresight to fill that reserve. The \nSenator from New Mexico has noted there is no better time, with oil \nbeing sold at historically low prices. But it is important for Members \nof the Senate to understand that this is a propitious moment not only \nbecause the reserve has capacity and prices are low, but because in \nmany ways the principal factors that led to the embargo of the 1970s, \nin an attempt to exercise leverage over American foreign policy, many \nof those factors are being revisited.\n  In 1973, the United States imported less than 27 percent of its crude \noil requirements. In 1979, we imported less than 43 percent of our \nrequirements. Yet, an embargo, given those numbers, was enough to \ncreate a national recession, hyperinflation, and caused a serious \ndebate about foreign policy objectives.\n  The United States has now passed the 50 percent limit on importing \nforeign crude oil--9.2 million barrels per day--and by the year 2015 \ncould import fully 70 percent of America's oil. Indeed, in the last 10 \nyears, the rate of increase in the American importation of oil is more \nthan all the imported oil of all nations in the world, other than Japan \nand Russia. Not only are we dependent, not only is it at historic \nhighs, it is increasing.\n  Secretary of Energy Pena said:\n\n       The United States is highly dependent on Persian Gulf oil \n     for a large and growing percent of our imports.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not only a question of the level of our imports, \nit is also the fact that many of those importations of oil continue to \ncome from volatile areas of the world, including the Persian Gulf where \nwe have serious foreign policy disputes with nations in the region.\n  It is estimated by the year 2010, the Persian Gulf's share of world \nexport markets could surpass 67 percent, a level not seen since the oil \nembargoes of 1973 and 1974. Simultaneously, while American dependence \non foreign oil is increasing, and world dependence on Persian Gulf oil \nis increasing, the United States continues to abandon domestic wells at \nan extraordinary rate. In the last 10 years alone, 173,000 U.S. oil \nwells have been abandoned. And oil production from smaller stripper \nwells is at its lowest level in 50 years.\n  Mr. President, at a time when Americans are enjoying a low price for \noil and foreign policy threats have retreated for the moment, it is \ndifficult for the Senator from New Mexico to rise and gain support of \nthe Congress for this important initiative. But almost certainly this \ncountry will be revisited at another time when there will be an attempt \nto compromise our foreign policy and use the economic leverage of oil \nagainst this country.\n  We cannot be so foolish to forget what the oil lines were like or the \nrecessions or the high inflation. In only a year after the Shah fell in \nIran, in 1979, oil prices rose 250 percent. There are few easy ways to \nguard against this attempted intimidation or the economic shocks that \nwould follow. Indeed, I know of only one. It is not perfect, it is not \ncomplete, but it is a contribution--it is the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  It is time again to take advantage of these low prices to begin \nfilling the reserve. For that reason, Mr. President, I rise in favor of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do not know how much time is left on \nthe amendment, but I would like to speak briefly on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls the time, \nand there are 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from New Mexico.\n  I rise in support of the amendment authorizing the purchase of 420 \nmillion dollars worth of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. First \nof all, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it \nis my responsibility to protect the energy security interests of this \ncountry. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created for emergency \npurposes.\n  This amendment today would accomplish several goals: one, replace the \noil that has been sold over the past several years for budgetary \npurposes. Now is a most opportune time to buy oil, when prices are at a \n30-year low.\n  In this context, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that the \naverage price of the oil in the SPR is about $33 a barrel. Over the \npast several years, the average price we have gotten in selling it is \nabout $19 a barrel. So far, the Government has not done very well. I do \nnot know whether they figured they would make it up in volume, but it \nis certainly poor business to buy high and sell low.\n  By taking action earlier this year, we stopped a proposed sale of oil \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was ordered in the 1998 \nInterior appropriations bill. We saved the American taxpayers over $\\1/\n2\\ billion by that action, and our energy security insurance policy \nremained intact. We did this, Mr. President, on an emergency \nappropriations bill.\n  Over the past 3 years, we have steadily drained our Nation's energy \nsecurity insurance policy. The drain started in 1996 when the \nDepartment of Energy proposed the sale of $96 million worth of oil to \npay for the decommissioning of the Weeks Island facility. In other \nwords, we had a piggy bank. We broke into it. We did it in order to \nmeet some budgetary requirements. We have had a hard time staying out \nof that piggy bank ever since.\n  In addition to the sale we canceled last year, there have been three \nadditional sales. In January of 1996, the Balanced Budget Downpayment \nAct authorized the sale of $5.1 million barrels from Weeks Island. The \noil cost a total of $40.33 a barrel. We sold it for $18.82. We lost \n$110 million.\n  In the 1996 budget agreement, we required the sale of 12.8 million \nbarrels for $227 million. Based upon the average cost of oil in the \nSPR, the American taxpayer lost approximately $200 million.\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\n  The fiscal year 1997 appropriations required the sale of 10 million \nbarrels for $220 million. Oil prices were up that winter, so the \nAmerican taxpayer lost only $110 million.\n  So far we have lost the American taxpayer $\\1/2\\ billion by selling \noil that we put in the SPR by buying it high and selling it low. And, \nof course, two years ago the President proposed to balance the budget \nin the year 2002 by selling $1.5 billion worth of SPR oil at $10 a \nbarrel, which would be 150,000 barrels of oil. I am grateful that wiser \nheads have prevailed.\n  However, we did not stop the drip, drip, drip of small sales, the \nappropriations process. As I indicated, we paid an average of $33 per \nbarrel. With three sales so far, it has cost the taxpayers a great deal \nof money--$\\1/2\\ billion. But now we have an opportunity to stop that \nby pursuing the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, who is also a member of the Energy Committee, because we are \nable to at an all-time low.\n  It is a great investment for our national energy security interests. \nI am told that what we are doing now is replacing, in this 28 million \nbarrels, the amount that we have sold over the past several years for \nbudgetary purposes. So while we are still short of our objective of a \n90-day supply of net imports, we will be somewhere in the area of a 64-\nday supply.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Let me congratulate my \nfriend from New Mexico for offering it. I yield the floor and yield \nback whatever time I have.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his strong support of this amendment and his leadership on \nthis issue over many years.\n  Let me also indicate the strong support that we have had from the \nIndependent Petroleum Association of America and the National Stripper \nWell Association. I thank them for the good work they have done in \ndeveloping the facts that support what we are doing here.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the President and chairman of \nthose two organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         IPAA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Murkowski: The Independent \n     Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) and the National \n     Stripper Well Association (NSWA) write in support of your \n     amendment to the FY 1999 Treasury/Postal Appropriations. IPAA \n     and NSWA, national associations representing America's 8,000 \n     crude oil and natural gas producers, applaud your effort to \n     seek an emergency appropriation of $420 million to purchase \n     28 million barrels of crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve (SPR).\n       Throughout 1998, America's independent oil producers have \n     been experiencing a price crisis of historic magnitude. From \n     October 1997 through July 1998, crude oil prices have dropped \n     more than $7.00 per barrel. In many producing regions, oil \n     producers are facing price declines of up to $10.00 per \n     barrel.\n       A combination of events--increased foreign oil production, \n     the collapse of Asian economies, and a mild winter--helped to \n     create a temporary oversupply of crude oil on the world \n     market. The result of the price collapse is that many of the \n     500,000 marginal oil wells, representing 20 percent of U.S. \n     production or the same volume of oil imported from Saudi \n     Arabia, are at risk of being permanently shut-in.\n       The amendment, which is similar to the recent $500 million \n     emergency appropriation to remove excess agriculture \n     commodities from the world market, would benefit (1) domestic \n     oil producers, (2) the economies of the U.S. and other \n     countries, and (3) U.S. national security.\n       1. Removing 28 million barrels of oil from a saturated \n     market would help stabilize oil prices. In effect, policy \n     makers would be signaling oil markets that the U.S. \n     government is committed to preserving America's true \n     strategic petroleum reserve--domestic crude oil producers.\n       This action could potentially increase prices to levels \n     that would keep marginal oil wells economic. The average \n     marginal oil well produces 2.2 barrels per day and costs \n     $41.11 a day to operate. When oil sells for $14 a barrel, the \n     marginal well generates only $30.80, resulting in a loss of \n     $10.31 per day. Annually, the well loses $3,752. For a \n     typical operator of 100 marginal wells, annual losses exceed \n     $375,000.\n       2. This one-time purchase of oil for the SPR will stimulate \n     U.S. and world economies. According to the National Petroleum \n     Councils' 1994 Marginal Wells report, marginal wells generate \n     80,000 jobs and contribute an annual $14.4 billion to the \n     U.S. economy. When oil prices fall, so do state and federal \n     revenues. IPAA estimates that from November 1997 through July \n     1998 state severance taxes and federal oil royalties have \n     dropped by more than $819 million.\n       The consequence of these revenue losses falls not on the \n     producer but on the nation's citizens. The pinch is already \n     being felt in state school spending where a great deal of \n     this revenue is used. Construction spending, book purchases, \n     and other key costs for state schools are being constrained \n     because of lost revenues.\n       Additionally, the oversupply of oil on the world market is \n     having a serious impact on the economies of Russia, \n     Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries. Last week, the \n     International Monetary Fund announced the approval of an \n     additional $11.2 billion in aid to Russia. Of that amount, \n     $2.9 billion was directed to make up for shortfalls in \n     Russia's oil export earnings.\n       3. The purchase of crude oil for the SPR would enhance \n     America's energy and economic security. U.S. dependence on \n     oil imports has grown to 54 percent, and is projected to \n     climb to 61 percent by 2015. The SPR is America's best tool \n     to combat the impact of growing import dependence and \n     possible disruptions in crude oil supply. However, the \n     federal government has sold 28 million barrels of oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Revenues raised from all \n     three non-emergency sales were used to pay for government \n     programs and to balance the federal budget.\n       Given the low price of crude oil, the purchase of \n     additional stockpiles for the SPR would be a bargain for the \n     U.S. Treasury. This purchase should be viewed as an asset \n     transfer rather than spending. Purchasing cheap oil for the \n     SPR makes good business sense for the U.S. government and \n     more importantly, for the tax paying citizens of this \n     country.

In the spirit of cooperation, although I have been \nallotted 20 minutes, I will be very brief, hoping I can pick up a vote \nor two. It is a good amendment, anyway.\n  Very simply, the matter is this: In my State, and I know various \nother Senators in various other States, ran into a problem with the \nPostal Service. Namely, when the Postal Service wants to properly \nclose, relocate or build a new post office, it has been, frankly, not \nthe most sensitive operation in the world. That is, just close a post \noffice, announce a closure, and that is it--giving the public and \ncommunities no say and no opportunity to comment on the closing, no \nopportunity to work out some accommodation with the Postal Service.\n  There are many examples of this. Let me give one in Livingston, MT. \nThe Postal Service decided they were going to close the post office in \ndowntown Livingston, just announced that they will build a new building \non the edge of town. The community was up in arms because they had no \nnotice of this, they had no opportunity to try to work something out \nwith the Postal Service. This is a very, very, very, popular part of \ntown. It is the center of a small town. People go to the post office, \nlinger, talk to their friends. It is basically kind of a commons. To \nhave this willy-nilly moved out of town is quite disruptive to the \ncommunity.\n  So one day when I was in Livingston, I decided to walk over to the \npost office to see what was going on there. The Postal Service might \nhave a good argument, but the folks also had a pretty good argument. So \nI walked over to the post office. They said I couldn't come in. They \nsaid, ``Sorry, Senator, you can't come in. We have to check in with \nheadquarters to see if you can come in or not: So I say, ``OK.'' I \ncooled my heels for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes; 45 \nminutes later they got OK and approval from the headquarters \nsomeplace--maybe the Denver office, I don't know--that I could come to \nthe post office, walk around and see why they needed to move the post \noffice.\n  I wasn't being arrogant. I wasn't being unreasonable at all. I was \njust being a person. This is one example of the arrogance that we run \nup against. As it turns out, as a consequence of this, they are very \nembarrassed and sat down and worked out a solution with the community.\n  My amendment is very simple. Basically, it says whenever the Postal \nService wants to close a post office, and I am sure there are needs to \nclose post offices, and there are needs to relocate. Whenever they \nclose or decide to relocate, they have to do several things.\n  No. 1, give notice. Give notice to the public, 60 days' notice to the \ncommunities being served. No. 2, have a hearing. No. 3, that they abide \nby the local zoning requirements of the community.\n  It is quite simple. I know the Postal Service will object, saying, \ngee, Congress shouldn't get into managing the Postal Service, and we \nare not getting into the managing of the Postal Service. We are saying \ngive the communities an opportunity to be heard. If the Postal Service \nand the Commission reject the community's demand, that is it. There is \nno right of appeal or judicial jurisdiction over any decision made by \nthe Postal Commission after the public has an opportunity to comment.\n  It is my experience that sometimes when a Government agency sits down \nwith a community, in advance, and talks it over with the community and \nasks their opinions about things before making a decision of what they \nwill do, that usually things work out pretty well.\n  On the other hand, if an agency doesn't in advance go talk to the \ncommunity, but just announces a decision arbitrarily, the community \nfeels like it has not been consulted and it hasn't been consulted. The \ncommittee feels like they are taken for granted. The fact is that we \nare talking about the public. They are the employers. The employees are \nthe Postal Service. I just ask Senators to support this amendment \nbecause it does give communities a little bit of a say in where the \nfacilities are located. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my good friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to argue in support of an \namendment sponsored by myself and Senator Baucus that would require the \nU.S. Postal Service to let communities know when they are planning to \nshut down, relocate, or consolidate a community's post office. This \namendment aims to preserve the fabric of downtowns and prevent sprawl \nby giving citizens a say in Postal Service decisions to close, \nrelocate, or consolidate their local post office.\n\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors Association, \nthe National League of Cities, the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation, the National Association of Postmasters of the United \nStates, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation \nOfficers, the American Planning Association, the Association of United \nStates Postal Lessors, and the International Downtown Association.\n  Coming from a small town in Vermont, I understand the importance \ndowntowns or village centers play in the identity and longevity of a \ncommunity. Downtowns are where people go to socialize, shop, learn what \ntheir elected representatives are doing, and gather to celebrate \nholidays with their neighbors.\n  One of the focal points of any downtown area is the community's post \noffice. Post offices have been part of downtowns and village centers as \nlong as most cities and towns have existed. These post offices are \noften located in historic buildings and have provided towns with a \nsense of continuity as their communities have changed over time. The \nremoval of this focal point can quickly lead to the disappearance of \ncontinuity and spirit of a community and then the community itself.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will enable the inhabitants of small \nvillages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides \nthat their local post office will be closed, relocated, or \nconsolidated. Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is \nnecessary. A few stories from my home state of Vermont will answer this \nquestion.\n  A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, \nVermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the \nsmall village center for a new building outside of town. By the time \nthe community was aware of the project, plans were so far along--the \nnew building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the \npost office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully \ninvestigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in \ncontrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we \ncertainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more \nto get our mail.'' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented \nthat as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of \ncommunity are woven and reinforced. ``It may be intangible, but its \nreal, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation \nof the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like \nPerkinsville.''\n  In 1988, the post office in the Stockbridge, Vermont, General Store \nneeded to expand. The store owner tried to find money to rehabilitate \nan 1811 barn next to the store to provide the needed space, but was not \nsuccessful. In 1990, the post office moved into a new facility located \non the outskirts of Stockbridge on a previously undeveloped section of \nland at the intersection of two highways. People can no longer walk to \nthe post office as they once were able to do when it was located in the \nvillage center. The relocation of the Stockbridge post office \nunfortunately removed one of the anchors of the community.\n  These are not isolated examples.\n  Mr. President, post office relocations are not only occurring in \nVermont, but all across the country. My colleagues will quickly \ndiscover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the \npost office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, \ndeprived access to citizens without cars, and contributed to urban \nsprawl.\n  The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in \na community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing or \nconsolidation of a post office. This community\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nvoice has been lacking in the current process. This bill does not give \nthe citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing or \nconsolidation. Instead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure \ncommunity voices and concerns are heard and taken into account by the \nPostal Service.\n  Additionally, this act will require the Postal Service to abide by \nlocal zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal \nbuildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the \nability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has \nlead to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety \nstandards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such \nas storm water management.\n  Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are \ncenters of social and business interaction. In communities where post \noffices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become \nintegral to these communities' identities. I believe that this \nlegislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal \nService, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and me in support of this \nimportant amendment.\n  This is a simple amendment. I can't believe it can't be accepted.\n  Vermonters are tired of waking up in the morning and finding out \ntheir post office will be somewhere else. Under the proposed rule, all \nthey get is a notice in the mail. There is no public hearing required. \nThere is no way to appeal. It is just given carte blanche as to what \nthey want to do.\n  In one little town in Vermont, they found out their post office moved \n2 miles outside of town, and the people who had gathered in the \nvillage, a lot of the reason they gathered in the village was to be \nable to walk to the post office. They have to go 2 miles to get their \nmail.\n  No notice, no ability to participate at all. Blanket exemption for \nmany zoning rules. They don't have to even take care of what the \nplanning for the town has been. There is an exemption from the historic \npreservation rule. It says they can exempt projects from the new \nstandards if the project is to meet an emergency requirement or is for \ntemporary use, with no definition of what they are.\n  You are at the complete mercy of the post office to stick it anywhere \nthey want. I tell you, our post offices are up in arms over this. All \nwe want is a simple logical way where people are notified, they get a \nchance to be heard, they find out where the locations are going to be, \nthey have an opportunity to make suggestions, and then they get on with \nlife. But right now the way it is, it has my people in Vermont in the \nsmall town areas deeply upset. They have got postmasters who are ready \nto march on Washington. Why? Because we want some simple, commonsense \nrules to be abided by so that there is local input as to where your \nnext post office is going to be.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition, reluctantly, to \nthis amendment because I agree very strongly with the fact that \ncustomers and residents of an area where a post office facility is \nlocated that is considered for relocation, consolidation, or closing, \nought to have an opportunity to have a say-so in that process.\n  For over a year, our subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the \nlegislation involving the Postal Service, has been working closely with \nofficials at the U.S. Postal Service to try to improve the processes. I \ncan tell you that we have received a lot of cooperation, and I am \nconvinced that we will continue to receive cooperation in improving \nthis process and showing some sensitivity to political concerns and to \nlocal interests that are affected by these decisions.\n  The Postal Service's continued efforts are appreciated very much by \nme. I think it would be a mistake for the Senate to legislate a new set \nof requirements or procedures that the U.S. Postal Service would have \nto follow. It would have the effect of undoing a lot of the good work \nthat has been done recently when we have tried to work with them on \nthis issue.\n  In fact, Postmaster General Henderson has recently placed a \nmoratorium on the closing of small post offices. This is an important \nissue. I agree with that. It deserves the attention of the Congress. \nBut it is also a complex issue, one that should receive the careful \nconsideration of the legislative committee in the due course of \nbusiness, not by the adoption of an amendment, with 10 minutes of \ndebate on each side, attached to an appropriations bill.\n  This amendment would add a lengthy procedural set of requirements for \nall facility replacements, relocations, and closings. If a fire \ndestroyed a postal facility, for example, necessary replacement would \nbe delayed, as this new process--if we adopt it--ran its course. For \neach facility change, the postmasters would have to write to each \ncustomer explaining what, why, and when the action was planned. A \npublic hearing would then be required, with testimony received from \npersons served by the facility. The Service would then have to respond \nin writing to any proposal of an alternative, giving reasons for \nrejecting such proposal. And then if one postal customer objects, the \nproposed action could be appealed to the Postal Rate Commission, \ncausing additional delay.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to seriously slow down the \nfacility modernization program of the U.S. Postal Service. The Service \nhas over 35,000 facilities around the country, and 8,000 of these \nfacilities were modernized or improved during the last year.\n  The Service has just recently published in the Federal Register new \nrequirements that it is imposing on itself for consultation with local \nleaders and customers on all facility projects. The projects must be \npublicized in the local newspaper and a public hearing held to explain \nthe proposal. Additionally, local public officials receive at least a \n45-day notice before the Postal Service solicits for a new site. The \nnew processes should provide ample opportunity for public input in a \nresponsible and orderly way. I think they should be given a chance to \nwork.\n  I urge Senators to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your side has 3 minutes 6 seconds. The other \nside has 6 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield a minute and a half to my good \nfriend from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the list of things I presented is the \nlist that the Senator from Mississippi was talking about. It doesn't do \nanything for you. It allows you to know and gives you a 1-day notice. \nYou get it in the mail and you find out the next day where it is \nlocated. There is a minimum 60 days for the--there is a gross \nexemption, blanket exemption, of the zoning requirements. They are \nexempt from new standards if it is for temporary use, but there is no \ndefinition of what that is. All these things I mentioned are what we \nare talking about. That is why we believe very strongly that our \namendment should prevail and we will work it out in conference.\n  I yield whatever time I have.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Simply, Mr. President, this is already in the law. A \nperson may already appeal a decision to close a post office. The \nCommission then decides whether that is reviewable. We are not changing \nthat. That is in the law today. Any person can appeal the decision made \nby the Postal Service to close a post office. That is in the law today. \nWe are saying, at least give the community notice that they are going \nto close. If that is done, then fewer people are going to appeal. That \nis all this is.\n  I just urge Senators to vote for something which is just common sense \nand reasonable. It is not going to be an excessive burden on the Postal \nService. It is just asking for people up front to have an opportunity \nto be in on the process.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof the time in opposition and move to table the amendment. I don't want \nto\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\ncut off any Senator's right to express themselves. I yield back the \ntime left on this side on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if the Senator from Ohio will yield \nmomentarily, I know he is up next, but I think we have an agreement \nthat will help us bring this to conclusion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3378\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have to act on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3378) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am continuing to struggle to try to get a \nfinite list of amendments. I think we have that. I know a number of \nthese amendments will be worked out, will be included in the managers' \npackage. I have discussed this arrangement and this list with the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the ranking member, and with Senator \nDaschle. I believe this is the best way to get this to a conclusion \nthat would be fair to one and all.\n  Again, I do note, before I make that unanimous consent request, that \nwe do have some Senators who are going to represent the entire body at \nthe funeral in the morning. So we are trying to go ahead and take up \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill first thing in the \nmorning, lay it down at 9 o'clock, and then any stacked votes would \noccur at 1 o'clock.\n  To renew the bidding, in the earlier unanimous consent agreement, we \nhave lined up for consideration the McConnell amendment for 30 minutes, \nthe Glenn amendment for 30 minutes, and the Harkin amendment for 30 \nminutes; Harkin with regard to drug control, the other two with regard \nto FEC.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that no further first-degree amendments \nbe in order other than the list agreed to earlier this evening and the \nbelow-listed amendments, and they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments: Graham relevant amendment, managers' package; DeWine \nregarding Customs; Domenici regarding FLETC; Stevens relevant \namendment; Senators Daschle and Lott--one relevant each; Conrad \nregarding high-intensity drug areas; Dorgan regarding an advisory \ncommission; one by Graham; Harkin and Bingaman--all three on the high-\nintensity drug issue. I hope they could work those out or roll them \ninto one or something of that nature; Kerrey regarding sense of the \nSenate; and a Kohl managers' amendment.\n  I further ask all amendments must be offered and debated tonight and \nthe votes be postponed to occur at 1, if any are needed, on the \namendments. And, of course, final passage on Thursday, and that they \noccur in stacked sequence with 2 minutes for debate at that time before \neach vote for closing remarks, and that following those votes the bill \nbe advanced to third reading.\n  I further ask that if the motion relative to the Graham motion to \nreconsider is not tabled, the underlying amendment and motions be \nlimited to unlimited debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, through the Chair, address the majority leader: \nWe have a matter at 1 o'clock, for the hour. We have the Director of \nthe CIA coming. We have 35 Senators who have said they want to hear \nhim. It is going to be in 407. Could we do it at 2 o'clock, or 10 till, \nthe votes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield for a moment, it is the \nintention of the leader to take up the defense bill when we convene in \nthe morning, right?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With the understanding we can proceed with business \nother than votes prior to that time, I think we can handle it.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right. Then we would have those stacked votes at----\n  Mr. REID. At 2 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. At 2 o'clock? Is that agreeable with the chairman?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, it is. I ask the leader if there is any possibility \nwe might get some agreement, however, that we can see the amendments \nthat are going to be brought up in the balance of the day by noon \ntomorrow with regard to the Defense bill. If we could just have an \nindication what Senators are going to have amendments so we can start \nscheduling the action after the vote on the stacked amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say if I could, to the chairman, if there are \namendments that are debated and ready for a vote at that time, we could \nput them in the sequence at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would be happy to do that. We would like to see what \nthe remainder of the day, and Friday morning, is going to look like if \nwe are going to finish the bill sometime Friday.\n  Mr. LOTT. We amend the request, then, to 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the leader.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am trying to discern whether or not the post office \nin St. Paul named after Eugene McCarthy will be in the managers' \namendment? Is that correct?\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be accepted. The objection that has been lodged \nwill be withdrawn and the agreement was, the understanding was, when \nthat is withdrawn, the Senator had another amendment that he would \nwithhold.\n  Your amendment will be in the bill when it is passed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ndon't intend to, may I just have scheduled, between 12:30 and 1:30, 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Five minutes or so?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will make sure that occurs, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3379\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n 431 et seq.) to provide for appointment and term length for the staff \n director and general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration on behalf of myself, Senator McCain, \nSenator Bennett and Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3379.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following section:\n\n     SEC. __. PROVISIONS FOR STAFF DIRECTOR AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF \n                   THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Appointment and Term of Service.--\n       (1) In general.--The first sentence of section 306(f)(1) of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n     437c(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``by the Commission'' and \n     inserting ``by an affirmative vote of not less than 4 members \n     of the Commission for a term of 4 years''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply with respect to any individual serving as the \n     staff director or general counsel of the Federal Election \n     Commission on or after January 1, 1999, without regard to \n     whether or not the individual served as staff director or \n     general counsel prior to such date.\n       (b) Treatment of Individuals Filling Vacancies; Termination \n     of Authority Upon Expiration of Term.--Section 306(f)(1) of \n     such Act (2 U.S.C. 437c(f)(1)) is amended by inserting after \n     the first sentence the following: ``An individual appointed \n     as a staff director or general counsel to fill a vacancy \n     occurring other than by the expiration of a term of office \n     shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the \n     individual whose term is being filled. An individual serving \n     as staff director or general counsel may not serve in such \n     position after the expiration of the individual's term unless \n     reappointed in accordance with this paragraph.''.\n       (c) Rule of Construction Regarding Authority of Acting \n     General Counsel.--Section 306(f) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     437c(f)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit \n     any individual serving as an acting general counsel of the \n     Commission from performing any functions of the general \n     counsel of the Commission.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had earlier offered to enter into a \nmuch shorter time agreement, because this amendment really requires \nvery little explanation.\n  Last year, in the Treasury-Postal bill, we enacted term limits for \nthe FEC Commissioners, and the terms of the Federal Election Commission \nmembers, Mr. President, are now one 6-year term.\n  This amendment continues the necessary reform of the Federal Election \nCommission by providing that two critical staff members at the Federal \nElection Commission--the staff director and the general counsel--serve \na 4-year term, but it is important to note, these important staff \nmembers could continue to serve with the vote of four of the six FEC \nCommissioners. It is important to remember the FEC is a 3-3 Commission, \nthree Republicans, three Democrats. It was structured that way on \npurpose. It is necessary that it be structured that way.\n  A very important part of the Federal Election Commission team is the \nstaff director and the general counsel. Under the amendment that I have \noffered, cosponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Bennett and Senator \nWarner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, beginning in January, the \ngeneral counsel and the staff director will be subject to a 4-year \nterm, and in order to achieve that 4-year term, Mr. President, they \nwould have to enjoy the confidence of both parties; that is, they would \nhave to achieve four votes which means at least three of one party and \none of another----\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Those Senators \nwishing to continue discussions please take your discussions off the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Or for that matter, Mr. President, the general counsel \nmight achieve the votes of two of one party and two of another. In \nother words, four votes to achieve a 4-year term, after which the \ngeneral counsel, if he or she wanted to continue--and many of them \nmight not--would have to be able to reach across party lines, which is, \nof course, the spirit of the Federal Election Commission, in order to \nachieve a 4-year term.\n  There is really nothing else to say about this amendment. It \ncontinues the reform process.\n  Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes, 23 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwhatever time he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my understanding of the actions and \nactivities of the FEC up to this point indicate that it is an agency \nbadly in need of reform, and I am delighted that the term limits have \nbeen enacted. It is also my understanding that because of its past \nhistory, some Commissioners of the FEC have been less than diligent in \ntheir duties and, as a result, the power to run the Commission has \ndevolved to the staff.\n  When we debate term limits generally, we are often told that one of \nthe reasons we should oppose term limits is because it will put too \nmuch power in the hands of the staff. The staff becomes the permanent \nand institutional memory of the body, while those who are supposed to \nrun it keep cycling through on term limits.\n  I think it entirely appropriate that we give the new Commissioners, \nas their terms expire, the opportunity to act affirmatively on the \nstaff and not allow the power of inertia to keep staff members in \nforever and forever. It is a logical thing to do, and I am happy to \nsupport it and happy to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. If this is \nadopted, this means that this will be the only independent agency or \ndepartment of Government to time limit the general counsel or staff \ndirector--the only independent agency in the Government.\n  One of the FEC Commissioners has indicated to us what he thought \nwould happen in this regard. He said it would cause chaos in the agency \nbecause, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has said, the \nCommission normally must have four votes for any action to ensure \naction is bipartisan.\n  This means that if they were trying to get rid of the general counsel \nfor whatever reason, the amendment would allow a minority of three to \nfire the general counsel because there wouldn't be a majority to \nretain, there wouldn't be the four votes. So there is concern about who \nthey can get to even serve in a general counsel position in that \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n  I think this will go a long ways toward destroying the FEC's \nindependence in its own investigations under the law, because the \ngeneral counsel will have to continually lobby for reinstatement. That \njust doesn't make any sense. I see no reason why we should be carving \nout the FEC, which is so important to us these days in trying to get \nelections laws straightened out, to be the only independent agency in \nall of Government to have such a time limit put on their general \ncounsel or their staff director.\n  They serve there, they have served for longer terms before, and \nserved very honorably and well, but to place them under these different \nrestrictions on voting, that would mean a general counsel could be \nousted much more easily than I believe any of us would like to see and \nis something I don't think we should do.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose this. If there are any others who \nwish to speak against this amendment, I will be glad to yield such \ntime. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes, 52 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wonder if the Senator from Ohio will yield me 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield such time as the Senator may desire.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment offered \nby the Senator from Kentucky. I already spoke at length on the floor \nagainst a very similar amendment in its other incarnation in the other \nHouse. Fortunately, that body did not keep this provision on the bill.\n  What is happening here is the opposite of reform. It is the opposite \nof reform. This is an effort, plain and simple, to hamstring the agency \nthat is charged with the very important responsibility of enforcing the \nFederal election law to which we all have to adhere--the Federal \nElection Commission. This effort has deadly serious consequences in \nterms of the independence of this Commission, and it has to be \ndefeated.\n  The effect of the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky would be to \nresult in the firing of the Commission's general counsel. The amendment \ninvolves the Congress in the personnel decisions of the FEC, the agency \nthat we have charged with overseeing the way we conduct our reelection \ncampaigns.\n  The Senator from Kentucky wants to get rid of a career civil servant \nwho is simply trying to do his job to enforce the election laws. The \ncurrent general counsel's institutional memory and knowledge is \ncritically important now, because we are poised to confirm three new \nCommissioners, perhaps before the August recess.\n  If we do that, Mr. President, the Commission will be at full strength \nfor the first time in almost 3 years. It has been that long since all \nsix slots on the Commission were filled. And right as that happens, if \nwe adopt this amendment, we are going to throw the Commission into \nturmoil once again by getting rid of the general counsel and forcing \nthis newly constituted Commission to come to agreement on someone else. \nThat could take months and hamper the enforcement efforts of the \nCommission at a crucial time, a very interesting time, right after the \n1998 elections.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand, as the Senator \nfrom Ohio has well stated, just how unprecedented this micromanaging of \nan agency's personnel decisions is.\n  No other agency must reappoint or replace its top staff every 4 \nyears--not one. According to the Congressional Research Service, there \nare three independent agencies where the general counsel is actually a \npolitical appointee, nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. In each of these cases, the general counsel has direct \nstatutory authority.\n  But in every other independent agency, including the FEC, the general \ncounsel is appointed by either the chairman or the entire body and \nserves at the pleasure of the appointing entity. That is what the law \nis now with respect to the FEC, and there is no reason to change it.\n  In recent years, the FEC has undertaken a number of controversial \nactions in a very reasonable attempt to enforce the law that the \nCongress has written. Some of these cases have taken on very powerful \npolitical figures or groups--and they have done it on both sides of the \naisle. And the crucial point is that the FEC itself has authorized all \nof these cases by a majority vote. If you don't like a case that the \nFEC has filed, you need to look to the Commission, not the general \ncounsel. He is just trying to do his job as he sees fit.\n  What we have here, Mr. President, is an effort to intimidate an \nagency. The proponents of this firing want to punish the FEC's general \ncounsel for bringing forward recommendations to enforce the law, even \nthough in all of the cases I have mentioned, a bipartisan majority of \nthe commission has agreed with him. In every one of those cases a \nbipartisan group has agreed to take the action.\n  Mr. President, I submit that we cannot let this happen. We need to \nlet the professional staff of the FEC do its job. Surely the 3 to 3 \nparty split on the Commission is enough to make sure that the \nCommission doesn't go off on some partisan vendetta. We must stop the \npartisan vendetta that this proposal represents. Protect the \nindependence of the FEC and the nonpartisan nature of its staff by \ndefeating the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McConnell \namendment. If this provision is enacted, the traditional bipartisan \nbalance of the Federal Elections Commission will be disrupted. Under \nthis provision the general counsel and staff director of the FEC can \nessentially be fired by either the three Democratic or Republican \nCommissioners on the FEC.\n  This amendment has the potential of paralyzing the Federal Elections \nCommission and further eroding what is already a weakened campaign \noversight agency.\n  Mr. President, such a move would be unprecedented in the Federal \nGovernment. According to a memorandum prepared by the Congressional \nResearch Service, no general counsel which is not subject to Senate \nconfirmation may be removed in this manner. It would be ironic that the \nagency charged with investigating political campaigns is crippled by \nCongress.\n  When this amendment was put forward in the House of Representatives, \nthe New York Times noted that this provision would cripple the FEC and \nguarantee ``an open field for influence peddlers and influence \nbuyers.''\n  In a year when this Congress failed to pass campaign finance reform, \nit would be even more tragic if we crippled the only watchdogs of our \ncampaign finance system.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment which proposes to \nlimit the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) general counsel and staff \ndirector to a term of 4 years unless four of the six Commissioners vote \nto renew their terms. The Commission is composed of six members--three \nRepublicans and three Democrats.\n  Consistent with the FEC's overall statutory scheme, requiring a \nmajority decision to take official action, four votes are currently \nneeded to remove the general counsel or staff director from office. If \nthis amendment is adopted, four affirmative votes would be required for \nthese officials to retain their position. That means three \nCommissioners from the same party voting as a block could force the \ntermination of either the general counsel or the staff director and \nhold hostage either of the two top career officials at the FEC.\n  This amendment injects partisanship into the carefully balanced \nbipartisan structure at the FEC. Further, this could cause the staff to \nmake recommendations based on partisan considerations in order to \nprotect their jobs. These consequences would be extremely detrimental \nto the administration of the FEC and the enforcement of our campaign \nfinance laws.\n  There appears to be little question that the purpose of this \nprovision is to retaliate against the general counsel, Lawrence Noble, \nfor certain actions. The general counsel recently made several \ncontroversial recommendations to the Commission. In response to 1997 \nrulemaking petitions filed by President Clinton and others, Mr. Noble \nrecommended that the FEC seek public\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\ncomment on a proposal to prohibit the use of soft money in connection \nwith federal elections.\n  Acting on the general counsel's recommendation, the Commission also \npursued cases in court that have received negative reactions from some \nMembers. A review of Mr. Noble's record indicates that he has been \nnonpartisan, balanced and fair. Mr. Noble has aggressively pursued \nenforcement of campaign finance laws against Democrats and Republicans \nalike.\n  In a year in which the need for campaign finance reform has received \nso much attention, Congress would be sending the wrong message if it \npasses a provision designed to weaken the very agency responsible for \nenforcing campaign finance laws.\n  I urge you to oppose this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. One other item I would like to note for everyone's \nillumination on this.\n  The House had a similar provision to that which is proposed by the \nSenator from Kentucky. They had a similar provision in the bill when it \ncame to the House floor. They had a debate over there on this very \nprovision which was described to me as being a bitter debate, a lot of \nrancor in it. It wound up with a bipartisan effort being put forward to \nstrike this position on the floor of the House; and it was struck. They \nvoted this provision out of the House bill on a bipartisan vote. And \nnow this is an effort being made to put it back in on the floor of the \nSenate here.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the House vote was on a point of order. \nIn fact, this particular reform has been recommended by the House \nauthorizing committee. Let us not make this more complicated than it \nis.\n  All this amendment does that the Senator from Kentucky has offered, \nin concert with the Senator from Utah, is require that on this--in this \nunique agency; it is different from any other agency in the Federal \nGovernment; it is three and three: three Republicans and three \nDemocrats--to require that in this agency every 4 years the top two \nstaff people enjoy enough confidence across party lines to be \nreappointed for 4 years.\n  In fact, Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the agency will, \nin fact, be operated on a bipartisan basis because any staff director \nor general counsel who, after 4 years in the office, cannot get the \nconfidence of both parties, Mr. President, clearly is not operating on \na bipartisan basis and therefore should not be reappointed.\n  So it is, in fact, this amendment that ensures that the Federal \nElection Commission achieves its original mission, which was to operate \non a bipartisan basis.\n  I see that my friend from Utah is on the floor. I yield to him \nwhatever time he may need.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I simply have to respond to the notion that this is an \namendment to fire the incumbent general counsel. That is what we were \ntold in the last debate. That assumes that the present general counsel \ndoes not enjoy bipartisan support. That assumes that the present \ngeneral counsel has conducted himself in such a way that he cannot \ngather the necessary four votes. I have no knowledge that that is \nindeed the case. But if it is indeed the case, it is a strong argument \nfor saying that the present general counsel probably should not be in \nhis job.\n  If he cannot muster bipartisan support to hold this job, we have a \nsituation where he is obviously supporting one party over the other in \norder to maintain those three votes. That is the only conclusion that \ncan be drawn from the argument made by the Senator from Wisconsin who \nclaims this is an attempt to fire the incumbent general counsel.\n  There is nothing in here that says this is an attempt to fire the \nincumbent general counsel. It simply says the incumbent general counsel \nhas to enjoy bipartisan support. And if he is as wonderful and as \nbipartisan as the Senator from Wisconsin says he is, he has nothing to \nfear from this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Utah, in further \nelaboration, after the enactment of this into law, we are not making \nthe general counsel or the staff director subject to removal on a whim. \nThey have a 4-year term, an opportunity to develop a record of \nbipartisan cooperation with both the Republicans and the Democrats on \nthe Federal Election Commission before reaching the end of the 4-year \nterm. At that point, if they want to continue enjoying enough \nconfidence across party lines to achieve another 4-year appointment--it \nseems to me eminently reasonable. And, Mr. President, I think it \nguarantees that the Federal Election Commission will be the kind of \nagency that the Congress intended it to be when it was created in the \nmid 1970s.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, if I have any.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. We are prepared to go to a vote. I am prepared to yield \nback the remainder of my time if the Senator from Kentucky is prepared \nto do the same thing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back by both \nparties. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth Coliguri, a member \nof my staff, be given floor privileges for the remainder of the \nconsideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is obviously some misunderstanding about the \nearlier consent agreement that was entered into between all of us and \nthe Parliamentarian. I think there is no misunderstanding among the \nSenators, so I ask unanimous consent that all of the amendments debated \ntonight be voted upon in order of their offering beginning at 2 o'clock \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the order.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to \nobject, but my understanding is the majority leader proposed that and \nit was already entered. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There was some misunderstanding by the Parliamentarian \nas to whether we were voting further tonight. I do not think there was \nany misunderstanding among Senators.\n  Mr. GLENN. OK. Fine. Whatever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3380\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for enforcement activities of \n                    the Federal Election Commission)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. GLENN], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3380.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 44, line 13, insert after ``$33,700,000'' the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,800,000 to be used for \n     enforcement activities)''.\n       On page 46, line 18, strike ``$5,665,585,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,662,785,000''.\n       On page 56, line 20, strike ``$5,665,585,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,662,785,000''.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send this to the desk, along with my \ncosponsors, Senators Jeffords, Kohl, Levin, Feingold, and Dodd. I offer \nthis amendment to increase the budgeted funds a small amount for \nenforcement efforts by the Federal Election Commission. This agency \nbears the very difficult and thankless task of policing all of our \ncampaigns in the whole Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out, first, that this amendment \nwas offered in the House, was debated there, and was approved. And the \namendment I offer today adds exactly the same amount. It is just an \nadditional $2.8 million to the FEC budget. The money would help the \nagency to investigate and prove wrongdoing. These additional funds are \njust a small step toward giving the Commission the resources that it \nreally needs.\n\n  In past years, we have seen attempts by Congress to stop vigorous \nenforcement of the law by failing to provide an adequate budget for \nthis agency. Just last year, following an election in which \nunprecedented abuse of the campaign finance laws occurred, Congress \nrefused to give money to the FEC to hire more staff to investigate \nthese abuses. I thought that was a tragedy.\n  Just last week in the House, we saw an extraordinary display of \nbipartisanship because the House defeated provisions intended to \npoliticize the agency, and instead approved additional funds, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, for the Federal Election Commission. The extra \nmoney was set aside very specifically to help the FEC pay for \ninvestigations, many stemming from the events of the 1996 campaign. \nThose of us who support campaign finance reform--which is a clear \nmajority in this body--agree that the system is broken and needs to be \nfixed.\n  Until we can pass new laws, we must at least allow the agency we \ncreated to do its best to actively and vigorously enforce the existing \nlaw. This amendment takes an important step toward assuring that the \nFEC can do just that. This amendment is a renewed commitment by the \nMembers of Congress to make a real effort to ensure that people who \nviolate our existing campaign finance laws are found and are held \naccountable. This is the only way we can assure the continued integrity \nof our election process.\n  Last year, we saw a lot of effort on campaign finance reform, and \nwith Chairman Thompson, I had the privilege of serving as the ranking \nmember of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' investigation into the \n1996 campaign finance fiasco. During the course of those hearings, \nChairman Thompson called on several campaign finance experts to \ntestify. One of those witnesses was Norm Ornstein of the Brookings \nInstitution who told us in testimony that he believed that the FEC \nwould probably need at least $50 million--that is about twice what they \nare receiving--in order to become an effective enforcement agency.\n  These funds I am proposing are a very small step. They just match the \nHouse funds that have already passed over there. It is a small step, \nbut still leaves the agency woefully short of what experts think it \nneeds.\n  Let me give a little bit of perspective of the job facing the FEC. \nRight now, the FEC has 200 cases pending; 93 of those cases are under \ninvestigation and 107 cases, over half, are sitting in a file cabinet. \nWhy? Why are these cases just sitting there in the cabinets with no \naction? They are waiting for staff to become available for these 200 \ncases. The FEC can only afford 25 staff attorneys.\n  How about the investigators who could help the attorneys? The FEC has \ntwo, which they consider a great improvement from 1994 when they had \nexactly zero. They had none. By way of contrast, on last year's \ninvestigative staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, we had 44 \nlawyers and a dozen investigators, and we weren't dealing with the \nwhole aspect of everything the FEC has to deal with. We were dealing \nwith only one limited aspect of what occurred during the 1996 campaign. \nWe faced nowhere near the caseload that confronts the agency that is \ntrying to do the best job it can on a real shoestring.\n  I think we can all agree it doesn't matter how good the law that you \nhave, if it isn't actively and vigorously enforced, it means nothing. \nIt becomes a scofflaw. The Federal Election Commission already enforces \na law readily exploited and bent in ways never intended. We, in \nCongress, fail to give the FEC the resources to find and hold \naccountable those who willfully violate these laws, who misuse soft \nmoney, who attempt to disguise political ads as issue advertising, and \non and on. With all of the things we know that can happen, how can we \nhope to ensure the public has confidence in its elections and in its \nelected officials?\n  This amendment is a very, very small and reasonable step towards \nallowing the FEC to accomplish its mission and enforce the law. I hope \nmy colleague will support it. I repeat, it is one that has already \npassed in the House. We just matched the figure of $2.8 million that \nthey have already passed in the House. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, the FEC is clearly not \nunderfunded. Its budget has more than doubled in the past decade. They \nare already getting $2 million more this year than last year under the \nbudget of the Senator from Colorado, who has been quite generous to the \nFederal Election Commission--frankly, beyond what I would have done had \nI been in his shoes. The FEC's problems are certainly not on the \nfinancial side.\n  Senator Glenn would give them an extra $2.8 million over and above \nthe additional $2 million that the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nis already providing for this agency. You are talking about a 16-\npercent budget increase, a 16-percent budget increase for the Federal \nElection Commission. I think the U.S. district court, in a recent case, \nsaid it best when they reported in a Wall Street Journal editorial of \nJuly 13:\n\n       If there is one thing all the players agree on, it is the \n     need for better disclosure of contributions and a crackdown \n     on violators. But a Federal court this week [the Wall Street \n     Journal referring to a court decision] signaled that the \n     Nation's electoral traffic cop, the Federal Election \n     Commission, is lax in carrying out even that basic function.\n\n  That is the point. The basic function of the Federal Election \nCommission is disclosure.\n  The distinguished Senator from Colorado has more than adequately \nprovided funding for this agency. To give them the additional money \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Ohio would provide a 16-\npercent increase over last year. Clearly, that is not appropriate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that's difficult to respond to, to say the \nFEC needs more resources. My distinguished colleague, my friend from \nKentucky, says they need to monitor disclosure better; but how do they \nmonitor that if they don't have the people to do it? They should crack \ndown on violators. How do they crack down if they don't have the people \non the staff to do it? They have a grand total of 25 staff attorneys. \nUntil 1994, they didn't have any investigators.\n  To say that we put them up a certain percentage this year, when \nestimates we had in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwere that we should probably double their budget to give them a fair \nshot at doing their job, which would put their budget up around, \nsomewhere around $50 million was the estimate, instead of where it is \nnow, to think if they could even come close to fulfilling the law and \nthe requirements they are supposed to monitor with the staff they have, \njust isn't right.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  I said in my statement a moment ago, the FEC has 200 cases pending. \nThey are only investigating 93. Why? It is because they don't have the \npeople to do it. To say that they don't need more money and are quite \nadequately funded just flies in the face of logic. They do not have \nadequate staff. They can't even keep up with these things. These cases \nare years and years old. Many of them will not even be settled before \nthe next election cycle comes around. They don't have the staff over \nthere for any expeditious treatment. Ninety-three of those cases are \nunder investigation, 107 cases are sitting in file cabinets for lack of \npeople.\n  In 1994, they didn't have any investigators and then they hired one. \nThen it was said later on they had 100-percent improvement in their \ninvestigative staff because they then hired two; they had two people on \ntheir investigative staff. None of these attorneys are people who are \nnormally going out and doing all the spadework, doing all of the \ninvestigating, doing the fieldwork out in the field. To say that they \nhave quite adequate funding because they went up a certain small \npercentage just flies in the face of logic.\n  I know we are not going to probably change many minds on this \nparticular subject, but if we are serious about ever improving our \ncampaign financing and having the FEC as the monitoring body that does \nthat, this is such a modest little amount of $2.8 million. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this and match the House with the exact same \namount the House put in. We wanted to match what they have done.\n  They had a debate on this in the House and decided to put this in. It \nwas because they felt they not only needed this, they probably needed \nmuch more, but could not get more through. I would like to see us do \nthis an extra $15 million or $20 million. I know we are not going to do \nthat here, but this is such a modest increase and they need it so badly \nthat I hope my colleagues will agree to the amendment I am proposing \nwhen we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm pleased to cosponsor and rise in \nsupport of the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn. And how fitting that Senator Glenn has taken the lead on this \nissue since he spent much of last year investigating the fundraising \nscandals of the 1996 election. I congratulate him on that work and on \noffering this very modest, but very important amendment today.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I have spent a lot of time on this floor \nin this Congress debating the McCain-Feingold bill, and the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. It has been a very difficult issue to make \nprogress on. We have a strong bipartisan majority, including seven \nSenators from the Republican side of the aisle, in support of reform. A \npartisan minority continues to block our bill.\n  But one area on which this entire body is united, Mr. President, is \nthe need to enforce the laws that are already on the book. In fact, \ntime after time when we debated the issue last fall and again early \nthis spring, opponents of our bill raised that issue as a reason that \nthey opposed McCain-Feingold. Why should we enact new laws, they said, \nwhen we can't even enforce the ones on the book? No less than eight \nSenators made some version of that argument in last fall's debate, \nright in the middle of the Thompson Committee hearings. More still \nraised it when we revisited campaign finance reform in February.\n  In fact, given the arguments made by the opponents of the McCain-\nFeingold bill, I would hope this amendment would be adopted by 100-0 \nwhen we vote. Because all the amendment does is give the resources that \nthe Federal Election Commission says it needs to carry out the duties \nthat we have given it under the law. The very small amount of money \nthat this amendment proposes to add to the FEC's appropriation--just \n2.8 million dollars--will bring the FEC's funding up to its full budget \nrequest, which is the level that the House passed bill includes.\n  This is a particularly good and important time to fully fund the FEC. \nThe Rules Committee recently recommended approval of three new nominees \nto the Commission, and one reappointment. If the Senate follows that \nrecommendation, the FEC will have a full complement of Commissioners \nfor the first time since October 1995 when then Chairman Trevor Potter \nleft the Commission. We therefore have a chance to have a fully \nfunctioning Commission prior to this year's elections. What better time \nto have a fully funded Commission as well. What better time to give the \nFEC the resources it says it needs to do its job right.\n  The additional funding provided in this amendment will go directly to \nhiring new personnel to beef up the FEC's enforcement capacity. And \nthere is no doubt at all that these additional investigative and legal \nstaff are truly necessary. The FEC simply is not able to keep up with \nthe workload as things now stand. In Fiscal Year 1997, it dismissed 133 \ncases as being too minor or too old to be worth pursuing. Through June \nof this year, three quarters of the way through this Fiscal Year, the \nFEC has already dismissed 144 cases. Now these are not frivolous cases, \nthese are cases that staff has determined are worth pursuing.\n  And here is the most disturbing statistic, Mr. President. In every \nyear since the FEC adopted this practice of dropping cases that it \ncan't get to the number of cases that are dropped because they are not \nthat important has exceeded the number that are dropped because they \nare stale. Until this year. This year, nearly 60 percent of the cases \ndropped were high priority but stale. This is a very disturbing fact. \nThe FEC is having a harder and harder time getting to the cases that it \ndeems to be significant because of the rising caseload and inadequate \nresources.\n  So, Mr. President, frankly, I can hardly imagine how one could argue \nagainst this amendment. The FEC is a very small agency, with a very \nsmall appropriation, and a very big job. Campaign spending by \ncandidates continues to increase. Involvement in election activity by \noutside groups continues to expand. We simply cannot pretend that we \nwant the laws to be enforced at election time and then ignore the FEC \nat budget time.\n  There is nothing that undermines the public's faith in government \nmore, Mr. President, than a feeling that the rules of the election game \nare being ignored. In a very real sense, Mr. President, this amendment \ngives us the chance to put our money where our mouth is. I hope we take \nit.\n  Once again, I congratulate the senior Senator from Ohio for offering \nthis amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment by \nSenator Glenn to bring the funding for the Federal Elections Commission \nto the level requested by the administration. Mr. President, we have \nwatched during the last few years as public confidence in our electoral \nsystem has crumbled. We've seen investigations, deliberations, \norations--but nothing substantive to improve how we elect Members of \nCongress.\n  We all know that despite the strong efforts of many in this \ninstitution--especially Senator McCain and my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold--we have not passed genuine campaign finance reform.\n  At the same time, the workload at the FEC has exploded. Since 1991, \ncampaign spending has increased by nearly 150 percent. The number of \naudits have gone up 110 percent. And the sheer number of transactions \nrecorded by the FEC has increased by 157 percent. This increase in work \nhas come at a time when the FEC, an independent federal agency, has \nlost employees. In the last three years the number of full time \nemployees has actually dropped from 314 to 300.\n  With this increase in work and decrease in staff, it should not be a \nsurprise that the FEC--the agency charged with investigating campaign \nfraud and abuse--has been forced to drop legitimate cases because of \ninsufficient resources. In 1998 alone, of the cases the FEC dismissed, \nnearly two out of three cases were dropped because the FEC did not have \nthe resources to fully investigate them.\n  Mr. President, if I came before this body today and told you that \ncriminals were being let out of jail because there were not enough \npolicemen on the beat, we would rush to provide more resources to law \nenforcement. But because those allegedly breaking the law are political \ncandidates and campaigns, we are ignoring the problem.\n  The House of Representatives recognized the deficiency in funding and \nvoted to bring the FEC budget to $36.5 million. Senator Glenn's \namendment\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nwould do the same, and without increasing overall spending.\n  Mr. President, we should have passed meaningful campaign finance \nreform this year, but we did not. Therefore, the only real improvement \nwe can make to our campaign finance system is to provide the policemen \nof that systems the tool they need to enforce our laws. The Glenn \namendment will provide that additional support, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will reserve the balance of my time. Do \nwe have 2 minutes to explain this before the vote tomorrow? Was that \nthe agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes, evenly divided, \nbefore each vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time for this \nevening.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Glenn \namendment at the agreed to time tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the great courtesies that the \nSenator from Colorado and the Senator from Wisconsin have extended in \nterms of a series of amendments that relate to drug issues. It is my \nhope and expectation that before we come to closure on this matter, \nthose various amendments will be combined in an amendment that will be \nsupported by the managers of this bill.\n  I am in a difficult situation, however, wanting to assure that in the \nunlikely event that that doesn't occur, the amendment that I propose to \noffer is protected. So in a minimum amount of time, I would like to \noffer the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. Robert Warshaw, the \nAssociate Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which \noutlines the severity of the situation in the region of central \nFlorida, which is the subject of the amendment, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: This is in response to your inquiry \n     concerning the status of the Central Florida High Intensity \n     Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). The Central Florida HIDTA was \n     designated by this office on February 27, 1998 after \n     consultation with the governor of Florida, the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n       A thorough analysis of the Threat Assessment and supporting \n     information submitted by the Central Florida HIDTA reveals \n     that this region has been severely affected by the flow of \n     illegal drugs from domestic and international sources, and \n     that this drug trafficking affects the nation as a whole. \n     Illegal drugs are increasingly smuggled into Orlando and \n     Tampa from the Caribbean and Latin America. Among Florida \n     cities in 1996, Orlando reported the highest rate of heroin \n     deaths. Marijuana seizures doubled between 1995 and 1996. \n     Violent crime in Orlando and St. Petersburg increased by 8% \n     in the first six months of 1997, at a time when violent crime \n     declined in many other locations.\n       The Central Florida HIDTA will provide federal assistance \n     intended to measurably reduce drug trafficking through a more \n     coordinated, deliberate and focused approach to drug \n     enforcement and interdiction in the Central Florida area. We \n     anticipate that Federal assistance will enhance combined \n     federal, state and local law enforcement agencies who will \n     focus on heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine and money \n     laundering organizations.\n       With the support of Congress, and federal, state and local \n     law enforcement programs, the Central Florida HIDTA and the \n     national HIDTA program will continue to provide assistance in \n     countering drug trafficking. ONDCP looks forward to your \n     continued support and cooperation in advancing this goal.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                               Robert Warshaw,\n\n                                               Associate Director,\n                                          State and Local Affairs.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not propose to have further debate on \nthis matter now. I hope this amendment can be vitiated tomorrow because \nit will have been adopted or ready to be adopted in a form that would \nbe submitted and supported by the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to assure our colleague, Senator \nGraham of Florida, that staff is working very diligently trying to \nreach agreement to work these amendments into one and make sure they \nare protected. We have a little work to do in finding offsets, but we \nare very close to that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3381\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funding for the Central Florida High Intensity \n                         Drug Trafficking Area)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself and Mr. \n     Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 3381.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, line 16, strike $3,164,399,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,162,399,000.\n       On page 39, line 10, strike ``$171,007,000'' and insert \n     ``$173,007,000''.\n       On page 40, line 3, strike ``: Provided, That funding'' and \n     insert the following: ``, and of which $3,000,000 shall be \n     used to continue the recently created Central Florida High \n     Intensity Drug Trafficking Area: Provided, That except with \n     respect to the Central Florida High Intensity Drug \n     Trafficking Area, funding''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Such peer review shall \n     not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \n     U.S.C. App.).\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to \nstrengthen the regulatory accounting provision in Section 625 of the \nTreasury-Postal Appropriations bill. This amendment would require OMB \nto submit a biannual report to Congress on the costs and benefits of \nfederal regulatory programs. I ask unanimous consent that Majority \nLeader Lott and Senators Breaux, Shelby, and Robb be added as \ncosponsors to my amendment. We come from different political \nviewpoints, but we all agree that we need to improve our regulatory \nsystem and make it more open and accountable.\n  This amendment continues the effort begun by Senator Stevens, the \nformer Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, when he passed \nthe Stevens Regulatory Accounting Amendment on the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill in 1996. Our goal is to promote the public's right \nto know about regulation, increase government accountability, and to \nimprove the quality of regulatory programs. This amendment would not \nchange any regulation or regulatory standard. It just provides \nimportant information for smarter and more accountable regulation.\n  Under the Stevens Amendment, the Office of Management and Budget \nissued its first regulatory accounting report to the Congress in \nSeptember 1997. While this first Report was an important step toward \ngovernment accountability, it left a lot to be desired. Following that \nfirst Report, Senator Stevens and I wrote to the OMB Director \nexpressing our concern that OMB was not fully complying with the \nAmendment. Several members of the House sent a similar letter. In \naddition, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings \nInstitution held a workshop reviewing the first OMB Report in the fall \nof 1997. At that workshop, a distinguished group of economists \nunanimously agreed that OMB had fallen short on the Stevens Amendment.\n  Now it's time to take another step toward a more open and accountable \nregulatory system. This amendment would add a few simple requirements \nto the Stevens regulatory accounting provision to ensure that:\n  Regulatory Accounting is a permanent requirement. Every two years, \nOMB would submit the Report with the President's budget.\n  The Report is more informative. To the extent feasible, agencies \nwould provide cost and benefit estimates for agency programs. In \naddition, the Report will clearly cover paperwork costs, including the \nlarge costs of complying with our Byzantine tax system. That was always \nsupposed to be covered.\n  The Report is of higher quality. OMB guidelines to the agencies and \npeer review will improve future reports.\n  As OMB said in their first regulatory accounting Report, \n``regulations (like other instruments of government policy) have \nenormous potential for both good and harm.'' Better information will \nhelp us regulate smarter--to increase the benefits of regulation while \nreducing needless waste and redtape. This will help ensure the success \nof important programs, while enhancing the economic security and well-\nbeing of our families and our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter to \nformer OMB Director Franklin Raines, and a letter from the Alliance USA \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.\n     Subject: Implementation of Regulatory Accounting Amendment.\n     Hon. Franklin D. Raines,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Raines: We would like to work with you toward \n     the successful implementation of the regulatory accounting \n     provision in section 625 of the Treasury and General \n     Government Appropriations Act, 1998 (Pub. L. 105-61). This \n     provision carries forward for another year the requirement \n     that OMB report to Congress on the total costs and benefits \n     of Federal regulatory programs. Based on our review of OMB's \n     first regulatory accounting report, we believe there is an \n     opportunity to make further progress toward a more \n     transparent, cost-effective, and accountable regulatory \n     system.\n       We believe that the public has a right to know the costs \n     and benefits of federal regulatory programs. While the budget \n     process provides the public and Congress with an opportunity \n     to monitor and control tax-and-expenditure programs, \n     regulatory programs do not receive such scrutiny. As your \n     first report says, ``regulations (like other instruments of \n     government policy) have enormous potential for both good and \n     harm.'' We believe that better information will help us to \n     increase the benefits and reduce the costs of regulation. \n     This would contribute to the success of programs the public \n     values, while enhancing the economic security and well-being \n     of our families and communities.\n       While the first regulatory accounting report has some \n     serious omissions, it is an important foundation for \n     improving the regulatory system. Critics said it could not be \n     done, and we appreciate that OMB's Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs (``OIRA''), with limited staff, proved the \n     critics were wrong. We agree that OMB should use the report \n     to raise the quality and utility of agency analyses--for \n     developing new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, \n     and tracking regulatory impacts over time. We encourage OMB \n     to build on this effort by tracking the net benefits of \n     regulations and reforms of old rules.\n       As OMB develops its second report, we believe there are \n     several opportunities for improvement, and we would like to \n     make the following recommendations. First, the report should \n     adhere to specific statutory requirements. The first report \n     fails to recommend improvements for specific regulatory \n     programs or program elements, as required by subsection \n     (a)(4). OMB need not base its recommendations on perfect \n     empirical information nor on its overall estimates of the \n     impacts of the regulatory system. Moreover, the first report \n     does not assess the indirect impacts of Federal regulation, \n     as required by subsection (a)(3).\n       Second, the report should more fully implement the \n     legislation to achieve its goals. The first report failed to \n     break down costs and benefits by program or program element \n     where feasible, as intended by subsection (a)(1). The public \n     also deserves a complete accounting of federal mandates--not \n     simply those that fall within OMB's categories of ``social'' \n     and ``economic'' regulations. OMB should estimate the costs \n     of all paperwork requirements, including those associated \n     with tax collection. OMB also should estimate transfer costs, \n     even if they are viewed as a different category of regulatory \n     costs.\n       Finally, OMB should exercise leadership to assure the \n     quality and reliability of information reported. \n     Specifically, we urge OMB to standardize procedures \n     government-wide for collecting, analyzing, and documenting \n     the best available information. OMB should leverage its \n     effort with cooperation from the agencies and the President's \n     Council of Economic Advisors. OMB also should establish a \n     database, enforce its ``Best Practices'' guidelines, and \n     track the costs and benefits of programs, program elements, \n     and rules over time. OMB should synthesize and evaluate the \n     information provided by the agencies and provide an \n     independent assessment. To this end, OMB staff should be \n     directed to critique the quality of the estimates provided to \n     them, not to simply compile data presented by the agencies.\n       We commend you for an important first step toward a more \n     open, efficient, and accountable regulatory system. We look \n     forward to working with you to advance further in the 1998 \n     report. We would appreciate your response to our \n     recommendations by December 1, 1997.\n       With best wishes,\n           Cordially,\n     Fred Thompson,\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\n       Chairman, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n     Ted Stevens,\n       Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Alliance USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1998.\n     Hon.

As you know, this \n     amendment would continue the important work on regulatory \n     accounting begun by Senator Stevens.\n       Alliance USA is a nationwide coalition of over 1,000 \n     companies united by their support for responsible regulatory \n     reform. Our coalition believes that your regulatory \n     accounting amendment would improve the effectiveness of \n     several pending regulatory reform measures, including S. 981, \n     the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998.\n       We believe that the successful addition of your amendment \n     would result in a more informed public and Congress about the \n     benefits and burdens of federal regulations. It would also \n     enable Congress to assess more accurately the effectiveness \n     of regulatory programs.\n       We commend you for your continued efforts to improve the \n     regulatory accounting process. If our coalition can be \n     helpful in this effort, please let me know.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lewis I.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment today with my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, and my \ncolleague from, New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to address funding for \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, referred to as FLETC.\n  This is a consolidated law enforcement training center for the \nFederal Government that is operated by the Department of the Treasury.\n  The committee bill reduces the funding for FLETC by $18.7 million \nbelow the President's budget request of $100.3 million.\n  The bill reduces funding for both the operating and the construction \nand maintenance accounts, which will have serious effects on our law \nenforcement training program.\n  Mr. President, some years ago, because law enforcement training \nbecame a necessity for a number of departments of the Federal \nGovernment, every major department which wanted to train their own law \nenforcement people, and the U.S. Government made a very good decision. \nThey said the Department of Treasury will establish the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center, and it will take care of most of law \nenforcement training that is required for institutions and entities \nlike the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Immigration, and just an untold \nnumber of agencies that need to have their law enforcement people \ntrained.\n  Through good fortune, an earlier abandoned naval base in the State of \nGeorgia, called Glynco, was the site that was determined for this \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n  As a matter of fact, I am sure some wonder why I remain so interested \nin this. A little part of it is in the State of New Mexico. But, \nbelieve it or not, when I was a second-year Senator on the Public Works \nCommittee, we were about to spend $600 million on a new center for the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center. I suggested, almost in a very \nmild voice, wondering whether then committee chairman of the Public \nWorks Committee would even consider this new center, and said, ``Would \nyou adopt a resolution saying that before we agree to build a new one \nthat we will take a year and look around and see if we might not \nalready own a facility such as an abandoned military base?'' I think, \nto get rid of me, they all said, ``Let's adopt the resolution.'' And \nsure enough, 9 months later, before we ever spent any money, the \nchairman called me to his office and said, ``Look. They found a naval \nbase in the State of Georgia which has just recently been closed, and \nit will be perfect. We will not have to build a new one.''\n  Although many, many claimed they were the people that got Glynco, I \nwas very pleased to be invited as a brand new Senator in the back row \nand know that because I had asked that we not spend money until we look \naround, that we found it.\n  It has been doing a marvelous job. The only major competitor is the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Some time ago, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, when Jim \nBaker was Secretary of Treasury, decided to expand and create a new \none. They picked a former college in the city of Artesia, NM, which \noffered them the entire campus at a bargain rate, and it has since \ngrown along with the Glynco establishment in Georgia.\n  I came to the floor tonight to urge the committee to restore the \nFLETC salary and expenses and construction to the President's level.\n  I know the committee had difficulty because they had to do a lot of \nthings the House didn't do in their bill with the same amount of \nallocation, overall. But this amendment will actually allow $20 million \nfor new construction of critical dormitory and classroom facilities at \nboth Artesia in New Mexico and Glynco: $6.4 million for new dormitories \nin Artesia; $7.5 million for new dormitories at headquarters in Glynco; \nand, $6.4 million dollars for new classrooms at Glynco, which will be \naugmented by the amounts in the bill, restoring the budget request, and \na proposed reprogramming of funds.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has put a significant emphasis on law \nenforcement over the past decade. I have been concerned for quite some \ntime that the law enforcement agencies of the Treasury Department--that \nis FLETC, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms--are overlooked when Congress talks about violent and youth \ncrimes, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigration. The Department of the \nTreasury plays a very important role in this regard. While Congress has \nmore than tripled the budget of the Department of Justice law \nenforcement agencies over the last decade, Treasury agencies--and this \nis no aspersions on the current leadership of the subcommittee--have \noften struggled to keep up with workloads that are increasing all the \ntime. FLETC is a case in point. Since Congress began serious anticrime \nefforts, thousands of law enforcement agents have been recruited. Many \nof these agents receive\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\ntheir basic as well as advanced training at these Federal law \nenforcement facilities. While the administration and Congress added \nthese agents, sufficient resources were not devoted to keep up with the \ntraining requirements. The President requested $71.9 million for the \nFederal law enforcement training salaries and expenses, and the \ncommittee provided $66.25.\n\n  There are 70 Federal agencies that depend solely upon the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center to provide all direct costs for entry level \ntraining. Without these additional funds, the number of students \ntrained in 1999 will fall below the actual number of agents trained in \n1997 while the demand is greater. That will be 3,900 less. Should the \nadministration decide to keep training levels stable, as much as 10 \npercent would have to be cut from other sources or some programs would \nhave to be reduced or eliminated such as the Office for State, Local \nand International Training within FLETC.\n  Rather than go on with all of the details that I have regarding this, \nI just want to conclude that this is not good policy. If Congress is \ngoing to commit to strong law enforcement, it needs not only the \npersonnel but the high-quality training needed to prepare and protect \nour law enforcement agents. FLETC, the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, must be in position to meet those demands.\n  Mr. President, this amendment provides important resources to support \nthe training of our Federal law enforcement personnel. I believe the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center should be a priority in this \nbill, and I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Treasury Department, signed by Raymond Kelly, Under Secretary, to \nme indicating that they would very much support funding the President's \nlevel in this bill for operation and for getting ready for future \ndemands in terms of construction.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici:  On behalf of Secretary Rubin, I \n     want to thank you for your leadership and support of Treasury \n     Enforcement programs. Like you, we believe that the Federal \n     Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) should be funded at \n     the President's request of $100.283 million and thereby \n     ensure our capacity to meet critical infrastructure needs. \n     The Treasury Department considers this a high priority so \n     FLETC can have adequate facilities, at both Glynco and \n     Artesia, in order to meet the surging workload associated \n     with border management build-up, drug interdiction, anti-\n     terrorism, and related activities.\n       Equally important, we are committed to ensuring that \n     funding for FLETC does not offset other Treasury programs. We \n     hope that the Senate will be able to restore the funding \n     levels requested by the Administration during its \n     deliberations on the FY 1999 appropriations.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,\n                                  Under Secretary for Enforcement.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman, with \nwhom I have conferred and whose staff I have conferred at length, would \nthe chairman do his best to fully fund FLETC as requested by the \nPresident when he goes to conference?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would be honored to support Senator \nDomenici's request in this amendment. I had some experience with FLETC, \ntoo. I visited the campus in Artesia, NM, a few years ago and was very \nimpressed. It is one of the opportunities that Federal agencies really \nhave to interact with each other, and certainly the agents who are \ngoing back to separate departments.\n  The Senator also mentioned other agencies. We have the Indian law \nenforcement agents who work throughout America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Exactly.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We have, of course, as every other subcommittee, only a \ncertain amount of spending authority, and we have to deal with that. We \nhave had a great many requests. We are now wrestling, in fact, with the \nrequest for the six high-density drug trafficking areas which are all \nbecoming more expensive, and certainly they work in an allied fashion, \nbecause people who get out of FLETC sometimes go into those different \nagencies. But I want to assure the Senator I am very supportive and we \nwill do our very best to come up with the money necessary to deal with \nthe President's request.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3383, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment which I \nheretofore sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's first amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3383) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3384\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Federal Law Enforcement \n                            Training Center)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will send an amendment to the desk shortly which I \nhope will be adopted. This one is in behalf of myself, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Cleland from the respective \nStates, the largest center in Georgia by far, and we have kind of a \nsmall adjunct to it in the State of New Mexico. So all four Senators \nare on the amendment.\n  First, we are relying upon the distinguished chairman, who will see \nto it in conference that the President's request for operations and the \nlike will be met, and that probably is already in the House bill.\n  This amendment says that within the amounts appropriated in the act, \nup to $20.3 million may be transferred to the acquisition, \nconstruction, improvements and related expenses account of the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center for new construction. I send that \namendment to the desk. It is the one with the four Senators who I have \nmentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Cleland, and others \n     propose an amendment numbered 3384.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new section:\n       ``Sec.   . Within the amounts appropriated in this Act, up \n     to $20.3 million may be transferred to the Acquisition, \n     Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses account of \n     the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for new \n     construction.''\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \namendment that I have cosponsored and introduced today with my \ncolleague from New Mexico and Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, regarding funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter.\n  To date only fifty one percent of FLETC's master construction plan is \ncompleted, and this amendment would move FLETC closer toward its goal \nof being the centralized training center for our federal agencies.\n  Whether traveling in my home state of Georgia, or chairing a \nSubcommittee hearing on drug interdiction, the need to address the \ncrisis we face with drugs and crime is consistently brought to my \nattention. Through continued funding and support of the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center we will be able to take the necessary steps \nto achieve this goal for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I once again urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I withhold that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there is nothing further before the Senate, is not \nthe next matter adoption of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3384) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their help \nin this matter, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3385\n\n(Purpose: To provide for an adjustment in the computation of annuities \n  for certain Federal officers and employees relating to average pay \n                determinations, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16 of title 18, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means any employee \n     described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section \n     8401(17) of title 5, United States Code; and any special \n     agent in the Diplomatic Security Service of the Department of \n     State.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, for purposes of chapter 171 of title 28, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law relating to \n     tort liability, a law enforcement officer shall be construed \n     to be acting within the scope of his or her office or \n     employment, if the officer takes reasonable action, including \n     the use of force, to--\n       (1) protect an individual in the presence of the officer \n     from a crime of violence;\n       (2) provide immediate assistance to an individual who has \n     suffered or who is threatened with bodily harm; or\n       (3) prevent the escape of any individual who the officer \n     reasonably believes to have\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n     committed in the presence of the officer a crime of violence.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \noffering my amendment. This is legislation that I originally offered \nlast year as a free standing bill. I would like to say a few words on \nthe amendment and ask my colleagues to support. It is co-sponsored by \nSenators D'Amato, Sessions, Stevens, and Grams.\n  First, let me remind my colleagues of what the amendment does. I have \noutlined these in letters to my colleagues and in my original statement \non the floor. In addition, many of you have heard from various federal \nlaw enforcement associations that support this amendment. Its main \nintent is to address a problem, a gray area, in current law. As it now \nstands, the situation reminds me of the old saying that no good deed \ngoes unpunished.\n  This involves what I call the 7-11 situation. Suppose for a moment \nthat an off-duty Capitol Police officer or a Customs Agent or some \nother federal officer goes into the 7-11 to buy coffee. While he is \nthere, a robber tries to hold up the store and is threatening the \npublic with violence. Under the present circumstance a not so funny \nthing can happen. If the off-duty officer intervenes to protect the \npublic and is hurt in the process. Or if someone is hurt in the \nincident, the officer could lose his workman's compensation or be sued \nby the felon for injuries because the Federal officer was acting \noutside the scope of his work. If he was not on duty or if the felony \ndid not occur as part of the duties involved in his job description, he \nhas no protections.\n  This is a real concern to serving officers. It puts them in a \ndifficult situation. That is what this amendment fixes. It would give \nprotection to Federal officers in these situations.\n  Now, let me make it clear. This does not mean an expansion of the \nauthorities to Federal officers to make arrests in matters reserved to \nthe states. I have checked this with the States' Attorneys General. \nThis amendment also does not authorize Federal law enforcement officers \nto act like cowboys. Nothing in current law, even when acting on \nofficial duty, would permit an officer to act irresponsibly. They are \nsubject to penalties if they should do so under their scope of work and \nthey are subject to the same sanctions here.\n  What we have now, however, is a situation where a law enforcement \nofficer has to make a sudden decision. Does he intervene to protect the \npublic, which is what we would all expect? Or does he sit it out to \navoid the risk of being sued or losing his workman's compensation if he \nis injured? I think I know what most of us would expect. I know what \nmost of us believe is the responsible thing to do. We would expect the \nofficer to intervene with a clear conscience and the knowledge that his \nact of decency and responsibility will not be punished. I would add \nthat this situation, fortunately, is not a common one. It is, however, \none that needs to be addressed.\n  I hope that we will adopt this amendment today. It has been a long \ntime in coming and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. \nAgain, let me remind my colleagues that this language has been a free-\nstanding bill for almost a year and has been available for comment. We \nhave worked with DEA, Customs, and many others on the language. It has \nbeen provided to both majority and minority members. Most of these \nmembers have been visited by all the major Federal law enforcement \nassociations and unions, which, I might mention, support this \nlegislation wholeheartedly. I offer for the Record a few of the letters \nthat have been written to me and other Members in support. I believe \nall the Federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on our \nbehalf deserve this much. We know only too well the risk they take on \nour behalf.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                               East Northport, NY, April 10, 1998.\n     Hon.

The citizens of the \n     United States would benefit in that the country's well \n     trained and equipped law enforcement officers would be \n     encouraged to assist the public.

I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mrs. \n     Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3387.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following:\n       On page 39, strike lines 10 through 12 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``Area Program, $179,007,000 for drug \n     control activities consistent with the approved strategy for \n     each of the designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, \n     of which $8,000,000 shall be used for methamphetamine \n     programs above the sums allocated in fiscal year 1998 and \n     otherwise provided for in this legislation with no less than \n     half of the $8,000,000 going to areas solely dedicated to \n     fighting methamphetamine usage and in addition no less than \n     $1,000,000 of the $8,000,000 shall be allocated to the \n     Cascade High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, of which''\n       Amend page 50, line 20 by reducing the dollar figure by \n     $8,000,000;\n       Amend page 52, line 13 by reducing the dollar figure by \n     $8,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is a plague sweeping across our \nNation. It is ruining an untold number of lives, claiming countless \nnumbers of our children. It is in our streets as well as our \nclassrooms. Drugs have become more abundant. But there is a new drug, \none that is far more addictive and readily available than heroin, \ncocaine, or any other illegal narcotic. Methamphetamine is becoming the \nleading addictive drug in this Nation. From the suburbs, to city \nstreets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of \nlives every year. The majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our \nchildren.\n  Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as Iowa's drug of choice in \nmy State. It is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from the \nwest coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach \nthe east coast. The trail of destruction of human lives as a result of \nmethamphetamine addiction stretches across America.\n  To illustrate the violence that meth elicits in people, \nmethamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of \ndomestic violence cases in my State, and a leading factor in a majority \nof violent crimes. I recently introduced the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Control Act which I think will get support and get \nthrough the Senate. But I offer this amendment today as an opportunity \nto take immediate action to help our Nation's law enforcement in their \nwar on methamphetamine.\n  This amendment makes a simple and modest request, taking $8 million \nin certain offsets and puts those dollars where they can do real good \nto combat the growing problem of methamphetamine.\n  These funds will be added to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nAreas Program to be used for increased enforcement and prosecution of \nmeth dealers, additional undercover agents, and to help pay for the \ntremendous cost of confiscation and cleanup of clandestine meth labs.\n  The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs \ncontinues to escalate. The number of clandestine meth labs confiscated \nand destroyed in 1998 is on pace to triple the number that was \nconfiscated in 1997--so triple this year over last year. The cost of \ncleaning up each lab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000. This cost is being \nabsorbed by communities who are not prepared or experienced to deal \nwith the dangers of methamphetamine.\n  These clandestine meth labs create an enormous amount of hazardous \nwaste. For every 1 pound of methamphetamine produced, there are 5 to 6 \npounds of hazardous waste as a by-product. This waste is highly toxic \nand seeps into the ground where eventually it ends up in our drinking \nwater supply.\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\n  The dangers posed to law enforcement officers are also greatly \nincreased by these meth labs. Many peddlers of meth have now what they \ncall ``kitchen'' labs. Meth pushers are now simply using mobile homes \nor even pickup trucks to produce their drugs. Combining many volatile \nchemicals in an uncontrolled environment, meth labs are time bombs to \npolice officers and communities everywhere.\n  I believe we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand \nright now to defeat this scourge. This amendment will not solve all of \nthese problems, but it will give law enforcement the support that they \nvitally need in their efforts to defeat this dangerous drug.\n  Mr. President, family after family is being devastated across the \nMidwest. In my State, I have seen methamphetamine skyrocket in its \nuse--the importation in the State and the development of these \nmethamphetamine labs in the State of Iowa. Communities are trying to \nfight this, but they do not have the resources. Children are being lost \nand getting hooked to this deadly drug every day. So the time now is to \ndo whatever we can to try to halt the growth of these meth labs, to \ngive our high-intensity drug traffic areas the tools that they need to \nstop this drug, to help our communities, and most importantly to help \nour law enforcement officials.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to assure the Senator we are \ndoing our very best to find a resolution in the funding of this. We \nhave four that we are working with. And just in my own personal \nexperience of having worked with several, particularly one in Denver, \nCO, I am certainly aware of the good work that they do in coordinating \nlocal, State, tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies so they are \nnot duplicating their efforts and so that these agencies can share \nideas and share resources.\n  The Senator's comments certainly underscore the importance of trying \nto stop the growth of the methamphetamine labs. These things are \nvolatile. They are mobile. They are contaminative, so even when you do \ngo through an expensive process of cleaning them up, you still have to \nworry about what it has done to contaminate the area, particularly the \nearth.\n  So I just want to assure him, we are working very hard to find a \nresolution to make sure they are all funded properly. I thank the \nSenator for his comments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman. I know of his great interest in \nthis area. And I know of his great support for our law enforcement \nagencies to crack down on the methamphetamine labs. I know your \nchairman is having the same experience out in his State, too, as we are \nin Iowa. I understand that you and the chairman, and Senator Kohl, are \nworking on putting all this together. Obviously, it would be my \nintention to withdraw the amendment if this whole thing gets worked \nout. I am sure that we will get it worked out.\n  I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation that \nwould bring a new, comprehensive strategy to America's effort against \nillegal drugs.\n  The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act would support enhanced \ndrug interdiction efforts in the major transit countries, and support a \ncomprehensive supply eradication and crop substitution program in \nsource countries. This legislation has 16 other Senate cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, this is a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over 3 \nyears for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop \nsubstitution efforts. This important counter-drug initiative would \nrestore a balanced drug control strategy by renewing our nation's \ncommitment to international eradication and interdiction efforts--\nefforts that have proven successful in reducing the trafficking and use \nof illegal drugs. I believe that this is an important investment in the \nfuture of America--and the future of our children.\n  The day after the new drug initiative was introduced, I offered an \namendment to the Transportation appropriations bill to provide much-\nneeded resources for the U.S. Coast Guard--resources that will increase \ntheir drug interdiction capability. Other cosponsors of this amendment \nincluded Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, and Grassley. \nThis amendment, which was agreed to by voice vote, accomplishes two \ngoals: First, it increases funds available for equipment devoted to \ndrug interdiction by approximately $37.5 million. Second, the amendment \nsets aside resources needed to restore a much-needed drug interdiction \noperation in the Caribbean--an operation which I had the opportunity to \nvisit earlier this year.\n  Today, I rise again with Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, \nGrassley, and Mack to introduce an amendment to the Treasury, Postal \nappropriations bill. Specifically, we seek $15 million for enhanced \ndrug interdiction efforts for the U.S. Customs Service in South Florida \nand the Caribbean.\n\n  Mr. President, in May, I traveled to the Caribbean for a very short--\n36-hour--visit to look at our interdiction operations there. I visited \nwith U.S. Customs officials in Key West, Florida. It was on this very \ntrip that I gained a greater appreciation of the actual difficult task \nof drug interdiction. I learned that it is far from an easy task--it is \nin fact highly dangerous.\n  U.S. Customs officials showed me video tapes of U.S. Customs go-fast \nboats pursuing Colombian go-fast boats in the middle of the night in \nhigh waves--waves that reached 5 or 6 feet. The videos showed Colombian \nboats ramming into our boats.\n  One of the key problems I learned about on that trip was that U.S. \nCustoms has very few go-fast boats--and the ones they have lack 1990's \ntechnology. Our boats have a top speed of 70 mph--while Colombian boats \ncan reach 80 or 90 mph. I rode in one of our go-fast boats in Key West \nduring a mock chase--and I can tell you that even during the day and in \nlow waves, this is dangerous work.\n  There can be no doubt that our U.S. Customs agents in Florida and the \nCaribbean need more equipment, better equipment dedicated to drug \ninterdiction, and more personnel. Since 1986, the number of U.S. \nCustoms vessels has decreased from 77 to 30. There has also\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nbeen a significant decrease in maritime officers, from 124 to 23. In \nfact, U.S. Customs no longer runs a 7-day, 24-hour drug interdiction \noperation.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would provide U.S. Customs \nwith more go-fast boats and more manpower for South Florida and the \nCaribbean. Let me tell you what this amendment would accomplish.\n  First, it would refurbish 22 interceptor and Blue Water Platform \nBoats. The interceptor boats are what is known as ``go-fast boats.'' \nThe Blue Water Platform Boats are for deep waters and have command \nand control capability--these vessels can accommodate satellite \ncommunications equipment and radar to communicate with the interceptor \nboats to enable them to better interdict the drug traffickers. Right \nnow, these 22 vessels cannot be used because of lack of funding for \nrefurbishment. This small amount of money will make a huge, huge \ndifference. The amendment would also appropriate money for 9 new \ninterceptor go-fast boats.\n\n  The amendment would also provide money for the hiring and training of \n30 special agents--criminal investigators--for maritime operations. \nFinally, the amendment would provide resources for overhead coverage \nand operation and maintenance in the Caribbean.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important amendment which will \naccomplish a lot with a small amount of resources. The amendment has \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking \nMember of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government \nSubcommittee, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl. I thank them for their \ncooperation with this bipartisan amendment.\n  First, I want to make clear that I intend to work with the conferees \nand the Treasury Department on alternatives to fund this amendment. \nWhile an offset has been identified in order to pay for this amendment, \nI want to work with them to find alternatives.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Ohio--\nfirst in offering this very important amendment and for his diligence \nin seeking additional funds for the U.S. Customs Service. I look \nforward to working with him on this important issue and we will work to \naddress any remaining items during conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I too appreciate the Senator from Ohio's efforts in seeking \nadditional funds for the U.S. Customs Service to better interdict drug \ntraffickers. I look forward to working with him to find an appropriate \noffset for this amendment.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, again, I would like to express my thanks \nto the chairman and the ranking member of the Treasury, Postal Service, \nand General Government Subcommittee for their efforts to assist me and \nthe distinguished list of cosponsors of this amendment. I also extend \nmy thanks to the staff of the subcommittee for their efforts, which \nwere nothing less than first rate.\n  Mr. President, this amendment today is another important step toward \nrestoring a balanced drug interdiction strategy. I expect there will be \nmany more steps in the future--steps that are needed if we are going to \nrestore a truly balanced, truly effective drug control strategy. This \namendment represents a bipartisan effort to make a targeted and \nspecific investment in stopping drugs before they reach America. It \nwill take similar efforts over the course of the next 3 years to bring \nour drug strategy back into balance, and most important, back on the \ncourse of reducing drug use in our homes, schools, and communities.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This amendment deals with funding for Customs drug \naddiction, and High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.\n  This amendment has been agreed to by both sides of the aisle. It \naccommodates Senators, DeWine, Conrad, Harkin, Graham, Mack, Coverdell, \nBond, Faircloth, Grassley, Bingaman, and Murray.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3388) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3389\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding payroll tax \n                                relief)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Kerrey, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3389.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REDUCTION OF \n                   PAYROLL TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) is the biggest, most regressive tax \n     paid by working families.\n       (2) The payroll tax constitutes a 15.3 percent tax burden \n     on the wages and self-employment income of each American, \n     with 12.4 percent of the payroll tax used to pay social \n     security benefits to current beneficiaries and 2.9 percent \n     used to pay the medicare benefits of current beneficiaries.\n       (3) The amount of wages and self-employment income subject \n     to the social security portion of the payroll tax is capped \n     at $68,400. Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to use the Federal budget surplus \n     to provide tax relief the payroll tax should be reduced \n     first; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     tax which burdens American families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside in keeping with the prior unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous consent agreement--Amendment No. 3356\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the previous consent, it be in order on Thursday for \nthe managers to offer a modification to amendment No. 3356, which was \npreviously adopted.\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   daschle marriage penalty amendment\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to table an amendment \nto the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill that had been \noffered by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. So \nthere will be no confusion with respect to my position on this issue, I \nwish to advise my colleagues of the reason for my opposition.\n  First, I am, as are others, deeply concerned with that anomaly in the \ntax code known as the ``marriage penalty.'' I can think of no rational \nreason why two individuals--individuals who have vowed a lifelong \ncommitment to each other through the sacred institution of marriage--\nshould, in certain cases, have their combined income taxed at a higher \nrate than that of two unmarried persons. At a time of declining social \nvalues, it simply does not make sense for the Congress to sanction \npolicies which clearly work to the detriment of family stability.\n  However, despite this concern, I could not, in all good conscience, \nsupport the Daschle amendment for the most basic of reasons, namely, \nthat Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States \nrequires that all revenue bills originate in the House of \nRepresentatives, not here in the Senate. As I am sure my colleagues \nknow, that is a prerogative that the House vigorously defends. \nConsequently, I believe that had the Daschle amendment been adopted to \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, which is a Senate-originated \nbill, that that bill would have been subjected to a constitutional \npoint of order in the House. In short, adoption of the Daschle \namendment would have killed this very important appropriations measure.\n  Again, Mr. President, notwithstanding my vote earlier today, I wish \nmy colleagues to know that I remain committed to working toward the \ngoal of alleviating the marriage penalty in the tax code.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nCampbell from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would welcome the opportunity to engage in a colloquy \nwith my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as you know there has been severe \nfinancial turmoil in Asia. This has lead to a dramatic increase in the \ntrade deficit. It is my understanding that exports from Asian nations \nare up significantly, particularly with respect to textiles. This is an \nimportant industry to my home State of North Carolina. My principal \nconcern is that when quotas are met, there will be an attempt to \nillegally ship textiles into this country through other countries, like \nMexico. This is a process known as ``transhipment.'' As you know, the \nU.S. Customs Service has frontline responsibility for enforcing the \nlaws that would bar illegal shipments into this country. We have \nalready written our Senate report, but I would hope that in Conference \nyou would advocate report language that would encourage the Customs \nService to step up their enforcement activities in this area.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I certainly agree with the Senator that this is an \nimportant issue and I will work with you on that. We are running high \ntrade deficits. I will certainly work with the gentleman to encourage \nthe Customs Service to work diligently to stop illegal textile \nshipments into the United States. I thank the gentleman for raising \nthis issue, I think it is one that deserves our attention and the \nattention of the administration.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator from Colorado and I look forward \nto working with him on this issue in conference.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It has come to our attention that concerns have been \nraised regarding report language in the Treasury-General Government \nAppropriations bill on tax standards for tax-exempt health clubs. We \nwould like to enter into a colloquy to clarify our intent in including \nthe report language.\n  Mr. KOHL. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the \nconcerns that have been raised. The issue of tax-exempt health clubs \nhas been of concern in my home State of Wisconsin. However, I share the \nSenator from New Jersey's desire to clarify the intent of the report \nlanguage. In so doing, we also have the opportunity to emphasize that \nno one wishes to harm community service organizations who are \nlegitimately using their tax-exempt status to serve our young people, \nour families, and our seniors through a variety of health-related \nprograms, including health and fitness programs.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I, too, share Senator Kohl's concerns and want to \nbe clear that long-standing community service providers engaged in \nlegitimate tax-exempt activities related to their central mission will \nnot be targeted by this study. I am also concerned, however, that some \ntax-exempt organizations are moving away from their core purpose and \nthat there are legitimate concerns as to whether they are engaging in \ncommercial competition with the for-profit sector. Was it the \nCommittee's intent to address this concerns?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, it was. But while addressing those concerns, we \ncertainly do not wish the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] to reinvent \nthe wheel. The IRS has issued several private letter rulings and \ntechnical advice memoranda (including Technical Advice Memorandum \n8502002) over the past years regarding the circumstances when adult \nfitness can be a charitable activity. It is my understanding that these \nrulings have stated that adult fitness is a charitable activity as long \nas the program serves a broad section of the community.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. While considering current business practices, we \nwould expect the IRS to focus on adult fitness provided by tax-exempt \norganizations that serve only adults.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I \nwant to state that it is my understanding this report will in no way \nrequire the IRS to effect any changes in current tax policy. It only \nasks the IRS to provide clear guidance for examining the issue in light \nof new market factors that may need to be considered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate your input. I Know Senator Grassley will also \nhave a statement on this issue, and that I and the Senator from \nColorado would certainly be happy to work with any and all group that \nmay have further concerns as we prepare to conference the Treasury-\nGeneral Government Appropriations bill with the House.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise today to express my concern about some language \nincluded in Senate report that accompanies this bill. This language is \nnot in the House report. This Senate language directs the Internal \nRevenue Service to review the legal standards and decisions the IRS \nutilizes in determining when fitness services and activities of tax-\nexempt organizations should be subject to unrelated business income \ntax. The stated intent of this review is to insure that tax-exempt \nhealth clubs are not unfairly competing with for-profit health clubs. I \nam afraid that the effect of this language will be to harm non-profit \ncommunity organizations. Is this the intent of the language?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. No, it is not. This language is not intended to harm \nnon-profit community organizations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. These non-profit community organizations provide a \nunique variety of programs based on community needs. Some of the \nprograms offered are child care, Head Start, GED classes, job training, \nsubstance abuse prevention, delinquency prevention, teen centers, \ncounseling, and health and fitness for all children, youth, families, \nand adults. They have partnerships with public housing projects, \njuvenile courts and schools. It is of utmost importance to me that the \nCongress not urge the IRS to change current IRS policies in a way that \nwill hurt our communities and our families. The IRS has determined that \nadult fitness is a charitable activity as long as the organization \nserves a broad segment of the community. does the committee intend that \nthis determination be changed?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. No, it is not the committee's intent to change this \ndetermination because it would hurt the poor and the young--the very \npeople who benefit most from these community organizations. I agree \nthat it is important that these non-profit community organizations are \nable to continue to provide their health, fitness, and other services \nto both adults and children. I would be glad to work with you to insure \nthat any language included in the conference report takes\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\ninto account the unique aspects of these community organizations, and \ndoes not unfairly target them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         atf arson task forces\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, Senator \nCampbell, on the floor. I would like to briefly discuss with him a \nconcern I have relating to BATF arson task forces.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be glad to respond to my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the manager of the bill for his courtesy. I was \nvery pleased to note that the committee report accompanying this bill \nspecifically notes that the program objectives of the BATF include \nassisting ``Federal, State, and local investigative and regulatory \nagencies in explosives and arson-related areas.''\n  Until recently, BATF was involved in just such a program in my State \nof Utah, where in the past year there has been a very troubling \nescalation of arsons connected with the animal rights movement. Utah \nhas experienced a string of animal rights terrorism arsons, including \nan attack on a West Jordan McDonald's, the firebombing of a Murray mink \nco-op, and numerous other arsons.\n  I am very concerned, however, by reports last week that the BATF has \nwithdrawn the last remaining agent assigned to this task force, leading \nto its imminent disbandment. I believe this will have a serious \nnegative effect on counter-terrorism efforts in Utah, and will send the \nwrong message to those pursuing social and political goals through \nviolence.\n  I think the Utah task force is exactly the type of program the \nSubcommittee has in mind, and I would like to ask Senator Campbell if \nhe agrees.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator from Utah is correct. The arson task force \nhe describes is exactly the kind of program the Subcommittee wishes the \nBATF to engage in.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Chairman also agree that BATF should devote \nsufficient resources to ensure the continued viability of these \nefforts?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with the Senator that disbanding a successful \ntaskforce sends the wrong message to arsonists.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would appreciate the Senator working with me to address \nmy concerns over the BATF's withdrawing support for this important task \nforce.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be happy to work with Senator Hatch to address \nhis concerns, and ensure that BATF dedicates necessary resources to \narson task forces such as the one he describes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank Senator Campbell for his assistance and his \ncourtesy, and yield the floor.\n\n\n     reducing the number of executive branch political appointments\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the past, the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill has been the vehicle for proposals relating to an \narea of great concern to me; namely, growing numbers of executive \nbranch political appointees, and I want to offer a few comments on this \nmatter.\n  I was pleased to introduce legislation early in this session to \naddress this issue. That bill, S. 38, would cap the total number of \npolitical appointees at 2,000, and I am pleased to be joined in that \neffort by my good friend, the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain). \nOur proposal to cap the number of political appointees has been \nestimated by CBO to save $330 million over five years.\n  Mr. President, our bill was based on the recommendations of a number \nof distinguished panels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century \nFund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force \nfindings are only the latest in a long line of recommendations that we \nreduce the number of political appointees in the Executive Branch. For \nmany years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication, \n``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,'' and it was one \nof the central recommendations of the National Commission on the Public \nService, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  Mr. President, our proposal is also consistent with the \nrecommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, \nwhich called for reductions in the number of federal managers and \nsupervisors, arguing that ``over-control and micro management'' not \nonly ``stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume \nbillions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.''\n  Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 report of the \nVolcker Commission, when it argued the growing number of presidential \nappointees may ``actually undermine effective presidential control of \nthe executive branch.'' The Volcker Commission recommended limiting the \nnumber of political appointees to 2,000, as our legislation does.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that any Administration be able to \nimplement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. \nGovernment must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But \nas the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of \npolitical appointees in recent years has not made government more \neffective or more responsive to political leadership.\n  Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 \npercent, over three times as fast as the total number of Executive \nBranch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more \ndramatic. In his recently published book ``Thickening Government: \nFederal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,'' author Paul \nLight reports a startling 430% increase in the number of political \nappointees and senior executives in Federal government between 1960 and \n1992.\n  In recommending a cap on political appointees, the Volcker Commission \nreport noted that the large number of presidential appointees simply \ncannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. This \nlack of control is aggravated by the often competing political agendas \nand constituencies that some appointees might bring with them to their \nnew positions. Altogether, the Commission argued that this lack of \ncontrol and political focus ``may actually dilute the President's \nability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to \nhold cabinet secretaries accountable.''\n  The Volcker Commission also reported that the excessive number of \nappointees is a barrier to critical expertise, distancing the President \nand his principal assistants from the most experienced career \nofficials. Though bureaucracies can certainly impede needed reforms, \nthey can also be a source of unbiased analysis. Adding organizational \nlayers of political appointees can restrict access to important \nresources, while doing nothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments.\n  Author Paul Light says, ``As this sediment has thickened over the \ndecades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of \ngovernment, and the front lines from them.'' Light adds that \n``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping \ngovernment of the barriers to doing its job effectively. . .''\n  Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on \nthe Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem \naggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees; namely, \nthe increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of \npositions. As the Task Force reported, both President Bush and \nPresident Clinton were into their presidencies for many months before \ntheir leadership teams were fully in place. The Task Force noted that \n``on average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more \nthan eight months after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire \npresidential term.'' By contrast, the report noted that in the \npresidential transition of 1960, ``Kennedy appointees were confirmed, \non average, two and a half months after the inauguration.''\n  In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in \ngovernment, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental \neffect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force \nreported that appointees can ``wait for months on end in a limbo of \nuncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public \nsector.''\n  Mr. President, there is little doubt that the large number of \npolitical appointments currently made aggravates a cumbersome process, \neven in the best of circumstances. The long delays and\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\nlogjams created in filling these positions under the Bush and Clinton \nAdministrations simply illustrates another reason why the number of \npositions should be cut back.\n  Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the \ninitial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that \nposition over time. The General Accounting Office reviewed a portion of \nthese positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, and found high levels \nof turnover--7 appointees in 10 years for one position--as well as \ndelays, usually of months but sometimes years, in filling vacancies.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Government Affairs Committee \nbeginning to examine issues surrounding political appointees and the \npolitical appointment process. The issues of vacancy rate, turnover, \ndelays in the appointment process, and of course the total number of \nappointees, all merit scrutiny by that Committee, and I would very much \nlike to work with Chairman Thompson and the Committee in crafting a \nbipartisan response to the set of problems that have been identified in \nthis area.\n  I am also encouraged that the Administration is moving forward as \nwell. The total number of appointees is down from last year, and down \nsignificantly from the levels seen in 1992. This is a healthy trend, \nand I very much hope it continues.\n  Mr. President, because the Government Affairs Committee is examining \na variety of issues surrounding the presidential appointment process, \nand with the modest improvements in the overall number of political \nappointees, I will not pursue an amendment to the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations measure capping the number of political appointees.\n  I will, however, continue to monitor the progress made both by the \nGovernment Affairs Committee and the Administration. This issue is \nimportant not only because of the potential to realize significant \ndeficit reduction, but also because of the impact the appointees have \non the day to day functioning of government.\n  As we move forward to implement the NPR recommendations to reduce the \nnumber of government employees, streamline agencies, and make \ngovernment more responsive, we should also right size the number of \npolitical appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the \npolicies of any Administration without burdening the Federal budget \nwith unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs.\n\n\n                        Random Audits by the IRS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nto the managers for accepting an amendment to S. 2312, the FY 1999 \nTreasury-Postal Service Appropriations bill, regarding the practice of \nrandomly selecting innocent taxpayers for audits, otherwise known as \nrandom audits. This is an issue that has been a focus of mine for a \nlong time. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss this matter \nwith my good friend, the senior Senator from Colorado and the manager \nof the bill, who shares my concern about the impact the Internal \nRevenue Service has upon taxpayers and the potential for abuse of \ntaxpayers' rights.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Indeed, I share many of the concerns of Senator \nCoverdell regarding taxpayer rights. I commend the Senator for his \ntenacious work on behalf of taxpayers, particularly low-income \ntaxpayers who are least able to defend themselves. This amendment the \nSenator offers presents a critical foundation upon which the Senate can \nbuild.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my good friend. Over the past several years, \nall of us have seen news accounts of regular, average citizens who have \nbecome the targets of grueling IRS audits. These individuals were \nneither wealthy nor powerful; in fact, they were most often ordinary, \nlaw-abiding taxpayers who earned a modest wage, ran a small business, \nor operated a family farm. Some struggled just to make ends meet, and \nmany were understandably confused about what wrong they had committed \nto justify the scrutiny of the IRS.\n  The truth is they committed no wrong. They were simply unfortunate \nvictims of a scandalous IRS practice called ``random audits,'' where \nthe IRS just picks people out of a hat in the hope it can uncover some \nwrongdoing.\n  A recent report produced by the General Accounting Office at my \nrequest confirms that the IRS has been targeting thousands of poor \ntaxpayers and small businesses for random audits. In fact, almost 95 \npercent of all random audits performed between 1994 and 1996 were \nconducted on individual taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 each \nyear.\n  Last fall, hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee brought the \nIRS's abuse of taxpayers to the attention of the entire Nation. One \nwitness, Jennifer Long, who is a current field agent with the IRS, \nremarked, ``As of late, we seem to be auditing only the poor people. \nThe current IRS Management does not believe anyone in this country can \npossibly live on less than $20,000 per year, insisting anyone below \nthat level must be cheating by understating their true income.''\n  The IRS' belief that low-income families are more likely to cheat \nthan others serves as a disturbing sign of how far it has strayed from \nthe principles of American justice. The GAO report also indicates that \nthe IRS has been specifically targeting the State of Georgia for random \naudits. Nearly twice as many random audits took place in Georgia \nbetween 1994 and 1996 than in all the New England states combined and \nGeorgians are three-times more likely to be randomly audited than their \nCalifornia counterparts. Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to \nprohibit the use of random audits by the IRS and will continue to \nprotect innocent taxpayers.\n\n\n   Amendment of the Gun Control Act to Exempt Certain Muzzle Loading \n                        Weapons From Regulation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, according to the amendment, would the \nKnight DISC rifle manufactured in my State fall under the definition of \na muzzle loader, or a regulated firearm?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Knight DISC rifle would be defined as a muzzle \nloader.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment of the Gun \nControl Act to Exempt Certain Muzzle Loading Weapons from Regulation \n(``the amendment''), in subparagraph (c), did the Committee intend \n``fixed ammunition'' to mean a completed centerfire or rimfire \ncartridge?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, for the purposes of the amendment, fixed \nammunition is defined as a complete centerfire or rimfire cartridge.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, subparagraph (c) of the amendment states \nthat the term ``antique firearm'' shall not include any weapon which \nincorporates a firearm frame or receiver . . .'' However, the amendment \ndoes not define the terms firearm frame or receiver.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. For the purpose of the amendment, a firearm frame or \nreceiver is defined as a serial numbered firearm frame or receiver.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first sentence of subparagraph (c) \nof the amendment does not address the types of ignition systems which \nwould fall within the definition of muzzle loading rifles.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Committee did not address the issue of ignition \nsystems because muzzle loaders may use black powder or a black powder \nsubstitute with any ignition system.\n\n\n                           blue water vessels\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address my \ncolleagues on a matter of critical importance to our national drug \ninterdiction program.\n  I am very concerned about the condition of some of the currently \ndeployed drug interdiction vessels. I understand that some of the \nvessels currently deployed in the U.S. Customs Service's marine program \nfleet are 30 years old and may pose a threat to U.S. Customs Service \nagents and the viability of our drug interdiction program.\n  The Customs Service already has a contract to build replacement \nvessels on demand. However, this contract will expire at the end of FY \n1999, and no vessels have been purchased to date. I believe the Customs \nService should extend this contract and make efforts to replace aging \nvessels in the field a high priority.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing this serious matter \nto our attention. I certainly understand and share her concerns about \nthe importance of operating these drug interdiction vessels in a safe \ncondition.\n  Ms. SNOWE. In recent years, drug seizures by the Customs Service have\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nincreased significantly. This progress is due in no small part to the \nCustoms agents who put their lives on the line to help stem the flow of \nillegal narcotics into the United States. Protecting our borders and \nreducing the proliferation of narcotics is an enormous challenge.\n  It is imperative that we maintain the viability of our drug \ninterdiction program and the fleet we use to enforce our drug laws on \nthe high seas. I believe procurement of drug interdiction vessels would \nbe an invaluable investment in our drug interdiction program.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Customs Service entered into a contract to build \n82-foot ``blue water'' vessels for drug interdiction. As I mentioned, \nthe contract was effective through FY 1999 but no vessel has been \nbuilt.\n  These vessels have a proven track record, and the contract was \nawarded by Customs in anticipation of resources for replacement \nvessels. However, the FY 1995 budget request proposed a 50-percent \nreduction in Customs marine program operations and staffing. The \nCongress restored some of the funding for this program. However, no \nadditional funds were appropriated to Customs for the replacement costs \nof vessels.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Customs Service has certainly had to make difficult \nchoices in the marine program under budget constraints. However, I \nrecognize the importance of these vessels to drug interdiction efforts.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am grateful to Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl for \ntheir leadership on this important program. In the Committee's report \non FY 1999 Customs' appropriations, the Committee recognizes the \nimportance of the blue water vessels as a central component of the \nmarine interdiction strategy, and urges the Customs Service to maintain \nits fleet of blue water vessels at a level which is safe for its \nagents.\n  I understand the delicate funding balance that the Customs Service \nand the Committee must strike. I had hoped to see some replacement blue \nwater vessels built in FY 1999. Unfortunately, it was not possible to \nallocate the funding for this purpose this year. However, we should not \nlet this opportunity to upgrade these vessels slip by--I believe we \nshould ensure that the option to fund these vessels remains in the \nevent that funding becomes available next year.\n  Again, Customs already has a contract to build these vessels on \ndemand scheduled to expire in the 1999 fiscal year. I strongly believe \nthat Customs should extend this contract.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree that the U.S. Customs Service should revisit \nthis issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Again, I applaud the leadership of the Committee on this \nmatter, and thank them for their cooperation. I look forward to working \nwith the Committee on this continuing and important effort in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                      marriage penalty amendments\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my views on providing \ntax relief for working families, and more specifically about the \nmarriage penalty. I have always supported efforts to alleviate the tax \nburden felt by many of our nation's working families. In 1993, I \nsupported tax cuts for millions of working families making less than \n$30,000 per year through an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. \nAnd again, last year, I supported tax cuts targeted toward working \nfamilies, including the $500 per-child-tax credit, the $1,500 HOPE \neducation tax credit, reinstatement of student loan deductions, full \ndeductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed and \ncapital gains and estate tax relief, I was pleased to support these tax \ncuts, Mr. President, because each was carefully targeted, fully paid \nfor, and consistent with a balanced budget.\n  Today, I continue to support efforts to bring relief to working \nfamilies, including providing them with substantial relief from the \nmarriage penalty. Yet, despite my support for repealing the marriage \npenalty which affects more than 20 million American families, I felt \ncompelled to vote against the amendment offered by Senator Brownback, \nbecause in my view, the amendment did not provide targeted relief to \nthose who need it most. In fact, Senator Brownback's amendment would \noffer marriage penalty relief to only about 40 percent of those \ncurrently penalized. Moreover, this amendment was both a costly \nmeasure--costing $125 billion over five years and $300 billion over the \nnext ten years--and one that was not paid for.\n  Mr. President, because Senator Brownback's amendment was not offset, \nit would have significantly drained the Treasury and put an incredible \nstrain on the Social Security trust fund. Indeed, had this amendment \nbeen adopted without an offset as proposed, we would be forced to make \ndraconian across-the-board spending cuts to all discretionary spending, \nincluding many important programs like Head Start, public health \nprograms, and defense. In addition, this amendment threatened to use as \nits offset, funds from the Social Security reserves, which clearly \nwould jeopardize the solvency of and undermine the strength of the \nSocial Security trust fund. Mr. President, in my view, we could ill \nafford to pay for this amendment with either option, and that is why I, \nin good conscience, could not support this amendment.\n  I want to be clear, however, that I support efforts to repeal the \nmarriage penalty. Yet I remain committed to doing so in a way that does \nnot harm the progress we've made in balancing the budget and in a way \nthat targets relief to working families who need it most. That is why I \nwas pleased to support the Democratic alternative, which would have \nreduced the marriage penalty in the tax code for approximately 90 \npercent of the families currently penalized. Indeed, this amendment was \ncarefully targeted and would cut the marriage tax penalty more for a \ngreater number of families Furthermore, this proposal would have cost \nfar less than Senator Brownback's proposal--$7 billion over five years \nand $21 billion over the next ten years. And finally, the Democratic \nalternative was fully offset without using reserves from the Social \nSecurity trust fund, but rather by using a number of widely supported \nproposals from the President's budget.\n  Although I was disappointed that the Democratic alternative was \ndefeated, I remain hopeful that Congress will continue to work to \nrepeal the marriage penalty in a way that is both fiscally responsible \nand carefully targeted to the American families who need relief the \nmost.\n  Mr. KLY. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Campbell, regarding the \nimportance of High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs).\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I understand the Senator's interest in this area.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I would like to take a few minutes to \ndescribe the importance of HIDTAs, and specifically the creation of a \nnew Central Arizona HIDTA.\n  As you know, HIDTAs are an effective mechanism for fighting drugs and \nespecially for combating the increase in methamphetamine use and meth \nlabs. Arizona has a huge problem with meth and meth lab cleanup. In \nApril, I held a field hearing in Phoenix on this issue and I heard \nfirst-hand about the magnitude of the drug problem in urban and rural \nareas of the state. For example, I heard testimony that the Maricopa \nCounty HIDTA Meth Lab Unit presently dismantles an average of three \nlabs per week and that, during fiscal year 97, it seized 137 meth labs. \nProjections for seizures this year are expected to reach 200. Moreover, \nthe DEA testified that clandestine lab seizures in Arizona have \nincreased 910 percent since 1994.\n  The formation of a new Arizona HIDTA, the Central Arizona HIDTA, is a \ncooperative effort among three Arizona counties--Maricopa, Pinal, and \nMohave--representing both rural and urban interests.\n  Designating new HIDTAs where a need can be demonstrated and where law \nenforcement has joined together is key to stopping the spread of drugs. \nI look forward to working with you to ensure that new HIDTAs, like the \nCentral Arizona HIDTA, receive funding.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This Committee is increasingly aware of the unique \nproblems meth poses, as well as the cleanup of their toxic labs. This \nis an area where a HIDTA can provide much needed assistance to a \ncommunity, therefore I can understand your interest in the creation of \na Central Arizona HIDTA. I look forward to working with the Senator in \nthe coming months to address these concerns.\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          tax code termination\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire: Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nthe Tax Code Termination Act, which had been proposed as an amendment \nto the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act. This measure, which I \ncosponsored with Senators Hutchinson and Brownback, would sunset the \nFederal Tax Code by the end of 2002.\n  Our current Tax Code, with its many rates, deductions and exemptions, \nneeds to be replaced with a simpler, fairer system that will eliminate \nthe bias against savings and investment and promote economic growth. \nConsider these facts:\n  The Tax Code is made up of about 7,500 pages. All the Internal \nRevenue Service regulations, rulings and tax court decisions add tens \nof thousands more pages. By contrast, when the income tax was enacted \neighty-five years, the Tax Code was under twenty pages long.\n  By the most conservative estimate, the total cost of collecting \ntaxes, including the value of the 4.5 billion hours that taxpayers \nspend preparing tax returns, is $75 billion per year. Other estimates \nare several times higher. The cost of complying with some provisions \nexceeds what the government collects in taxes.\n  I can think of no more fitting commentary on the tax laws that are on \nthe books today than The Federalist Papers, and I quote: ``It will be \nof little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their \nown choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so \nincoherent that they cannot be understood.''\n  Is there any doubt that our current Tax Code is too voluminous to be \nread or too incoherent to be understood? There probably is not a single \naccountant who understands the Code in its entirety. Not even the IRS, \nwhich employs about 110,000 people and is twice as big as the CIA, \nseems to have a complete grasp on the Code. In 1993, for example, the \nIRS provided an estimated 8.5 million incorrect or incomplete answers \nto taxpayer inquiries, and taxpayers were overcharged an estimated $5 \nbillion in penalties.\n  Another measure of the Code's complexity is the number of disputes it \ngenerates. As many as 40 percent of major corporate audits end up in \nadministrative or legal disputes. Some last for years.\n  The Tax Code is so burdensome that it encourages tax evasion and \ndistorts investment. the IRS has reported that there are hundreds of \npeople who pay no taxes on incomes of more than $200,000 per year. \nRemember Leona Helmsly, the New York real estate magnate who spent \neighteen months in jail for tax evasion? According to her former \nhousekeeper, Leona said: ``[w]e don't pay taxes. Only the little people \npay taxes.'' Taxpayers who can afford to pay for tax planning have a \nstrong incentive to invest in schemes to avoid paying taxes instead of \ninvesting in productive enterprises that will help the economy thrive.\n  Up to 30% of individuals reporting business income are not complying \nwith the Tax Code, according to the IRS. Small wonder that many small \nbusinesses are not in compliance, when we consider the Code's \ncomplexity. For every $100 they paid in income taxes, small businesses \nwith net profits paid an estimated $377 in accounting fees and other \ncosts to comply with the tax laws, according to a 1996 Tax Foundation \nreport. If the current tax code were not so complex, perhaps we would \nnot be facing the enforcement problems that we brought to light by the \nFinance Committee in its April 1998 IRS oversight hearings.\n  Critics of the Tax Code Termination Act maintain that it would be \nirresponsible to sunset the Tax Code until a substitute is prepared. \nBut there are already a number of other federal programs on the books \nthat contain sunset language; and why should the Tax Code by any \ndifferent? This legislation simply sets a fixed date by which the Tax \nCode will have to be reauthorized, thereby forcing the President and \nCongress to engage in a meaningful dialogue on the issue.\n  Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to take the first step \ntoward meaningful tax reform by setting a date when the Tax Code will \nexpire. We should discard the current maze that is our Tax Code and \nenact a new tax system that is simple, fair and does not discourage \nsavings or investment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote \nto adopt the Treasury and General Appropriations Bill for the Fiscal \nYear 1999. I intend to support this measure because it provides funding \nfor the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the \nExecutive Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies.\n  Mr. President, as elected officials, we bear no greater \nresponsibility than to see the American people's hard earned tax \ndollars utilized in the most prudent fashion. We must remain committed \nto open and fair consideration of public expenditures. Our objective \nmust always be to further the greatest public good. This must remain \nthe cornerstone of the appropriations process.\n  I admit that this is a difficult task. Each year the appropriators \nface the daunting task of supporting necessary governmental activities \nand balancing additional competing interests for funding. However, this \nis a challenge that we must firmly uphold with integrity. I come \nforward to this body to once again declare that we are undermining the \nnational faith by continuing the practice of earmarking and \ninappropriately designating funding for projects based on erroneous \ncriteria rather than national priority and necessity.\n  After reviewing the Treasury Postal Appropriations Bill, it is \npainfully clear the subcommittee has not lost its appetite for pork-\nbarrel spending. This bill has been fattened up with vast amounts of \nlow-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending. In fact, this \nappropriations bill contains well over $826 million in specifically \nearmarked pork-barrel spending. This is more than $791 million more \nthan last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which only \ncontained $34.25 million in wasted funds. In addition, the bill and \nreport directs that current year spending be maintained for hundreds of \nprojects, without being specific about any dollar amount.\n  We now have the first unified-budget surplus in nearly 30 years. CBO \nprojects that we will have $1.6 billion of budget surpluses over the \nnext 10 years. However, if we continue with our current levels of \nwasteful spending, these budget surpluses may not occur. Pork-barrel \nspending today not only robs well-deserving programs of much needed \nfunds, it also jeopardizes our fiscal well-being into the next century. \nI would be remiss if I did not inform the American public of the \nseriousness and magnitude of wasteful spending endorsed by this body. \nThese individual earmarks may not seem extravagant. However, taken \ntogether, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs \nthat have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. I \ntake very strong exception to a large number of provisions in the bill \nbefore us today.\n  As usual, this bill and report contain numerous earmarks of new funds \nfor particular states, as well as language designed to ensure the \ncontinued flow of federal funds into certain states. I have compiled a \nlengthy list of these and numerous other add-ons, earmarks in this \nbill. I will not spare precious time to recite the entire list. \nInstead, I will ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the \nRecord. However, I will discuss some of the more troubling provisions \nin this bill in detail.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains a provision which requires the \nPostal Service to work with the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to \ndevise a plan to combat pest introduction into Hawaii through the U.S. \nmail. Also contained in this report is over one half billion dollars in \nnew courthouse construction specifically allocated to certain states \nand localities. This type of earmarking of federal funds must stop.\n  Mr. President, in the last few weeks, the Senate has wasted billions \nof taxpayers' dollars on wasteful, unnecessary, or low priority \nprojects. Most alarming, we still have 5 more appropriations bills \nstill to be considered. When will Congress curb its appetite\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\nfor wasteful pork-barrel spending? How much is too much?\n  Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable \nprovisions of this bill. I simply ask my colleagues to apply fair and \nreasonable spending principles when appropriating funds to the \nmultitude of priority and necessary programs in our appropriations \nbills. Fiscal responsibility yields long term dividends to America as a \nwhole. Moreover, responsible spending will renew the public's faith in \ntheir elected representatives, while also insuring that America \nrealizes any projected budget surpluses.\n  Congress can ill afford to waste taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. Let \nus use these budget surpluses to pay down our multi-trillion-dollar \nnational debt. Let us use the anticipated budget surpluses to save \nsocial security and for additional tax cuts. These objectives further \nthe greater public good, and our long-term prosperity. Wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending which has limited short term benefits to a few obscure \nspecial interests, does not further the public good. It drains our \nbudget, and threatens our long-term prosperity. Congress will only make \nour potentially prosperous future a reality if it curbs its appetite \nfor pork-barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think seriously about the \nrepercussions that could soon be felt right here in this body, if we \ncontinue the longstanding practice of pork-barrel spending. Wasteful \npork-barrel spending simply erodes the public's trust in our system of \ngovernment. Congress must reaffirm its commitment to furthering the \npublic good by curbing its appetite for pork-barrel spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n LOW PRIORITY, UNNECESSARY, OR WASTEFUL SPENDING CONTAINED IN S. 2312, \n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  1999\n\n       The total dollar amount included in this bill is more than \n     $3 billion over the Fiscal Year 1999 budget request.\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       Sections 506, 507, 508, and 606 all contain the usual \n     protectionist, Buy-America provisions.\n\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       BATF: $4.5 million to expand the National Tracing Center in \n     Martinsburg, WV. $2.4 million for 12 trafficking agents, \n     three of which are to be for Milwaukee, WI.

Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been working to \nidentify the remaining amendments and the time that will be necessary \nto debate those amendments. I thank Senator Daschle, again, for the \ntime he spent on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments, as previously \nidentified on the consent agreement, be limited to the following times, \nto be equally divided:\n  Senator Bingaman with regard to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 20 \nminutes;\n  Senator Baucus regarding post office closings, 10 minutes;\n  Senator McConnell regarding the Federal Elections Commission, 10 \nminutes;\n  Senator Glenn regarding FEC, 10 minutes;\n  Senator Harkin regarding drug control, 30 minutes;\n  And Senator Wellstone regarding naming of a post office, 10 minutes.\n  We will continue to work with the Senators on this list to see if we \ncan work them out and get them accepted, but we need to get this order \nlined up and identify what those amendments are to be.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if we can have 15 \nminutes on my side. We have a couple of people who want to make short \nremarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would modify that request, then, so we will have 15 \nminutes on each side?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now we are talking 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is right, instead of 20.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then Senator McConnell will need 30 minutes. So you are \ntalking about 30 minutes on each side--30 minutes equally divided or 30 \nminutes total?\n  Mr. GLENN. Thirty total.\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be 30 minutes equally divided on the McConnell \namendment and 30 minutes on the Glenn amendment.\n  I remind our colleagues, it is a quarter till 7. I can't think of any \nprofound statement that can be made that will take 30 minutes that will \naffect one iota the vote or its outcome. If the Senators will be \nwilling to yield some of that time, that will be very helpful.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate my amendment being on the \nlist. I would like 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Baucus amendment, 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Objection on two parts. First of all, with regard to \nthe Gene McCarthy Post Office, if we are going to debate this, I would \nlike to have that 20 minutes equally divided. And second of all, I did \nnot agree--I thought we might reach an agreement--I did not agree to \nwithdraw my other amendment. There is another amendment that should be \nadded to the list that will deal with mental health or substance abuse \nas it affects Federal employees. I would like to have 20 minutes \nequally divided on that.\n  Mr. President, let me just add, I have been here in the afternoon \nready to go with amendments, so I am not trying to delay anything.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time did the Senator want on the second \namendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Twenty minutes equally, if it is not accepted--maybe \nit will be acceptable--20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe this is sprouting wings here. I \nthink I am going to at this point withdraw this agreement and notify \nMembers I will move to table all amendments when offered. Unless we can \nget reasonable time agreements--we are now talking 1 hour, 2 hours, \n3\\1/2\\ hours. What the heck, I will just move to table, and we will \nhave a vote on each one of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the leader, I am willing to reduce mine down to \n2 minutes if the Senator will agree to my amendment. (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. That would take unanimous consent. You might get my \nagreement, but I am not sure you will get the rest of them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I get your agreement, I will reduce mine to 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield for and observation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the majority leader, Senator Glenn suggested \nthat my amendment will require 30 minutes, 15 minutes on a side, and \nthen he wanted 30 minutes for his amendment. I had offered him earlier \nin the day that we could adopt them both on voice vote which will \nrequire no time at all for the Senate. If I understand the Glenn \namendment, it is adding $2.8 million for the FEC; is that the Glenn \namendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me renew the request because Senator Daschle and I have \nother things we would like to do. If you want to talk and have votes, \nwe will just be having votes every 20 minutes the rest of the night. We \nare not going to stack them. You need to be reasonable. The request as \nit now stands--does Senator Graham have an addition?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The central Florida drug trafficking area amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand you have an amendment in there which they are \nattempting to work out.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I hope we can work it out. I want to be certain I am \nprotected in the event.\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew my request with the present conditions:\n  Bingaman amendment for 20 minutes;\n  Baucus amendment for 20 minutes;\n  McConnell amendment for 30 minutes;\n  Glenn amendment for 30 minutes;\n  Harkin amendment for 30 minutes;\n  And Senator Wellstone, two amendments, 20 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if you are \nnot on this list, does this mean you are precluded from offering your \namendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. No, you would be in the order about 10 or 11 o'clock.\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to make sure I am protected to offer my amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator's reservation is recognized, and if the issue \nis not worked out, he will have an opportunity to offer it and vote on \nit. Senator Daschle has a suggestion to make.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think we ought to add the Graham amendment and then \nlimit it to the ones on this list. I don't want to see this list grow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let's add Senator Graham to the list for 10 \nminutes. I don't think we can lock it in at this point because we have \nthe managers' amendment and other problems could be caused doing that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the very least, why don't we proceed \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to a vote on a \ntabling motion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree. I further ask that no second-degree amendments be \nin order prior to a vote on a tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest as amended by the minority leader? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3376\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, with regard to the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  Among the great attributes of our country, historic memory may not be \nour greatest strength. It was only 25 years ago that America found her \neconomy crippled by attempts made to compromise her national security \nby an oil embargo placed upon states that disagreed with fundamental \naspects of our national foreign policy.\n  The 1970s may be a memory, but we have been revisited by the low oil \nprices that preceded the oil embargo of that decade.\n  Mr. President, because of the foresight of this Congress in creating \na Strategic Petroleum Reserve, there is now space for 120 million \nbarrels of oil. This Congress had the foresight, during and after the \noil embargo, to plan to preserve our foreign policy independence, to \npreserve a large capacity to store oil so we could not be intimidated.\n  What is missing now is the foresight to fill that reserve. The \nSenator from New Mexico has noted there is no better time, with oil \nbeing sold at historically low prices. But it is important for Members \nof the Senate to understand that this is a propitious moment not only \nbecause the reserve has capacity and prices are low, but because in \nmany ways the principal factors that led to the embargo of the 1970s, \nin an attempt to exercise leverage over American foreign policy, many \nof those factors are being revisited.\n  In 1973, the United States imported less than 27 percent of its crude \noil requirements. In 1979, we imported less than 43 percent of our \nrequirements. Yet, an embargo, given those numbers, was enough to \ncreate a national recession, hyperinflation, and caused a serious \ndebate about foreign policy objectives.\n  The United States has now passed the 50 percent limit on importing \nforeign crude oil--9.2 million barrels per day--and by the year 2015 \ncould import fully 70 percent of America's oil. Indeed, in the last 10 \nyears, the rate of increase in the American importation of oil is more \nthan all the imported oil of all nations in the world, other than Japan \nand Russia. Not only are we dependent, not only is it at historic \nhighs, it is increasing.\n  Secretary of Energy Pena said:\n\n       The United States is highly dependent on Persian Gulf oil \n     for a large and growing percent of our imports.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not only a question of the level of our imports, \nit is also the fact that many of those importations of oil continue to \ncome from volatile areas of the world, including the Persian Gulf where \nwe have serious foreign policy disputes with nations in the region.\n  It is estimated by the year 2010, the Persian Gulf's share of world \nexport markets could surpass 67 percent, a level not seen since the oil \nembargoes of 1973 and 1974. Simultaneously, while American dependence \non foreign oil is increasing, and world dependence on Persian Gulf oil \nis increasing, the United States continues to abandon domestic wells at \nan extraordinary rate. In the last 10 years alone, 173,000 U.S. oil \nwells have been abandoned. And oil production from smaller stripper \nwells is at its lowest level in 50 years.\n  Mr. President, at a time when Americans are enjoying a low price for \noil and foreign policy threats have retreated for the moment, it is \ndifficult for the Senator from New Mexico to rise and gain support of \nthe Congress for this important initiative. But almost certainly this \ncountry will be revisited at another time when there will be an attempt \nto compromise our foreign policy and use the economic leverage of oil \nagainst this country.\n  We cannot be so foolish to forget what the oil lines were like or the \nrecessions or the high inflation. In only a year after the Shah fell in \nIran, in 1979, oil prices rose 250 percent. There are few easy ways to \nguard against this attempted intimidation or the economic shocks that \nwould follow. Indeed, I know of only one. It is not perfect, it is not \ncomplete, but it is a contribution--it is the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  It is time again to take advantage of these low prices to begin \nfilling the reserve. For that reason, Mr. President, I rise in favor of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do not know how much time is left on \nthe amendment, but I would like to speak briefly on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls the time, \nand there are 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from New Mexico.\n  I rise in support of the amendment authorizing the purchase of 420 \nmillion dollars worth of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. First \nof all, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it \nis my responsibility to protect the energy security interests of this \ncountry. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created for emergency \npurposes.\n  This amendment today would accomplish several goals: one, replace the \noil that has been sold over the past several years for budgetary \npurposes. Now is a most opportune time to buy oil, when prices are at a \n30-year low.\n  In this context, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that the \naverage price of the oil in the SPR is about $33 a barrel. Over the \npast several years, the average price we have gotten in selling it is \nabout $19 a barrel. So far, the Government has not done very well. I do \nnot know whether they figured they would make it up in volume, but it \nis certainly poor business to buy high and sell low.\n  By taking action earlier this year, we stopped a proposed sale of oil \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was ordered in the 1998 \nInterior appropriations bill. We saved the American taxpayers over $\\1/\n2\\ billion by that action, and our energy security insurance policy \nremained intact. We did this, Mr. President, on an emergency \nappropriations bill.\n  Over the past 3 years, we have steadily drained our Nation's energy \nsecurity insurance policy. The drain started in 1996 when the \nDepartment of Energy proposed the sale of $96 million worth of oil to \npay for the decommissioning of the Weeks Island facility. In other \nwords, we had a piggy bank. We broke into it. We did it in order to \nmeet some budgetary requirements. We have had a hard time staying out \nof that piggy bank ever since.\n  In addition to the sale we canceled last year, there have been three \nadditional sales. In January of 1996, the Balanced Budget Downpayment \nAct authorized the sale of $5.1 million barrels from Weeks Island. The \noil cost a total of $40.33 a barrel. We sold it for $18.82. We lost \n$110 million.\n  In the 1996 budget agreement, we required the sale of 12.8 million \nbarrels for $227 million. Based upon the average cost of oil in the \nSPR, the American taxpayer lost approximately $200 million.\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\n  The fiscal year 1997 appropriations required the sale of 10 million \nbarrels for $220 million. Oil prices were up that winter, so the \nAmerican taxpayer lost only $110 million.\n  So far we have lost the American taxpayer $\\1/2\\ billion by selling \noil that we put in the SPR by buying it high and selling it low. And, \nof course, two years ago the President proposed to balance the budget \nin the year 2002 by selling $1.5 billion worth of SPR oil at $10 a \nbarrel, which would be 150,000 barrels of oil. I am grateful that wiser \nheads have prevailed.\n  However, we did not stop the drip, drip, drip of small sales, the \nappropriations process. As I indicated, we paid an average of $33 per \nbarrel. With three sales so far, it has cost the taxpayers a great deal \nof money--$\\1/2\\ billion. But now we have an opportunity to stop that \nby pursuing the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, who is also a member of the Energy Committee, because we are \nable to at an all-time low.\n  It is a great investment for our national energy security interests. \nI am told that what we are doing now is replacing, in this 28 million \nbarrels, the amount that we have sold over the past several years for \nbudgetary purposes. So while we are still short of our objective of a \n90-day supply of net imports, we will be somewhere in the area of a 64-\nday supply.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Let me congratulate my \nfriend from New Mexico for offering it. I yield the floor and yield \nback whatever time I have.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his strong support of this amendment and his leadership on \nthis issue over many years.\n  Let me also indicate the strong support that we have had from the \nIndependent Petroleum Association of America and the National Stripper \nWell Association. I thank them for the good work they have done in \ndeveloping the facts that support what we are doing here.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the President and chairman of \nthose two organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         IPAA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Murkowski: The Independent \n     Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) and the National \n     Stripper Well Association (NSWA) write in support of your \n     amendment to the FY 1999 Treasury/Postal Appropriations. IPAA \n     and NSWA, national associations representing America's 8,000 \n     crude oil and natural gas producers, applaud your effort to \n     seek an emergency appropriation of $420 million to purchase \n     28 million barrels of crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve (SPR).\n       Throughout 1998, America's independent oil producers have \n     been experiencing a price crisis of historic magnitude. From \n     October 1997 through July 1998, crude oil prices have dropped \n     more than $7.00 per barrel. In many producing regions, oil \n     producers are facing price declines of up to $10.00 per \n     barrel.\n       A combination of events--increased foreign oil production, \n     the collapse of Asian economies, and a mild winter--helped to \n     create a temporary oversupply of crude oil on the world \n     market. The result of the price collapse is that many of the \n     500,000 marginal oil wells, representing 20 percent of U.S. \n     production or the same volume of oil imported from Saudi \n     Arabia, are at risk of being permanently shut-in.\n       The amendment, which is similar to the recent $500 million \n     emergency appropriation to remove excess agriculture \n     commodities from the world market, would benefit (1) domestic \n     oil producers, (2) the economies of the U.S. and other \n     countries, and (3) U.S. national security.\n       1. Removing 28 million barrels of oil from a saturated \n     market would help stabilize oil prices. In effect, policy \n     makers would be signaling oil markets that the U.S. \n     government is committed to preserving America's true \n     strategic petroleum reserve--domestic crude oil producers.\n       This action could potentially increase prices to levels \n     that would keep marginal oil wells economic. The average \n     marginal oil well produces 2.2 barrels per day and costs \n     $41.11 a day to operate. When oil sells for $14 a barrel, the \n     marginal well generates only $30.80, resulting in a loss of \n     $10.31 per day. Annually, the well loses $3,752. For a \n     typical operator of 100 marginal wells, annual losses exceed \n     $375,000.\n       2. This one-time purchase of oil for the SPR will stimulate \n     U.S. and world economies. According to the National Petroleum \n     Councils' 1994 Marginal Wells report, marginal wells generate \n     80,000 jobs and contribute an annual $14.4 billion to the \n     U.S. economy. When oil prices fall, so do state and federal \n     revenues. IPAA estimates that from November 1997 through July \n     1998 state severance taxes and federal oil royalties have \n     dropped by more than $819 million.\n       The consequence of these revenue losses falls not on the \n     producer but on the nation's citizens. The pinch is already \n     being felt in state school spending where a great deal of \n     this revenue is used. Construction spending, book purchases, \n     and other key costs for state schools are being constrained \n     because of lost revenues.\n       Additionally, the oversupply of oil on the world market is \n     having a serious impact on the economies of Russia, \n     Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries. Last week, the \n     International Monetary Fund announced the approval of an \n     additional $11.2 billion in aid to Russia. Of that amount, \n     $2.9 billion was directed to make up for shortfalls in \n     Russia's oil export earnings.\n       3. The purchase of crude oil for the SPR would enhance \n     America's energy and economic security. U.S. dependence on \n     oil imports has grown to 54 percent, and is projected to \n     climb to 61 percent by 2015. The SPR is America's best tool \n     to combat the impact of growing import dependence and \n     possible disruptions in crude oil supply. However, the \n     federal government has sold 28 million barrels of oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Revenues raised from all \n     three non-emergency sales were used to pay for government \n     programs and to balance the federal budget.\n       Given the low price of crude oil, the purchase of \n     additional stockpiles for the SPR would be a bargain for the \n     U.S. Treasury. This purchase should be viewed as an asset \n     transfer rather than spending. Purchasing cheap oil for the \n     SPR makes good business sense for the U.S. government and \n     more importantly, for the tax paying citizens of this \n     country. It's that simple.\n       IPAA and NSWA strongly support this important amendment. If \n     you have any questions, please contact Craig Ward of the IPAA \n     staff at 202-857-4722.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Yates,\n       Chairman, Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n     Stephen D.

In the spirit of cooperation, although I have been \nallotted 20 minutes, I will be very brief, hoping I can pick up a vote \nor two. It is a good amendment, anyway.\n  Very simply, the matter is this: In my State, and I know various \nother Senators in various other States, ran into a problem with the \nPostal Service. Namely, when the Postal Service wants to properly \nclose, relocate or build a new post office, it has been, frankly, not \nthe most sensitive operation in the world. That is, just close a post \noffice, announce a closure, and that is it--giving the public and \ncommunities no say and no opportunity to comment on the closing, no \nopportunity to work out some accommodation with the Postal Service.\n  There are many examples of this. Let me give one in Livingston, MT. \nThe Postal Service decided they were going to close the post office in \ndowntown Livingston, just announced that they will build a new building \non the edge of town. The community was up in arms because they had no \nnotice of this, they had no opportunity to try to work something out \nwith the Postal Service. This is a very, very, very, popular part of \ntown. It is the center of a small town. People go to the post office, \nlinger, talk to their friends. It is basically kind of a commons. To \nhave this willy-nilly moved out of town is quite disruptive to the \ncommunity.\n  So one day when I was in Livingston, I decided to walk over to the \npost office to see what was going on there. The Postal Service might \nhave a good argument, but the folks also had a pretty good argument. So \nI walked over to the post office. They said I couldn't come in. They \nsaid, ``Sorry, Senator, you can't come in. We have to check in with \nheadquarters to see if you can come in or not: So I say, ``OK.'' I \ncooled my heels for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes; 45 \nminutes later they got OK and approval from the headquarters \nsomeplace--maybe the Denver office, I don't know--that I could come to \nthe post office, walk around and see why they needed to move the post \noffice.\n  I wasn't being arrogant. I wasn't being unreasonable at all. I was \njust being a person. This is one example of the arrogance that we run \nup against. As it turns out, as a consequence of this, they are very \nembarrassed and sat down and worked out a solution with the community.\n  My amendment is very simple. Basically, it says whenever the Postal \nService wants to close a post office, and I am sure there are needs to \nclose post offices, and there are needs to relocate. Whenever they \nclose or decide to relocate, they have to do several things.\n  No. 1, give notice. Give notice to the public, 60 days' notice to the \ncommunities being served. No. 2, have a hearing. No. 3, that they abide \nby the local zoning requirements of the community.\n  It is quite simple. I know the Postal Service will object, saying, \ngee, Congress shouldn't get into managing the Postal Service, and we \nare not getting into the managing of the Postal Service. We are saying \ngive the communities an opportunity to be heard. If the Postal Service \nand the Commission reject the community's demand, that is it. There is \nno right of appeal or judicial jurisdiction over any decision made by \nthe Postal Commission after the public has an opportunity to comment.\n  It is my experience that sometimes when a Government agency sits down \nwith a community, in advance, and talks it over with the community and \nasks their opinions about things before making a decision of what they \nwill do, that usually things work out pretty well.\n  On the other hand, if an agency doesn't in advance go talk to the \ncommunity, but just announces a decision arbitrarily, the community \nfeels like it has not been consulted and it hasn't been consulted. The \ncommittee feels like they are taken for granted. The fact is that we \nare talking about the public. They are the employers. The employees are \nthe Postal Service. I just ask Senators to support this amendment \nbecause it does give communities a little bit of a say in where the \nfacilities are located. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my good friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to argue in support of an \namendment sponsored by myself and Senator Baucus that would require the \nU.S. Postal Service to let communities know when they are planning to \nshut down, relocate, or consolidate a community's post office. This \namendment aims to preserve the fabric of downtowns and prevent sprawl \nby giving citizens a say in Postal Service decisions to close, \nrelocate, or consolidate their local post office.\n\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors Association, \nthe National League of Cities, the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation, the National Association of Postmasters of the United \nStates, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation \nOfficers, the American Planning Association, the Association of United \nStates Postal Lessors, and the International Downtown Association.\n  Coming from a small town in Vermont, I understand the importance \ndowntowns or village centers play in the identity and longevity of a \ncommunity. Downtowns are where people go to socialize, shop, learn what \ntheir elected representatives are doing, and gather to celebrate \nholidays with their neighbors.\n  One of the focal points of any downtown area is the community's post \noffice. Post offices have been part of downtowns and village centers as \nlong as most cities and towns have existed. These post offices are \noften located in historic buildings and have provided towns with a \nsense of continuity as their communities have changed over time. The \nremoval of this focal point can quickly lead to the disappearance of \ncontinuity and spirit of a community and then the community itself.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will enable the inhabitants of small \nvillages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides \nthat their local post office will be closed, relocated, or \nconsolidated. Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is \nnecessary. A few stories from my home state of Vermont will answer this \nquestion.\n  A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, \nVermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the \nsmall village center for a new building outside of town. By the time \nthe community was aware of the project, plans were so far along--the \nnew building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the \npost office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully \ninvestigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in \ncontrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we \ncertainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more \nto get our mail.'' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented \nthat as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of \ncommunity are woven and reinforced. ``It may be intangible, but its \nreal, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation \nof the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like \nPerkinsville.''\n  In 1988, the post office in the Stockbridge, Vermont, General Store \nneeded to expand. The store owner tried to find money to rehabilitate \nan 1811 barn next to the store to provide the needed space, but was not \nsuccessful. In 1990, the post office moved into a new facility located \non the outskirts of Stockbridge on a previously undeveloped section of \nland at the intersection of two highways. People can no longer walk to \nthe post office as they once were able to do when it was located in the \nvillage center. The relocation of the Stockbridge post office \nunfortunately removed one of the anchors of the community.\n  These are not isolated examples.\n  Mr. President, post office relocations are not only occurring in \nVermont, but all across the country. My colleagues will quickly \ndiscover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the \npost office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, \ndeprived access to citizens without cars, and contributed to urban \nsprawl.\n  The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in \na community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing or \nconsolidation of a post office. This community\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nvoice has been lacking in the current process. This bill does not give \nthe citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing or \nconsolidation. Instead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure \ncommunity voices and concerns are heard and taken into account by the \nPostal Service.\n  Additionally, this act will require the Postal Service to abide by \nlocal zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal \nbuildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the \nability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has \nlead to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety \nstandards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such \nas storm water management.\n  Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are \ncenters of social and business interaction. In communities where post \noffices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become \nintegral to these communities' identities. I believe that this \nlegislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal \nService, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and me in support of this \nimportant amendment.\n  This is a simple amendment. I can't believe it can't be accepted.\n  Vermonters are tired of waking up in the morning and finding out \ntheir post office will be somewhere else. Under the proposed rule, all \nthey get is a notice in the mail. There is no public hearing required. \nThere is no way to appeal. It is just given carte blanche as to what \nthey want to do.\n  In one little town in Vermont, they found out their post office moved \n2 miles outside of town, and the people who had gathered in the \nvillage, a lot of the reason they gathered in the village was to be \nable to walk to the post office. They have to go 2 miles to get their \nmail.\n  No notice, no ability to participate at all. Blanket exemption for \nmany zoning rules. They don't have to even take care of what the \nplanning for the town has been. There is an exemption from the historic \npreservation rule. It says they can exempt projects from the new \nstandards if the project is to meet an emergency requirement or is for \ntemporary use, with no definition of what they are.\n  You are at the complete mercy of the post office to stick it anywhere \nthey want. I tell you, our post offices are up in arms over this. All \nwe want is a simple logical way where people are notified, they get a \nchance to be heard, they find out where the locations are going to be, \nthey have an opportunity to make suggestions, and then they get on with \nlife. But right now the way it is, it has my people in Vermont in the \nsmall town areas deeply upset. They have got postmasters who are ready \nto march on Washington. Why? Because we want some simple, commonsense \nrules to be abided by so that there is local input as to where your \nnext post office is going to be.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition, reluctantly, to \nthis amendment because I agree very strongly with the fact that \ncustomers and residents of an area where a post office facility is \nlocated that is considered for relocation, consolidation, or closing, \nought to have an opportunity to have a say-so in that process.\n  For over a year, our subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the \nlegislation involving the Postal Service, has been working closely with \nofficials at the U.S. Postal Service to try to improve the processes. I \ncan tell you that we have received a lot of cooperation, and I am \nconvinced that we will continue to receive cooperation in improving \nthis process and showing some sensitivity to political concerns and to \nlocal interests that are affected by these decisions.\n  The Postal Service's continued efforts are appreciated very much by \nme. I think it would be a mistake for the Senate to legislate a new set \nof requirements or procedures that the U.S. Postal Service would have \nto follow. It would have the effect of undoing a lot of the good work \nthat has been done recently when we have tried to work with them on \nthis issue.\n  In fact, Postmaster General Henderson has recently placed a \nmoratorium on the closing of small post offices. This is an important \nissue. I agree with that. It deserves the attention of the Congress. \nBut it is also a complex issue, one that should receive the careful \nconsideration of the legislative committee in the due course of \nbusiness, not by the adoption of an amendment, with 10 minutes of \ndebate on each side, attached to an appropriations bill.\n  This amendment would add a lengthy procedural set of requirements for \nall facility replacements, relocations, and closings. If a fire \ndestroyed a postal facility, for example, necessary replacement would \nbe delayed, as this new process--if we adopt it--ran its course. For \neach facility change, the postmasters would have to write to each \ncustomer explaining what, why, and when the action was planned. A \npublic hearing would then be required, with testimony received from \npersons served by the facility. The Service would then have to respond \nin writing to any proposal of an alternative, giving reasons for \nrejecting such proposal. And then if one postal customer objects, the \nproposed action could be appealed to the Postal Rate Commission, \ncausing additional delay.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to seriously slow down the \nfacility modernization program of the U.S. Postal Service. The Service \nhas over 35,000 facilities around the country, and 8,000 of these \nfacilities were modernized or improved during the last year.\n  The Service has just recently published in the Federal Register new \nrequirements that it is imposing on itself for consultation with local \nleaders and customers on all facility projects. The projects must be \npublicized in the local newspaper and a public hearing held to explain \nthe proposal. Additionally, local public officials receive at least a \n45-day notice before the Postal Service solicits for a new site. The \nnew processes should provide ample opportunity for public input in a \nresponsible and orderly way. I think they should be given a chance to \nwork.\n  I urge Senators to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your side has 3 minutes 6 seconds. The other \nside has 6 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield a minute and a half to my good \nfriend from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the list of things I presented is the \nlist that the Senator from Mississippi was talking about. It doesn't do \nanything for you. It allows you to know and gives you a 1-day notice. \nYou get it in the mail and you find out the next day where it is \nlocated. There is a minimum 60 days for the--there is a gross \nexemption, blanket exemption, of the zoning requirements. They are \nexempt from new standards if it is for temporary use, but there is no \ndefinition of what that is. All these things I mentioned are what we \nare talking about. That is why we believe very strongly that our \namendment should prevail and we will work it out in conference.\n  I yield whatever time I have.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Simply, Mr. President, this is already in the law. A \nperson may already appeal a decision to close a post office. The \nCommission then decides whether that is reviewable. We are not changing \nthat. That is in the law today. Any person can appeal the decision made \nby the Postal Service to close a post office. That is in the law today. \nWe are saying, at least give the community notice that they are going \nto close. If that is done, then fewer people are going to appeal. That \nis all this is.\n  I just urge Senators to vote for something which is just common sense \nand reasonable. It is not going to be an excessive burden on the Postal \nService. It is just asking for people up front to have an opportunity \nto be in on the process.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof the time in opposition and move to table the amendment. I don't want \nto\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\ncut off any Senator's right to express themselves. I yield back the \ntime left on this side on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Coats) and \nthe Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Ohio will yield \nmomentarily, I know he is up next, but I think we have an agreement \nthat will help us bring this to conclusion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3378\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have to act on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3378) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am continuing to struggle to try to get a \nfinite list of amendments. I think we have that. I know a number of \nthese amendments will be worked out, will be included in the managers' \npackage. I have discussed this arrangement and this list with the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the ranking member, and with Senator \nDaschle. I believe this is the best way to get this to a conclusion \nthat would be fair to one and all.\n  Again, I do note, before I make that unanimous consent request, that \nwe do have some Senators who are going to represent the entire body at \nthe funeral in the morning. So we are trying to go ahead and take up \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill first thing in the \nmorning, lay it down at 9 o'clock, and then any stacked votes would \noccur at 1 o'clock.\n  To renew the bidding, in the earlier unanimous consent agreement, we \nhave lined up for consideration the McConnell amendment for 30 minutes, \nthe Glenn amendment for 30 minutes, and the Harkin amendment for 30 \nminutes; Harkin with regard to drug control, the other two with regard \nto FEC.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that no further first-degree amendments \nbe in order other than the list agreed to earlier this evening and the \nbelow-listed amendments, and they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments: Graham relevant amendment, managers' package; DeWine \nregarding Customs; Domenici regarding FLETC; Stevens relevant \namendment; Senators Daschle and Lott--one relevant each; Conrad \nregarding high-intensity drug areas; Dorgan regarding an advisory \ncommission; one by Graham; Harkin and Bingaman--all three on the high-\nintensity drug issue. I hope they could work those out or roll them \ninto one or something of that nature; Kerrey regarding sense of the \nSenate; and a Kohl managers' amendment.\n  I further ask all amendments must be offered and debated tonight and \nthe votes be postponed to occur at 1, if any are needed, on the \namendments. And, of course, final passage on Thursday, and that they \noccur in stacked sequence with 2 minutes for debate at that time before \neach vote for closing remarks, and that following those votes the bill \nbe advanced to third reading.\n  I further ask that if the motion relative to the Graham motion to \nreconsider is not tabled, the underlying amendment and motions be \nlimited to unlimited debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, through the Chair, address the majority leader: \nWe have a matter at 1 o'clock, for the hour. We have the Director of \nthe CIA coming. We have 35 Senators who have said they want to hear \nhim. It is going to be in 407. Could we do it at 2 o'clock, or 10 till, \nthe votes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield for a moment, it is the \nintention of the leader to take up the defense bill when we convene in \nthe morning, right?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With the understanding we can proceed with business \nother than votes prior to that time, I think we can handle it.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right. Then we would have those stacked votes at----\n  Mr. REID. At 2 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. At 2 o'clock? Is that agreeable with the chairman?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, it is. I ask the leader if there is any possibility \nwe might get some agreement, however, that we can see the amendments \nthat are going to be brought up in the balance of the day by noon \ntomorrow with regard to the Defense bill. If we could just have an \nindication what Senators are going to have amendments so we can start \nscheduling the action after the vote on the stacked amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say if I could, to the chairman, if there are \namendments that are debated and ready for a vote at that time, we could \nput them in the sequence at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would be happy to do that. We would like to see what \nthe remainder of the day, and Friday morning, is going to look like if \nwe are going to finish the bill sometime Friday.\n  Mr. LOTT. We amend the request, then, to 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the leader.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am trying to discern whether or not the post office \nin St. Paul named after Eugene McCarthy will be in the managers' \namendment? Is that correct?\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be accepted. The objection that has been lodged \nwill be withdrawn and the agreement was, the understanding was, when \nthat is withdrawn, the Senator had another amendment that he would \nwithhold.\n  Your amendment will be in the bill when it is passed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ndon't intend to, may I just have scheduled, between 12:30 and 1:30, 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Five minutes or so?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will make sure that occurs, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3379\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n 431 et seq.) to provide for appointment and term length for the staff \n director and general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration on behalf of myself, Senator McCain, \nSenator Bennett and Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3379.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following section:\n\n     SEC. __. PROVISIONS FOR STAFF DIRECTOR AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF \n                   THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Appointment and Term of Service.--\n       (1) In general.--The first sentence of section 306(f)(1) of \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. \n     437c(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``by the Commission'' and \n     inserting ``by an affirmative vote of not less than 4 members \n     of the Commission for a term of 4 years''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply with respect to any individual serving as the \n     staff director or general counsel of the Federal Election \n     Commission on or after January 1, 1999, without regard to \n     whether or not the individual served as staff director or \n     general counsel prior to such date.\n       (b) Treatment of Individuals Filling Vacancies; Termination \n     of Authority Upon Expiration of Term.--Section 306(f)(1) of \n     such Act (2 U.S.C. 437c(f)(1)) is amended by inserting after \n     the first sentence the following: ``An individual appointed \n     as a staff director or general counsel to fill a vacancy \n     occurring other than by the expiration of a term of office \n     shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the \n     individual whose term is being filled. An individual serving \n     as staff director or general counsel may not serve in such \n     position after the expiration of the individual's term unless \n     reappointed in accordance with this paragraph.''.\n       (c) Rule of Construction Regarding Authority of Acting \n     General Counsel.--Section 306(f) of such Act (2 U.S.C. \n     437c(f)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit \n     any individual serving as an acting general counsel of the \n     Commission from performing any functions of the general \n     counsel of the Commission.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had earlier offered to enter into a \nmuch shorter time agreement, because this amendment really requires \nvery little explanation.\n  Last year, in the Treasury-Postal bill, we enacted term limits for \nthe FEC Commissioners, and the terms of the Federal Election Commission \nmembers, Mr. President, are now one 6-year term.\n  This amendment continues the necessary reform of the Federal Election \nCommission by providing that two critical staff members at the Federal \nElection Commission--the staff director and the general counsel--serve \na 4-year term, but it is important to note, these important staff \nmembers could continue to serve with the vote of four of the six FEC \nCommissioners. It is important to remember the FEC is a 3-3 Commission, \nthree Republicans, three Democrats. It was structured that way on \npurpose. It is necessary that it be structured that way.\n  A very important part of the Federal Election Commission team is the \nstaff director and the general counsel. Under the amendment that I have \noffered, cosponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Bennett and Senator \nWarner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, beginning in January, the \ngeneral counsel and the staff director will be subject to a 4-year \nterm, and in order to achieve that 4-year term, Mr. President, they \nwould have to enjoy the confidence of both parties; that is, they would \nhave to achieve four votes which means at least three of one party and \none of another----\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Those Senators \nwishing to continue discussions please take your discussions off the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Or for that matter, Mr. President, the general counsel \nmight achieve the votes of two of one party and two of another. In \nother words, four votes to achieve a 4-year term, after which the \ngeneral counsel, if he or she wanted to continue--and many of them \nmight not--would have to be able to reach across party lines, which is, \nof course, the spirit of the Federal Election Commission, in order to \nachieve a 4-year term.\n  There is really nothing else to say about this amendment. It \ncontinues the reform process.\n  Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes, 23 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwhatever time he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my understanding of the actions and \nactivities of the FEC up to this point indicate that it is an agency \nbadly in need of reform, and I am delighted that the term limits have \nbeen enacted. It is also my understanding that because of its past \nhistory, some Commissioners of the FEC have been less than diligent in \ntheir duties and, as a result, the power to run the Commission has \ndevolved to the staff.\n  When we debate term limits generally, we are often told that one of \nthe reasons we should oppose term limits is because it will put too \nmuch power in the hands of the staff. The staff becomes the permanent \nand institutional memory of the body, while those who are supposed to \nrun it keep cycling through on term limits.\n  I think it entirely appropriate that we give the new Commissioners, \nas their terms expire, the opportunity to act affirmatively on the \nstaff and not allow the power of inertia to keep staff members in \nforever and forever. It is a logical thing to do, and I am happy to \nsupport it and happy to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. If this is \nadopted, this means that this will be the only independent agency or \ndepartment of Government to time limit the general counsel or staff \ndirector--the only independent agency in the Government.\n  One of the FEC Commissioners has indicated to us what he thought \nwould happen in this regard. He said it would cause chaos in the agency \nbecause, as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has said, the \nCommission normally must have four votes for any action to ensure \naction is bipartisan.\n  This means that if they were trying to get rid of the general counsel \nfor whatever reason, the amendment would allow a minority of three to \nfire the general counsel because there wouldn't be a majority to \nretain, there wouldn't be the four votes. So there is concern about who \nthey can get to even serve in a general counsel position in that \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n  I think this will go a long ways toward destroying the FEC's \nindependence in its own investigations under the law, because the \ngeneral counsel will have to continually lobby for reinstatement. That \njust doesn't make any sense. I see no reason why we should be carving \nout the FEC, which is so important to us these days in trying to get \nelections laws straightened out, to be the only independent agency in \nall of Government to have such a time limit put on their general \ncounsel or their staff director.\n  They serve there, they have served for longer terms before, and \nserved very honorably and well, but to place them under these different \nrestrictions on voting, that would mean a general counsel could be \nousted much more easily than I believe any of us would like to see and \nis something I don't think we should do.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose this. If there are any others who \nwish to speak against this amendment, I will be glad to yield such \ntime. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes, 52 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wonder if the Senator from Ohio will yield me 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield such time as the Senator may desire.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment offered \nby the Senator from Kentucky. I already spoke at length on the floor \nagainst a very similar amendment in its other incarnation in the other \nHouse. Fortunately, that body did not keep this provision on the bill.\n  What is happening here is the opposite of reform. It is the opposite \nof reform. This is an effort, plain and simple, to hamstring the agency \nthat is charged with the very important responsibility of enforcing the \nFederal election law to which we all have to adhere--the Federal \nElection Commission. This effort has deadly serious consequences in \nterms of the independence of this Commission, and it has to be \ndefeated.\n  The effect of the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky would be to \nresult in the firing of the Commission's general counsel. The amendment \ninvolves the Congress in the personnel decisions of the FEC, the agency \nthat we have charged with overseeing the way we conduct our reelection \ncampaigns.\n  The Senator from Kentucky wants to get rid of a career civil servant \nwho is simply trying to do his job to enforce the election laws. The \ncurrent general counsel's institutional memory and knowledge is \ncritically important now, because we are poised to confirm three new \nCommissioners, perhaps before the August recess.\n  If we do that, Mr. President, the Commission will be at full strength \nfor the first time in almost 3 years. It has been that long since all \nsix slots on the Commission were filled. And right as that happens, if \nwe adopt this amendment, we are going to throw the Commission into \nturmoil once again by getting rid of the general counsel and forcing \nthis newly constituted Commission to come to agreement on someone else. \nThat could take months and hamper the enforcement efforts of the \nCommission at a crucial time, a very interesting time, right after the \n1998 elections.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand, as the Senator \nfrom Ohio has well stated, just how unprecedented this micromanaging of \nan agency's personnel decisions is.\n  No other agency must reappoint or replace its top staff every 4 \nyears--not one. According to the Congressional Research Service, there \nare three independent agencies where the general counsel is actually a \npolitical appointee, nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. In each of these cases, the general counsel has direct \nstatutory authority.\n  But in every other independent agency, including the FEC, the general \ncounsel is appointed by either the chairman or the entire body and \nserves at the pleasure of the appointing entity. That is what the law \nis now with respect to the FEC, and there is no reason to change it.\n  In recent years, the FEC has undertaken a number of controversial \nactions in a very reasonable attempt to enforce the law that the \nCongress has written. Some of these cases have taken on very powerful \npolitical figures or groups--and they have done it on both sides of the \naisle. And the crucial point is that the FEC itself has authorized all \nof these cases by a majority vote. If you don't like a case that the \nFEC has filed, you need to look to the Commission, not the general \ncounsel. He is just trying to do his job as he sees fit.\n  What we have here, Mr. President, is an effort to intimidate an \nagency. The proponents of this firing want to punish the FEC's general \ncounsel for bringing forward recommendations to enforce the law, even \nthough in all of the cases I have mentioned, a bipartisan majority of \nthe commission has agreed with him. In every one of those cases a \nbipartisan group has agreed to take the action.\n  Mr. President, I submit that we cannot let this happen. We need to \nlet the professional staff of the FEC do its job. Surely the 3 to 3 \nparty split on the Commission is enough to make sure that the \nCommission doesn't go off on some partisan vendetta. We must stop the \npartisan vendetta that this proposal represents. Protect the \nindependence of the FEC and the nonpartisan nature of its staff by \ndefeating the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McConnell \namendment. If this provision is enacted, the traditional bipartisan \nbalance of the Federal Elections Commission will be disrupted. Under \nthis provision the general counsel and staff director of the FEC can \nessentially be fired by either the three Democratic or Republican \nCommissioners on the FEC.\n  This amendment has the potential of paralyzing the Federal Elections \nCommission and further eroding what is already a weakened campaign \noversight agency.\n  Mr. President, such a move would be unprecedented in the Federal \nGovernment. According to a memorandum prepared by the Congressional \nResearch Service, no general counsel which is not subject to Senate \nconfirmation may be removed in this manner. It would be ironic that the \nagency charged with investigating political campaigns is crippled by \nCongress.\n  When this amendment was put forward in the House of Representatives, \nthe New York Times noted that this provision would cripple the FEC and \nguarantee ``an open field for influence peddlers and influence \nbuyers.''\n  In a year when this Congress failed to pass campaign finance reform, \nit would be even more tragic if we crippled the only watchdogs of our \ncampaign finance system.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment which proposes to \nlimit the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) general counsel and staff \ndirector to a term of 4 years unless four of the six Commissioners vote \nto renew their terms. The Commission is composed of six members--three \nRepublicans and three Democrats.\n  Consistent with the FEC's overall statutory scheme, requiring a \nmajority decision to take official action, four votes are currently \nneeded to remove the general counsel or staff director from office. If \nthis amendment is adopted, four affirmative votes would be required for \nthese officials to retain their position. That means three \nCommissioners from the same party voting as a block could force the \ntermination of either the general counsel or the staff director and \nhold hostage either of the two top career officials at the FEC.\n  This amendment injects partisanship into the carefully balanced \nbipartisan structure at the FEC. Further, this could cause the staff to \nmake recommendations based on partisan considerations in order to \nprotect their jobs. These consequences would be extremely detrimental \nto the administration of the FEC and the enforcement of our campaign \nfinance laws.\n  There appears to be little question that the purpose of this \nprovision is to retaliate against the general counsel, Lawrence Noble, \nfor certain actions. The general counsel recently made several \ncontroversial recommendations to the Commission. In response to 1997 \nrulemaking petitions filed by President Clinton and others, Mr. Noble \nrecommended that the FEC seek public\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\ncomment on a proposal to prohibit the use of soft money in connection \nwith federal elections.\n  Acting on the general counsel's recommendation, the Commission also \npursued cases in court that have received negative reactions from some \nMembers. A review of Mr. Noble's record indicates that he has been \nnonpartisan, balanced and fair. Mr. Noble has aggressively pursued \nenforcement of campaign finance laws against Democrats and Republicans \nalike.\n  In a year in which the need for campaign finance reform has received \nso much attention, Congress would be sending the wrong message if it \npasses a provision designed to weaken the very agency responsible for \nenforcing campaign finance laws.\n  I urge you to oppose this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. One other item I would like to note for everyone's \nillumination on this.\n  The House had a similar provision to that which is proposed by the \nSenator from Kentucky. They had a similar provision in the bill when it \ncame to the House floor. They had a debate over there on this very \nprovision which was described to me as being a bitter debate, a lot of \nrancor in it. It wound up with a bipartisan effort being put forward to \nstrike this position on the floor of the House; and it was struck. They \nvoted this provision out of the House bill on a bipartisan vote. And \nnow this is an effort being made to put it back in on the floor of the \nSenate here.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the House vote was on a point of order. \nIn fact, this particular reform has been recommended by the House \nauthorizing committee. Let us not make this more complicated than it \nis.\n  All this amendment does that the Senator from Kentucky has offered, \nin concert with the Senator from Utah, is require that on this--in this \nunique agency; it is different from any other agency in the Federal \nGovernment; it is three and three: three Republicans and three \nDemocrats--to require that in this agency every 4 years the top two \nstaff people enjoy enough confidence across party lines to be \nreappointed for 4 years.\n  In fact, Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the agency will, \nin fact, be operated on a bipartisan basis because any staff director \nor general counsel who, after 4 years in the office, cannot get the \nconfidence of both parties, Mr. President, clearly is not operating on \na bipartisan basis and therefore should not be reappointed.\n  So it is, in fact, this amendment that ensures that the Federal \nElection Commission achieves its original mission, which was to operate \non a bipartisan basis.\n  I see that my friend from Utah is on the floor. I yield to him \nwhatever time he may need.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I simply have to respond to the notion that this is an \namendment to fire the incumbent general counsel. That is what we were \ntold in the last debate. That assumes that the present general counsel \ndoes not enjoy bipartisan support. That assumes that the present \ngeneral counsel has conducted himself in such a way that he cannot \ngather the necessary four votes. I have no knowledge that that is \nindeed the case. But if it is indeed the case, it is a strong argument \nfor saying that the present general counsel probably should not be in \nhis job.\n  If he cannot muster bipartisan support to hold this job, we have a \nsituation where he is obviously supporting one party over the other in \norder to maintain those three votes. That is the only conclusion that \ncan be drawn from the argument made by the Senator from Wisconsin who \nclaims this is an attempt to fire the incumbent general counsel.\n  There is nothing in here that says this is an attempt to fire the \nincumbent general counsel. It simply says the incumbent general counsel \nhas to enjoy bipartisan support. And if he is as wonderful and as \nbipartisan as the Senator from Wisconsin says he is, he has nothing to \nfear from this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Utah, in further \nelaboration, after the enactment of this into law, we are not making \nthe general counsel or the staff director subject to removal on a whim. \nThey have a 4-year term, an opportunity to develop a record of \nbipartisan cooperation with both the Republicans and the Democrats on \nthe Federal Election Commission before reaching the end of the 4-year \nterm. At that point, if they want to continue enjoying enough \nconfidence across party lines to achieve another 4-year appointment--it \nseems to me eminently reasonable. And, Mr. President, I think it \nguarantees that the Federal Election Commission will be the kind of \nagency that the Congress intended it to be when it was created in the \nmid 1970s.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, if I have any.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. We are prepared to go to a vote. I am prepared to yield \nback the remainder of my time if the Senator from Kentucky is prepared \nto do the same thing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back by both \nparties. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth Coliguri, a member \nof my staff, be given floor privileges for the remainder of the \nconsideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is obviously some misunderstanding about the \nearlier consent agreement that was entered into between all of us and \nthe Parliamentarian. I think there is no misunderstanding among the \nSenators, so I ask unanimous consent that all of the amendments debated \ntonight be voted upon in order of their offering beginning at 2 o'clock \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the order.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to \nobject, but my understanding is the majority leader proposed that and \nit was already entered. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There was some misunderstanding by the Parliamentarian \nas to whether we were voting further tonight. I do not think there was \nany misunderstanding among Senators.\n  Mr. GLENN. OK. Fine. Whatever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3380\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for enforcement activities of \n                    the Federal Election Commission)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. GLENN], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3380.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 44, line 13, insert after ``$33,700,000'' the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,800,000 to be used for \n     enforcement activities)''.\n       On page 46, line 18, strike ``$5,665,585,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,662,785,000''.\n       On page 56, line 20, strike ``$5,665,585,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,662,785,000''.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send this to the desk, along with my \ncosponsors, Senators Jeffords, Kohl, Levin, Feingold, and Dodd. I offer \nthis amendment to increase the budgeted funds a small amount for \nenforcement efforts by the Federal Election Commission. This agency \nbears the very difficult and thankless task of policing all of our \ncampaigns in the whole Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out, first, that this amendment \nwas offered in the House, was debated there, and was approved. And the \namendment I offer today adds exactly the same amount. It is just an \nadditional $2.8 million to the FEC budget. The money would help the \nagency to investigate and prove wrongdoing. These additional funds are \njust a small step toward giving the Commission the resources that it \nreally needs.\n\n  In past years, we have seen attempts by Congress to stop vigorous \nenforcement of the law by failing to provide an adequate budget for \nthis agency. Just last year, following an election in which \nunprecedented abuse of the campaign finance laws occurred, Congress \nrefused to give money to the FEC to hire more staff to investigate \nthese abuses. I thought that was a tragedy.\n  Just last week in the House, we saw an extraordinary display of \nbipartisanship because the House defeated provisions intended to \npoliticize the agency, and instead approved additional funds, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, for the Federal Election Commission. The extra \nmoney was set aside very specifically to help the FEC pay for \ninvestigations, many stemming from the events of the 1996 campaign. \nThose of us who support campaign finance reform--which is a clear \nmajority in this body--agree that the system is broken and needs to be \nfixed.\n  Until we can pass new laws, we must at least allow the agency we \ncreated to do its best to actively and vigorously enforce the existing \nlaw. This amendment takes an important step toward assuring that the \nFEC can do just that. This amendment is a renewed commitment by the \nMembers of Congress to make a real effort to ensure that people who \nviolate our existing campaign finance laws are found and are held \naccountable. This is the only way we can assure the continued integrity \nof our election process.\n  Last year, we saw a lot of effort on campaign finance reform, and \nwith Chairman Thompson, I had the privilege of serving as the ranking \nmember of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' investigation into the \n1996 campaign finance fiasco. During the course of those hearings, \nChairman Thompson called on several campaign finance experts to \ntestify. One of those witnesses was Norm Ornstein of the Brookings \nInstitution who told us in testimony that he believed that the FEC \nwould probably need at least $50 million--that is about twice what they \nare receiving--in order to become an effective enforcement agency.\n  These funds I am proposing are a very small step. They just match the \nHouse funds that have already passed over there. It is a small step, \nbut still leaves the agency woefully short of what experts think it \nneeds.\n  Let me give a little bit of perspective of the job facing the FEC. \nRight now, the FEC has 200 cases pending; 93 of those cases are under \ninvestigation and 107 cases, over half, are sitting in a file cabinet. \nWhy? Why are these cases just sitting there in the cabinets with no \naction? They are waiting for staff to become available for these 200 \ncases. The FEC can only afford 25 staff attorneys.\n  How about the investigators who could help the attorneys? The FEC has \ntwo, which they consider a great improvement from 1994 when they had \nexactly zero. They had none. By way of contrast, on last year's \ninvestigative staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, we had 44 \nlawyers and a dozen investigators, and we weren't dealing with the \nwhole aspect of everything the FEC has to deal with. We were dealing \nwith only one limited aspect of what occurred during the 1996 campaign. \nWe faced nowhere near the caseload that confronts the agency that is \ntrying to do the best job it can on a real shoestring.\n  I think we can all agree it doesn't matter how good the law that you \nhave, if it isn't actively and vigorously enforced, it means nothing. \nIt becomes a scofflaw. The Federal Election Commission already enforces \na law readily exploited and bent in ways never intended. We, in \nCongress, fail to give the FEC the resources to find and hold \naccountable those who willfully violate these laws, who misuse soft \nmoney, who attempt to disguise political ads as issue advertising, and \non and on. With all of the things we know that can happen, how can we \nhope to ensure the public has confidence in its elections and in its \nelected officials?\n  This amendment is a very, very small and reasonable step towards \nallowing the FEC to accomplish its mission and enforce the law. I hope \nmy colleague will support it. I repeat, it is one that has already \npassed in the House. We just matched the figure of $2.8 million that \nthey have already passed in the House. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, the FEC is clearly not \nunderfunded. Its budget has more than doubled in the past decade. They \nare already getting $2 million more this year than last year under the \nbudget of the Senator from Colorado, who has been quite generous to the \nFederal Election Commission--frankly, beyond what I would have done had \nI been in his shoes. The FEC's problems are certainly not on the \nfinancial side.\n  Senator Glenn would give them an extra $2.8 million over and above \nthe additional $2 million that the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nis already providing for this agency. You are talking about a 16-\npercent budget increase, a 16-percent budget increase for the Federal \nElection Commission. I think the U.S. district court, in a recent case, \nsaid it best when they reported in a Wall Street Journal editorial of \nJuly 13:\n\n       If there is one thing all the players agree on, it is the \n     need for better disclosure of contributions and a crackdown \n     on violators. But a Federal court this week [the Wall Street \n     Journal referring to a court decision] signaled that the \n     Nation's electoral traffic cop, the Federal Election \n     Commission, is lax in carrying out even that basic function.\n\n  That is the point. The basic function of the Federal Election \nCommission is disclosure.\n  The distinguished Senator from Colorado has more than adequately \nprovided funding for this agency. To give them the additional money \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Ohio would provide a 16-\npercent increase over last year. Clearly, that is not appropriate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that's difficult to respond to, to say the \nFEC needs more resources. My distinguished colleague, my friend from \nKentucky, says they need to monitor disclosure better; but how do they \nmonitor that if they don't have the people to do it? They should crack \ndown on violators. How do they crack down if they don't have the people \non the staff to do it? They have a grand total of 25 staff attorneys. \nUntil 1994, they didn't have any investigators.\n  To say that we put them up a certain percentage this year, when \nestimates we had in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwere that we should probably double their budget to give them a fair \nshot at doing their job, which would put their budget up around, \nsomewhere around $50 million was the estimate, instead of where it is \nnow, to think if they could even come close to fulfilling the law and \nthe requirements they are supposed to monitor with the staff they have, \njust isn't right.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  I said in my statement a moment ago, the FEC has 200 cases pending. \nThey are only investigating 93. Why? It is because they don't have the \npeople to do it. To say that they don't need more money and are quite \nadequately funded just flies in the face of logic. They do not have \nadequate staff. They can't even keep up with these things. These cases \nare years and years old. Many of them will not even be settled before \nthe next election cycle comes around. They don't have the staff over \nthere for any expeditious treatment. Ninety-three of those cases are \nunder investigation, 107 cases are sitting in file cabinets for lack of \npeople.\n  In 1994, they didn't have any investigators and then they hired one. \nThen it was said later on they had 100-percent improvement in their \ninvestigative staff because they then hired two; they had two people on \ntheir investigative staff. None of these attorneys are people who are \nnormally going out and doing all the spadework, doing all of the \ninvestigating, doing the fieldwork out in the field. To say that they \nhave quite adequate funding because they went up a certain small \npercentage just flies in the face of logic.\n  I know we are not going to probably change many minds on this \nparticular subject, but if we are serious about ever improving our \ncampaign financing and having the FEC as the monitoring body that does \nthat, this is such a modest little amount of $2.8 million. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this and match the House with the exact same \namount the House put in. We wanted to match what they have done.\n  They had a debate on this in the House and decided to put this in. It \nwas because they felt they not only needed this, they probably needed \nmuch more, but could not get more through. I would like to see us do \nthis an extra $15 million or $20 million. I know we are not going to do \nthat here, but this is such a modest increase and they need it so badly \nthat I hope my colleagues will agree to the amendment I am proposing \nwhen we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm pleased to cosponsor and rise in \nsupport of the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn. And how fitting that Senator Glenn has taken the lead on this \nissue since he spent much of last year investigating the fundraising \nscandals of the 1996 election. I congratulate him on that work and on \noffering this very modest, but very important amendment today.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I have spent a lot of time on this floor \nin this Congress debating the McCain-Feingold bill, and the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. It has been a very difficult issue to make \nprogress on. We have a strong bipartisan majority, including seven \nSenators from the Republican side of the aisle, in support of reform. A \npartisan minority continues to block our bill.\n  But one area on which this entire body is united, Mr. President, is \nthe need to enforce the laws that are already on the book. In fact, \ntime after time when we debated the issue last fall and again early \nthis spring, opponents of our bill raised that issue as a reason that \nthey opposed McCain-Feingold. Why should we enact new laws, they said, \nwhen we can't even enforce the ones on the book? No less than eight \nSenators made some version of that argument in last fall's debate, \nright in the middle of the Thompson Committee hearings. More still \nraised it when we revisited campaign finance reform in February.\n  In fact, given the arguments made by the opponents of the McCain-\nFeingold bill, I would hope this amendment would be adopted by 100-0 \nwhen we vote. Because all the amendment does is give the resources that \nthe Federal Election Commission says it needs to carry out the duties \nthat we have given it under the law. The very small amount of money \nthat this amendment proposes to add to the FEC's appropriation--just \n2.8 million dollars--will bring the FEC's funding up to its full budget \nrequest, which is the level that the House passed bill includes.\n  This is a particularly good and important time to fully fund the FEC. \nThe Rules Committee recently recommended approval of three new nominees \nto the Commission, and one reappointment. If the Senate follows that \nrecommendation, the FEC will have a full complement of Commissioners \nfor the first time since October 1995 when then Chairman Trevor Potter \nleft the Commission. We therefore have a chance to have a fully \nfunctioning Commission prior to this year's elections. What better time \nto have a fully funded Commission as well. What better time to give the \nFEC the resources it says it needs to do its job right.\n  The additional funding provided in this amendment will go directly to \nhiring new personnel to beef up the FEC's enforcement capacity. And \nthere is no doubt at all that these additional investigative and legal \nstaff are truly necessary. The FEC simply is not able to keep up with \nthe workload as things now stand. In Fiscal Year 1997, it dismissed 133 \ncases as being too minor or too old to be worth pursuing. Through June \nof this year, three quarters of the way through this Fiscal Year, the \nFEC has already dismissed 144 cases. Now these are not frivolous cases, \nthese are cases that staff has determined are worth pursuing.\n  And here is the most disturbing statistic, Mr. President. In every \nyear since the FEC adopted this practice of dropping cases that it \ncan't get to the number of cases that are dropped because they are not \nthat important has exceeded the number that are dropped because they \nare stale. Until this year. This year, nearly 60 percent of the cases \ndropped were high priority but stale. This is a very disturbing fact. \nThe FEC is having a harder and harder time getting to the cases that it \ndeems to be significant because of the rising caseload and inadequate \nresources.\n  So, Mr. President, frankly, I can hardly imagine how one could argue \nagainst this amendment. The FEC is a very small agency, with a very \nsmall appropriation, and a very big job. Campaign spending by \ncandidates continues to increase. Involvement in election activity by \noutside groups continues to expand. We simply cannot pretend that we \nwant the laws to be enforced at election time and then ignore the FEC \nat budget time.\n  There is nothing that undermines the public's faith in government \nmore, Mr. President, than a feeling that the rules of the election game \nare being ignored. In a very real sense, Mr. President, this amendment \ngives us the chance to put our money where our mouth is. I hope we take \nit.\n  Once again, I congratulate the senior Senator from Ohio for offering \nthis amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment by \nSenator Glenn to bring the funding for the Federal Elections Commission \nto the level requested by the administration. Mr. President, we have \nwatched during the last few years as public confidence in our electoral \nsystem has crumbled. We've seen investigations, deliberations, \norations--but nothing substantive to improve how we elect Members of \nCongress.\n  We all know that despite the strong efforts of many in this \ninstitution--especially Senator McCain and my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold--we have not passed genuine campaign finance reform.\n  At the same time, the workload at the FEC has exploded. Since 1991, \ncampaign spending has increased by nearly 150 percent. The number of \naudits have gone up 110 percent. And the sheer number of transactions \nrecorded by the FEC has increased by 157 percent. This increase in work \nhas come at a time when the FEC, an independent federal agency, has \nlost employees. In the last three years the number of full time \nemployees has actually dropped from 314 to 300.\n  With this increase in work and decrease in staff, it should not be a \nsurprise that the FEC--the agency charged with investigating campaign \nfraud and abuse--has been forced to drop legitimate cases because of \ninsufficient resources. In 1998 alone, of the cases the FEC dismissed, \nnearly two out of three cases were dropped because the FEC did not have \nthe resources to fully investigate them.\n  Mr. President, if I came before this body today and told you that \ncriminals were being let out of jail because there were not enough \npolicemen on the beat, we would rush to provide more resources to law \nenforcement. But because those allegedly breaking the law are political \ncandidates and campaigns, we are ignoring the problem.\n  The House of Representatives recognized the deficiency in funding and \nvoted to bring the FEC budget to $36.5 million. Senator Glenn's \namendment\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nwould do the same, and without increasing overall spending.\n  Mr. President, we should have passed meaningful campaign finance \nreform this year, but we did not. Therefore, the only real improvement \nwe can make to our campaign finance system is to provide the policemen \nof that systems the tool they need to enforce our laws. The Glenn \namendment will provide that additional support, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will reserve the balance of my time. Do \nwe have 2 minutes to explain this before the vote tomorrow? Was that \nthe agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes, evenly divided, \nbefore each vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time for this \nevening.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Glenn \namendment at the agreed to time tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the great courtesies that the \nSenator from Colorado and the Senator from Wisconsin have extended in \nterms of a series of amendments that relate to drug issues. It is my \nhope and expectation that before we come to closure on this matter, \nthose various amendments will be combined in an amendment that will be \nsupported by the managers of this bill.\n  I am in a difficult situation, however, wanting to assure that in the \nunlikely event that that doesn't occur, the amendment that I propose to \noffer is protected. So in a minimum amount of time, I would like to \noffer the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. Robert Warshaw, the \nAssociate Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which \noutlines the severity of the situation in the region of central \nFlorida, which is the subject of the amendment, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: This is in response to your inquiry \n     concerning the status of the Central Florida High Intensity \n     Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). The Central Florida HIDTA was \n     designated by this office on February 27, 1998 after \n     consultation with the governor of Florida, the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n       A thorough analysis of the Threat Assessment and supporting \n     information submitted by the Central Florida HIDTA reveals \n     that this region has been severely affected by the flow of \n     illegal drugs from domestic and international sources, and \n     that this drug trafficking affects the nation as a whole. \n     Illegal drugs are increasingly smuggled into Orlando and \n     Tampa from the Caribbean and Latin America. Among Florida \n     cities in 1996, Orlando reported the highest rate of heroin \n     deaths. Marijuana seizures doubled between 1995 and 1996. \n     Violent crime in Orlando and St. Petersburg increased by 8% \n     in the first six months of 1997, at a time when violent crime \n     declined in many other locations.\n       The Central Florida HIDTA will provide federal assistance \n     intended to measurably reduce drug trafficking through a more \n     coordinated, deliberate and focused approach to drug \n     enforcement and interdiction in the Central Florida area. We \n     anticipate that Federal assistance will enhance combined \n     federal, state and local law enforcement agencies who will \n     focus on heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine and money \n     laundering organizations.\n       With the support of Congress, and federal, state and local \n     law enforcement programs, the Central Florida HIDTA and the \n     national HIDTA program will continue to provide assistance in \n     countering drug trafficking. ONDCP looks forward to your \n     continued support and cooperation in advancing this goal.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                               Robert Warshaw,\n\n                                               Associate Director,\n                                          State and Local Affairs.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not propose to have further debate on \nthis matter now. I hope this amendment can be vitiated tomorrow because \nit will have been adopted or ready to be adopted in a form that would \nbe submitted and supported by the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to assure our colleague, Senator \nGraham of Florida, that staff is working very diligently trying to \nreach agreement to work these amendments into one and make sure they \nare protected. We have a little work to do in finding offsets, but we \nare very close to that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3381\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funding for the Central Florida High Intensity \n                         Drug Trafficking Area)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself and Mr. \n     Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 3381.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

(a) In General.--Beginning in calendar year 2000, \n     and every 2 calendar years thereafter, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget shall prepare and submit to \n     Congress, with the budget submitted under section 1105 of \n     title 31, United States Code, an accounting statement and \n     associated report containing--\n       (1) an estimate of the total annual costs and benefits \n     (including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects) of \n     Federal rules and paperwork, to the extent feasible--\n       (A) in the aggregate;\n       (B) by agency and agency program; and\n       (C) by major rule;\n       (2) an analysis of impacts of Federal regulation on State, \n     local, and tribal government, small business, wages, and \n     economic growth; and\n       (3) recommendations for reform.\n       (b) Notice.--The Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall provide public notice and an opportunity to \n     comment on the statement and report under subsection (a) \n     before the statement and report are submitted to Congress.\n       (c) Guidelines.--To implement this section, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget shall issue guidelines to \n     agencies to standardize--\n       (1) measures of costs and benefits; and\n       (2) the format of accounting statements.\n       (d) Peer Review.--The Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall provide for independent and external peer \n     review of the guidelines and each accounting statement and \n     associated report under this section. Such peer review shall \n     not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \n     U.S.C. App.).\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to \nstrengthen the regulatory accounting provision in Section 625 of the \nTreasury-Postal Appropriations bill. This amendment would require OMB \nto submit a biannual report to Congress on the costs and benefits of \nfederal regulatory programs. I ask unanimous consent that Majority \nLeader Lott and Senators Breaux, Shelby, and Robb be added as \ncosponsors to my amendment. We come from different political \nviewpoints, but we all agree that we need to improve our regulatory \nsystem and make it more open and accountable.\n  This amendment continues the effort begun by Senator Stevens, the \nformer Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, when he passed \nthe Stevens Regulatory Accounting Amendment on the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill in 1996. Our goal is to promote the public's right \nto know about regulation, increase government accountability, and to \nimprove the quality of regulatory programs. This amendment would not \nchange any regulation or regulatory standard. It just provides \nimportant information for smarter and more accountable regulation.\n  Under the Stevens Amendment, the Office of Management and Budget \nissued its first regulatory accounting report to the Congress in \nSeptember 1997. While this first Report was an important step toward \ngovernment accountability, it left a lot to be desired. Following that \nfirst Report, Senator Stevens and I wrote to the OMB Director \nexpressing our concern that OMB was not fully complying with the \nAmendment. Several members of the House sent a similar letter. In \naddition, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings \nInstitution held a workshop reviewing the first OMB Report in the fall \nof 1997. At that workshop, a distinguished group of economists \nunanimously agreed that OMB had fallen short on the Stevens Amendment.\n  Now it's time to take another step toward a more open and accountable \nregulatory system. This amendment would add a few simple requirements \nto the Stevens regulatory accounting provision to ensure that:\n  Regulatory Accounting is a permanent requirement. Every two years, \nOMB would submit the Report with the President's budget.\n  The Report is more informative. To the extent feasible, agencies \nwould provide cost and benefit estimates for agency programs. In \naddition, the Report will clearly cover paperwork costs, including the \nlarge costs of complying with our Byzantine tax system. That was always \nsupposed to be covered.\n  The Report is of higher quality. OMB guidelines to the agencies and \npeer review will improve future reports.\n  As OMB said in their first regulatory accounting Report, \n``regulations (like other instruments of government policy) have \nenormous potential for both good and harm.'' Better information will \nhelp us regulate smarter--to increase the benefits of regulation while \nreducing needless waste and redtape. This will help ensure the success \nof important programs, while enhancing the economic security and well-\nbeing of our families and our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter to \nformer OMB Director Franklin Raines, and a letter from the Alliance USA \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.\n     Subject: Implementation of Regulatory Accounting Amendment.\n     Hon. Franklin D. Raines,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Raines: We would like to work with you toward \n     the successful implementation of the regulatory accounting \n     provision in section 625 of the Treasury and General \n     Government Appropriations Act, 1998 (Pub. L. 105-61). This \n     provision carries forward for another year the requirement \n     that OMB report to Congress on the total costs and benefits \n     of Federal regulatory programs. Based on our review of OMB's \n     first regulatory accounting report, we believe there is an \n     opportunity to make further progress toward a more \n     transparent, cost-effective, and accountable regulatory \n     system.\n       We believe that the public has a right to know the costs \n     and benefits of federal regulatory programs. While the budget \n     process provides the public and Congress with an opportunity \n     to monitor and control tax-and-expenditure programs, \n     regulatory programs do not receive such scrutiny. As your \n     first report says, ``regulations (like other instruments of \n     government policy) have enormous potential for both good and \n     harm.'' We believe that better information will help us to \n     increase the benefits and reduce the costs of regulation. \n     This would contribute to the success of programs the public \n     values, while enhancing the economic security and well-being \n     of our families and communities.\n       While the first regulatory accounting report has some \n     serious omissions, it is an important foundation for \n     improving the regulatory system. Critics said it could not be \n     done, and we appreciate that OMB's Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs (``OIRA''), with limited staff, proved the \n     critics were wrong. We agree that OMB should use the report \n     to raise the quality and utility of agency analyses--for \n     developing new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, \n     and tracking regulatory impacts over time. We encourage OMB \n     to build on this effort by tracking the net benefits of \n     regulations and reforms of old rules.\n       As OMB develops its second report, we believe there are \n     several opportunities for improvement, and we would like to \n     make the following recommendations. First, the report should \n     adhere to specific statutory requirements. The first report \n     fails to recommend improvements for specific regulatory \n     programs or program elements, as required by subsection \n     (a)(4). OMB need not base its recommendations on perfect \n     empirical information nor on its overall estimates of the \n     impacts of the regulatory system. Moreover, the first report \n     does not assess the indirect impacts of Federal regulation, \n     as required by subsection (a)(3).\n       Second, the report should more fully implement the \n     legislation to achieve its goals. The first report failed to \n     break down costs and benefits by program or program element \n     where feasible, as intended by subsection (a)(1). The public \n     also deserves a complete accounting of federal mandates--not \n     simply those that fall within OMB's categories of ``social'' \n     and ``economic'' regulations. OMB should estimate the costs \n     of all paperwork requirements, including those associated \n     with tax collection. OMB also should estimate transfer costs, \n     even if they are viewed as a different category of regulatory \n     costs.\n       Finally, OMB should exercise leadership to assure the \n     quality and reliability of information reported. \n     Specifically, we urge OMB to standardize procedures \n     government-wide for collecting, analyzing, and documenting \n     the best available information. OMB should leverage its \n     effort with cooperation from the agencies and the President's \n     Council of Economic Advisors. OMB also should establish a \n     database, enforce its ``Best Practices'' guidelines, and \n     track the costs and benefits of programs, program elements, \n     and rules over time. OMB should synthesize and evaluate the \n     information provided by the agencies and provide an \n     independent assessment. To this end, OMB staff should be \n     directed to critique the quality of the estimates provided to \n     them, not to simply compile data presented by the agencies.\n       We commend you for an important first step toward a more \n     open, efficient, and accountable regulatory system. We look \n     forward to working with you to advance further in the 1998 \n     report. We would appreciate your response to our \n     recommendations by December 1, 1997.\n       With best wishes,\n           Cordially,\n     Fred Thompson,\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\n       Chairman, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n     Ted Stevens,\n       Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Alliance USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1998.\n     Hon.

As you know, this \n     amendment would continue the important work on regulatory \n     accounting begun by Senator Stevens.\n       Alliance USA is a nationwide coalition of over 1,000 \n     companies united by their support for responsible regulatory \n     reform. Our coalition believes that your regulatory \n     accounting amendment would improve the effectiveness of \n     several pending regulatory reform measures, including S. 981, \n     the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998.\n       We believe that the successful addition of your amendment \n     would result in a more informed public and Congress about the \n     benefits and burdens of federal regulations. It would also \n     enable Congress to assess more accurately the effectiveness \n     of regulatory programs.\n       We commend you for your continued efforts to improve the \n     regulatory accounting process. If our coalition can be \n     helpful in this effort, please let me know.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lewis I.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment today with my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, and my \ncolleague from, New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to address funding for \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, referred to as FLETC.\n  This is a consolidated law enforcement training center for the \nFederal Government that is operated by the Department of the Treasury.\n  The committee bill reduces the funding for FLETC by $18.7 million \nbelow the President's budget request of $100.3 million.\n  The bill reduces funding for both the operating and the construction \nand maintenance accounts, which will have serious effects on our law \nenforcement training program.\n  Mr. President, some years ago, because law enforcement training \nbecame a necessity for a number of departments of the Federal \nGovernment, every major department which wanted to train their own law \nenforcement people, and the U.S. Government made a very good decision. \nThey said the Department of Treasury will establish the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center, and it will take care of most of law \nenforcement training that is required for institutions and entities \nlike the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Immigration, and just an untold \nnumber of agencies that need to have their law enforcement people \ntrained.\n  Through good fortune, an earlier abandoned naval base in the State of \nGeorgia, called Glynco, was the site that was determined for this \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n  As a matter of fact, I am sure some wonder why I remain so interested \nin this. A little part of it is in the State of New Mexico. But, \nbelieve it or not, when I was a second-year Senator on the Public Works \nCommittee, we were about to spend $600 million on a new center for the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center. I suggested, almost in a very \nmild voice, wondering whether then committee chairman of the Public \nWorks Committee would even consider this new center, and said, ``Would \nyou adopt a resolution saying that before we agree to build a new one \nthat we will take a year and look around and see if we might not \nalready own a facility such as an abandoned military base?'' I think, \nto get rid of me, they all said, ``Let's adopt the resolution.'' And \nsure enough, 9 months later, before we ever spent any money, the \nchairman called me to his office and said, ``Look. They found a naval \nbase in the State of Georgia which has just recently been closed, and \nit will be perfect. We will not have to build a new one.''\n  Although many, many claimed they were the people that got Glynco, I \nwas very pleased to be invited as a brand new Senator in the back row \nand know that because I had asked that we not spend money until we look \naround, that we found it.\n  It has been doing a marvelous job. The only major competitor is the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Some time ago, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, when Jim \nBaker was Secretary of Treasury, decided to expand and create a new \none. They picked a former college in the city of Artesia, NM, which \noffered them the entire campus at a bargain rate, and it has since \ngrown along with the Glynco establishment in Georgia.\n  I came to the floor tonight to urge the committee to restore the \nFLETC salary and expenses and construction to the President's level.\n  I know the committee had difficulty because they had to do a lot of \nthings the House didn't do in their bill with the same amount of \nallocation, overall. But this amendment will actually allow $20 million \nfor new construction of critical dormitory and classroom facilities at \nboth Artesia in New Mexico and Glynco: $6.4 million for new dormitories \nin Artesia; $7.5 million for new dormitories at headquarters in Glynco; \nand, $6.4 million dollars for new classrooms at Glynco, which will be \naugmented by the amounts in the bill, restoring the budget request, and \na proposed reprogramming of funds.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has put a significant emphasis on law \nenforcement over the past decade. I have been concerned for quite some \ntime that the law enforcement agencies of the Treasury Department--that \nis FLETC, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms--are overlooked when Congress talks about violent and youth \ncrimes, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigration. The Department of the \nTreasury plays a very important role in this regard. While Congress has \nmore than tripled the budget of the Department of Justice law \nenforcement agencies over the last decade, Treasury agencies--and this \nis no aspersions on the current leadership of the subcommittee--have \noften struggled to keep up with workloads that are increasing all the \ntime. FLETC is a case in point. Since Congress began serious anticrime \nefforts, thousands of law enforcement agents have been recruited. Many \nof these agents receive\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\ntheir basic as well as advanced training at these Federal law \nenforcement facilities. While the administration and Congress added \nthese agents, sufficient resources were not devoted to keep up with the \ntraining requirements. The President requested $71.9 million for the \nFederal law enforcement training salaries and expenses, and the \ncommittee provided $66.25.\n\n  There are 70 Federal agencies that depend solely upon the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center to provide all direct costs for entry level \ntraining. Without these additional funds, the number of students \ntrained in 1999 will fall below the actual number of agents trained in \n1997 while the demand is greater. That will be 3,900 less. Should the \nadministration decide to keep training levels stable, as much as 10 \npercent would have to be cut from other sources or some programs would \nhave to be reduced or eliminated such as the Office for State, Local \nand International Training within FLETC.\n  Rather than go on with all of the details that I have regarding this, \nI just want to conclude that this is not good policy. If Congress is \ngoing to commit to strong law enforcement, it needs not only the \npersonnel but the high-quality training needed to prepare and protect \nour law enforcement agents. FLETC, the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, must be in position to meet those demands.\n  Mr. President, this amendment provides important resources to support \nthe training of our Federal law enforcement personnel. I believe the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center should be a priority in this \nbill, and I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Treasury Department, signed by Raymond Kelly, Under Secretary, to \nme indicating that they would very much support funding the President's \nlevel in this bill for operation and for getting ready for future \ndemands in terms of construction.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici:  On behalf of Secretary Rubin, I \n     want to thank you for your leadership and support of Treasury \n     Enforcement programs. Like you, we believe that the Federal \n     Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) should be funded at \n     the President's request of $100.283 million and thereby \n     ensure our capacity to meet critical infrastructure needs. \n     The Treasury Department considers this a high priority so \n     FLETC can have adequate facilities, at both Glynco and \n     Artesia, in order to meet the surging workload associated \n     with border management build-up, drug interdiction, anti-\n     terrorism, and related activities.\n       Equally important, we are committed to ensuring that \n     funding for FLETC does not offset other Treasury programs. We \n     hope that the Senate will be able to restore the funding \n     levels requested by the Administration during its \n     deliberations on the FY 1999 appropriations.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,\n                                  Under Secretary for Enforcement.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman, with \nwhom I have conferred and whose staff I have conferred at length, would \nthe chairman do his best to fully fund FLETC as requested by the \nPresident when he goes to conference?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would be honored to support Senator \nDomenici's request in this amendment. I had some experience with FLETC, \ntoo. I visited the campus in Artesia, NM, a few years ago and was very \nimpressed. It is one of the opportunities that Federal agencies really \nhave to interact with each other, and certainly the agents who are \ngoing back to separate departments.\n  The Senator also mentioned other agencies. We have the Indian law \nenforcement agents who work throughout America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Exactly.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We have, of course, as every other subcommittee, only a \ncertain amount of spending authority, and we have to deal with that. We \nhave had a great many requests. We are now wrestling, in fact, with the \nrequest for the six high-density drug trafficking areas which are all \nbecoming more expensive, and certainly they work in an allied fashion, \nbecause people who get out of FLETC sometimes go into those different \nagencies. But I want to assure the Senator I am very supportive and we \nwill do our very best to come up with the money necessary to deal with \nthe President's request.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3383, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment which I \nheretofore sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's first amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3383) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3384\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Federal Law Enforcement \n                            Training Center)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will send an amendment to the desk shortly which I \nhope will be adopted. This one is in behalf of myself, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Cleland from the respective \nStates, the largest center in Georgia by far, and we have kind of a \nsmall adjunct to it in the State of New Mexico. So all four Senators \nare on the amendment.\n  First, we are relying upon the distinguished chairman, who will see \nto it in conference that the President's request for operations and the \nlike will be met, and that probably is already in the House bill.\n  This amendment says that within the amounts appropriated in the act, \nup to $20.3 million may be transferred to the acquisition, \nconstruction, improvements and related expenses account of the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center for new construction. I send that \namendment to the desk. It is the one with the four Senators who I have \nmentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Cleland, and others \n     propose an amendment numbered 3384.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new section:\n       ``Sec.   . Within the amounts appropriated in this Act, up \n     to $20.3 million may be transferred to the Acquisition, \n     Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses account of \n     the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center for new \n     construction.''\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \namendment that I have cosponsored and introduced today with my \ncolleague from New Mexico and Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, regarding funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter.\n  To date only fifty one percent of FLETC's master construction plan is \ncompleted, and this amendment would move FLETC closer toward its goal \nof being the centralized training center for our federal agencies.\n  Whether traveling in my home state of Georgia, or chairing a \nSubcommittee hearing on drug interdiction, the need to address the \ncrisis we face with drugs and crime is consistently brought to my \nattention. Through continued funding and support of the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center we will be able to take the necessary steps \nto achieve this goal for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I once again urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I withhold that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there is nothing further before the Senate, is not \nthe next matter adoption of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3384) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their help \nin this matter, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3385\n\n(Purpose: To provide for an adjustment in the computation of annuities \n  for certain Federal officers and employees relating to average pay \n                determinations, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3385.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

(a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16 of title 18, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means any employee \n     described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section \n     8401(17) of title 5, United States Code; and any special \n     agent in the Diplomatic Security Service of the Department of \n     State.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, for purposes of chapter 171 of title 28, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law relating to \n     tort liability, a law enforcement officer shall be construed \n     to be acting within the scope of his or her office or \n     employment, if the officer takes reasonable action, including \n     the use of force, to--\n       (1) protect an individual in the presence of the officer \n     from a crime of violence;\n       (2) provide immediate assistance to an individual who has \n     suffered or who is threatened with bodily harm; or\n       (3) prevent the escape of any individual who the officer \n     reasonably believes to have\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n     committed in the presence of the officer a crime of violence.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \noffering my amendment. This is legislation that I originally offered \nlast year as a free standing bill. I would like to say a few words on \nthe amendment and ask my colleagues to support. It is co-sponsored by \nSenators D'Amato, Sessions, Stevens, and Grams.\n  First, let me remind my colleagues of what the amendment does. I have \noutlined these in letters to my colleagues and in my original statement \non the floor. In addition, many of you have heard from various federal \nlaw enforcement associations that support this amendment. Its main \nintent is to address a problem, a gray area, in current law. As it now \nstands, the situation reminds me of the old saying that no good deed \ngoes unpunished.\n  This involves what I call the 7-11 situation. Suppose for a moment \nthat an off-duty Capitol Police officer or a Customs Agent or some \nother federal officer goes into the 7-11 to buy coffee. While he is \nthere, a robber tries to hold up the store and is threatening the \npublic with violence. Under the present circumstance a not so funny \nthing can happen. If the off-duty officer intervenes to protect the \npublic and is hurt in the process. Or if someone is hurt in the \nincident, the officer could lose his workman's compensation or be sued \nby the felon for injuries because the Federal officer was acting \noutside the scope of his work. If he was not on duty or if the felony \ndid not occur as part of the duties involved in his job description, he \nhas no protections.\n  This is a real concern to serving officers. It puts them in a \ndifficult situation. That is what this amendment fixes. It would give \nprotection to Federal officers in these situations.\n  Now, let me make it clear. This does not mean an expansion of the \nauthorities to Federal officers to make arrests in matters reserved to \nthe states. I have checked this with the States' Attorneys General. \nThis amendment also does not authorize Federal law enforcement officers \nto act like cowboys. Nothing in current law, even when acting on \nofficial duty, would permit an officer to act irresponsibly. They are \nsubject to penalties if they should do so under their scope of work and \nthey are subject to the same sanctions here.\n  What we have now, however, is a situation where a law enforcement \nofficer has to make a sudden decision. Does he intervene to protect the \npublic, which is what we would all expect? Or does he sit it out to \navoid the risk of being sued or losing his workman's compensation if he \nis injured? I think I know what most of us would expect. I know what \nmost of us believe is the responsible thing to do. We would expect the \nofficer to intervene with a clear conscience and the knowledge that his \nact of decency and responsibility will not be punished. I would add \nthat this situation, fortunately, is not a common one. It is, however, \none that needs to be addressed.\n  I hope that we will adopt this amendment today. It has been a long \ntime in coming and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. \nAgain, let me remind my colleagues that this language has been a free-\nstanding bill for almost a year and has been available for comment. We \nhave worked with DEA, Customs, and many others on the language. It has \nbeen provided to both majority and minority members. Most of these \nmembers have been visited by all the major Federal law enforcement \nassociations and unions, which, I might mention, support this \nlegislation wholeheartedly. I offer for the Record a few of the letters \nthat have been written to me and other Members in support. I believe \nall the Federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on our \nbehalf deserve this much. We know only too well the risk they take on \nour behalf.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                               East Northport, NY, April 10, 1998.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, there is a plague sweeping across our \nNation. It is ruining an untold number of lives, claiming countless \nnumbers of our children. It is in our streets as well as our \nclassrooms. Drugs have become more abundant. But there is a new drug, \none that is far more addictive and readily available than heroin, \ncocaine, or any other illegal narcotic. Methamphetamine is becoming the \nleading addictive drug in this Nation. From the suburbs, to city \nstreets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of \nlives every year. The majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our \nchildren.\n  Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as Iowa's drug of choice in \nmy State. It is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from the \nwest coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach \nthe east coast. The trail of destruction of human lives as a result of \nmethamphetamine addiction stretches across America.\n  To illustrate the violence that meth elicits in people, \nmethamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of \ndomestic violence cases in my State, and a leading factor in a majority \nof violent crimes. I recently introduced the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Control Act which I think will get support and get \nthrough the Senate. But I offer this amendment today as an opportunity \nto take immediate action to help our Nation's law enforcement in their \nwar on methamphetamine.\n  This amendment makes a simple and modest request, taking $8 million \nin certain offsets and puts those dollars where they can do real good \nto combat the growing problem of methamphetamine.\n  These funds will be added to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nAreas Program to be used for increased enforcement and prosecution of \nmeth dealers, additional undercover agents, and to help pay for the \ntremendous cost of confiscation and cleanup of clandestine meth labs.\n  The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs \ncontinues to escalate. The number of clandestine meth labs confiscated \nand destroyed in 1998 is on pace to triple the number that was \nconfiscated in 1997--so triple this year over last year. The cost of \ncleaning up each lab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000. This cost is being \nabsorbed by communities who are not prepared or experienced to deal \nwith the dangers of methamphetamine.\n  These clandestine meth labs create an enormous amount of hazardous \nwaste. For every 1 pound of methamphetamine produced, there are 5 to 6 \npounds of hazardous waste as a by-product. This waste is highly toxic \nand seeps into the ground where eventually it ends up in our drinking \nwater supply.\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\n  The dangers posed to law enforcement officers are also greatly \nincreased by these meth labs. Many peddlers of meth have now what they \ncall ``kitchen'' labs. Meth pushers are now simply using mobile homes \nor even pickup trucks to produce their drugs. Combining many volatile \nchemicals in an uncontrolled environment, meth labs are time bombs to \npolice officers and communities everywhere.\n  I believe we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand \nright now to defeat this scourge. This amendment will not solve all of \nthese problems, but it will give law enforcement the support that they \nvitally need in their efforts to defeat this dangerous drug.\n  Mr. President, family after family is being devastated across the \nMidwest. In my State, I have seen methamphetamine skyrocket in its \nuse--the importation in the State and the development of these \nmethamphetamine labs in the State of Iowa. Communities are trying to \nfight this, but they do not have the resources. Children are being lost \nand getting hooked to this deadly drug every day. So the time now is to \ndo whatever we can to try to halt the growth of these meth labs, to \ngive our high-intensity drug traffic areas the tools that they need to \nstop this drug, to help our communities, and most importantly to help \nour law enforcement officials.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to assure the Senator we are \ndoing our very best to find a resolution in the funding of this. We \nhave four that we are working with. And just in my own personal \nexperience of having worked with several, particularly one in Denver, \nCO, I am certainly aware of the good work that they do in coordinating \nlocal, State, tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies so they are \nnot duplicating their efforts and so that these agencies can share \nideas and share resources.\n  The Senator's comments certainly underscore the importance of trying \nto stop the growth of the methamphetamine labs. These things are \nvolatile. They are mobile. They are contaminative, so even when you do \ngo through an expensive process of cleaning them up, you still have to \nworry about what it has done to contaminate the area, particularly the \nearth.\n  So I just want to assure him, we are working very hard to find a \nresolution to make sure they are all funded properly. I thank the \nSenator for his comments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman. I know of his great interest in \nthis area. And I know of his great support for our law enforcement \nagencies to crack down on the methamphetamine labs. I know your \nchairman is having the same experience out in his State, too, as we are \nin Iowa. I understand that you and the chairman, and Senator Kohl, are \nworking on putting all this together. Obviously, it would be my \nintention to withdraw the amendment if this whole thing gets worked \nout. I am sure that we will get it worked out.\n  I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation that \nwould bring a new, comprehensive strategy to America's effort against \nillegal drugs.\n  The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act would support enhanced \ndrug interdiction efforts in the major transit countries, and support a \ncomprehensive supply eradication and crop substitution program in \nsource countries. This legislation has 16 other Senate cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, this is a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over 3 \nyears for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop \nsubstitution efforts. This important counter-drug initiative would \nrestore a balanced drug control strategy by renewing our nation's \ncommitment to international eradication and interdiction efforts--\nefforts that have proven successful in reducing the trafficking and use \nof illegal drugs. I believe that this is an important investment in the \nfuture of America--and the future of our children.\n  The day after the new drug initiative was introduced, I offered an \namendment to the Transportation appropriations bill to provide much-\nneeded resources for the U.S. Coast Guard--resources that will increase \ntheir drug interdiction capability. Other cosponsors of this amendment \nincluded Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, and Grassley. \nThis amendment, which was agreed to by voice vote, accomplishes two \ngoals: First, it increases funds available for equipment devoted to \ndrug interdiction by approximately $37.5 million. Second, the amendment \nsets aside resources needed to restore a much-needed drug interdiction \noperation in the Caribbean--an operation which I had the opportunity to \nvisit earlier this year.\n  Today, I rise again with Senators Coverdell, Graham, Bond, Faircloth, \nGrassley, and Mack to introduce an amendment to the Treasury, Postal \nappropriations bill. Specifically, we seek $15 million for enhanced \ndrug interdiction efforts for the U.S. Customs Service in South Florida \nand the Caribbean.\n\n  Mr. President, in May, I traveled to the Caribbean for a very short--\n36-hour--visit to look at our interdiction operations there. I visited \nwith U.S. Customs officials in Key West, Florida. It was on this very \ntrip that I gained a greater appreciation of the actual difficult task \nof drug interdiction. I learned that it is far from an easy task--it is \nin fact highly dangerous.\n  U.S. Customs officials showed me video tapes of U.S. Customs go-fast \nboats pursuing Colombian go-fast boats in the middle of the night in \nhigh waves--waves that reached 5 or 6 feet. The videos showed Colombian \nboats ramming into our boats.\n  One of the key problems I learned about on that trip was that U.S. \nCustoms has very few go-fast boats--and the ones they have lack 1990's \ntechnology. Our boats have a top speed of 70 mph--while Colombian boats \ncan reach 80 or 90 mph. I rode in one of our go-fast boats in Key West \nduring a mock chase--and I can tell you that even during the day and in \nlow waves, this is dangerous work.\n  There can be no doubt that our U.S. Customs agents in Florida and the \nCaribbean need more equipment, better equipment dedicated to drug \ninterdiction, and more personnel. Since 1986, the number of U.S. \nCustoms vessels has decreased from 77 to 30. There has also\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nbeen a significant decrease in maritime officers, from 124 to 23. In \nfact, U.S. Customs no longer runs a 7-day, 24-hour drug interdiction \noperation.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would provide U.S. Customs \nwith more go-fast boats and more manpower for South Florida and the \nCaribbean. Let me tell you what this amendment would accomplish.\n  First, it would refurbish 22 interceptor and Blue Water Platform \nBoats. The interceptor boats are what is known as ``go-fast boats.'' \nThe Blue Water Platform Boats are for deep waters and have command \nand control capability--these vessels can accommodate satellite \ncommunications equipment and radar to communicate with the interceptor \nboats to enable them to better interdict the drug traffickers. Right \nnow, these 22 vessels cannot be used because of lack of funding for \nrefurbishment. This small amount of money will make a huge, huge \ndifference. The amendment would also appropriate money for 9 new \ninterceptor go-fast boats.\n\n  The amendment would also provide money for the hiring and training of \n30 special agents--criminal investigators--for maritime operations. \nFinally, the amendment would provide resources for overhead coverage \nand operation and maintenance in the Caribbean.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important amendment which will \naccomplish a lot with a small amount of resources. The amendment has \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking \nMember of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government \nSubcommittee, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl. I thank them for their \ncooperation with this bipartisan amendment.\n  First, I want to make clear that I intend to work with the conferees \nand the Treasury Department on alternatives to fund this amendment. \nWhile an offset has been identified in order to pay for this amendment, \nI want to work with them to find alternatives.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Ohio--\nfirst in offering this very important amendment and for his diligence \nin seeking additional funds for the U.S. Customs Service. I look \nforward to working with him on this important issue and we will work to \naddress any remaining items during conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I too appreciate the Senator from Ohio's efforts in seeking \nadditional funds for the U.S. Customs Service to better interdict drug \ntraffickers. I look forward to working with him to find an appropriate \noffset for this amendment.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, again, I would like to express my thanks \nto the chairman and the ranking member of the Treasury, Postal Service, \nand General Government Subcommittee for their efforts to assist me and \nthe distinguished list of cosponsors of this amendment. I also extend \nmy thanks to the staff of the subcommittee for their efforts, which \nwere nothing less than first rate.\n  Mr. President, this amendment today is another important step toward \nrestoring a balanced drug interdiction strategy. I expect there will be \nmany more steps in the future--steps that are needed if we are going to \nrestore a truly balanced, truly effective drug control strategy. This \namendment represents a bipartisan effort to make a targeted and \nspecific investment in stopping drugs before they reach America. It \nwill take similar efforts over the course of the next 3 years to bring \nour drug strategy back into balance, and most important, back on the \ncourse of reducing drug use in our homes, schools, and communities.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This amendment deals with funding for Customs drug \naddiction, and High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.\n  This amendment has been agreed to by both sides of the aisle. It \naccommodates Senators, DeWine, Conrad, Harkin, Graham, Mack, Coverdell, \nBond, Faircloth, Grassley, Bingaman, and Murray.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3388) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3389\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding payroll tax \n                                relief)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Kerrey, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3389.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REDUCTION OF \n                   PAYROLL TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) is the biggest, most regressive tax \n     paid by working families.\n       (2) The payroll tax constitutes a 15.3 percent tax burden \n     on the wages and self-employment income of each American, \n     with 12.4 percent of the payroll tax used to pay social \n     security benefits to current beneficiaries and 2.9 percent \n     used to pay the medicare benefits of current beneficiaries.\n       (3) The amount of wages and self-employment income subject \n     to the social security portion of the payroll tax is capped \n     at $68,400. Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to use the Federal budget surplus \n     to provide tax relief the payroll tax should be reduced \n     first; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     tax which burdens American families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside in keeping with the prior unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous consent agreement--Amendment No. 3356\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the previous consent, it be in order on Thursday for \nthe managers to offer a modification to amendment No. 3356, which was \npreviously adopted.\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   daschle marriage penalty amendment\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to table an amendment \nto the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill that had been \noffered by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. So \nthere will be no confusion with respect to my position on this issue, I \nwish to advise my colleagues of the reason for my opposition.\n  First, I am, as are others, deeply concerned with that anomaly in the \ntax code known as the ``marriage penalty.'' I can think of no rational \nreason why two individuals--individuals who have vowed a lifelong \ncommitment to each other through the sacred institution of marriage--\nshould, in certain cases, have their combined income taxed at a higher \nrate than that of two unmarried persons. At a time of declining social \nvalues, it simply does not make sense for the Congress to sanction \npolicies which clearly work to the detriment of family stability.\n  However, despite this concern, I could not, in all good conscience, \nsupport the Daschle amendment for the most basic of reasons, namely, \nthat Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States \nrequires that all revenue bills originate in the House of \nRepresentatives, not here in the Senate. As I am sure my colleagues \nknow, that is a prerogative that the House vigorously defends. \nConsequently, I believe that had the Daschle amendment been adopted to \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, which is a Senate-originated \nbill, that that bill would have been subjected to a constitutional \npoint of order in the House. In short, adoption of the Daschle \namendment would have killed this very important appropriations measure.\n  Again, Mr. President, notwithstanding my vote earlier today, I wish \nmy colleagues to know that I remain committed to working toward the \ngoal of alleviating the marriage penalty in the tax code.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nCampbell from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would welcome the opportunity to engage in a colloquy \nwith my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as you know there has been severe \nfinancial turmoil in Asia. This has lead to a dramatic increase in the \ntrade deficit. It is my understanding that exports from Asian nations \nare up significantly, particularly with respect to textiles. This is an \nimportant industry to my home State of North Carolina. My principal \nconcern is that when quotas are met, there will be an attempt to \nillegally ship textiles into this country through other countries, like \nMexico. This is a process known as ``transhipment.'' As you know, the \nU.S. Customs Service has frontline responsibility for enforcing the \nlaws that would bar illegal shipments into this country. We have \nalready written our Senate report, but I would hope that in Conference \nyou would advocate report language that would encourage the Customs \nService to step up their enforcement activities in this area.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I certainly agree with the Senator that this is an \nimportant issue and I will work with you on that. We are running high \ntrade deficits. I will certainly work with the gentleman to encourage \nthe Customs Service to work diligently to stop illegal textile \nshipments into the United States. I thank the gentleman for raising \nthis issue, I think it is one that deserves our attention and the \nattention of the administration.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator from Colorado and I look forward \nto working with him on this issue in conference.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It has come to our attention that concerns have been \nraised regarding report language in the Treasury-General Government \nAppropriations bill on tax standards for tax-exempt health clubs. We \nwould like to enter into a colloquy to clarify our intent in including \nthe report language.\n  Mr. KOHL. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the \nconcerns that have been raised. The issue of tax-exempt health clubs \nhas been of concern in my home State of Wisconsin. However, I share the \nSenator from New Jersey's desire to clarify the intent of the report \nlanguage. In so doing, we also have the opportunity to emphasize that \nno one wishes to harm community service organizations who are \nlegitimately using their tax-exempt status to serve our young people, \nour families, and our seniors through a variety of health-related \nprograms, including health and fitness programs.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I, too, share Senator Kohl's concerns and want to \nbe clear that long-standing community service providers engaged in \nlegitimate tax-exempt activities related to their central mission will \nnot be targeted by this study. I am also concerned, however, that some \ntax-exempt organizations are moving away from their core purpose and \nthat there are legitimate concerns as to whether they are engaging in \ncommercial competition with the for-profit sector. Was it the \nCommittee's intent to address this concerns?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, it was. But while addressing those concerns, we \ncertainly do not wish the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] to reinvent \nthe wheel. The IRS has issued several private letter rulings and \ntechnical advice memoranda (including Technical Advice Memorandum \n8502002) over the past years regarding the circumstances when adult \nfitness can be a charitable activity. It is my understanding that these \nrulings have stated that adult fitness is a charitable activity as long \nas the program serves a broad section of the community.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. While considering current business practices, we \nwould expect the IRS to focus on adult fitness provided by tax-exempt \norganizations that serve only adults.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I \nwant to state that it is my understanding this report will in no way \nrequire the IRS to effect any changes in current tax policy. It only \nasks the IRS to provide clear guidance for examining the issue in light \nof new market factors that may need to be considered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate your input. I Know Senator Grassley will also \nhave a statement on this issue, and that I and the Senator from \nColorado would certainly be happy to work with any and all group that \nmay have further concerns as we prepare to conference the Treasury-\nGeneral Government Appropriations bill with the House.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise today to express my concern about some language \nincluded in Senate report that accompanies this bill. This language is \nnot in the House report. This Senate language directs the Internal \nRevenue Service to review the legal standards and decisions the IRS \nutilizes in determining when fitness services and activities of tax-\nexempt organizations should be subject to unrelated business income \ntax. The stated intent of this review is to insure that tax-exempt \nhealth clubs are not unfairly competing with for-profit health clubs. I \nam afraid that the effect of this language will be to harm non-profit \ncommunity organizations. Is this the intent of the language?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. No, it is not. This language is not intended to harm \nnon-profit community organizations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. These non-profit community organizations provide a \nunique variety of programs based on community needs. Some of the \nprograms offered are child care, Head Start, GED classes, job training, \nsubstance abuse prevention, delinquency prevention, teen centers, \ncounseling, and health and fitness for all children, youth, families, \nand adults. They have partnerships with public housing projects, \njuvenile courts and schools. It is of utmost importance to me that the \nCongress not urge the IRS to change current IRS policies in a way that \nwill hurt our communities and our families. The IRS has determined that \nadult fitness is a charitable activity as long as the organization \nserves a broad segment of the community. does the committee intend that \nthis determination be changed?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. No, it is not the committee's intent to change this \ndetermination because it would hurt the poor and the young--the very \npeople who benefit most from these community organizations. I agree \nthat it is important that these non-profit community organizations are \nable to continue to provide their health, fitness, and other services \nto both adults and children. I would be glad to work with you to insure \nthat any language included in the conference report takes\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\ninto account the unique aspects of these community organizations, and \ndoes not unfairly target them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         atf arson task forces\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, Senator \nCampbell, on the floor. I would like to briefly discuss with him a \nconcern I have relating to BATF arson task forces.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be glad to respond to my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the manager of the bill for his courtesy. I was \nvery pleased to note that the committee report accompanying this bill \nspecifically notes that the program objectives of the BATF include \nassisting ``Federal, State, and local investigative and regulatory \nagencies in explosives and arson-related areas.''\n  Until recently, BATF was involved in just such a program in my State \nof Utah, where in the past year there has been a very troubling \nescalation of arsons connected with the animal rights movement. Utah \nhas experienced a string of animal rights terrorism arsons, including \nan attack on a West Jordan McDonald's, the firebombing of a Murray mink \nco-op, and numerous other arsons.\n  I am very concerned, however, by reports last week that the BATF has \nwithdrawn the last remaining agent assigned to this task force, leading \nto its imminent disbandment. I believe this will have a serious \nnegative effect on counter-terrorism efforts in Utah, and will send the \nwrong message to those pursuing social and political goals through \nviolence.\n  I think the Utah task force is exactly the type of program the \nSubcommittee has in mind, and I would like to ask Senator Campbell if \nhe agrees.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator from Utah is correct. The arson task force \nhe describes is exactly the kind of program the Subcommittee wishes the \nBATF to engage in.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Chairman also agree that BATF should devote \nsufficient resources to ensure the continued viability of these \nefforts?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with the Senator that disbanding a successful \ntaskforce sends the wrong message to arsonists.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would appreciate the Senator working with me to address \nmy concerns over the BATF's withdrawing support for this important task \nforce.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would be happy to work with Senator Hatch to address \nhis concerns, and ensure that BATF dedicates necessary resources to \narson task forces such as the one he describes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank Senator Campbell for his assistance and his \ncourtesy, and yield the floor.\n\n\n     reducing the number of executive branch political appointments\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the past, the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill has been the vehicle for proposals relating to an \narea of great concern to me; namely, growing numbers of executive \nbranch political appointees, and I want to offer a few comments on this \nmatter.\n  I was pleased to introduce legislation early in this session to \naddress this issue. That bill, S. 38, would cap the total number of \npolitical appointees at 2,000, and I am pleased to be joined in that \neffort by my good friend, the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain). \nOur proposal to cap the number of political appointees has been \nestimated by CBO to save $330 million over five years.\n  Mr. President, our bill was based on the recommendations of a number \nof distinguished panels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century \nFund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force \nfindings are only the latest in a long line of recommendations that we \nreduce the number of political appointees in the Executive Branch. For \nmany years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication, \n``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,'' and it was one \nof the central recommendations of the National Commission on the Public \nService, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  Mr. President, our proposal is also consistent with the \nrecommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, \nwhich called for reductions in the number of federal managers and \nsupervisors, arguing that ``over-control and micro management'' not \nonly ``stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume \nbillions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.''\n  Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 report of the \nVolcker Commission, when it argued the growing number of presidential \nappointees may ``actually undermine effective presidential control of \nthe executive branch.'' The Volcker Commission recommended limiting the \nnumber of political appointees to 2,000, as our legislation does.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that any Administration be able to \nimplement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. \nGovernment must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But \nas the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of \npolitical appointees in recent years has not made government more \neffective or more responsive to political leadership.\n  Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 \npercent, over three times as fast as the total number of Executive \nBranch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more \ndramatic. In his recently published book ``Thickening Government: \nFederal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,'' author Paul \nLight reports a startling 430% increase in the number of political \nappointees and senior executives in Federal government between 1960 and \n1992.\n  In recommending a cap on political appointees, the Volcker Commission \nreport noted that the large number of presidential appointees simply \ncannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. This \nlack of control is aggravated by the often competing political agendas \nand constituencies that some appointees might bring with them to their \nnew positions. Altogether, the Commission argued that this lack of \ncontrol and political focus ``may actually dilute the President's \nability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to \nhold cabinet secretaries accountable.''\n  The Volcker Commission also reported that the excessive number of \nappointees is a barrier to critical expertise, distancing the President \nand his principal assistants from the most experienced career \nofficials. Though bureaucracies can certainly impede needed reforms, \nthey can also be a source of unbiased analysis. Adding organizational \nlayers of political appointees can restrict access to important \nresources, while doing nothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments.\n  Author Paul Light says, ``As this sediment has thickened over the \ndecades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of \ngovernment, and the front lines from them.'' Light adds that \n``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping \ngovernment of the barriers to doing its job effectively. . .''\n  Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on \nthe Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem \naggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees; namely, \nthe increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of \npositions. As the Task Force reported, both President Bush and \nPresident Clinton were into their presidencies for many months before \ntheir leadership teams were fully in place. The Task Force noted that \n``on average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more \nthan eight months after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire \npresidential term.'' By contrast, the report noted that in the \npresidential transition of 1960, ``Kennedy appointees were confirmed, \non average, two and a half months after the inauguration.''\n  In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in \ngovernment, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental \neffect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force \nreported that appointees can ``wait for months on end in a limbo of \nuncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public \nsector.''\n  Mr. President, there is little doubt that the large number of \npolitical appointments currently made aggravates a cumbersome process, \neven in the best of circumstances. The long delays and\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\nlogjams created in filling these positions under the Bush and Clinton \nAdministrations simply illustrates another reason why the number of \npositions should be cut back.\n  Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the \ninitial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that \nposition over time. The General Accounting Office reviewed a portion of \nthese positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, and found high levels \nof turnover--7 appointees in 10 years for one position--as well as \ndelays, usually of months but sometimes years, in filling vacancies.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Government Affairs Committee \nbeginning to examine issues surrounding political appointees and the \npolitical appointment process. The issues of vacancy rate, turnover, \ndelays in the appointment process, and of course the total number of \nappointees, all merit scrutiny by that Committee, and I would very much \nlike to work with Chairman Thompson and the Committee in crafting a \nbipartisan response to the set of problems that have been identified in \nthis area.\n  I am also encouraged that the Administration is moving forward as \nwell. The total number of appointees is down from last year, and down \nsignificantly from the levels seen in 1992. This is a healthy trend, \nand I very much hope it continues.\n  Mr. President, because the Government Affairs Committee is examining \na variety of issues surrounding the presidential appointment process, \nand with the modest improvements in the overall number of political \nappointees, I will not pursue an amendment to the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations measure capping the number of political appointees.\n  I will, however, continue to monitor the progress made both by the \nGovernment Affairs Committee and the Administration. This issue is \nimportant not only because of the potential to realize significant \ndeficit reduction, but also because of the impact the appointees have \non the day to day functioning of government.\n  As we move forward to implement the NPR recommendations to reduce the \nnumber of government employees, streamline agencies, and make \ngovernment more responsive, we should also right size the number of \npolitical appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the \npolicies of any Administration without burdening the Federal budget \nwith unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs.\n\n\n                        Random Audits by the IRS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nto the managers for accepting an amendment to S. 2312, the FY 1999 \nTreasury-Postal Service Appropriations bill, regarding the practice of \nrandomly selecting innocent taxpayers for audits, otherwise known as \nrandom audits. This is an issue that has been a focus of mine for a \nlong time. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss this matter \nwith my good friend, the senior Senator from Colorado and the manager \nof the bill, who shares my concern about the impact the Internal \nRevenue Service has upon taxpayers and the potential for abuse of \ntaxpayers' rights.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Indeed, I share many of the concerns of Senator \nCoverdell regarding taxpayer rights. I commend the Senator for his \ntenacious work on behalf of taxpayers, particularly low-income \ntaxpayers who are least able to defend themselves. This amendment the \nSenator offers presents a critical foundation upon which the Senate can \nbuild.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my good friend. Over the past several years, \nall of us have seen news accounts of regular, average citizens who have \nbecome the targets of grueling IRS audits. These individuals were \nneither wealthy nor powerful; in fact, they were most often ordinary, \nlaw-abiding taxpayers who earned a modest wage, ran a small business, \nor operated a family farm. Some struggled just to make ends meet, and \nmany were understandably confused about what wrong they had committed \nto justify the scrutiny of the IRS.\n  The truth is they committed no wrong. They were simply unfortunate \nvictims of a scandalous IRS practice called ``random audits,'' where \nthe IRS just picks people out of a hat in the hope it can uncover some \nwrongdoing.\n  A recent report produced by the General Accounting Office at my \nrequest confirms that the IRS has been targeting thousands of poor \ntaxpayers and small businesses for random audits. In fact, almost 95 \npercent of all random audits performed between 1994 and 1996 were \nconducted on individual taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 each \nyear.\n  Last fall, hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee brought the \nIRS's abuse of taxpayers to the attention of the entire Nation. One \nwitness, Jennifer Long, who is a current field agent with the IRS, \nremarked, ``As of late, we seem to be auditing only the poor people. \nThe current IRS Management does not believe anyone in this country can \npossibly live on less than $20,000 per year, insisting anyone below \nthat level must be cheating by understating their true income.''\n  The IRS' belief that low-income families are more likely to cheat \nthan others serves as a disturbing sign of how far it has strayed from \nthe principles of American justice. The GAO report also indicates that \nthe IRS has been specifically targeting the State of Georgia for random \naudits. Nearly twice as many random audits took place in Georgia \nbetween 1994 and 1996 than in all the New England states combined and \nGeorgians are three-times more likely to be randomly audited than their \nCalifornia counterparts. Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to \nprohibit the use of random audits by the IRS and will continue to \nprotect innocent taxpayers.\n\n\n   Amendment of the Gun Control Act to Exempt Certain Muzzle Loading \n                        Weapons From Regulation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, according to the amendment, would the \nKnight DISC rifle manufactured in my State fall under the definition of \na muzzle loader, or a regulated firearm?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Knight DISC rifle would be defined as a muzzle \nloader.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment of the Gun \nControl Act to Exempt Certain Muzzle Loading Weapons from Regulation \n(``the amendment''), in subparagraph (c), did the Committee intend \n``fixed ammunition'' to mean a completed centerfire or rimfire \ncartridge?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, for the purposes of the amendment, fixed \nammunition is defined as a complete centerfire or rimfire cartridge.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, subparagraph (c) of the amendment states \nthat the term ``antique firearm'' shall not include any weapon which \nincorporates a firearm frame or receiver . . .'' However, the amendment \ndoes not define the terms firearm frame or receiver.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. For the purpose of the amendment, a firearm frame or \nreceiver is defined as a serial numbered firearm frame or receiver.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first sentence of subparagraph (c) \nof the amendment does not address the types of ignition systems which \nwould fall within the definition of muzzle loading rifles.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Committee did not address the issue of ignition \nsystems because muzzle loaders may use black powder or a black powder \nsubstitute with any ignition system.\n\n\n                           blue water vessels\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address my \ncolleagues on a matter of critical importance to our national drug \ninterdiction program.\n  I am very concerned about the condition of some of the currently \ndeployed drug interdiction vessels. I understand that some of the \nvessels currently deployed in the U.S. Customs Service's marine program \nfleet are 30 years old and may pose a threat to U.S. Customs Service \nagents and the viability of our drug interdiction program.\n  The Customs Service already has a contract to build replacement \nvessels on demand. However, this contract will expire at the end of FY \n1999, and no vessels have been purchased to date. I believe the Customs \nService should extend this contract and make efforts to replace aging \nvessels in the field a high priority.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing this serious matter \nto our attention. I certainly understand and share her concerns about \nthe importance of operating these drug interdiction vessels in a safe \ncondition.\n  Ms. SNOWE. In recent years, drug seizures by the Customs Service have\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nincreased significantly. This progress is due in no small part to the \nCustoms agents who put their lives on the line to help stem the flow of \nillegal narcotics into the United States. Protecting our borders and \nreducing the proliferation of narcotics is an enormous challenge.\n  It is imperative that we maintain the viability of our drug \ninterdiction program and the fleet we use to enforce our drug laws on \nthe high seas. I believe procurement of drug interdiction vessels would \nbe an invaluable investment in our drug interdiction program.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Customs Service entered into a contract to build \n82-foot ``blue water'' vessels for drug interdiction. As I mentioned, \nthe contract was effective through FY 1999 but no vessel has been \nbuilt.\n  These vessels have a proven track record, and the contract was \nawarded by Customs in anticipation of resources for replacement \nvessels. However, the FY 1995 budget request proposed a 50-percent \nreduction in Customs marine program operations and staffing. The \nCongress restored some of the funding for this program. However, no \nadditional funds were appropriated to Customs for the replacement costs \nof vessels.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Customs Service has certainly had to make difficult \nchoices in the marine program under budget constraints. However, I \nrecognize the importance of these vessels to drug interdiction efforts.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am grateful to Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl for \ntheir leadership on this important program. In the Committee's report \non FY 1999 Customs' appropriations, the Committee recognizes the \nimportance of the blue water vessels as a central component of the \nmarine interdiction strategy, and urges the Customs Service to maintain \nits fleet of blue water vessels at a level which is safe for its \nagents.\n  I understand the delicate funding balance that the Customs Service \nand the Committee must strike. I had hoped to see some replacement blue \nwater vessels built in FY 1999. Unfortunately, it was not possible to \nallocate the funding for this purpose this year. However, we should not \nlet this opportunity to upgrade these vessels slip by--I believe we \nshould ensure that the option to fund these vessels remains in the \nevent that funding becomes available next year.\n  Again, Customs already has a contract to build these vessels on \ndemand scheduled to expire in the 1999 fiscal year. I strongly believe \nthat Customs should extend this contract.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree that the U.S. Customs Service should revisit \nthis issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Again, I applaud the leadership of the Committee on this \nmatter, and thank them for their cooperation. I look forward to working \nwith the Committee on this continuing and important effort in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                      marriage penalty amendments\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my views on providing \ntax relief for working families, and more specifically about the \nmarriage penalty. I have always supported efforts to alleviate the tax \nburden felt by many of our nation's working families. In 1993, I \nsupported tax cuts for millions of working families making less than \n$30,000 per year through an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. \nAnd again, last year, I supported tax cuts targeted toward working \nfamilies, including the $500 per-child-tax credit, the $1,500 HOPE \neducation tax credit, reinstatement of student loan deductions, full \ndeductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed and \ncapital gains and estate tax relief, I was pleased to support these tax \ncuts, Mr. President, because each was carefully targeted, fully paid \nfor, and consistent with a balanced budget.\n  Today, I continue to support efforts to bring relief to working \nfamilies, including providing them with substantial relief from the \nmarriage penalty. Yet, despite my support for repealing the marriage \npenalty which affects more than 20 million American families, I felt \ncompelled to vote against the amendment offered by Senator Brownback, \nbecause in my view, the amendment did not provide targeted relief to \nthose who need it most. In fact, Senator Brownback's amendment would \noffer marriage penalty relief to only about 40 percent of those \ncurrently penalized. Moreover, this amendment was both a costly \nmeasure--costing $125 billion over five years and $300 billion over the \nnext ten years--and one that was not paid for.\n  Mr. President, because Senator Brownback's amendment was not offset, \nit would have significantly drained the Treasury and put an incredible \nstrain on the Social Security trust fund. Indeed, had this amendment \nbeen adopted without an offset as proposed, we would be forced to make \ndraconian across-the-board spending cuts to all discretionary spending, \nincluding many important programs like Head Start, public health \nprograms, and defense. In addition, this amendment threatened to use as \nits offset, funds from the Social Security reserves, which clearly \nwould jeopardize the solvency of and undermine the strength of the \nSocial Security trust fund. Mr. President, in my view, we could ill \nafford to pay for this amendment with either option, and that is why I, \nin good conscience, could not support this amendment.\n  I want to be clear, however, that I support efforts to repeal the \nmarriage penalty. Yet I remain committed to doing so in a way that does \nnot harm the progress we've made in balancing the budget and in a way \nthat targets relief to working families who need it most. That is why I \nwas pleased to support the Democratic alternative, which would have \nreduced the marriage penalty in the tax code for approximately 90 \npercent of the families currently penalized. Indeed, this amendment was \ncarefully targeted and would cut the marriage tax penalty more for a \ngreater number of families Furthermore, this proposal would have cost \nfar less than Senator Brownback's proposal--$7 billion over five years \nand $21 billion over the next ten years. And finally, the Democratic \nalternative was fully offset without using reserves from the Social \nSecurity trust fund, but rather by using a number of widely supported \nproposals from the President's budget.\n  Although I was disappointed that the Democratic alternative was \ndefeated, I remain hopeful that Congress will continue to work to \nrepeal the marriage penalty in a way that is both fiscally responsible \nand carefully targeted to the American families who need relief the \nmost.\n  Mr. KLY. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Campbell, regarding the \nimportance of High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs).\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I understand the Senator's interest in this area.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I would like to take a few minutes to \ndescribe the importance of HIDTAs, and specifically the creation of a \nnew Central Arizona HIDTA.\n  As you know, HIDTAs are an effective mechanism for fighting drugs and \nespecially for combating the increase in methamphetamine use and meth \nlabs. Arizona has a huge problem with meth and meth lab cleanup. In \nApril, I held a field hearing in Phoenix on this issue and I heard \nfirst-hand about the magnitude of the drug problem in urban and rural \nareas of the state. For example, I heard testimony that the Maricopa \nCounty HIDTA Meth Lab Unit presently dismantles an average of three \nlabs per week and that, during fiscal year 97, it seized 137 meth labs. \nProjections for seizures this year are expected to reach 200. Moreover, \nthe DEA testified that clandestine lab seizures in Arizona have \nincreased 910 percent since 1994.\n  The formation of a new Arizona HIDTA, the Central Arizona HIDTA, is a \ncooperative effort among three Arizona counties--Maricopa, Pinal, and \nMohave--representing both rural and urban interests.\n  Designating new HIDTAs where a need can be demonstrated and where law \nenforcement has joined together is key to stopping the spread of drugs. \nI look forward to working with you to ensure that new HIDTAs, like the \nCentral Arizona HIDTA, receive funding.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This Committee is increasingly aware of the unique \nproblems meth poses, as well as the cleanup of their toxic labs. This \nis an area where a HIDTA can provide much needed assistance to a \ncommunity, therefore I can understand your interest in the creation of \na Central Arizona HIDTA. I look forward to working with the Senator in \nthe coming months to address these concerns.\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          tax code termination\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire: Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nthe Tax Code Termination Act, which had been proposed as an amendment \nto the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act. This measure, which I \ncosponsored with Senators Hutchinson and Brownback, would sunset the \nFederal Tax Code by the end of 2002.\n  Our current Tax Code, with its many rates, deductions and exemptions, \nneeds to be replaced with a simpler, fairer system that will eliminate \nthe bias against savings and investment and promote economic growth. \nConsider these facts:\n  The Tax Code is made up of about 7,500 pages. All the Internal \nRevenue Service regulations, rulings and tax court decisions add tens \nof thousands more pages. By contrast, when the income tax was enacted \neighty-five years, the Tax Code was under twenty pages long.\n  By the most conservative estimate, the total cost of collecting \ntaxes, including the value of the 4.5 billion hours that taxpayers \nspend preparing tax returns, is $75 billion per year. Other estimates \nare several times higher. The cost of complying with some provisions \nexceeds what the government collects in taxes.\n  I can think of no more fitting commentary on the tax laws that are on \nthe books today than The Federalist Papers, and I quote: ``It will be \nof little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their \nown choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so \nincoherent that they cannot be understood.''\n  Is there any doubt that our current Tax Code is too voluminous to be \nread or too incoherent to be understood? There probably is not a single \naccountant who understands the Code in its entirety. Not even the IRS, \nwhich employs about 110,000 people and is twice as big as the CIA, \nseems to have a complete grasp on the Code. In 1993, for example, the \nIRS provided an estimated 8.5 million incorrect or incomplete answers \nto taxpayer inquiries, and taxpayers were overcharged an estimated $5 \nbillion in penalties.\n  Another measure of the Code's complexity is the number of disputes it \ngenerates. As many as 40 percent of major corporate audits end up in \nadministrative or legal disputes. Some last for years.\n  The Tax Code is so burdensome that it encourages tax evasion and \ndistorts investment. the IRS has reported that there are hundreds of \npeople who pay no taxes on incomes of more than $200,000 per year. \nRemember Leona Helmsly, the New York real estate magnate who spent \neighteen months in jail for tax evasion? According to her former \nhousekeeper, Leona said: ``[w]e don't pay taxes. Only the little people \npay taxes.'' Taxpayers who can afford to pay for tax planning have a \nstrong incentive to invest in schemes to avoid paying taxes instead of \ninvesting in productive enterprises that will help the economy thrive.\n  Up to 30% of individuals reporting business income are not complying \nwith the Tax Code, according to the IRS. Small wonder that many small \nbusinesses are not in compliance, when we consider the Code's \ncomplexity. For every $100 they paid in income taxes, small businesses \nwith net profits paid an estimated $377 in accounting fees and other \ncosts to comply with the tax laws, according to a 1996 Tax Foundation \nreport. If the current tax code were not so complex, perhaps we would \nnot be facing the enforcement problems that we brought to light by the \nFinance Committee in its April 1998 IRS oversight hearings.\n  Critics of the Tax Code Termination Act maintain that it would be \nirresponsible to sunset the Tax Code until a substitute is prepared. \nBut there are already a number of other federal programs on the books \nthat contain sunset language; and why should the Tax Code by any \ndifferent? This legislation simply sets a fixed date by which the Tax \nCode will have to be reauthorized, thereby forcing the President and \nCongress to engage in a meaningful dialogue on the issue.\n  Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to take the first step \ntoward meaningful tax reform by setting a date when the Tax Code will \nexpire. We should discard the current maze that is our Tax Code and \nenact a new tax system that is simple, fair and does not discourage \nsavings or investment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote \nto adopt the Treasury and General Appropriations Bill for the Fiscal \nYear 1999. I intend to support this measure because it provides funding \nfor the Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the \nExecutive Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies.\n  Mr. President, as elected officials, we bear no greater \nresponsibility than to see the American people's hard earned tax \ndollars utilized in the most prudent fashion. We must remain committed \nto open and fair consideration of public expenditures. Our objective \nmust always be to further the greatest public good. This must remain \nthe cornerstone of the appropriations process.\n  I admit that this is a difficult task. Each year the appropriators \nface the daunting task of supporting necessary governmental activities \nand balancing additional competing interests for funding. However, this \nis a challenge that we must firmly uphold with integrity. I come \nforward to this body to once again declare that we are undermining the \nnational faith by continuing the practice of earmarking and \ninappropriately designating funding for projects based on erroneous \ncriteria rather than national priority and necessity.\n  After reviewing the Treasury Postal Appropriations Bill, it is \npainfully clear the subcommittee has not lost its appetite for pork-\nbarrel spending. This bill has been fattened up with vast amounts of \nlow-priority, unnecessary and wasteful spending. In fact, this \nappropriations bill contains well over $826 million in specifically \nearmarked pork-barrel spending. This is more than $791 million more \nthan last year's pork-barrel spending total for this bill, which only \ncontained $34.25 million in wasted funds. In addition, the bill and \nreport directs that current year spending be maintained for hundreds of \nprojects, without being specific about any dollar amount.\n  We now have the first unified-budget surplus in nearly 30 years. CBO \nprojects that we will have $1.6 billion of budget surpluses over the \nnext 10 years. However, if we continue with our current levels of \nwasteful spending, these budget surpluses may not occur. Pork-barrel \nspending today not only robs well-deserving programs of much needed \nfunds, it also jeopardizes our fiscal well-being into the next century. \nI would be remiss if I did not inform the American public of the \nseriousness and magnitude of wasteful spending endorsed by this body. \nThese individual earmarks may not seem extravagant. However, taken \ntogether, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs \nthat have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. I \ntake very strong exception to a large number of provisions in the bill \nbefore us today.\n  As usual, this bill and report contain numerous earmarks of new funds \nfor particular states, as well as language designed to ensure the \ncontinued flow of federal funds into certain states. I have compiled a \nlengthy list of these and numerous other add-ons, earmarks in this \nbill. I will not spare precious time to recite the entire list. \nInstead, I will ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the \nRecord. However, I will discuss some of the more troubling provisions \nin this bill in detail.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains a provision which requires the \nPostal Service to work with the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to \ndevise a plan to combat pest introduction into Hawaii through the U.S. \nmail. Also contained in this report is over one half billion dollars in \nnew courthouse construction specifically allocated to certain states \nand localities. This type of earmarking of federal funds must stop.\n  Mr. President, in the last few weeks, the Senate has wasted billions \nof taxpayers' dollars on wasteful, unnecessary, or low priority \nprojects. Most alarming, we still have 5 more appropriations bills \nstill to be considered. When will Congress curb its appetite\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\nfor wasteful pork-barrel spending? How much is too much?\n  Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on the objectionable \nprovisions of this bill. I simply ask my colleagues to apply fair and \nreasonable spending principles when appropriating funds to the \nmultitude of priority and necessary programs in our appropriations \nbills. Fiscal responsibility yields long term dividends to America as a \nwhole. Moreover, responsible spending will renew the public's faith in \ntheir elected representatives, while also insuring that America \nrealizes any projected budget surpluses.\n  Congress can ill afford to waste taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. Let \nus use these budget surpluses to pay down our multi-trillion-dollar \nnational debt. Let us use the anticipated budget surpluses to save \nsocial security and for additional tax cuts. These objectives further \nthe greater public good, and our long-term prosperity. Wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending which has limited short term benefits to a few obscure \nspecial interests, does not further the public good. It drains our \nbudget, and threatens our long-term prosperity. Congress will only make \nour potentially prosperous future a reality if it curbs its appetite \nfor pork-barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think seriously about the \nrepercussions that could soon be felt right here in this body, if we \ncontinue the longstanding practice of pork-barrel spending. Wasteful \npork-barrel spending simply erodes the public's trust in our system of \ngovernment. Congress must reaffirm its commitment to furthering the \npublic good by curbing its appetite for pork-barrel spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n LOW PRIORITY, UNNECESSARY, OR WASTEFUL SPENDING CONTAINED IN S. 2312, \n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  1999\n\n       The total dollar amount included in this bill is more than \n     $3 billion over the Fiscal Year 1999 budget request.\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       Sections 506, 507, 508, and 606 all contain the usual \n     protectionist, Buy-America provisions.\n\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       BATF: $4.5 million to expand the National Tracing Center in \n     Martinsburg, WV. $2.4 million for 12 trafficking agents, \n     three of which are to be for Milwaukee, WI.

Mr. President, in the wake of the terrible crime \ncommitted in the Capitol last Friday, I want to take a moment to \nreflect on the courage exhibited by the Capitol Police force in the \nface of that attack at the heart of America's democracy.\n  The Capitol Police have guarded the U.S. Congress since 1828, but \ntheir finest, yet most tragic, moment came on July 24, 1998, when two \nofficers gave their lives to defend their fellow citizens, and our \nCapitol and all that it represents.\n  Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, like all the \nquiet heroes of the Capitol Police force and their colleagues across \nAmerica, came to work each day, performing their duties with dedication \nand professionalism, prepared at any moment to lay down their lives so \nthat others could be saved, and the security of the Capitol could be \npreserved.\n  In a few terrifying minutes on the afternoon of July 24th, that \nmoment came, as Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut gave their lives \nfor ours, and for countless other people working and visiting here that \nday. As they bravely defended the Capitol, Detective Gibson and Officer \nChestnut showed the enormity of their courage, the depth of their \ncharacter, and the fullness of their commitment to duty as Capitol \nPolice officers.\n  As Americans, we owe Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson a debt \nthat can never be repaid. Instead, we can only offer our deepest \nsympathies to the families of these two brave officers, and pledge to \nhonor their memories with the same enduring strength and vigilance with \nwhich they defended our lives.\n  I also want to recognize the other Capitol Police officers involved \nin apprehending the gunman, rushing people in the building to safety, \nand conducting the subsequent investigation with such a high degree of \nprofessionalism. We commend their service in protecting our Capitol and \nreaffirm with confidence that under their watch the house of the people \nwill stay open to all the people.\n  Americans can take great pride in the heroism the Capitol Police \ndisplayed last Friday, and in the bravery they summon every day as they \nprotect our nation's Capitol. To them I offer my thanks, and the thanks \nof my staff and the people of the State of Wisconsin, for their \ncourageous work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9239-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9239-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9239-S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 149\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On November 14, 1994, in light of the danger of the proliferation of \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) \nand of the means of delivering such weapons, using my authority under \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et \nseq.), I declared a national emergency and issued Executive Order \n12938. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, I have \nrenewed the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 \nannually, most recently on November 14, 1997. Pursuant to section \n204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n1703(b)), I hereby report to the Congress that I have exercised my \nstatutory authority to issue an Executive order to amend Executive \nOrder 12938 in order to more effectively to respond to the worldwide \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities.\n  The amendment of section 4 of Executive Order 12938 strengthens the \noriginal Executive order in several significant ways.\n  First, the amendment broadens the type of proliferation activity that \nis subject to potential penalties. Executive Order 12938 covers \ncontributions to the efforts of any foreign country, project, or entity \nto use, acquire, design, produce, or stockpile chemical or biological \nweapons (CBW). This amendment adds potential penalties for \ncontributions to foreign programs for nuclear weapons and missiles \ncapable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. For example, the new \namendment authorizes the imposition of measures against foreign \nentities that materially assist Iran's missile program.\n  Second, the amendment lowers the requirements for imposing penalties. \nExecutive Order 12938 required a finding that a foreign person \n``knowingly and materially'' contributed to a foreign CBW program. The \namendment removes the ``knowing'' requirement as a basis for \ndetermining potential penalties. Therefore, the Secretary of State need \nonly determine that the foreign person made a ``material'' contribution \nto a weapons of mass destruction or missile program to apply the \nspecified sanctions. At the same time, the Secretary of State will have \ndiscretion regarding the scope of sanctions so that a truly unwitting \nparty will not be unfairly punished.\n  Third, the amendment expands the original Executive order to include \n``attempts'' to contribute to foreign proliferation activities, as well \nas actual contributions. This will allow imposition of penalties even \nin cases where foreign persons make an unsuccessful effort to \ncontribute to weapons of mass destruction and missile programs or where \nauthorities block a transaction before it is consummated.\n  Fourth, the amendment expressly expands the range of potential \npenalties to include the prohibition of United States Government \nassistance to the foreign person, as well as United States Government \nprocurement and imports into the United States, which were specified by \nthe original Executive order. Moreover, section 4(b) broadens the scope \nof the United States Government procurement limitations to include a \nbar on the procurement of technology, as well as goods or services from \nany foreign person described in section 4(a). Section 4(d) broadens the \nscope of import limitations to include a bar on imports of any \ntechnology or services produced or provided by any foreign person \ndescribed in section 4(a).\n  Finally, this amendment gives the United States Government greater \nflexibility and discretion in deciding how and to what extent to impose \npenalties against foreign persons that assist proliferation programs. \nThis provision authorizes the Secretary of State, who will act in \nconsultation with the heads of other interested agencies, to determine \nthe extent to which these measures should be imposed against entities \ncontributing to foreign weapons of mass destruction or missile \nprograms. The Secretary of State will act to further the national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests of the United States, including \nprincipally our nonproliferation objectives. Prior to imposing measures \npursuant to this provision, the Secretary of State will take into \naccount the likely effectiveness of such measures in furthering the \ninterests of the United States and the costs and benefits of such \nmeasures. This approach provides the necessary flexibility to tailor \nour responses to specific situations.\n  I have authorized these actions in view of the danger posed to the \nnational security and foreign policy of\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\nthe United States by the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. I am enclosing a copy of the \nExecutive order that I have issued exercising these authorities.\n                                                  William J.

NATO has agreed to move ahead in all these \nareas.\n  First, NATO agreed to benchmarks parallel to ours on May 28 as part \nof its approval of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) military plan (OPLAN \n10407). Furthermore, the OPLAN requires SFOR to develop detailed \ncriteria for each of these benchmarks, to be approved by the North \nAtlantic Council, which will provide a more specific basis to evaluate \nprogress. SFOR will develop the benchmark criteria in coordination with \nappropriate international civilian agencies.\n  Second, with regard to timelines, the United States proposed that \nNATO military authorities provide an estimate of the time likely to be \nrequired for implementation of the military and civilian aspects of the \nDayton Agreement based on the benchmark criteria. Allies agreed to this \napproach on June 10. As SACEUR General Wes Clark testified before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee June 4, the development and approval of \nthe criteria and estimated target dates should take 2 to 3 months.\n  Third, with regard to a review process, NATO will continue the 6-\nmonth review process that began with the deployment of the \nImplementation Force (IFOR) in December 1995, incorporating the \nbenchmarks and detailed criteria. The reviews will include an \nassessment of the security situation, an assessment of compliance by \nthe parties with the Dayton Agreement, an assessment of progress \nagainst the benchmark criteria being developed by SFOR, recommendations \non any changes in the level of support to civilian agencies, and \nrecommendations on any other changes to the mission and tasks of the \nforce.\n  While not required under Public Law 105-174, we have sought to \nfurther utilize this framework of benchmarks and criteria for Dayton \nimplementation among civilian implementation agencies. The Steering \nBoard of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) adopted the same \nframework in its Luxembourg declaration of June 9, 1998. The \ndeclaration, which serves as the civilian implementation agenda for the \nnext 6 months, now includes language that corresponds to the benchmarks \nin the March 3 certification to the Congress and in the SFOR OPLAN. In \naddition, the PIC Steering Board called on the High Representative to \nsubmit a report on the progress made in meeting these goals by mid-\nSeptember, which will be considered in the NATO 6-month review process.\n  The benchmark framework, now approved by military and civilian \nimplementers, is clearly a better approach than setting a fixed, \narbitrary end date to the mission. This process will produce a clear \npicture of where intensive efforts will be required to achieve our \ngoal: a self-sustaining peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina for \nwhich a major international military force will no longer be necessary. \nExperience demonstrates that arbitrary deadlines can prove impossible \nto meet and tend to encourage those who would wait us out or undermine \nour credibility. Realistic target dates, combined with concerted use of \nincentives, leverage and pressure with all the parties, should maintain \nthe sense of urgency necessary to move steadily toward an enduring \npeace. While the benchmark process will be useful as a tool both to \npromote and review the pace of Dayton implementation, the estimated \ntarget dates established will be notional, and their attainment \ndependent upon a complex set of interdependent factors.\n  We will provide a supplemental report once NATO has agreed upon \ndetailed criteria and estimated target dates. The continuing 6-month \nreviews of the status of implementation will provide a useful \nopportunity to continue to consult with Congress. These reviews, and \nany updates to the estimated timelines for implementation, will be \nprovided in subsequent reports submitted pursuant to Public Law 105-\n174. I look forward to continuing to work with the Congress in pursuing \nU.S. foreign policy goals in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation today that would enable the Senate Employees Child Care \nCenter (SECCC) to receive the proceeds from Senate recycling or other \nwaste prevention programs. Specifically, my bill would authorize the \nArchitect of the Capitol to receive funds from Senate recycling \nprograms and make those funds available for the activities and expenses \nof the SECCC, subject to the regular appropriations process. The effect \nof this measure will be to provide the SECCC with a potentially steady, \nif relatively small, source of income as well as create an additional \nincentive for the Senate to support recycling efforts.\n   Mr. President, the SECCC was established as a non-profit 501(c)(3) \ncorporation in 1984 by parents who work for the Senate. Today, the \ncenter provides full and part-time care for about 50 children between \nthe ages of 18 months and 5 years. The SECCC is open to the entire \ncommunity, with priority enrollment reserved for children of Senate \nemployees. The SECCC is accredited by the National Academy of Early \nChildhood Programs, a division of the National Association of Young \nChildren. It first received such recognition in 1989, the first day \ncare center in Washington, D.C., to be so distinguished.\n  The SECCC is governed by an independent board composed of the parents \nof children enrolled at the center. A cooperative relationship exists \nbetween the SECCC and the Senate. The parents, through the board, are \nresponsible for oversight of SECCC operations; the Senate provides \ncritical support, such as providing for the facility itself and \nutilities. The Senate is providing the funds for the construction of a \nnew center, near the Daniel Webster Senate Page Residence, which is \nexpected to be ready for occupancy within a few months.\n  The Senate currently does not appropriate annual funds for the \noperation of the SECCC. The SECCC's annual operating budget of \napproximately $535,000 is funded entirely through tuition payments and \nthe center's fundraising efforts. These funds are used to defray costs \nassociated with tuition assistance (scholarships), teacher salaries, \ncurriculum materials, meals, general office expenses, advertising and \nmarketing, accounting and audit fees, professional development, and \nunemployment and liability insurance.\n  The recycling program for House and Senate buildings is operated by \nthe Office Waste Recycling Program (OWRP),\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nunder the Architect of the Capitol. Through OWRP, the Architect is \nresponsible for collecting and bundling recycled materials; a private \ncontractor, under contract to the General Services Administration, \nserves as the recycling facility. However, the Architect does not have \nthe authority to receive funds from recycling or other so-called \n``enterprise'' activities; thus, all recycling funds from both the \nSenate and House are deposited in the General Fund of the U.S. \nTreasury.\n\n  The OWRP started as pilot project in 1990-91 and was expanded on a \nvoluntary participation basis to all offices in the House and Senate \noffice buildings in 1992. The program is based on the concept of source \nseparation, an approach that includes the separation, collection, and \nremoval of high and mixed grade paper as well as aluminum cans, glass, \nand certain types of plastic materials. The effectiveness of the \nprogram depends on the active participation of Congressional staff, who \nare needed to separate recyclables into designated receptacles, and the \ncustodial and labor forces, who must ensure that materials remain \nsegregated during the collection process.\n  The program has been a success in certain respects. For example, it \nhas allowed Congress to avoid paying costs associated with hauling away \nand landfilling recycled materials, since these costs are borne by the \nrecycling contractor. According to the OWRP, in FY97, the House Office \nBuildings recycled 2,247 tons of paper, cans, glass, and plastic, \navoiding landfill/haulaway costs of $173,000. For the same year, the \nSenate Office Buildings collected 898 tons, for a savings of $69,146.\n  However, actual revenues generated by the program have been nominal. \nThe Senate recycling program, for example, brought in a relatively \npaltry $2,694 in FY96 and $2,364 in FY97, the last full year for which \nwe have data, while collecting an estimated 1,021 tons and 886 tons of \npaper waste. The reason for this seemingly low return is that the \ncontractor is not required to pay for materials that are contaminated \nby a certain percentage. With respect to paper, which constitutes the \nbulk of Senate recyclables, contamination refers to mixing with other \nrecyclable (e.g., newspapers with high grade paper) or with foreign \nmatter such as food. Apparently, Senate and House recycled materials \nhave relatively high contamination levels, a fact which may be \nattributed in part to an absence of incentives on the part of \nCongressional offices to recycle.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the situation with federal agencies, \nwhich beginning in 1991 have had the authority to retain recycling \nproceeds, either to defray the cost of maintaining recycling programs \nand/or direct them to programs that directly benefit employees, \nincluding day care activities. In my opinion, it is no accident that \nwhile the level of participation in recycling programs varies from \nagency to agency, overall the Executive Branch agencies' recycling \nprograms are much more robust than Congress'.\n  Mr. President, my bill would authorize the Architect of the Capitol \nto receive Senate recycling funds and make them available for the \npayment of SECCC activities and expenses, through the annual \nappropriations process. This would achieve two mutually beneficial \ngoals: first, to provide a small but important supplement to the day \ncare center's operating budget; second, to improve the efficiency of \nthe Senate recycling program by establishing an internal incentive to \nrecycle.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill as well as \na letter supporting the legislation from the SECCC's board of directors \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Board of Directors of the Senate \n     Employees Child Care Center (SECCC) strongly supports \n     legislation that would allow the SECCC to receive the \n     proceeds from the Senate recycling and other waste prevention \n     programs to support the operating and other expenses of the \n     SECCC. This support was demonstrated in a recent unanimous \n     vote during our board meeting on July 15, 1998.\n       We have been advised that the receipts from the Senate \n     recycling program total several thousand dollars a year. \n     Should the legislation pass, we anticipate applying the funds \n     to our tuition assistance program, which helps families who \n     may not be able to afford the full cost of enrollment at the \n     center. The funds from the recycling program would represent \n     a substantial portion of the tuition assistance budget and \n     would provide an annual contribution, allowing us to maintain \n     the tuition assistance program over the long-term.\n       Thank you for any assistance you could provide in \n     authorizing the SECCC to receive Senate recycling funds.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Heidi Bonner,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                 SECCC Board of Directors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Roth:\n  S. 2369. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish the \nPersonal Retirement Accounts Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the personal retirement accounts act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personal \nRetirement Accounts Act of 1998. This legislation has a simple but \npowerful purpose--to establish personal retirement accounts for working \nAmericans. In my view, these accounts promise to give working Americans \nnot only a more secure retirement future but a new stake in the \nNation's economic growth. And, as I will describe, these accounts may \nprovide the model for future Social Security reform.\n  A few years ago personal retirement accounts were an exotic and even \ncontroversial concept. But no longer! In 1996, a majority of a Clinton \nAdministration task force on Social Security reform endorsed the \nconcept. Today, personal retirement accounts are a bipartisan, even \nmainstream, idea. In March, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Finance Committee, and Senator Kerrey introduced legislation that \nwould create retirement accounts as part of an overhaul of Social \nSecurity.\n  And earlier this month, bipartisan, bicameral Social Security reform \nlegislation that included personal retirement accounts was introduced \nby Senators Gregg and Breaux in the Senate, and by Congressmen Kolbe \nand Stenholm in the House. Their bill is based on the unanimous \nrecommendations of a privately sponsored National Commission on \nRetirement Policy--comprised of 24 lawmakers, economists, pension \nexperts, and businessmen.\n  Yesterday, at a Social Security town hall meeting in Albquqerque, NM, \nthe President said he had an ``open mind'' on personal retirement \naccounts. And in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last \nweek, a top Clinton Administration official offered several guidelines \nfor designing such accounts, including efficiency, such as low \nadministrative costs, and protection of the progressive benefits. My \nbill meets these guidelines.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why retirement accounts find so much \nsupport--not only in Congress but among the American people. With even \nconservative investment, such accounts have the potential to provide \nAmericans with a substantial retirement nest egg, and an estate they \ncan leave to their children and grandchildren.\n  Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who \ndo not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic \ngrowth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. \nMore Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers.\n  Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, \nAmericans save less than people in almost every other country. But \npersonal\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nretirement accounts will demonstrate to all Americans the magic of \ncompound interest as even small savings grow significantly over time.\n  Lastly, creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare \nfor retirement. According to the CRS, 60 percent of Americans are not \nactively participating in a retirement program other than Social \nSecurity. A recent survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute \nfound that only about 45 percent of working Americans have tried to \ncalculate how much they will need for retirement. It is my belief that \nretirement accounts will prompt Americans--particularly baby boomers--\nto think more about retirement planning.\n  Mr. President, let me describe a few of the features of my bill. \nFirst, the program would run for 5 years, from 1999 to 2003, utilizing \nhalf the budget surplus projected by CBO earlier this month.\n  Each year, every working American who earned a minimum of 4 quarters \nof Social Security coverage--about $2,900 in 1999--would receive a \ndeposit in his or her personal retirement account. About 127 million \nAmericans would receive a deposit in 1999.\n  The formula for sharing the surplus among the accounts is \nprogressive. Each eligible individual would receive a minimum amount of \n$250 per year, plus an additional amount based on how much they paid in \npayroll taxes.\n  Over the life of the program, a minimum wage earner--someone earning \n$12,400 this year--would receive about $1,720. That amount is equal to \na 34-percent rebate of his or her payroll taxes.\n  An average wage earner--earning $27,600--would receive about $2,300--\nequal to a 20-percent rebate of payroll taxes. And an individual who \npaid the maximum Social Security tax would get $3,840, a 14-percent \nrebate of payroll taxes. These figures do not include any investment \nincome or deductions for the costs of running the program.\n  Account holders would have three investment choices--prudent choices \nthat balance risk and return. The three choices are a stock index \nfund--a mutual fund that reflects the overall performance of the stock \nmarket; a fund that invests in corporate bonds and other fixed income \nsecurities; and a fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n  However, my legislation also provides for a study of additional \ninvestment options--of other types of investment funds and investment \nmanagers.\n\n  An account holder would become eligible for benefits when he or she \nsigns up for Social Security. An individual could choose between an \nannuity or annual payments based on life expectancy.\n  The bill also provides a number of features to ensure the program is \nproperly run. First, the program would be neither on budget nor off \nbudget. Instead, the program would be outside the Federal budget. The \nmoney in the program could be used for no other purpose than retirement \nbenefits and the program's operating expenses.\n  Second, the program would be supervised by a new, independent \nPersonal Retirement Board, with members appointed by the President and \nCongressional leaders and subject to Senate confirmation. Board \nofficials would be fiduciaries, and required by law to act only in the \nbest financial interests of beneficiaries.\n  Lastly, the stock funds would be managed by private sector investment \nmanagers. To insulate companies represented in the stock funds from \npolitics, no board official or other government employee would be \neligible to vote company proxies--only the investment managers.\n  Mr. President, the design of this personal retirement accounts plan \nfollows a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, \nwhen I was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the \nretirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. One of \nthe new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan--a \ndefined contribution employee benefit plan--that has been a great \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, many Americans will undoubtedly ask, ``What size nest \negg might grow in my personal retirement account?'' According to an \nanalysis done by Social Security's actuaries, someone earning the \nminimum wage would have an account worth about $2,150 in 2004, assuming \na 7.5 percent interest rate. For the average wage earner, the account \nwould be worth about $2,870, and for the individual paying the maximum \nSocial Security tax, about $4,770.\n  Of course, over the long term, accounts can grow significantly. For \nthe minimum wage person, after 40 years--in 2039--his or her account \nwould be worth about $27,000; the average wage earner would have \n$36,000; and the person paying the maximum payroll tax, $60,000.\n  Mr. President, some might ask, ``Why start with personal retirement \naccounts rather than proposing comprehensive Social Security reform?'' \nIndeed, my bill will not affect the current Social Security program. \nPersonal retirement accounts are an exciting concept, but still a big \njob, requiring careful work by the Finance Committee.\n  And unlike many other Social Security reform proposals, retirement \naccounts have broad support. So let's get these accounts up and \nrunning, proven and tested, while Congress considers carefully \nprotecting and preserving Social Security for the long term.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me add that personal retirement \naccounts have another big promise. Such accounts--if later made a part \nof Social Security--may help restore the confidence of the American \npeople in Social Security. Polls show that Social Security is among the \nmost popular of government programs, deservedly so. But many \nAmericans--particularly young Americans--appear to have lost confidence \nin the program. They believe that there will be no benefits for them \nwhen they retire. Personal retirement accounts will provide the \naccountability and assurances that Americans are asking for.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at my bill, and I \ninvite members to co-sponsor it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of this bill \nbe printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security program is the foundation of \n     retirement income for most Americans, and solving the \n     financial problems of the social security program is a vital \n     national priority and essential for the retirement security \n     of today's working Americans and their families.\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\n       (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal \n     retirement accounts should be an important feature of social \n     security reform.\n       (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \n     retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an \n     individual 28 years old on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 in 2035, just \n     1 percent of that individual's wages deposited each year in a \n     personal retirement account and invested in securities \n     consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow to \n     $132,000, and be worth approximately 20 percent of the \n     benefits that would be provided to the individual under the \n     current provisions of the social security program.\n       (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of \n     Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in \n     the economic growth of America.\n       (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the \n     value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all \n     Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost \n     every other country.\n       (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to \n     better prepare for retirement generally. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are \n     not actively participating in a retirement plan other than \n     social security, although social security was never intended \n     to be the sole source of retirement income.\n       (7) The Federal budget will register a surplus of \n     $583,000,000,000 over fiscal years 1998 through 2003, \n     offering a unique opportunity to begin a permanent solution \n     to social security's financing.\n       (8) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal \n     retirement accounts would be an important first step in \n     comprehensive social security reform and ensuring the \n     delivery of promised retirement benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3. SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Trust Fund.--There is established in \n     the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as \n     the ``Save Social Security First Trust Fund'' (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Trust Fund''), consisting of \n     such amounts as are appropriated or credited to the Trust \n     Fund as provided in this section.\n       (b) Appropriation to Trust Fund.--There is appropriated to \n     the Trust Fund, out of any sums in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, an amount equal to $31,500,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1998 and $40,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. The \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer such amounts to the \n     Trust Fund not later than--\n       (1) September 30, 1998, in the case of the amount \n     appropriated for fiscal year 1998; and\n       (2) September 30, 1999, in the case of the amount \n     appropriated for fiscal year 1999.\n       (c) Investment of Trust Fund.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall invest the Trust Fund in public debt \n     securities with suitable maturities and bearing interest at \n     rates determined by the Secretary, taking into consideration \n     current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations \n     of the United States of comparable maturities. The income on \n     such investments shall be credited to and form a part of the \n     Trust Fund.\n       (d) Limitation on Use of Trust Fund.--Amounts in the Trust \n     Fund shall not be appropriated or used for any purpose other \n     than to be transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings \n     Fund established under section 112 of the Social Security Act \n     in accordance with section 111(b)(1) of such Act.\n       (e) Dissolution of Trust Fund.--On the date of the transfer \n     of all amounts in the Trust Fund to the Personal Retirement \n     Savings Fund in accordance with section 111(b)(1) of the \n     Social Security Act, the Trust Fund established under this \n     section shall be dissolved.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at Tall Timbers Village Square, Untied States Highway \n19 South, in Thomasville, Georgia, as the ``Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper \nStation''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  lieutenant henry o. flipper station\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill in honor of \nan American patriot, Lieutenant Henry Ossian Flipper, on whose behalf I \noffer this legislation for the designation of the Lieutenant Henry O. \nFlipper Station, a postal station being constructed in Thomasville, \nGeorgia.\n  It is an honor for me to highlight the contributions of this \ncourageous American. Born in 1856, in Thomasville, Georgia, Lieutenant \nFlipper was the first African-American to graduate from the United \nStates Military Academy at West Point in 1877.\n  Lieutenant Flipper had a distinguished career as an Army officer. His \nfirst assignment to frontier duty was with the Tenth Cavalry at Fort \nSill, Oklahoma. The Tenth, along with its sister unit, the Ninth \nCavalry unit, were responsible for facilitating the movement of \npioneers wishing to settle in the Western frontier. The African-\nAmerican members of these two units became known as ``Buffalo \nSoldiers.'' During his tenure at Fort Sill, Lieutenant Flipper \ningeniously engineered a drainage system to eliminate stagnant malarial \nponds and swamps created during the rainy season. This effort made a \nsignificant contribution to improving the health of the Post, and the \nditch, christened ``Flipper's Ditch,'' is now a historic landmark.\n  Lieutenant Flipper was instrumental in the successful 1880 campaign \nagainst Mescalero Apache Chief Victorio, an escapee from the military \nauthorities in New Mexico. Facing a judicial sentence for murder in \n1879, Victorio was able to escape, gather his forces and begin a \nrampage throughout New Mexico and Texas. Through tough terrain and \nlogistical challenges, the soldiers of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry were \nable to push Victorio into Mexico where he was killed by the Mexican \nArmy.\n  It is very timely that we commemorate Lieutenant Flipper since this \nyear is the fiftieth anniversary of the racial integration of the \nmilitary. This action marked a historic change which has led to \nsignificant progress in eliminating racial barriers. Lieutenant \nFlipper's legacy is that of a pioneer in confronting the challenges of \nracial strife who paved the way for this evolution. Although Lieutenant \nFlipper left the military in 1882, he was able to prove to America that \nAfrican-Americans possessed the quality of military leadership.\n  After the end of his military service in 1882, Lieutenant Flipper \ncontinued a very distinguished career, applying his surveying and \nengineering skills as a civil and mining engineer on the frontiers of \nthe Southwest and Mexico. He became the first African-American to gain \nprominence in the engineering profession.\n  Historical accounts depict the solid perseverance of Lieutenant \nFlipper. He confronted racial bias demonstrating unflinchingly strong \ncharacter and intellect. In a book entitled ``An Officer and a \nGentlemen,'' historian Steve Wilson is credited with compiling a list \nof ``firsts'' for an African-American which were achieved by Lieutenant \nFlipper: Military Academy graduate, cavalry officer, surveyor, \ncartographer, civil and mining engineer, translator, interpreter, \ninventor, editor, author, special agent for the Justice Department, \npersonal confident and advisor to a Senator, and pioneer in the oil \nindustry.\n  In a ceremony in 1977, Lieutenant General Sidney B. Berry, the United \nStates Military Academy's Superintendent, praised Lieutenant Flipper's \nmemory, stating that, ``there was a strength and gentleness that \ntranscended any bad treatment Flipper received. He was a strong and \ngentle man.'' Lieutenant Flipper was a pioneer for civil rights in the \nmilitary and in the civilian community. Although he had a very \nsuccessful civilian life, Lieutenant Flipper always considered himself \nfirst and foremost an Army officer.\n  I join the residents of Thomasville in this quest of the post office \ndesignation in honor of Lieutenant Flipper. Not only is this hero one \nof Georgia's own, Lieutenant Flipper has earned the respect of a \ngrateful Nation. The measure I am submitting today will give him this \nwell-deserved recognition.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit the use of the proceeds from Senate \nrecycling efforts for the expenses and activities of the Senate \nEmployees Child Care Center; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n             senate day care recycling funding support act\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation today that would enable the Senate Employees Child Care \nCenter (SECCC) to receive the proceeds from Senate recycling or other \nwaste prevention programs. Specifically, my bill would authorize the \nArchitect of the Capitol to receive funds from Senate recycling \nprograms and make those funds available for the activities and expenses \nof the SECCC, subject to the regular appropriations process. The effect \nof this measure will be to provide the SECCC with a potentially steady, \nif relatively small, source of income as well as create an additional \nincentive for the Senate to support recycling efforts.\n   Mr. President, the SECCC was established as a non-profit 501(c)(3) \ncorporation in 1984 by parents who work for the Senate. Today, the \ncenter provides full and part-time care for about 50 children between \nthe ages of 18 months and 5 years. The SECCC is open to the entire \ncommunity, with priority enrollment reserved for children of Senate \nemployees. The SECCC is accredited by the National Academy of Early \nChildhood Programs, a division of the National Association of Young \nChildren. It first received such recognition in 1989, the first day \ncare center in Washington, D.C., to be so distinguished.\n  The SECCC is governed by an independent board composed of the parents \nof children enrolled at the center. A cooperative relationship exists \nbetween the SECCC and the Senate. The parents, through the board, are \nresponsible for oversight of SECCC operations; the Senate provides \ncritical support, such as providing for the facility itself and \nutilities. The Senate is providing the funds for the construction of a \nnew center, near the Daniel Webster Senate Page Residence, which is \nexpected to be ready for occupancy within a few months.\n  The Senate currently does not appropriate annual funds for the \noperation of the SECCC. The SECCC's annual operating budget of \napproximately $535,000 is funded entirely through tuition payments and \nthe center's fundraising efforts. These funds are used to defray costs \nassociated with tuition assistance (scholarships), teacher salaries, \ncurriculum materials, meals, general office expenses, advertising and \nmarketing, accounting and audit fees, professional development, and \nunemployment and liability insurance.\n  The recycling program for House and Senate buildings is operated by \nthe Office Waste Recycling Program (OWRP),\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nunder the Architect of the Capitol. Through OWRP, the Architect is \nresponsible for collecting and bundling recycled materials; a private \ncontractor, under contract to the General Services Administration, \nserves as the recycling facility. However, the Architect does not have \nthe authority to receive funds from recycling or other so-called \n``enterprise'' activities; thus, all recycling funds from both the \nSenate and House are deposited in the General Fund of the U.S. \nTreasury.\n\n  The OWRP started as pilot project in 1990-91 and was expanded on a \nvoluntary participation basis to all offices in the House and Senate \noffice buildings in 1992. The program is based on the concept of source \nseparation, an approach that includes the separation, collection, and \nremoval of high and mixed grade paper as well as aluminum cans, glass, \nand certain types of plastic materials. The effectiveness of the \nprogram depends on the active participation of Congressional staff, who \nare needed to separate recyclables into designated receptacles, and the \ncustodial and labor forces, who must ensure that materials remain \nsegregated during the collection process.\n  The program has been a success in certain respects. For example, it \nhas allowed Congress to avoid paying costs associated with hauling away \nand landfilling recycled materials, since these costs are borne by the \nrecycling contractor. According to the OWRP, in FY97, the House Office \nBuildings recycled 2,247 tons of paper, cans, glass, and plastic, \navoiding landfill/haulaway costs of $173,000. For the same year, the \nSenate Office Buildings collected 898 tons, for a savings of $69,146.\n  However, actual revenues generated by the program have been nominal. \nThe Senate recycling program, for example, brought in a relatively \npaltry $2,694 in FY96 and $2,364 in FY97, the last full year for which \nwe have data, while collecting an estimated 1,021 tons and 886 tons of \npaper waste. The reason for this seemingly low return is that the \ncontractor is not required to pay for materials that are contaminated \nby a certain percentage. With respect to paper, which constitutes the \nbulk of Senate recyclables, contamination refers to mixing with other \nrecyclable (e.g., newspapers with high grade paper) or with foreign \nmatter such as food. Apparently, Senate and House recycled materials \nhave relatively high contamination levels, a fact which may be \nattributed in part to an absence of incentives on the part of \nCongressional offices to recycle.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the situation with federal agencies, \nwhich beginning in 1991 have had the authority to retain recycling \nproceeds, either to defray the cost of maintaining recycling programs \nand/or direct them to programs that directly benefit employees, \nincluding day care activities. In my opinion, it is no accident that \nwhile the level of participation in recycling programs varies from \nagency to agency, overall the Executive Branch agencies' recycling \nprograms are much more robust than Congress'.\n  Mr. President, my bill would authorize the Architect of the Capitol \nto receive Senate recycling funds and make them available for the \npayment of SECCC activities and expenses, through the annual \nappropriations process. This would achieve two mutually beneficial \ngoals: first, to provide a small but important supplement to the day \ncare center's operating budget; second, to improve the efficiency of \nthe Senate recycling program by establishing an internal incentive to \nrecycle.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill as well as \na letter supporting the legislation from the SECCC's board of directors \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senate Day Care Center \n     Recycling Funding Support Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RECYCLING FUNDING FOR THE SENATE DAY CARE CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Architect of the Capitol shall receive \n     all funds collected through Senate recycling or waste \n     prevention programs and deposit those amounts in an account \n     in the Treasury which shall be available for payment of the \n     activities and expenses of the Senate Employees Child Care \n     Center.\n       (b) Subject to Appropriations.--Amounts deposited in the \n     account referred to in subsection (a) shall be available to \n     the extent provided in appropriations Acts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Senate Employees'\n\n\n                                            Child Care Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Board of Directors of the Senate \n     Employees Child Care Center (SECCC) strongly supports \n     legislation that would allow the SECCC to receive the \n     proceeds from the Senate recycling and other waste prevention \n     programs to support the operating and other expenses of the \n     SECCC. This support was demonstrated in a recent unanimous \n     vote during our board meeting on July 15, 1998.\n       We have been advised that the receipts from the Senate \n     recycling program total several thousand dollars a year. \n     Should the legislation pass, we anticipate applying the funds \n     to our tuition assistance program, which helps families who \n     may not be able to afford the full cost of enrollment at the \n     center. The funds from the recycling program would represent \n     a substantial portion of the tuition assistance budget and \n     would provide an annual contribution, allowing us to maintain \n     the tuition assistance program over the long-term.\n       Thank you for any assistance you could provide in \n     authorizing the SECCC to receive Senate recycling funds.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Heidi Bonner,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                 SECCC Board of Directors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Roth:\n  S. 2369. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish the \nPersonal Retirement Accounts Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the personal retirement accounts act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personal \nRetirement Accounts Act of 1998. This legislation has a simple but \npowerful purpose--to establish personal retirement accounts for working \nAmericans. In my view, these accounts promise to give working Americans \nnot only a more secure retirement future but a new stake in the \nNation's economic growth. And, as I will describe, these accounts may \nprovide the model for future Social Security reform.\n  A few years ago personal retirement accounts were an exotic and even \ncontroversial concept. But no longer! In 1996, a majority of a Clinton \nAdministration task force on Social Security reform endorsed the \nconcept. Today, personal retirement accounts are a bipartisan, even \nmainstream, idea. In March, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on \nthe Finance Committee, and Senator Kerrey introduced legislation that \nwould create retirement accounts as part of an overhaul of Social \nSecurity.\n  And earlier this month, bipartisan, bicameral Social Security reform \nlegislation that included personal retirement accounts was introduced \nby Senators Gregg and Breaux in the Senate, and by Congressmen Kolbe \nand Stenholm in the House. Their bill is based on the unanimous \nrecommendations of a privately sponsored National Commission on \nRetirement Policy--comprised of 24 lawmakers, economists, pension \nexperts, and businessmen.\n  Yesterday, at a Social Security town hall meeting in Albquqerque, NM, \nthe President said he had an ``open mind'' on personal retirement \naccounts. And in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last \nweek, a top Clinton Administration official offered several guidelines \nfor designing such accounts, including efficiency, such as low \nadministrative costs, and protection of the progressive benefits. My \nbill meets these guidelines.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why retirement accounts find so much \nsupport--not only in Congress but among the American people. With even \nconservative investment, such accounts have the potential to provide \nAmericans with a substantial retirement nest egg, and an estate they \ncan leave to their children and grandchildren.\n  Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who \ndo not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic \ngrowth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. \nMore Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers.\n  Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, \nAmericans save less than people in almost every other country. But \npersonal\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nretirement accounts will demonstrate to all Americans the magic of \ncompound interest as even small savings grow significantly over time.\n  Lastly, creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare \nfor retirement. According to the CRS, 60 percent of Americans are not \nactively participating in a retirement program other than Social \nSecurity. A recent survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute \nfound that only about 45 percent of working Americans have tried to \ncalculate how much they will need for retirement. It is my belief that \nretirement accounts will prompt Americans--particularly baby boomers--\nto think more about retirement planning.\n  Mr. President, let me describe a few of the features of my bill. \nFirst, the program would run for 5 years, from 1999 to 2003, utilizing \nhalf the budget surplus projected by CBO earlier this month.\n  Each year, every working American who earned a minimum of 4 quarters \nof Social Security coverage--about $2,900 in 1999--would receive a \ndeposit in his or her personal retirement account. About 127 million \nAmericans would receive a deposit in 1999.\n  The formula for sharing the surplus among the accounts is \nprogressive. Each eligible individual would receive a minimum amount of \n$250 per year, plus an additional amount based on how much they paid in \npayroll taxes.\n  Over the life of the program, a minimum wage earner--someone earning \n$12,400 this year--would receive about $1,720. That amount is equal to \na 34-percent rebate of his or her payroll taxes.\n  An average wage earner--earning $27,600--would receive about $2,300--\nequal to a 20-percent rebate of payroll taxes. And an individual who \npaid the maximum Social Security tax would get $3,840, a 14-percent \nrebate of payroll taxes. These figures do not include any investment \nincome or deductions for the costs of running the program.\n  Account holders would have three investment choices--prudent choices \nthat balance risk and return. The three choices are a stock index \nfund--a mutual fund that reflects the overall performance of the stock \nmarket; a fund that invests in corporate bonds and other fixed income \nsecurities; and a fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n  However, my legislation also provides for a study of additional \ninvestment options--of other types of investment funds and investment \nmanagers.\n\n  An account holder would become eligible for benefits when he or she \nsigns up for Social Security. An individual could choose between an \nannuity or annual payments based on life expectancy.\n  The bill also provides a number of features to ensure the program is \nproperly run. First, the program would be neither on budget nor off \nbudget. Instead, the program would be outside the Federal budget. The \nmoney in the program could be used for no other purpose than retirement \nbenefits and the program's operating expenses.\n  Second, the program would be supervised by a new, independent \nPersonal Retirement Board, with members appointed by the President and \nCongressional leaders and subject to Senate confirmation. Board \nofficials would be fiduciaries, and required by law to act only in the \nbest financial interests of beneficiaries.\n  Lastly, the stock funds would be managed by private sector investment \nmanagers. To insulate companies represented in the stock funds from \npolitics, no board official or other government employee would be \neligible to vote company proxies--only the investment managers.\n  Mr. President, the design of this personal retirement accounts plan \nfollows a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, \nwhen I was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the \nretirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. One of \nthe new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan--a \ndefined contribution employee benefit plan--that has been a great \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, many Americans will undoubtedly ask, ``What size nest \negg might grow in my personal retirement account?'' According to an \nanalysis done by Social Security's actuaries, someone earning the \nminimum wage would have an account worth about $2,150 in 2004, assuming \na 7.5 percent interest rate. For the average wage earner, the account \nwould be worth about $2,870, and for the individual paying the maximum \nSocial Security tax, about $4,770.\n  Of course, over the long term, accounts can grow significantly. For \nthe minimum wage person, after 40 years--in 2039--his or her account \nwould be worth about $27,000; the average wage earner would have \n$36,000; and the person paying the maximum payroll tax, $60,000.\n  Mr. President, some might ask, ``Why start with personal retirement \naccounts rather than proposing comprehensive Social Security reform?'' \nIndeed, my bill will not affect the current Social Security program. \nPersonal retirement accounts are an exciting concept, but still a big \njob, requiring careful work by the Finance Committee.\n  And unlike many other Social Security reform proposals, retirement \naccounts have broad support. So let's get these accounts up and \nrunning, proven and tested, while Congress considers carefully \nprotecting and preserving Social Security for the long term.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me add that personal retirement \naccounts have another big promise. Such accounts--if later made a part \nof Social Security--may help restore the confidence of the American \npeople in Social Security. Polls show that Social Security is among the \nmost popular of government programs, deservedly so. But many \nAmericans--particularly young Americans--appear to have lost confidence \nin the program. They believe that there will be no benefits for them \nwhen they retire. Personal retirement accounts will provide the \naccountability and assurances that Americans are asking for.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at my bill, and I \ninvite members to co-sponsor it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of this bill \nbe printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security program is the foundation of \n     retirement income for most Americans, and solving the \n     financial problems of the social security program is a vital \n     national priority and essential for the retirement security \n     of today's working Americans and their families.\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\n       (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal \n     retirement accounts should be an important feature of social \n     security reform.\n       (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \n     retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an \n     individual 28 years old on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 in 2035, just \n     1 percent of that individual's wages deposited each year in a \n     personal retirement account and invested in securities \n     consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow to \n     $132,000, and be worth approximately 20 percent of the \n     benefits that would be provided to the individual under the \n     current provisions of the social security program.\n       (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of \n     Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in \n     the economic growth of America.\n       (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the \n     value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all \n     Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost \n     every other country.\n       (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to \n     better prepare for retirement generally. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are \n     not actively participating in a retirement plan other than \n     social security, although social security was never intended \n     to be the sole source of retirement income.\n       (7) The Federal budget will register a surplus of \n     $583,000,000,000 over fiscal years 1998 through 2003, \n     offering a unique opportunity to begin a permanent solution \n     to social security's financing.\n       (8) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal \n     retirement accounts would be an important first step in \n     comprehensive social security reform and ensuring the \n     delivery of promised retirement benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3. SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Trust Fund.--There is established in \n     the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as \n     the ``Save Social Security First Trust Fund'' (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Trust Fund''), consisting of \n     such amounts as are appropriated or credited to the Trust \n     Fund as provided in this section.\n       (b) Appropriation to Trust Fund.--There is appropriated to \n     the Trust Fund, out of any sums in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, an amount equal to $31,500,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1998 and $40,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. The \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer such amounts to the \n     Trust Fund not later than--\n       (1) September 30, 1998, in the case of the amount \n     appropriated for fiscal year 1998; and\n       (2) September 30, 1999, in the case of the amount \n     appropriated for fiscal year 1999.\n       (c) Investment of Trust Fund.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall invest the Trust Fund in public debt \n     securities with suitable maturities and bearing interest at \n     rates determined by the Secretary, taking into consideration \n     current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations \n     of the United States of comparable maturities.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at Tall Timbers Village Square, Untied States Highway \n19 South, in Thomasville, Georgia, as the ``Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper \nStation''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  lieutenant henry o. flipper station\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill in honor of \nan American patriot, Lieutenant Henry Ossian Flipper, on whose behalf I \noffer this legislation for the designation of the Lieutenant Henry O. \nFlipper Station, a postal station being constructed in Thomasville, \nGeorgia.\n  It is an honor for me to highlight the contributions of this \ncourageous American. Born in 1856, in Thomasville, Georgia, Lieutenant \nFlipper was the first African-American to graduate from the United \nStates Military Academy at West Point in 1877.\n  Lieutenant Flipper had a distinguished career as an Army officer. His \nfirst assignment to frontier duty was with the Tenth Cavalry at Fort \nSill, Oklahoma. The Tenth, along with its sister unit, the Ninth \nCavalry unit, were responsible for facilitating the movement of \npioneers wishing to settle in the Western frontier. The African-\nAmerican members of these two units became known as ``Buffalo \nSoldiers.'' During his tenure at Fort Sill, Lieutenant Flipper \ningeniously engineered a drainage system to eliminate stagnant malarial \nponds and swamps created during the rainy season. This effort made a \nsignificant contribution to improving the health of the Post, and the \nditch, christened ``Flipper's Ditch,'' is now a historic landmark.\n  Lieutenant Flipper was instrumental in the successful 1880 campaign \nagainst Mescalero Apache Chief Victorio, an escapee from the military \nauthorities in New Mexico. Facing a judicial sentence for murder in \n1879, Victorio was able to escape, gather his forces and begin a \nrampage throughout New Mexico and Texas. Through tough terrain and \nlogistical challenges, the soldiers of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry were \nable to push Victorio into Mexico where he was killed by the Mexican \nArmy.\n  It is very timely that we commemorate Lieutenant Flipper since this \nyear is the fiftieth anniversary of the racial integration of the \nmilitary. This action marked a historic change which has led to \nsignificant progress in eliminating racial barriers. Lieutenant \nFlipper's legacy is that of a pioneer in confronting the challenges of \nracial strife who paved the way for this evolution. Although Lieutenant \nFlipper left the military in 1882, he was able to prove to America that \nAfrican-Americans possessed the quality of military leadership.\n  After the end of his military service in 1882, Lieutenant Flipper \ncontinued a very distinguished career, applying his surveying and \nengineering skills as a civil and mining engineer on the frontiers of \nthe Southwest and Mexico. He became the first African-American to gain \nprominence in the engineering profession.\n  Historical accounts depict the solid perseverance of Lieutenant \nFlipper. He confronted racial bias demonstrating unflinchingly strong \ncharacter and intellect. In a book entitled ``An Officer and a \nGentlemen,'' historian Steve Wilson is credited with compiling a list \nof ``firsts'' for an African-American which were achieved by Lieutenant \nFlipper: Military Academy graduate, cavalry officer, surveyor, \ncartographer, civil and mining engineer, translator, interpreter, \ninventor, editor, author, special agent for the Justice Department, \npersonal confident and advisor to a Senator, and pioneer in the oil \nindustry.\n  In a ceremony in 1977, Lieutenant General Sidney B. Berry, the United \nStates Military Academy's Superintendent, praised Lieutenant Flipper's \nmemory, stating that, ``there was a strength and gentleness that \ntranscended any bad treatment Flipper received. He was a strong and \ngentle man.'' Lieutenant Flipper was a pioneer for civil rights in the \nmilitary and in the civilian community. Although he had a very \nsuccessful civilian life, Lieutenant Flipper always considered himself \nfirst and foremost an Army officer.\n  I join the residents of Thomasville in this quest of the post office \ndesignation in honor of Lieutenant Flipper. Not only is this hero one \nof Georgia's own, Lieutenant Flipper has earned the respect of a \ngrateful Nation. The measure I am submitting today will give him this \nwell-deserved recognition.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF LIEUTENANT HENRY O. FLIPPER \n                   STATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at Tall Timbers Village Square, United States \n     Highway 19 South, in Thomasville, Georgia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Station''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility of the United States Postal Service referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Station''.\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 259\n\n       Whereas there are 104 historically black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities provide the quality \n     education so essential to full participation in a complex, \n     highly technological society;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities have a rich \n     heritage and have played a prominent role in American \n     history;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities have allowed many \n     underprivileged students to attain their full potential \n     through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 20, 1998, as \n     ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President of the United States issue \n     a proclamation calling on the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate support \n     for historically black colleges and universities in the \n     United States.\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a \nSenate Resolution which authorizes and requests the President to \ndesignate the week beginning September 20, 1998, as ``National \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Week.''\n  It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the thirteenth \ntime honoring the Historically Black Colleges of our Country.\n  Eight of the 104 Historically Black Colleges, namely Allen \nUniversity, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State \nUniversity, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical \nCollege, and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. \nThese colleges are vital to the higher education system of South \nCarolina. They have provided thousands of economically disadvantaged \nyoung people with the opportunity to obtain a college education.\n  Mr. President, thousands of young Americans have received quality \neducations at these 104 schools. These institutions have a long and \ndistinguished history of providing the training necessary for \nparticipation in a rapidly changing society. Historically Black \nColleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through \nwhich young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding \nopportunities for continued social progress.\n  Mr. President, through passage of this Senate Resolution, Congress \ncan reaffirm its support for Historically Black Colleges, and \nappropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I \nlook forward to the speedy passage of this Resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9255-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9255-S9272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENT SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               BROWNBACK (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3359\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Grams, Mr. \nSmith of New Hampshire, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Helms, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Hutchinson) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 2312) making appropriations for \nthe Treasury Department, the United States Postal Service, the \nExecutive Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes; \nas follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to use the Federal budget surplus \n     to provide tax relief the payroll tax should be reduced \n     first; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     tax which burdens American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9255-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9272-S9273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n250th anniversary of Frederick County, Maryland. Throughout Maryland's \nglorious history, Frederick County and her sons and daughters have \nplayed a critical role in our State's quest for freedom and progress. \nFrom the very founding of our nation, Frederick Countians have proudly \nand resolutely upheld the principles and beliefs which are the basis of \nour democratic system of self government.\n  This strong commitment to freedom was evident among the English and \nGerman immigrants who first settled in Frederick County. They were \nextremely appreciative of the freedoms they found in this ``New World'' \nand zealous in their dedication to protecting them. One such individual \nwas Francis Scott Key, the lawyer and poet who, watching the \nbombardment of Ft. McHenry from a British cartel ship off Sparrow's \nPoint in Baltimore's harbor, penned the words that subsequently became \nmemorialized as our National Anthem.\n  What many may not know is that the eloquent author of the Star \nSpangled Banner was born in Frederick City, which celebrated its own \n250th birthday in 1995. Francis Scott Key was detained on the British \nship in 1814 while attempting to secure the release of Dr. William \nBeanes of Upper Marlboro who had been arrested. In the early morning of \nSeptember 14, 1814, during the Battle of Baltimore, Key, overcome with \npride from his unique vantage point, wrote the words that captured the \nessence of our national struggle for independence.\n  Frederick County is also the seat of some of our State's most \ntumultuous historic incidents. When the British passed the Stamp Act in \n1785 requiring colonists to purchase stamps for all legal and \ncommercial documents, twelve Frederick County judges resolved to reject \nthe Stamp Act, and approved the use of unstamped documents. This bold \nmaneuver is believed to be the first recorded act of rebellion in the \ncolonies.\n  It was in Frederick County that the Maryland legislature held the \nmomentous vote on secession. The vote was held in this venue in \nresponse to a personal request from President Lincoln in the hope that \nMarylanders from the southern part of the State would not be able to \nattend, therefore guaranteeing that Maryland remain in the Union. \nAlthough the strategy was successful, the narrow vote sent \nreverberations throughout the State and there were skirmishes at towns \nalong the Potomac. While the resulting Confederate occupation of parts \nof Frederick County was relatively peaceful, this event was the \nimmediate precursor to the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of \nfighting in any American war.\n  A local anecdote, which serves as a testament to the tremendous \ndedication of these citizens, claims that on\n\n[[Page S9274]]\n\nthe day that General Jackson's troops were marching out of Frederick to \nAntietam, a Union flag was seen hanging from the home of Barbara \nFritchie, a 95 year old widow known for her spirited nature, who risked \ninjury and death by hanging from her window after shots were fired, \nflag in hand, shouting, ``Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, but \nspare your country's flag.''\n  Another significant event has its beginnings here, as it was from the \nCity of Frederick that Lewis and Clark launched their exploration of \nthe American West. In July, 1803, these two explorers set out from the \nHessian Barracks in Frederick Town into uncharted territories. These \nevents further illustrate Frederick County's position at the symbolic \ncrossroads of history, and it is here that we find Maryland's true \nroots firmly in place. Frederick County is at a literal crossroads as \nwell due to the construction of the B Railroad in the early 1800's \nand the location of the C canal. These two modes of transportation \nopened up major corridors from and to the east, laying the groundwork \nfor a tradition of jobs, industry and trade.\n  From this lasting spirit of community interdependence and unity comes \nmany of Frederick's modern landmarks. Frederick County is home to Ft. \nDetrick, crucial to the creation of new jobs and economic development \nin the region, and to the National Fallen Firefighters memorial in \nEmmitsburg. In recent years, Frederick County has been a leader in \ndeveloping new economic growth and opportunities for our State and has \nattracted innovative technology companies to its pleasant surroundings.\n  The City of Frederick, the County Seat, is the second largest city in \nMaryland, yet it maintains its small town charm and sense of community \nthat reflects the civil congeniality that has always defined Frederick, \nboth in its rich history and its contemporary success. The contribution \nof Francis Scott Key to our nation has been complemented over the \ndecades by other distinguished citizens of this county. Most recently, \nmany of us in the Senate were privileged to count as a colleague the \nextremely distinguished Senator from Maryland and native son of \nFrederick, Charles Mac Mathias. The intellectual and personal integrity \nwhich Senator Mathias brought to this body in service to the nation is \nexemplary of the spirit of his fellow Frederick Countians.\n  The activities that have been planned in celebration of this \nauspicious anniversary exemplify the deep devotion of Frederick \nresidents to their county. I join these citizens in sharing their pride \nin Frederick's past and their optimism for continued achievement. I \nurge my colleagues to visit this lovely location in the heart of \nMaryland and explore this renowned resource.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9273-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOUIS TAYLOR\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Louis \nTaylor who has provided great service to the Committee on Small \nBusiness, the U.S. Senate and to me personally. Louis Taylor is \nstepping down this week as Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business. When I became chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business in January 1995, one of my first actions \nwas to hire Louis. For the past 3\\1/2\\ years, Louis has provided \noutstanding leadership to the staff on the Committee on Small Business \nand he has been instrumental in support of my efforts to transform the \ncommittee so that it is the eyes, ears, and voice in the U.S. Senate \nfor small businesses.\n  In his tenure on the Committee on Small Business, Louis Taylor played \na significant role in crafting important pieces of legislation to help \nsmall businesses. Two such legislative accomplishments stand out among \nthe numerous bills that originated from the Committee on Small Business \nand were enacted into law--the HUBZone Act of 1997 and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, also known as the \nRed-Tape Reduction Act. The HUBZone program expands the opportunity for \nsmall businesses in economically distressed areas to compete for \nFederal contracts, bringing jobs and new investments to inner cities \nand poor rural areas. The Red-Tape Reduction Act established safeguards \nto improve the Government's regulatory fairness to small businesses and \nestablished an independent ombudsman and regional citizen review boards \nto give small businesses a voice in evaluating Federal agency actions. \nWithout Louis Taylor's contributions, the ultimate enactment of these \nimportant statutes would surely have been much more difficult.\n  In addition to these impressive legislative achievements, Louis \nTaylor played an integral role in ensuring that the Committee on Small \nBusiness capitalized on its expansive oversight jurisdiction to be a \nstrong advocate for small business in the U.S. Senate. On those issues \nwhere the committee did not have legislative jurisdiction, Louis Taylor \nhelped me guide the committee in its efforts to call attention to the \nimpact such issues have on small business. For example, using its \noversight jurisdiction, the committee was successful in including a \nnumber of small business provisions in the IRS Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998, which was signed into law last week. These changes to the \nstructure of the IRS and improved taxpayer rights will help small \nbusiness owners to resolve tax problems more efficiently while \nproviding them with the service and respect that they deserve from the \nagency. The committee has also been extremely active in ensuring \nregulatory fairness for small businesses and women-owned businesses, in \nparticular. Perhaps the provision that will have the broadest impact, \nhowever, is the provision of 100 percent deductibility for health \ninsurance for the self-employed and their families. This measure \nultimately will make health insurance more affordable for 5 million \nAmericans who do not carry it now.\n  In conclusion, the entire committee and I certainly will miss Louis \nTaylor as he moves on to other endeavors, but the contributions that he \nhas made and the leadership he has given to the Committee on Small \nBusiness are greatly appreciated and will not be soon \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9274-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9274-S9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     150TH PHINEAS GAGE ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, CAVENDISH, VERMONT\n\n Mr. LEAHY: Mr. President, on September 13, 1998, the town of \nCavendish, Vermont will be holding a very special event to commemorate \nthe remarkable life of Phineas Gage. Phineas Gage was the victim of a \nfreak head injury that occurred in Cavendish, and the effect his injury \nhad on his personality resulted in a breakthrough in the understanding \nof brain function.\n  To commemorate the 150th anniversary of Phineas Gage's accident, the \ntown of Cavendish has planned a two-day celebration. A beautiful town \nin southern Vermont, lying on the original tracks of the Rutland-\nBurlington railroad, Cavendish has initiated and organized the Gage \ncelebration. At the heart of the commemoration events will be a \nhistoric festival in the Cavendish town center. The festival will \ninclude tours along the historic railway, artifact displays, including \nthe first public display of Gage's skull and tamping rod, and Vermont \nartisan and craft demonstrations.\n  The residents of Cavendish citizens are to be commended for their \nleadership and hard work in planning these events.\n  To more fully explain the events of September 13, 1848, and the \nimportance of this day for medical history, at the conclusion of my \nremarks and those of my colleague from Vermont, I ask that the story of \nPhineas Gage provided by the town of Cavendish be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Vermont in \nrecognizing September 13th as the 150th Anniversary of Phineas Gage's \naccident in Cavendish, VT. Gage was clearing away boulders for a new \nrail line in the town of Cavendish, population 1300, when an explosion \nsent his tamping rod passing through his skull and landing 30 yards \naway. It initially appeared that Gage had survived the accident without \nlong term effects. However, soon after the accident, it became apparent \nthat his emotional stability and good attitude had changed forever \noffering insight into the effects of the frontal lobe brain damage on \nmental function.\n  Earlier this year,Vermont Governor Howard Dean signed a proclamation \ndeclaring September 13, 1998 as Phineas\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\nGage 150th Anniversary Commemoration Day. On this day, accompanying the \nhistoric festival, Cavendish will host the John Martyn Harlow Frontal \nLobe Symposium. John Harlow, Gage's doctor, carefully documented Gage's \naccident and recovery, providing early insight into frontal lobe brain \ndamage. The symposium will draw experts and scholars from around the \nglobe to reexamine the Gage case, and apply modern technology to better \nunderstand the connection between brain damage and personality change.\n  I join my colleague from Vermont in commending the residents of \nCavendish for bringing together their town, the state of Vermont, and \nthe international neurological community to celebrate this Vermont \nlegend and the medical breakthrough surrounding his life.\n  The story follows:\n\n                  The Story of Phineas Gage's Accident\n\n       Phineas Gage is one of the most famous patients in medical \n     history and probably the most famous patient to have survived \n     severe damage to the brain. He is also the first patient from \n     whom we have learned something about the relationship between \n     personality and the function of the frontal lobe of the \n     brain.\n       Gage was the foreman in a railway construction gang working \n     for the contractors preparing the bed for the Rutland and \n     Burlington Railroad just outside of Cavendish (Vermont). On \n     September 13, 1848, an accidental explosion of a charge he \n     had set blew his tamping iron through the left side of his \n     skull. The tamping iron, a crowbar-like tool, was 3 feet 7 \n     inches long, weighed 13\\1/2\\ pounds, and was 1\\1/4\\ inches in \n     diameter at one end, tapering over a distance of about 1 foot \n     to a diameter of \\1/4\\ inch at the other end.\n       The tamping iron went point first under his left cheek bone \n     and out through the top of his head, landing about 25 to 30 \n     yards behind him. Gage was knocked over but may not have lost \n     consciousness according to historic accounts even though most \n     of the left frontal lobe was destroyed. He was treated by Dr. \n     John Harlow, the Cavendish physician, with such skill that \n     Gage returned to his home in Lebanon, NH, 10 weeks later.\n       Seven months later, Gage felt strong enough to resume work. \n     But because his personality had changed so much, the \n     contractors who had employed him would not return him to his \n     former position. Before the accident, he had been their most \n     capable and efficient foreman, one with a well-balanced mind \n     and a shrewd business sense. He was not fitful, irreverent, \n     and grossly profane, showing little deference for his men. He \n     was impatient and obstinate, yet capricious and vacillating, \n     unable to settle on any of the plans he devised for future \n     action. His friends said he was, ``No longer Gage.''\n       Phineas Gage never worked at the level of a foreman again. \n     He held a number of odd jobs according to Dr. Harlow's 1868 \n     account. He appeared at Barnum's Museum in New York, worked \n     in the livery stable of the Darmouth Inn (Hanover, NH) and \n     drove coaches and cared for horses in Chile. In about 1859, \n     after his health began to fail, he went to San Francisco to \n     live with his mother. He began to have epileptic seizures in \n     February 1860 and died on May 21, 1860.\n       No studies of Phineas Gage's brain were made post mortem. \n     Late in 1867, his body was exhumed from its grave in San \n     Francisco's Lone Mountain Cemetery. Phineas' skull and the \n     famous tamping iron were delivered by his brother-in-law to \n     Dr. Harlow (who was at that time, living in Woburn, MA). \n     Harlow reported his findings, including his estimate of the \n     brain damage, in 1868. He donated the skull and tamping iron \n     for preservation to the Warren Museum in the Harvard \n     University School of Medicine where they are still on \n     display, and still studied.\n       The case created a good deal of interest in both medical \n     and lay circles at the time (which continues to this day). \n     Phineas survived a horrendous injury. His case began to have \n     a profound influence on the science of localization of brain \n     function. For nearly 20 years knowledge of the profound \n     change that occurred to Gage's personality was not widely \n     disseminated. It was true that he was physically unchanged \n     except for the obvious scars and that his mental capacity was \n     also unchanged. Without knowing about the personality \n     difference, most people thought he had survived totally \n     intact. His case was therefore used as evidence against the \n     doctrine that any functions were localized in the brain, \n     especially against the phrenological version of it. Later it \n     was also used as negative evidence in the medical debates \n     regarding aphasia and frontal lobe function. The real story \n     was publicized after 1868 by David Ferrier, the notable \n     English doctor and physiological research worker. Even now, \n     150 years after the fateful accident, the case continues to \n     generate controversy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/29/senate-section/article/S9274-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9275-S9278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE FOR H.R. 1151\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask that the Congressional \nBudget Office Cost Estimate for H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership \nAccess Act, be printed in the Record. The Senate completed action on \nH.R. 1151 on July 28, 1998.\n  The cost estimate follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n             H.R. 1151--Credit Union Membership Access Act\n\n       Summary: H.R. 1151 would establish new guidelines governing \n     eligibility for membership in credit unions; establish a \n     framework of safety and soundness regulations for credit \n     unions consistent with that for banks and savings and loans; \n     and allow the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to \n     increase assessments that credit unions pay into the National \n     Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) and to increase \n     the normal operating balance of the fund. CBO estimates that \n     implementing the act would increase net assessments paid to \n     the NCUSIF BY $510 million over the 1999-2003 period, thereby \n     reducing net outlays by that amount. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 1151 would lead \n     to a shift of deposits from financial institutions that pay \n     federal income taxes to credit unions, which are not subject \n     to federal income tax, resulting in revenue losses to the \n     federal government totaling $143 million through 2003.\n       Because H.R. 1151 would affect both revenues and direct \n     spending, it would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures. \n     H.R. 1151 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) because it would, in \n     certain circumstances, preempt state laws regulating credit \n     unions. CBO estimates that the cost of such mandates would be \n     minimal. Other impacts on states would also not be \n     significant. H.R. 1151 would not impose mandates or have \n     other budgetary impacts on local or tribal governments.\n       H.R. 1151 would impose new private-sector mandates, as \n     defined by UMRA, on federally insured credit unions. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of those mandates would not exceed \n     the statutory threshold established in UMRA ($100 million in \n     one year, adjusted annually for inflation). Other provisions \n     of the bill would benefit some credit unions by reversing the \n     effects of a recent Supreme Court Decision, thus allowing \n     federal credit unions to organize with members from unrelated \n     occupational groups.\n\n\n                    DESCRIPTION OF MAJOR PROVISIONS\n\n       H.R. 1151 would overturn a February 1998 supreme Court \n     decision in National Credit Union Administration v. First \n     National Bank & Trust Co., et al., which--in the absence of \n     legislation such as this--will tighten the limitations on \n     membership in credit unions. The case dealt with a challenge \n     to the NCUA's interpretation of section 109 of the Federal \n     Credit Union Act, which requires that membership in federal \n     credit unions be limited to groups having a common bond of \n     occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined \n     neighborhood or community. The NCUA ruled in 1982 that a \n     single credit union could serve employees of multiple \n     employers even though not all employers were engaged in the \n     same industrial activity. The Supreme Court has now \n     determined that the NCUA's interpretation was invalid.\n       This legislation would amend the Federal Credit Union Act \n     to allow federal credit unions to accept members from \n     unrelated groups--thus forming multiple common bonds--in \n     addition to the current permissible categories of single \n     common bond and community credit unions. The act would \n     grandfather membership status for members of existing credit \n     unions and allow credit unions to solicit members from \n     unrelated groups of up to 3,000 persons.\n       Other provisions of the act would: establish new procedures \n     for taking prompt corrective action regarding a troubled \n     credit union and specify capital levels for credit unions, \n     which would be equal to the standards that the banking and \n     thrift regulators now require; require the NCUA to develop \n     risk-based requirements for determining the net worth of \n     certain credit unions that the NCUA determines to be \n     ``complex;'' change the method for calculating the ratio of \n     NCUSIF balances to total credit union deposits; specify a \n     range (between 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent of insured \n     deposits) for the normal balance of the insurance fund; \n     assessments would be triggered if the fund balance falls \n     below 1.2 percent; require an independent financial audit for \n     all credit unions with total assets of $500,000 or more; \n     limit the total volume of commercial loans that can be made \n     by a credit union to the lesser of 1.75 times the actual \n     capital level of the credit union or to 1.75 times the \n     capital level of a well-capitalized credit union with the \n     same amount of assets; require credit unions to serve members \n     of ``modest means,'' and require the NCUA to monitor the \n     lending record of credit unions to ensure compliance with \n     this provision; require the NCUA and the other federal \n     banking agencies to review certain rules and regulations with \n     the goal of streamlining and modifying them, as appropriate, \n     to reduce paperwork and unnecessary costs for insured \n     depository institutions; require the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to prepare several reports, including a study of the \n     difference between credit unions and other financial \n     institutions that are federally insured, and a study \n     outlining recommendations for legislative and administrative \n     actions that would reduce and simplify the tax burden on \n     small insured depository institutions; and simplify the rules \n     allowing credit unions to convert to another insured \n     institution and limit the economic\n\n[[Page S9276]]\n\n     benefit that senior officials of a credit union could gain \n     when converting a credit union to a mutual institution.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 1151 is shown in the following \n     table. Over the 1999-2003 period, CBO estimates that net \n     collections of the NCUSIF would increase by about $510 \n     million. The JCT estimates that federal revenues would \n     decline by $6 million in 1999 and $143 million over the 1999-\n     2003 period. The outlay effects of this legislation fall \n     within budget function 370 (commerce and housing credit).\n\n \n                                     [By fiscal year, in million of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 DIRECT SPENDING\n \nNCUA spending under current law:\n    Estimated budget authority................          0          0          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated outlays.........................       -182       -145       -117       -116       -120       -123\nProposed changes:\n    Estimated budget authority................          0          0          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated outlays \\1\\.....................          0        -93       -113       -110        -99        -94\nNCUA spending under H.R. 1151:\n    Estimated budget authority................          0          0          0          0          0          0\n    Estimated outlays.........................       -182       -238       -230       -226       -219       -217\n \n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated revenues \\2\\........................          0         -6        -16        -27        -40       -54\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ These amounts exclude changes in NCUA interest income from intragovernmental payments that have no net\n  budgetary impact.\n\\2\\ A negative sign indicates a decrease in revenues.\n\n       Basis of estimate: For purposes of this estimate, we assume \n     H.R. 1151 will be enacted by the beginning of fiscal year \n     1999. The provisions of the act that are expected to have a \n     significant budgetary effect are discussed below. The reports \n     to be completed by the Secretary of the Treasury would be \n     funded by discretionary spending, but we estimate that the \n     amounts required would not be significant.\n       Direct spending: CBO estimates that, under H.R. 1151, the \n     amount of assessments that credit unions pay to the NCUSIF \n     would increase by about $352 million over the 1999-2003 \n     period and that rebates to members from the fund would \n     decline by $185 million over the same period. Together, these \n     changes would reduce federal outlays by $537 million from \n     1999 through 2003. NCUSIF's payments for the NCUA's operating \n     costs would increase by $27 million over the five years, for \n     a net budgetary savings of $510 million through 2003. \n     Finally, we estimate that the operating fund of the NCUA \n     would incur additional administrative costs of $55 million \n     over the 1999-2003 period to carry out the act's provisions \n     related to safety and soundness, and to ensure that credit \n     unions meet the needs of all members of the community. These \n     costs would be offset by additional income from fees and \n     payments from the NCUSIF.\n       Assessment income: H.R. 1151 would make three changes that \n     CBO expects would increase assessments paid into the NCUSIF \n     over the next 10 years. It would (1) allow current credit \n     union members whose membership status was nuclear as a result \n     of the Supreme Court ruling to retain their membership and \n     allow credit unions to accept members from unrelated groups; \n     (2) change the formula for calculating the reserve balance in \n     the NCUSIF; and (3) change the frequency with which credit \n     unions pay assessments for deposit insurance. This \n     estimate measures these changes relative to current law, \n     which reflects the Supreme Court decision in the case of \n     National Credit Union Administration v. First National \n     Bank & Trust Co., et al.\n       The act would allow for an expansion in credit union \n     memberships by allowing growth in groups with common bonds, \n     including occupational credit unions, where the greatest \n     potential for new deposits exists. Recently, about two-thirds \n     of all net new job creation has been associated with small \n     businesses employing fewer than 500 persons. Although H.R. \n     1151 would encourage the chartering of new credit unions with \n     a common single bond of occupation or association, these \n     groups are often too small to have their own sponsor for a \n     separate credit union. CBO believes that, as a result of this \n     act, such small groups of individuals sharing a common \n     employer or occupation would be more likely to join together \n     to form new credit unions, or to join existing ones, thereby \n     forming credit unions with members having multiple common \n     bonds. Thus, we expect the number of size of credit unions \n     with multiple common bonds to grow faster than under current \n     law. As a result, we expect that enactment of H.R. 1151 would \n     trigger growth of deposits in credit unions of about 5 \n     percent annually by 2000, compared to projected annual growth \n     of about 3 percent under current law. With more rapid growth \n     in deposits, CBO expects that insurance assessments collected \n     by the NCUA also would increase because credit unions pay to \n     the NCUSIF an amount equal to 1 percent of the growth in \n     their deposits each year.\n       The act would impose some restrictions that could limit the \n     growth of deposits, by narrowing the definition of ``family \n     members'' eligible for membership; limiting conversions to \n     community credit unions; requiring the NCUA to impose tougher \n     capital standards and to close insolvent credit unions \n     promptly; and prohibiting credit unions that are \n     undercapitalized from making new commercial loans. It also \n     would encourage a shift of some deposits from credit unions \n     to thrifts or banks by simplifying the process involved in \n     converting a credit union to another type of insured \n     institution and by allowing some profits from conversions to \n     accrue to individuals. Nevertheless, CBO expects that the \n     effects of other provisions of H.R. 1151, which would lead to \n     more rapid deposit growth, would more than offset thee \n     restrictions.\n       The act would change the NCUSIF's normal operating level of \n     reserves by allowing the fund balance to range between $1.30 \n     per $100 of insured deposits to as much as $1.50 per $100 of \n     insured deposits. Under current law, the NCUA rebates all \n     balances in excess of 1.3 percent. Under the act, however, \n     CBO expects that the NCUA would continue to provide rebates \n     to members but would limit the amount to one-half the total \n     potentially available for refunding, thereby accumulating \n     higher balances in the insurance fund. CBO estimates that the \n     NCUA would authorize rebates totaling about $465 million over \n     the 1999-2003 period, or about $185 million less than under \n     current law.\n       Safety and Soundness: H.R. 1151 also would strengthen the \n     regulatory framework of credit unions, and would specify \n     statutory capital and net worth standards equal to those of \n     other insured financial institutions. The act would authorize \n     the NCUA to take prompt corrective action against credit \n     unions engaged in unsafe practices. Because the act would \n     allow credit unions to diversify their membership among \n     various occupational groups, we expect that the stress on \n     particular credit unions would be reduced in periods of \n     corporate downsizing or closure. As a consequence, the \n     probability of failure of credit unions and of losses to the \n     insurance fund would be lower. At this time, CBO has no basis \n     for estimating the potential savings--if any--to the NCUSIF.\n       Other provisions. The act would limit the authority of most \n     credit unions to make business loans exceeding $50,000 to the \n     lesser of 1.75 times the net worth of the institution or 1.75 \n     times the minimum net worth for a well-capitalized credit \n     union with the same amount of assets. (A well-capitalized \n     credit union is defined as having a ratio of capital to \n     assets of 7 percent.) Section 203 would allow a transition \n     period of three years to phase in the new restrictions on \n     business loans. In addition, the act would require the NCUA \n     to issue regulations defining permissible membership and \n     boundaries for community credit unions. Title II would \n     require the NCUA to prescribe criteria for annually \n     evaluating the record of any community credit union and to \n     develop procedures for ensuring compliance.\n       CBO estimates that the additional cost to the NCUA to \n     undertake the various initiatives required by H.R. 1151 would \n     total approximately $4 million in 1999, and would increase to \n     $17 million by 2003, about 14 percent of its operating \n     budget. The basis for this estimate is the cost of similar \n     activities for the other federal financial regulators. \n     Most of these expenses, which total an estimated $55 \n     million through 2003, would be for evaluating the records \n     of all insured credit unions to ensure that they meet the \n     needs of those in the community with modest means. They \n     include costs for training, computer support, and \n     overhead. The operating funds of the NCUA are derived from \n     two sources: examination fees charged to credit unions and \n     transfers of funds from the NCUSIF equal to one-half of \n     the annual expenses associated with operating the NCUA. We \n     expect the NCUA would increase fees and reduce rebates to \n     credit unions in amounts sufficient to recover the \n     increase in administrative costs, resulting in no \n     significant budgetary impact over the next five years.\n       Revenues: The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that \n     enacting H.R. 1151 would result in a loss of governmental \n     receipts because deposits would shift from financial \n     institutions that currently are subject to corporate \n     taxation--primarily banks and thrifts--to credit unions, \n     which are exempt from federal taxation. Assuming that, over \n     time, deposits in credit unions would grow about 2 percent \n     per year faster than under current law, the JCT estimates \n     that the federal government would lose revenues\n\n[[Page S9277]]\n\n     totaling $143 million over the 1999-2003 period.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-\n     go procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in outlays and governmental \n     receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are \n     shown in the following table. For the purposes of enforcing \n     pay-as-you-go procedures, only the effects in the current \n     year, the budget year, and the succeeding four years are \n     counted.\n\n \n                                                        [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays.............          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0          0\nChanges in receipts............          0         -6        -16        -27        -40        -54        -70        -87       -106       -127       -151\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The JCT estimates that, under H.R. 1151, there would be \n     more deposits in credit unions and fewer in financial \n     institutions that are subject to federal taxation. Forgone \n     revenues are estimated to total $143 million over the 1999-\n     2003 period.\n       Under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act, provisions providing funding necessary to meet the \n     government's deposit insurance commitment are excluded from \n     pay-as-you-go procedures. Therefore, the projected increases \n     in assessment income and decreases in rebates to credit \n     unions would not count for pay-as-you-go purposes. CBO \n     believes that the administrative costs related to safety and \n     soundness, estimated to total about $11 million through 2003, \n     would be excluded as well. In contract, CBO believes that the \n     various costs that the NCUA would incur to ensure that credit \n     unions serve people of modest means would count for pay-as-\n     you-go purposes. We estimate that the additional direct \n     spending for the NCUA's supervisory costs associated with \n     activities other than those related to safety and soundness \n     would total about $45 million over the 1999-2003 period. \n     These costs would be fully offset by increases in fees \n     charged to credit unions or reduced rebates, resulting in no \n     significant net budgetary impact.\n       Estimated Impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     H.R. 1151 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA because it would, in certain circumstances, preempt \n     state laws regulating credit unions. Specifically, the act \n     would establish safety, soundness, and audit requirements \n     that are stricter than some state standards. In addition, it \n     would impose limits on the volume of business loans made by \n     credit unions. It could also override state community \n     reinvestment laws that apply to state-chartered credit unions \n     that are federally insured. Under UMRA such preemptions would \n     be mandates. However, because these preemptions would simply \n     limit the application of state law in some circumstances, and \n     because only a few states are likely to be affected, CBO \n     estimates that they would impose only minimal costs on \n     states.\n       H.R. 1151 also contains provisions that would increase the \n     workload of state regulators of credit unions. These \n     provisions would not be mandates under UMRA because they are \n     the result of voluntary agreements between state and federal \n     regulators, under which state regulators incorporate federal \n     requirements into their evaluations of state-chartered credit \n     unions. The net effect of these provisions would not be \n     significant because costs incurred by state regulators would \n     be offset by examination fees and assessments levied by the \n     states. Finally, the legislation would not impose mandates or \n     have other budgetary impacts on local or tribal governments.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: H.R. 1151 would \n     impose new private-sector mandates, as defined by UMRA, on \n     federally insured credit unions. CBO estimates that the \n     direct costs of complying with private-sector mandates in \n     H.R. 1151, in the first five years after mandates become \n     effective, would be below the statutory threshold established \n     in UMRA ($100 million in 1996, adjusted annually for \n     inflation). Several provisions in the act would impose \n     restrictions on credit unions that could affect their long-\n     term future business potential. CBO expects that those \n     restrictions could limit somewhat the growth of deposits. At \n     the same time, a key provision in H.R. 1151 would benefit \n     federal credit unions by relaxing an existing restriction and \n     allowing occupation-based credit unions to serve multiple \n     unrelated groups. Overall, CBO estimates that total deposits \n     of credit unions would grow faster under H.R. 1151 than under \n     current law.\n       Private-sector mandates contained in the bill: H.R. 1151 \n     would impose several mandates on federally insured credit \n     unions. The primary mandates in the act would: establish new \n     criteria for credit unions to demonstrate service to low- and \n     moderate-income individuals; limit the amount of business \n     loans that an institution can make to members; establish a \n     system of prompt corrective action that is consistent with \n     the system currently applicable to institutions insured by \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; require credit \n     unions having assets greater than $50 million to remit \n     deposits to the NCUSIF semiannually instead of annually; and \n     impose new regulations regarding auditing and accounting \n     procedures for institutions with assets greater than $10 \n     million.\n       Serving persons of modest means. Section 204 would subject \n     federally insured credit unions to a periodic review by the \n     NCUA of their record in providing affordable credit union \n     services to low- and moderate-income individuals within their \n     membership group. The act would direct the NCUA to develop \n     additional criteria for annual evaluations of the record of \n     community credit unions. Such institutions are usually \n     organized to serve a particular local community, \n     neighborhood, or rural district and are not based on an \n     occupational bond. The act would direct the NCUA to \n     implement regulations that emphasize performance over \n     paperwork.\n       Business Loans to Members. Section 203 would put limits on \n     the total amount of business loans that a federally insured \n     credit union could make. Business loans to members would be \n     limited to an amount that is the lesser of 1.75 times a \n     credit union's actual net worth or 1.75 times the statutory \n     requirement for well-capitalized institutions with the same \n     amount of assets. For a well-capitalized credit union, this \n     provision would effectively limit business loans to its \n     members to 12.25 percent of its assets. The act would exempt \n     from this requirement credit unions that have a history of \n     primarily making business loans to members and credit unions \n     that serve predominantly low-income members. Although the \n     limit on business loans would be effective on the date of \n     enactment, H.R. 1151 would allow credit unions with loans \n     over the limit on that date three years to reduce the volume \n     of outstanding loans to a level that is in compliance.\n       Safety and Soundness Provisions. Section 301 would require \n     the NCUA to establish a system of prompt corrective action \n     (PCA) for federally insured credit unions within one and one-\n     half years after enactment. As a part of the PCA system H.R. \n     1151 would establish statutory capital levels for federally \n     insured credit unions based on an institution's ratio of net \n     worth to assets--well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, \n     undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and \n     critically undercapitalized. (Credit unions that are deemed \n     to have complex portfolios by the NCUA would have additional \n     risk-based capital requirements.) Well-capitalized \n     institutions would have no further restrictions on their \n     activities under PCA. Credit unions that are not well-\n     capitalized would have to set aside net worth (usually \n     retained earnings) at a rate of 0.4 percent of assets \n     annually. Undercapitalized institutions would have to (1) \n     create a restoration plan approved by the NCUA, (2) monitor \n     asset growth in compliance with an approved plan, and (3) \n     restrict the growth of business loans to members.\n       Semi-Annual Remittance to the Share Insurance Fund. Under \n     current law, each insured credit union maintains on deposit \n     in the NCUSIF an amount equal to 1 percent of the credit \n     union's insured share deposits. Credit unions periodically \n     certify the amount of share deposits and, each April, they \n     adjust their deposit in the fund based on this amount. For \n     credit unions with more than $50 million in assets, this \n     legislation would change the schedule to twice per year for \n     adjusting deposit levels in the fund.\n       New Accounting Requirements. Section 201 would require \n     credit unions with assets over $500 million to have an annual \n     independent audit of their financial statement performed in \n     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \n     (GAAP). H.R. 1151 would also require credit unions with \n     assets over $10 million to use GAAP in all reports required \n     to be filed with the NCUA. Credit unions with assets under \n     $10 million would be allowed to continue to use other methods \n     outlined in NCUA's Accounting Manual, unless GAAP is \n     specifically prescribed for them by NCUA or their state \n     regulator.\n       Estimated costs to the private sector: In total, CBO \n     estimates that the cost of mandates in H.R. 1151 would fall \n     below UMRA's threshold for private-sector mandates. Complying \n     with the provisions in section 204, dealing with service to \n     persons of modest means, would be the most costly mandate in \n     the act. The costs of those provisions would range from $25 \n     million to $33 million in the first year that the regulations \n     are fully implemented, fall in the next year, and rise \n     somewhat thereafter. The cost to credit unions of limiting \n     business loans to members are not expected to be substantial \n     overall, but some institutions may have to bear significant \n     losses on loans in order to comply with this restriction. The \n     direct costs of other mandates in the legislation would be \n     less than $3 million in any of the five years after mandates \n     would become effective. The safety-and-soundness provisions \n     would increase examination costs incurred by credit unions by \n     about $1 million annually by the year 2001. Lost investment \n     income to credit unions that would have to make additional \n     deposits to the share insurance fund would total between $1.5 \n     million and $2 million during each of the first five years \n     after implementation. The costs of complying with the \n     accounting provisions in the act would be negligible because \n     most institutions are already in or near compliance.\n\n[[Page S9278]]\n\n       Serving Persons of Modest Means. The cost of complying with \n     requirements that would result from provisions in section 204 \n     are difficult to assess because the NCUA would have to \n     develop a new set of criteria to evaluate a credit union's \n     service to members of modest means. Such rules are likely \n     to differ substantially from those applicable to other \n     depository institutions. Based on information from the \n     NCUA and other regulatory agencies, CBO estimates that the \n     costs of complying with those provisions would range from \n     $25 million to $33 million in the year 2000 and would fall \n     in the next year once the system is in place. Most of the \n     incremental costs to credit unions would be for keeping \n     additional records on member loans and share accounts to \n     assist in monitoring services to low-income persons, \n     marketing to all segments within the membership field, and \n     undergoing more extensive periodic examinations. Costs \n     could be higher if the NCUA determines that additional \n     types of information would be necessary to monitor \n     compliance with these provisions.\n       In general, federally insured credit unions would have to \n     record additional information on households with respect to \n     such member services as loans and, possibly, share accounts. \n     The incremental costs of new recordkeeping requirements could \n     range between $17 million and $25 million beginning in the \n     year 2000, and would fall by 20 percent to 30 percent in the \n     next years once the system is fully in place. Costs would \n     then rise over time as the number of loans and share accounts \n     grows. CBO estimates that the costs of marketing to all \n     income strata within the field of membership would increase \n     costs by $4 million to $5 million annually, which is less \n     than 1 percent of the amount that credit unions currently \n     spend on educational and promotional expenses. In addition to \n     those incremental costs, credit unions would have to cover \n     the costs of more extensive examinations by regulators. Based \n     on information from the NCUA and banking regulators, CBO \n     estimates that the increased costs for periodic examinations \n     would be about $3 million a year by the year 2000.\n       Business Loans to Members. The restrictions on business \n     loans to members would not impose a significant cost on the \n     industry as a whole. Currently about 1,550 credit unions make \n     business loans to their members. Of that group, only about \n     100 institutions are currently over the limit proposed in the \n     act. According to the latest data, those institutions would \n     be over the limit by almost $870 million in loans. However, \n     many of the institutions that are over the limit would be \n     able to qualify under the act for an exemption based on their \n     history of making such loans. (In over 40 percent of the \n     institutions that are currently over the limit, business \n     loans make up 37 percent or more of their loan portfolio.)\n       Credit unions that do not qualify for an exemption would \n     have 3 years to: allow loans to turn over (the turnover rate \n     for all credit union loans averages about 22 months); try to \n     sell loans on the market--only quality loans would attract a \n     high percentage on the dollar; try to engage in \n     ``participating loan'' programs, which allow institutions to \n     share up to 90 percent of their loan portfolio with other \n     credit unions; or try to ``call in'' loans under loan \n     agreements that have a provision allowing such an action. \n     Institutions with nonperforming loans or those that have a \n     slow turnover in their portfolio may have to sell loans at a \n     significant loss or write off loans at a total loss. Even \n     institutions that are able to sell off business loans could \n     experience a loss in interest income if they are unable to \n     invest money from the sale of those loans at comparable \n     interest rates. (Business loans typically garner a higher \n     rate than other loans in a credit union's portfolio.)\n       Safety and Soundness Provisions. The near-term costs of new \n     requirements under section 301 should be small for two \n     reasons. First, the NCUA currently monitors the net worth of \n     credit unions and administers several informal policies that \n     are analogous to prompt corrective action procedures \n     applicable to FDIC-insured institutions. Second, about 94 \n     percent of all federally insured credit unions are currently \n     well capitalized. Institutions with the lowest composite \n     performance ratings given by regulators have accounted for \n     only 3 percent or less of all credit unions over the last \n     four years.\n       Under PCA, institutions that are not well capitalized would \n     have to set aside funds that they could otherwise use to earn \n     interest income. However, according to the NCUA, the .04 \n     percent retention requirement is not significantly different \n     from current earnings-retention requirements. The costs of \n     examinations for credit unions would also increase slightly \n     (by $1 million or so by the year 2001) for all credit unions \n     under a system of prompt corrective action.\n       Other Mandate Costs. Under section 302, insured credit \n     unions with more than $50 million in assets would have to \n     remit assessments twice a year to the NCUSIF, thus losing the \n     use of $60 million for six months, compared to the current \n     system. Assuming credit unions would earn an annual yield of \n     about 5.5 percent on those funds, they would lose income of \n     $1.5 million to $2 million per year over the 1999-2003 \n     period.\n       The costs of complying with the accounting provisions in \n     H.R. 1151 would be small. According to recent data from the \n     NCUA, all but one of the credit unions with over $500 million \n     in assets already have an independent outside audit performed \n     each year. The incremental costs of an audit would be less \n     than $30,000 for an institution of that size. The costs of \n     complying with GAAP would also be minor because most credit \n     unions with assets over $10 million use accounting procedures \n     that are largely consistent with GAAP. For institutions that \n     currently use methods that are not consistent with GAAP \n     (mostly cash accounting methods), the additional compliance \n     costs of this mandate could include the costs to train \n     employees in the application of GAAP accounting methods, and \n     the costs of transferring records into a new system of \n     accounting. However, the majority of institutions do not use \n     cash accounting methods and would, therefore, only have to \n     make minor changes to achieve compliance.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On June 2, 1998, CBO prepared a cost \n     estimate for H.R. 1151, as passed by the House of \n     Representatives on April 1, 1998. For the House version of \n     H.R. 1151, CBO estimated that deposits in credit unions would \n     grow by 6 percent annually by 2000, compared to projected \n     annual growth of about 3 percent under current law. As a \n     result, CBO estimated that net assessments paid to the NCUSIF \n     would increase by $628 million over the period 1999-2003 \n     period, and that the shift in deposits would reduce revenues \n     to the federal government by $217 million through 2003. In \n     contrast, for the Senate version of H.R. 1151, CBO estimates \n     that deposits in credit unions would grow at a rate of about \n     2 percent annually by 2000, that net assessments would \n     increase by $510 million over the 1999-2003 period, and that \n     revenue losses would total $143 million through 2003.\n       CBO expects a lower annual rate of growth in deposits under \n     the Senate version of H.R. 1151 for a number of reasons. The \n     Senate version would specify net worth and capital \n     requirements for credit unions and require regulators to \n     restrict the growth of unhealthy institutions. In contrast, \n     the House version would give the NCUA discretion to develop \n     future standards affecting the safety and soundness of credit \n     unions. The Senate version of H.R. 1151 also would simplify \n     and ease procedures for converting a credit union to a mutual \n     institution. Unlike the House version, the Senate provisions \n     would not bar owners and members from earning profits if the \n     newly created mutual institution subsequently converted to a \n     publicly traded financial institution. CBO believes, \n     therefore, that the Senate version of H.R. 1151 would provide \n     a greater incentive to convert a credit union to a mutual or \n     stock institution by allowing participants to realize greater \n     economic benefits. This is consistent with the experience of \n     many small thrifts and banks that recently have converted \n     from mutual to stock ownership, thereby creating substantial \n     value for the new shareholders.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Mary Maginniss; \n     Revenues: Mark Booth; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal \n     Governments: Marc Nicole; and Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Patrice Gordon.\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues who are conferees for the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations bill to retain the Senate-passed funding \nlevel for the Army Corps of Engineers' fish and wildlife mitigation \nmeasures on the Columbia River.\n  The Senate approved $95 million for this program, which is vitally \nimportant to ongoing efforts to restore the\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\nsalmon and steelhead runs in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. \nUnfortunately, the House-passed bill slashed funding for the program to \nless than $8 million, enough for just two studies already underway in \nthe Basin. The House Committee justifies this action by claiming that \nthe funds spent to date have not recovered the salmon. Further, the \nHouse report states that since a major decision on the long-term \noperations of the federal dams on the system is supposed to occur in \n1999, we should just wait for that decision before we spend any more \nmoney on salmon recovery efforts in the basin.\n  Given the life cycle of the salmon, waiting even a few years is \nsimply not an option. Inaction on our part could push the salmon closer \nto extinction, which is unacceptable to those of us in the Pacific \nNorthwest. We must also be realistic about the possibility that the \n1999 decision could be delayed. And unless a regional consensus is \ndeveloped soon on how best to proceed, the decision--whenever it \ncomes--is bound to be controversial and subject to challenges.\n  Work on these fish mitigation measures, for which most of the funding \nwill be reimbursed through power revenues, must continue while a long-\nterm solution is developed and implemented. The House approach to this \nissue fails to recognize that most of the funding is earmarked for \nimportant mitigation facilities at dams not being studied for permanent \ndrawdown or by-pass, including McNary Dam and Bonneville Dam, as well \nas for important mitigation analysis studies. Information from these \nstudies is needed if we are to make an informed decision on the long-\nterm operation of the system.\n  Let me state emphatically that I am opposed to removal or drawdown of \ndams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, which would destroy navigation \non the river, affect irrigation, and eliminate up to 40 percent of \nBonneville's generating capacity. There are those in the region who \nview this an ``either/or'' proposition: either the river is operated \nfor salmon, or for economic activity. I say we can operate it for both.\n  The Columbia River truly is the lifeblood of the Northwest. The Basin \ndrains approximately 259,000 square miles, and encompasses two \ncountries and seven states in its approximately 1,200 miles to the \nPacific Ocean.\n  In this century, we have harnessed the River for a variety of human \nactivities and benefits, including navigation, water supply, power \nsupply, and flood control. At the time many of the great public works \nprojects in the Basin were constructed, fish and wildlife impacts were \nnot fully considered. We are now struggling with the best way to \nmitigate these impacts while still meeting human needs. The \nconsequences of these decisions could affect the livelihoods of most \nNorthwest residents.\n  I know that there are those who oppose funding certain activities on \nthe River that they view to be of questionable value. I think our \ncolleague, Senator Gorton, performed a great service for the region \nwith his 1996 amendment to the Northwest Power Planning and \nConservation Act to require that an independent, 11-member scientific \npanel review projects proposed to be funded by that portion of BPA's \nannual fish and wildlife budget that implements the Northwest Power \nPlanning Council's fish and wildlife program. I would support the \nexpanded use of scientific review panels for other fish and wildlife \nfunding proposals within the Columbia River Basin.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate my fervent hope that \nSenate conferees on this bill will stand firm on the $95 million \nappropriation this body has already approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

and\n       (III) in the case of an application for a temporary \n     restraining order or an injunction to prevent a violation of \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section, relating to material or activity located within \n     the United States, whether less burdensome, but comparably \n     effective means are available to block access by a customer \n     of the service's system or network to information or activity \n     that violates such section 1085.\n\n       (iii) Findings.--In any order issued by the court under \n     this paragraph, the court shall set forth the reasons for its \n     issuance, shall be specific in its terms, and shall describe \n     in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint \n     or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained \n     and the general steps to be taken to comply with the order.\n       (D) Expiration.--Any temporary restraining order or \n     preliminary injunction entered pursuant to this paragraph \n     shall expire if, and as soon as, the United States, or the \n     attorney general (or other appropriate State official) of the \n     State, as applicable, notifies the court that issued the \n     injunction that the United States or the State, as \n     applicable, will not seek a permanent injunction.\n       (3) Expedited proceedings.--\n       (A) In general.--In addition to proceedings under paragraph \n     (2), a district court may enter a temporary restraining order \n     against a person alleged to be in violation of section 1085 \n     of title 18, United States Code, as added by this section, \n     upon application of the United States under paragraph (2)(A), \n     or the attorney general (or other appropriate State official) \n     of an affected State under paragraph (2)(B), without notice \n     and the opportunity for a hearing, if the United States or \n     the State, as applicable, demonstrates that there is probable \n     cause to believe that the transmission at issue violates \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section.\n       (B) Expiration.--A temporary restraining order entered \n     under this paragraph shall expire on the earlier of--\n       (i) the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the \n     date on which the order is entered; or\n       (ii) the date on which a preliminary injunction is granted \n     or denied.\n       (C) Hearings.--A hearing requested concerning an order \n     entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest \n     practicable time.\n       (4) Rule of construction.--In the absence of fraud or bad \n     faith, no interactive computer service (as defined in section \n     1085(a) of title 18, United States Code, as added by this \n     section) shall be liable for any damages, penalty, or \n     forfeiture, civil or criminal, for a reasonable course of \n     action taken to comply with a court order issued under \n     paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection.\n       (5) Protection of privacy.--Nothing in this section or the \n     amendments made by this section shall be construed to \n     authorize an affirmative obligation on an interactive \n     computer service--\n       (A) to monitor use of its service; or\n       (B) except as required by an order of a court, to access, \n     remove or disable access to material where such material \n     reveals conduct prohibited by this section and the amendments \n     made by this section.\n       (6) No effect on other remedies.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to affect any remedy under \n     section 1084 or 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     amended by this section, or under any other Federal or State \n     law. The availability of relief under this subsection shall \n     not depend on, or be affected by, the initiation or \n     resolution of any action under section 1084 or 1085 of title \n     18, United States Code, as amended by this section, or under \n     any other Federal or State law.\n       (7) Continuous jurisdiction.--The court shall have \n     continuous jurisdiction under this subsection to enforce \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section.\n       (e) Report on Enforcement.--Not later than 3 years after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall \n     submit a report to Congress that includes--\n       (1) an analysis of the problems, if any, associated with \n     enforcing section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     added by this section;\n       (2) recommendations for the best use of the resources of \n     the Department of Justice to enforce that section; and\n       (3) an estimate of the amount of activity and money being \n     used to gamble on the Internet.\n       (f) Report on Costs.--Not later than 3 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     submit a report to Congress that includes--\n       (1) an analysis of existing and potential methods or \n     technologies for filtering or screening transmissions in \n     violation of section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     added by this section, that originate outside of the \n     territorial boundaries of any State or the United States;\n       (2) a review of the effect, if any, on interactive computer \n     services of any court ordered temporary restraining orders or \n     injunctions imposed on those services under this section;\n       (3) a calculation of the cost to the economy of illegal \n     gambling on the Internet, and other societal costs of such \n     gambling; and\n       (4) an estimate of the effect, if any, on the Internet \n     caused by any court ordered temporary restraining orders or \n     injunctions imposed under this section.\n       (g) Severability.--If any provision of this section, an \n     amendment made by this section, or the application of such \n     provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held \n     to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section, the \n     amendments made by this section, and the application of the \n     provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be \n     affected thereby.\n       Sec. 625. Sense of the Senate Regarding Japan's Recession. \n     (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share common goals of \n     peace, stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in East \n     and Southeast Asia and around the world.\n       (2) Japan's economic and financial crisis represents a new \n     challenge to United States-Japanese cooperation to achieve \n     these common goals and threatens the economic stability of \n     East and Southeast Asia and the United States.\n       (3) A strong United States-Japanese alliance is critical to \n     stability in East and Southeast Asia.\n       (4) The importance of the United States-Japanese alliance \n     was reaffirmed by the President of the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Japan in the April 1996 Joint Security \n     Declaration.\n       (5) United States-Japanese bilateral military cooperation \n     was enhanced with the revision of the United States \n     Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997.\n       (6) The Japanese economy, the second largest in the world \n     and over 2 times larger than the economy in the rest of East \n     Asia, has been growing at a little over 1 percent annually \n     since 1991 and is currently in a recession with some \n     forecasts suggesting that it will contract by 1.5 percent in \n     1998.\n       (7) The estimated $574,000,000,000 of problem loans in \n     Japan's banking sector and other problems associated with an \n     unstable banking sector remain the major roadblock to \n     economic recovery in Japan.\n       (8) The recent weakness in the yen, following a 10 percent \n     depreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last 5 \n     months and a 45 percent depreciation since 1995, has placed \n     competitive price pressures on United States industries and \n     workers and is putting downward pressure on China and the \n     rest of the economies in East and Southeast Asia to begin \n     another round of competitive currency devaluations.\n       (9) Japan's current account surplus has increased by 60 \n     percent over the last 12 months from 71,579,000,000 yen in \n     1996 to 114,357,000,000 yen in 1997.\n       (10) A period of deflation in Japan would lead to lower \n     demand for United States products.\n       (11) The unnecessary and burdensome regulation of the \n     Japanese market constrains Japanese economic growth and \n     raises costs to business and consumers.\n       (12) Deregulating Japan's economy and spurring economic \n     growth would ultimately benefit the Japanese people with a \n     higher standard of living and a more secure future.\n       (13) Japan's economic recession is slowing the growth of \n     the United States gross domestic product and job creation in \n     the United States.\n       (14) Japan has made significant efforts to restore economic \n     growth with a 16,000,000,000,000 yen stimulus package that \n     includes 4,500,000,000,000 yen in tax cuts and \n     11,500,000,000,000 yen in government spending, a Total Plan \n     to restore stability to the private banking sector, and joint \n     intervention with the United States to strengthen the value \n     of the yen in international currency markets.\n       (15) The people of Japan expressed deep concern about \n     economic conditions and government leadership in the Upper \n     House elections held on July 12, 1998.\n       (16) The Prime Minister of Japan tendered his resignation \n     on July 13, 1998, to take responsibility for the Liberal \n     Democratic Party's poor election results and to acknowledge \n     the desire of the people of Japan for new leadership to \n     restore economic stability.\n       (17) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the economy of the United States and is now seriously \n     threatening the 9 years of unprecedented economic expansion \n     in the United States.\n       (18) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the recovery of the East and Southeast Asian economies.\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\n       (19) The American people and the countries of East and \n     Southeast Asia are looking for a demonstration of Japanese \n     leadership and close United States-Japanese cooperation in \n     resolving Japan's economic crisis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \n     United States Trade Representative should emphasize the \n     importance of financial deregulation, including banking \n     reform, market deregulation, and restructuring bad bank debt \n     as fundamental to Japan's economic recovery; and\n       (2) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Secretary of State should communicate to \n     the Japanese Government that the first priority of the new \n     Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet should be to restore \n     economic growth in Japan and promote stability in \n     international financial markets.\n       Sec. 626. (a) Add the following at the end of section \n     1153(b)(5)(C) of title 8, United States Code:\n       ``(iv) Definition.--\n\n       ``(I) As used in this subsection the term `capital' means \n     cash, equipment, inventory, other tangible property, and cash \n     equivalents, but shall not include indebtedness.

Any amounts remaining in such designated \n     fund after 5 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act shall be applied to the Federal deficit or, if there is \n     no Federal deficit, to reducing the Federal debt.\n       (g) Nonsupplanting Requirement.--Funds made available under \n     this Act to units of local government shall not be used to \n     supplant State or local funds, but shall be used to increase \n     the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds made \n     available under this Act, be made available from State or \n     local sources.\n       (h) Matching Funds.--The Federal share of a grant received \n     under this Act may not exceed 90 percent of the costs of a \n     program or proposal funded under this Act. No funds provided \n     under this Act may be used as matching funds for any other \n     Federal grant program.\n       Sec. 803. Authorization of Appropriations.

To be eligible to \n     receive a grant with amounts set aside under this subsection, \n     an Indian tribal government shall submit to the Attorney \n     General an application in such form and containing such \n     information as the Attorney General may by regulation \n     require.\n       (d) Unavailability and Inaccuracy of Information.--\n       (1) Data for states.--For purposes of this section, if data \n     regarding part 1 violent crimes in any State for the 3 most \n     recent calendar years is unavailable, insufficient, or \n     substantially inaccurate, the Director shall utilize the best \n     available comparable data regarding the number of violent \n     crimes for such years for such State for the purposes of \n     allocation of any funds under this Act.\n       (2) Possible inaccuracy of data for units of local \n     government.--In addition to the provisions of paragraph (1), \n     if the Director believes that the reported rate of part 1 \n     violent crimes or legal expenditure information for a unit of \n     local government is insufficient or inaccurate, the Director \n     shall--\n       (A) investigate the methodology used by such unit to \n     determine the accuracy of the submitted data; and\n       (B) when necessary, use the best available comparable data \n     regarding the number of violent crimes or legal expenditure \n     information for such years for such unit of local government.\n       Sec. 806.

Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the \n     United States are resources of substantial ecological, \n     scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;\n       (2) whale populations--\n       (A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;\n       (B) are the subject of intense research;\n       (C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale watching \n     tourist industry that provides the public an opportunity to \n     enjoy and learn about great whales and the ecosystems of \n     which the whales are a part; and\n       (D) are of importance to Native Americans for cultural and \n     subsistence purposes;\n       (3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, \n     and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale \n     (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;\n       (4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, \n     commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other \n     recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale \n     populations adversely;\n       (5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard \n     mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, \n     and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of \n     whales may affect whale populations adversely;\n       (6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to \n     difficult challenges related to--\n       (A) the migration of whale populations across international \n     boundaries;\n       (B) the size of individual whales, as that size precludes \n     certain conservation research procedures that may be used for \n     other animal species, such as captive research and breeding;\n       (C) the low reproductive rates of whales that require long-\n     term conservation programs to ensure recovery of whale \n     populations; and\n       (D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore waters \n     where undertaking research, monitoring, and conservation \n     measures is difficult and costly;\n       (7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator \n     of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has \n     research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation \n     of whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and\n       (B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine \n     Mammal Commission established under section 201 of the Marine \n     Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related \n     research and management activities under the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n       (8) the funding available for the activities described in \n     paragraph (8) is insufficient to support all necessary whale \n     conservation and recovery activities; and\n       (9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from \n     non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales.\n       Sec. 903.

basis.--For purposes of this title, a worker \n     is employed on a temporary basis where the employment is \n     intended not to exceed 10 months.\n       (3) Assurance of provision of required

registry, post in a conspicuous place a poster to be \n     provided by the Secretary advertising the availability of the \n     registry.\n       (7) Assurance of contacting former workers.--The

To withdraw an application, the employer \n     shall notify the Secretary in writing, and the Secretary \n     shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of such withdrawal \n     notice. An employer who withdraws an application under \n     subsection (a), or on whose behalf an application is \n     withdrawn, is relieved of the obligations undertaken in the \n     application.\n       (2) Limitation.--An application may not be withdrawn while \n     any alien provided status under this title pursuant to such \n     application is employed by the employer.\n       (3) Obligations under other statutes.--Any obligation \n     incurred by an employer under any other law or regulation as \n     a result of recruitment of United States workers under an \n     offer of terms and conditions of employment required as a \n     result of making an application under subsection (a) is \n     unaffected by withdrawal of such application.\n       (e) Review of Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Promptly upon receipt of an application by \n     an employer under subsection (a), the Secretary shall review \n     the application for compliance with the requirements of such \n     subsection.\n       (2) Approval of applications.--If the Secretary determines \n     that an application meets the requirements of subsection (a), \n     and the employer is not ineligible to apply under paragraph \n     (2), (3), or (4) of section 1108(b), the Secretary shall, not \n     later than 7 days after the receipt of such application, \n     approve the application and so notify the employer.\n       (3) Rejection of applications.--If the Secretary determines \n     that an application fails to meet 1 or more of the \n     requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary, as \n     expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than 7 days \n     after the receipt of such application, shall--\n       (A) notify the employer of the rejection of the application \n     and the reasons for such rejection, and provide the \n     opportunity for the prompt resubmission of an amended \n     application; and\n       (B) offer the applicant an opportunity to request an \n     expedited administrative review or a de novo administrative \n     hearing before an administrative law judge of the rejection \n     of the application.\n       (4) Rejection for program violations.--The Secretary shall \n     reject the application of an employer under this section if \n     the employer has been determined to be ineligible to employ \n     workers under section 1108(b) or subsection (b)(2) of section \n     218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1188).\n       Sec. 1105.

The Secretary shall contact such qualified \n     registered workers and determine, in each instance, whether \n     the worker is ready, willing, and able to accept the \n     employer's job opportunity and will commit to work for the \n     employer at the time and place needed. The Secretary shall \n     provide to each worker who commits to work for the employer \n     the employer's name, address, telephone number, the location \n     where the employer has requested that employees report for \n     employment, and a statement disclosing the terms and \n     conditions of employment.\n       (b) Deadline for Completing Search Process; Referral of \n     Workers.--As expeditiously as possible, but not later than 7 \n     days before the date on which an employer desires work to \n     begin, the Secretary shall complete the search under \n     subsection (a) and shall transmit to the employer a report \n     containing the name, address, and social security account \n     number of each registered worker who has committed to work \n     for the employer on the date needed, together with sufficient \n     information to enable the employer to establish contact with \n     the worker. The identification of such registered workers in \n     a report shall constitute a referral of workers under this \n     section.\n       (c) Notice of Insufficient Workers.--If the report provided \n     to the employer under subsection (b) does not include \n     referral of a sufficient number of registered workers to fill \n     all of the employer's job opportunities in the occupation for \n     which the employer applied under section 1104(a), the \n     Secretary shall indicate in the report the number of job \n     opportunities for which registered workers could not be \n     referred, and promptly transmit a copy of the report to the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of State, by electronic or \n     other means ensuring next day delivery.\n       Sec. 1106.

Independent \n     contractors, agricultural associations, and such similar \n     entities shall be subject to a cap on the number of H2-A \n     visas that they may sponsor at the discretion of the \n     Secretary of Labor.\n       (b) Direct Application Upon Failure To Act.--\n       (1) Application to the secretary of state.--If the employer \n     has not received a referral of sufficient workers pursuant to \n     section 1105(b) or a report of insufficient workers pursuant \n     to section 1105(c), by the date that is 7 days before the \n     date on which the work is anticipated to begin, the employer \n     may submit an application for alien workers directly to the \n     Secretary of State, with a copy of the application provided \n     to the Attorney General, seeking the issuance of visas to and \n     the admission of aliens for employment in the job \n     opportunities for which the employer has not received \n     referral of registered workers. Such an application shall \n     include a copy of the employer's application under section \n     1104(a), together with evidence of its timely submission. The \n     Secretary of State may consult with the Secretary of Labor in \n     carrying out this paragraph.\n       (2) Expedited consideration by secretary of state.--The \n     Secretary of State shall, as expeditiously as possible, but \n     not later than 5 days after the employer files an application \n     under paragraph (1), issue visas to, and the Attorney General \n     shall admit, a sufficient number of eligible aliens \n     designated by the employer to fill the job opportunities for \n     which the employer has applied under that paragraph.\n       (c) Redetermination of Need.--\n       (1) Requests for redetermination.--\n       (A) In general.--An employer may file a request for a \n     redetermination by the Secretary of the needs of the employer \n     if--\n       (i) a worker referred from the registry is not at the place \n     of employment on the date of need shown on the application, \n     or the date the work for which the worker is needed has \n     begun, whichever is later;\n       (ii) the worker is not ready, willing, able, or qualified \n     to perform the work required; or\n       (iii) the worker abandons the employment or is terminated \n     for a lawful job-related reason.\n       (B) Additional authorization of admissions.--The Secretary \n     shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     a redetermination is requested under subparagraph (A), submit \n     a report to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \n     providing notice of a need for workers under this subsection.\n       (2) Job-related requirements.--An employer shall not be \n     required to initially employ a worker who fails to meet \n     lawful job-related employment criteria, nor to continue the \n     employment of a worker who fails to meet lawful, job-related \n     standards of conduct and performance, including failure to \n     meet minimum production standards after a 3-day break-in \n     period.\n       (d) Emergency Applications.--Notwithstanding subsections \n     (b) and (c), the Secretary may promptly transmit a report to \n     the Attorney General and Secretary of State providing notice \n     of a need for workers under this subsection for an employer--\n       (1) who has not employed aliens under this title in the \n     occupation in question in the prior year's agricultural \n     season;\n       (2) who faces an unforeseen need for workers (as determined \n     by the Secretary); and\n       (3) with respect to whom the Secretary cannot refer able, \n     willing, and qualified workers from the registry who will \n     commit to be at the employer's place of employment and ready \n     for work within 72 hours or on the date the work for which \n     the worker is needed has begun, whichever is later.\n       (e) Regulations.--The Secretary of State shall prescribe \n     regulations to provide for the designation of aliens under \n     this section.\n       Sec. 1107. Employment Requirements. (a) Required Wages.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section 1104(a) \n     for workers shall offer to pay, and shall pay, all workers in \n     the occupation or occupations for which the employer has \n     applied for workers from the registry, not less (and is not \n     required to pay more) than the greater of the prevailing wage \n     in the occupation in the area of intended employment or the \n     adverse effect wage rate.\n       (2) Payment of prevailing wage determined by a state \n     employment security agency sufficient.--In complying with \n     paragraph (1), an employer may request and obtain a \n     prevailing wage determination from the State employment \n     security agency. If the employer requests such a \n     determination, and pays the wage required by paragraph (1) \n     based upon such a determination, such payment shall be \n     considered sufficient to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reliance on wage survey.--In lieu of the procedure of \n     paragraph (2), an employer\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\n     may rely on other information, such as an employer-generated \n     prevailing wage survey and determination that meets criteria \n     specified by the Secretary.\n       (4) Alternative methods of payment permitted.--\n       (A) In general.--A prevailing wage may be expressed as an \n     hourly wage, a piece rate, a task rate, or other incentive \n     payment method, including a group rate. The requirement to \n     pay at least the prevailing wage in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment does not require an employer to pay by \n     the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed, \n     except that, if the employer adopts a method of pay other \n     than the prevailing rate, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to demonstrate that the employer's method of pay is \n     designed to produce earnings equivalent to the earnings that \n     would result from payment of the prevailing rate.\n       (B) Compliance when paying an incentive rate.--In the case \n     of an employer that pays a piece rate or task rate or uses \n     any other incentive payment method, including a group rate, \n     the employer shall be considered to be in compliance with any \n     applicable hourly wage requirement if the average of the \n     hourly earnings of the workers, taken as a group, the \n     activity for which a piece rate, task rate, or other \n     incentive payment, including a group rate, is paid, for the \n     pay period, is at least equal to the required hourly wage.\n       (C) Task rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``task rate'' means an incentive payment method based on a \n     unit of work performed such that the incentive rate varies \n     with the level of effort required to perform individual units \n     of work.\n       (D) Group rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``group rate'' means an incentive payment method in which the \n     payment is shared among a group of workers working together \n     to perform the task.\n       (b) Requirement To Provide Housing.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section 1104(a) \n     for registered workers shall offer to provide housing at no \n     cost (except for charges permitted by paragraph (5)) to all \n     workers employed in job opportunities to which the employer \n     has applied under that section, and to all other workers in \n     the same occupation at the place of employment, whose \n     permanent place of residence is beyond normal commuting \n     distance.\n       (2) Type of housing.--In complying with paragraph (1), an \n     employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or, in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.\n       (3) Workers engaged in the range production of livestock.--\n     The Secretary shall issue regulations that address the \n     specific requirements for the provision of housing to workers \n     engaged in the range production of livestock.\n       (4) Limitation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require an employer to provide or secure housing \n     for persons who were not entitled to such housing under the \n     temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June \n     1, 1986.\n       (5) Charges for housing.--\n       (A) Utilities and maintenance.--An employer who provides \n     housing to a worker pursuant to paragraph (1) may charge an \n     amount equal to the fair market value (but not greater than \n     the employer's actual cost) for maintenance and utilities, or \n     such lesser amount as permitted by law.\n       (B) Security deposit.--An employer who provides housing to \n     workers pursuant to paragraph (1) may require, as a condition \n     for providing such housing, a deposit not to exceed $50 from \n     workers occupying such housing to protect against gross \n     negligence or willful destruction of property.\n       (C) Damages.--An employer who provides housing to workers \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) may require a worker found to have \n     been responsible for damage to such housing which is not the \n     result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (6) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (A) In general.--In lieu of offering housing pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), the \n     employer may on a case-by-case basis provide a reasonable \n     housing allowance. An employer who offers a housing allowance \n     to a worker pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be deemed \n     to be a housing provider under section 203 of the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) \n     solely by virtue of providing such housing allowance.\n       (B) Limitation.--At any time after the date that is 3 years \n     after the effective date of this title, the governor of the \n     State may certify to the Secretary that there is not \n     sufficient housing available in an area of intended \n     employment of migrant farm workers or aliens provided status \n     pursuant to this title who are seeking temporary housing \n     while employed at farm work. Such certification may be \n     canceled by the governor of the State at any time, and shall \n     expire after 5 years unless renewed by the governor of the \n     State.\n       (C) Effect of certification.--If the governor of the State \n     makes the certification of insufficient housing described in \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to an area of employment, \n     employers of workers in that area of employment may not offer \n     the housing allowance described in subparagraph (A) after the \n     date that is 5 years after such certification of insufficient \n     housing for such area, unless the certification has expired \n     or been canceled pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (D) Amount of allowance.--The amount of a housing allowance \n     under this paragraph shall be equal to the statewide average \n     fair market rental for existing housing for nonmetropolitan \n     counties for the State in which the employment occurs, as \n     established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     pursuant to section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit \n     and an assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Transportation.--\n       (1) To place of employment.--A worker who is referred to a \n     job opportunity under section 1105(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this title, who completes 50 percent of the \n     period of employment of the job opportunity for which the \n     worker was hired, may apply to the employer for reimbursement \n     of the cost of the worker's transportation and subsistence \n     from the worker's permanent place of residence (or place of \n     last employment, if the worker traveled from such place) to \n     the place of employment to which the worker was referred \n     under section 1105(a).\n       (2) From place of employment.--A worker who is referred to \n     a job opportunity under section 1105(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this title, who completes the period of \n     employment for the job opportunity involved, may apply to the \n     employer for reimbursement of the cost of the worker's \n     transportation and subsistence from the place of employment \n     to the worker's permanent place of residence.\n       (3) Limitation.--\n       (A) Amount of reimbursement.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the amount of reimbursement provided under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) to a worker or alien shall not exceed \n     the lesser of--\n       (i) the actual cost to the worker or alien of the \n     transportation and subsistence involved; or\n       (ii) the most economical and reasonable transportation and \n     subsistence costs that would have been incurred had the \n     worker or alien used an appropriate common carrier, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (B) Distance traveled.--No reimbursement under paragraph \n     (1) or (2) shall be required if the distance traveled is 100 \n     miles or less.\n       (d) Continuing Obligation To Employ United States \n     Workers.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer that applies for registered \n     workers under section 1104(a) shall, as a condition for the \n     approval of such application, continue to offer employment to \n     qualified, eligible United States workers who are referred \n     under section 1105(b) after the employer receives the report \n     described in section 1105(b).\n       (2) Limitation.--An employer shall not be obligated to \n     comply with paragraph (1)--\n       (A) after 50 percent of the anticipated period of \n     employment shown on the employer's application under section \n     1104(a) has elapsed; or\n       (B) during any period in which the employer is employing no \n     aliens in the occupation for which the United States worker \n     was referred; or\n       (C) during any period when the Secretary is conducting a \n     search of a registry for job opportunities in the occupation \n     and area of intended employment to which the worker has been \n     referred, or other occupations in the area of intended \n     employment for which the worker is qualified that offer \n     substantially similar terms and conditions of employment.\n       (3) Limitation on requirement to provide housing.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an \n     employer to whom a registered worker is referred pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) may provide a reasonable housing allowance to \n     such referred worker in lieu of providing housing if the \n     employer does not have sufficient housing to accommodate the \n     referred worker and all other workers for whom the employer \n     is providing housing or has committed to provide housing.\n       (4) Referral of workers during 50-percent period.--The \n     Secretary shall make all reasonable efforts to place a \n     registered worker in an open job acceptable to the worker, \n     including available jobs not listed on the registry, before \n     referring such worker to an employer for a job opportunity \n     already filled by, or committed to, an alien admitted \n     pursuant to this title.\n       Sec. 1108. Enforcement and penalties. (a) Enforcement \n     Authority.--\n       (1) Investigation of complaints.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a process \n     for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints \n     respecting an employer's failure to meet a condition \n     specified in section 1104 or an employer's misrepresentation \n     of material facts in an application under that section. \n     Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or any \n     organization (including bargaining representatives). No \n     investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint \n     concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the \n     complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date \n     of the failure or misrepresentation, as the case may be. The \n     Secretary shall conduct an investigation under\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\n     this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that \n     such a failure or misrepresentation has occurred.\n       (B) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this title limits \n     the authority of the Secretary of Labor to conduct any \n     compliance investigation under any other labor law, including \n     any law affecting migrant and seasonal agricultural workers \n     or, in the absence of a complaint under this paragraph, under \n     this title.\n       (2) Written notice of finding and opportunity for appeal.--\n     After an investigation has been conducted, the Secretary \n     shall issue a written determination as to whether or not any \n     violation described in subsection (b) has been committed. The \n     Secretary's determination shall be served on the complainant \n     and the employer, and shall provide an opportunity for an \n     appeal of the Secretary's decision to an administrative law \n     judge, who may conduct a de novo hearing.\n       (b) Remedies.--\n       (1) Back wages.--Upon a final determination that the \n     employer has failed to pay wages as required under this \n     section, the Secretary may assess payment of back wages due \n     to any United States worker or alien described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     employed by the employer in the specific employment in \n     question. The back wages shall be equal to the difference \n     between the amount that should have been paid and the amount \n     that actually was paid to such worker.\n       (2) Failure to pay wages.--Upon a final determination that \n     the employer has failed to pay the wages required under this \n     title, the Secretary may assess a civil money penalty up to \n     $1,000 for each failure, and may recommend to the Attorney \n     General the disqualification of the employer from the \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     for a period of time determined by the Secretary not to \n     exceed 1 year.\n       (3) Other violations.--If the Secretary, as a result of an \n     investigation pursuant to a complaint, determines that an \n     employer covered by an application under section 1104(a) \n     has--\n       (A) filed an application that misrepresents a material \n     fact; or\n       (B) failed to meet a condition specified in section 1104,\n\n     the Secretary may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed \n     $1,000 for each violation and may recommend to the Attorney \n     General the disqualification of the employer for substantial \n     violations in the employment of any United States workers or \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of time \n     determined by the Secretary not to exceed 1 year. In \n     determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed \n     or whether to recommend disqualification of the employer, the \n     Secretary shall consider the seriousness of the violation, \n     the good faith of the employer, the size of the business of \n     the employer being charged, the history of previous \n     violations by the employer, whether the employer obtained a \n     financial gain from the violation, whether the violation was \n     willful, and other relevant factors.\n       (4) Program disqualification.--\n       (A) 3 years for second violation.--Upon a second final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this title or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of 3 years.\n       (B) Permanent for third violation.--Upon a third final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this section or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General, and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from any subsequent \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (c) Role of Associations.--\n       (1) Violation by a member of an association.--An employer \n     on whose behalf an application is filed by an association \n     acting as its agent is fully responsible for such \n     application, and for complying with the terms and conditions \n     of this title, as though the employer had filed the \n     application itself. If such an employer is determined to have \n     violated a requirement of this section, the penalty for such \n     violation shall be assessed against the employer who \n     committed the violation and not against the association or \n     other members of the association.\n       (2) Violation by an association acting as an employer.--If \n     an association filing an application on its own behalf as an \n     employer is determined to have committed a violation under \n     this subsection which results in disqualification from the \n     program under subsection (b), no individual member of such \n     association may be the beneficiary of the services of an \n     alien described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in an occupation in which \n     such alien was employed by the association during the period \n     such disqualification is in effect, unless such member files \n     an application as an individual employer or such application \n     is filed on the employer's behalf by an association with \n     which the employer has an agreement that the employer will \n     comply with the requirements of this title.\n       Sec. 1109.

Res. 240\n\n       Whereas in 1975, the Pathet Lao party supplanted the \n     existing Lao government and the Lao Royal Family, and \n     established a ``people's democratic republic'', in violation \n     of the 1962 Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and its \n     Protocol, as well as the 1973 Vientiane Agreement on Laos;\n       Whereas since the 1975 overthrow of the existing Lao \n     government, Laos has been under the sole control of the Lao \n     People's Democratic Party;\n       Whereas the present Lao Constitution provides for human \n     rights protection for the Lao people, and Laos is a signatory \n     to international agreements on civil and political rights;\n       Whereas Laos has become a member of the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations, which calls for the creation of open \n     societies in each of its member states by the year 2020;\n       Whereas despite that, the State Department's ``Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1997'' notes that the \n     government has only slowly eased restrictions on basic \n     freedoms and begun codification of implementing legislation \n     for rights stipulated in the Lao Constitution, and continues \n     to significantly restrict the freedoms of speech, assembly, \n     and religion; and\n       Whereas on January 30, 1998, the Lao government arrested \n     and detained forty-four individuals at a Bible study meeting \n     in Vientiane and on March 25 sentenced thirteen Christians \n     from the group to prison terms of three to five years for \n     ``creating divisions among the people, undermining the \n     government, and accepting foreign funds to promote \n     religion'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     present government of Laos should--\n       (1) respect international norms of human rights and \n     democratic freedoms for the Lao people, and fully honor its \n     commitments to those norms and freedoms as embodied in its \n     constitution and international agreements, and in the 1962 \n     Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and its Protocol and \n     the 1973 Vientiane Agreement on Laos;\n       (2) issue a public statement specifically reaffirming its \n     commitment to protecting religious freedom and other basic \n     human rights; [and]\n       (3) fully institute a process of democracy, human rights, \n     and openly-contested free and fair elections in Laos, and \n     ensure specifically that the National Assembly elections--\n     currently scheduled for 2002--are openly contested[.]; and\n       (4) allow access for international human rights monitors, \n     including the International Committee of the Red Cross to Lao \n     prisons, and to all regions of the country to investigate \n     allegations of human rights abuses, including those against \n     the Hmong people, when requested.\n\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.
