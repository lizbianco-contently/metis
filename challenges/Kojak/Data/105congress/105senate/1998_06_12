Mr. President, I want to take a moment or two to talk \nabout an issue that is related to the health and well-being of our \nfellow citizens--the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which I \nthink cries out for action in these next very few days.\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Patients' Bill of Rights is not on the majority \nleader's list of bills to be considered. The majority leader has made \navailable to the Members which pieces of legislation he is going to \ncall up to the floor of the Senate over the period of these next few \nweeks until the Fourth of July break, then the period of July and then \ncoming into the time that we will be meeting in September. There is a \nwhole series of bills on that list, but one that is missing and one \nthat cries out for action as well is the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nwant to have the opportunity to debate and consider it, but we are \nunable to either get a markup of the legislation in our Human Resources \nCommittee, the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, or on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. And that is, I think, unacceptable. We are not able \nto have it considered--not this month, not next month, not for the \nremainder of this Congress. Evidently, he stands shoulder to shoulder \nwith the guardians of the status quo who want to continue the health \ninsurance abuses. Protecting patients may not be on the majority \nleader's priority list, but it is on the priority list of American \nfamilies. And it is on the priority list of more than 100 organizations \nof doctors, nurses and patients who wrote Leader Lott and Speaker \nGingrich yesterday asking that this legislation be considered.\n  I believe this is on the priority list of a majority of Members of \nthe Senate and House--a bipartisan majority that want to protect \nfamilies, not the profits of the insurance companies. Our leader on \nthis side of the aisle, Tom Daschle, has said that we will offer the \nPatients' Bill of Rights on the first available appropriate vehicle. \nThe American people deserve action.\n  The American people deserve to have their health care decisions \ndecided by the doctors and the medical profession rather than the \naccountants for the insurance industry. We have had over the period of \nthese past weeks series after series of incidents of how our fellow \ncitizens' lives have been lost or permanently damaged because of our \nfailure to address this particular issue. The President last year \ncalled forth a commission, which was bipartisan, which made unanimous \nrecommendations--Republican and Democrat alike.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which has been introduced \nby Senator Daschle and which I have been honored to cosponsor with a \nnumber of our colleagues, basically reflects the judgment put forward \nby that bipartisan group of outstanding, thoughtful men and women who \nare a part of our health care system. We here in this body should \naddress this issue, and we will. We are giving as much notice as \npossible to the leaders that this is an issue that is not going to go \naway. We are going to address it. We would vastly prefer addressing it \nin a way that will accommodate the kind of debate and discussion this \nissue deserves, but if we are not given that kind of assurance, if we \nare not given time to address this issue, then we will use whatever \nparliamentary means we must because the American people expect it.\n  This is a measure of enormous importance in protecting the health and \nthe well-being of families in this country. Families that are facing \nmedical crises, as I mentioned, should have these decisions decided by \nthe health professions. They ought to be able to get the specialists \nthey need. If it is, in a woman's case, a gynecologist or obstetrician, \nthey ought to be able to call on and get the kind of specialty care \nthey need. Women in our society ought to be able to participate in \nclinical trials, not be denied some of the best that is available out \nthere that offers, in many instances, the opportunity for real hope of \na possible cure or a significant improvement in their well-being. They \nshould not be denied that. They are denied that in too many instances \ntoday.\n  Newborn children ought to be guaranteed they are going to be able to \nget the pediatric specialists who can help guide a newborn child or a \nbaby to be able to deal with some of those extraordinary challenges \nthat are evidenced in the first days and weeks of life. We ought to \nprohibit the kind of gag orders that are out there today in so many \ninstances where doctors who are trying to practice their medicine are \ndenied the opportunity to provide the whole range of choices and \noptions to their patients and they are prohibited because of the HMO's \ndecision.\n  We want to eliminate the kinds of incidents that have been reported \non the floor of the Senate where ambulances will drive by the emergency \nroom of a particular hospital and take someone who is in need of \nemergency treatment to a distant hospital because the HMO is not going \nto reimburse that individual for the treatment and emergency services \nat that particular hospital. That makes no common sense, and it does \nnot make any sense even on the bottom line for these companies.\n  These kinds of things are happening every single day, and every \nsingle day we delay the debate, discussion, and conclusion of this \nlegislation, the health of Americans across this country is being \ncompromised. That is wrong.\n  We have had bipartisan support for this legislation. The two doctors \nin the House of Representatives, Republicans, have both supported a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They are urging that we take action. I \ncommend them for their courage and for their leadership. It is \nimperative that we move ahead and take action in the very near future. \nEvery day that goes on and we fail to do so, thousands of families are \nbeing put at risk. I hope that on the first vehicle after we conclude \nthis legislation we will have an opportunity to address it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6273-8", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOBACCO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see our colleague and friend from \nArizona in the Chamber at this time. I just want to join with the \nothers in commending him for his leadership on this issue, on tobacco \nlegislation.

I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind \nremarks. As always, I am very appreciative. Sometimes, as he knows, it \nhelps me a little more if he criticizes me from time to time, which he \nalso does from time to time. I thank Senator Kennedy for his \ninvolvement in this issue. He has been in the Chamber talking about it \nquite a bit. Obviously, Senator Kennedy has not agreed with me on \ncertain aspects of the bill, but we are in agreement--in fact, I think \nit is important that those who watch this debate understand that we are \nall interested, on both sides of the aisle, in trying to resolve this \nissue because we are concerned about our children and the fact that, as \nwe know, teenage smoking in this country is on the rise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6274-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6274-S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROGRESS ON THE TOBACCO BILL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator Reed, and I \nwill be brief because I know he wants to discuss his amendment further.\n  Later on, Senator Gramm will come to propose his amendment. I \nunderstand that Senator Gramm has to go to the dentist so he perhaps \nmay not be in his usual sunny, rosy mood as he usually is when he comes \nto the floor, especially debating this issue, but I am told that he \nwill come later this morning to propose his amendment which we do plan \nto vote on Monday, sometime after 5 o'clock, I believe is the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Again, because of headlines that I have seen this morning and \ncomments in the various newspapers about the attitude that some have \ntaken towards the legislation, I would like to review where we have \ncome and where we are.\n  Yesterday, we made further progress. We are at the point wherein I \nbelieve we can and should finish our business expeditiously. I say that \nfor two reasons. One is the progress that we have made, but also we are \nall aware now, as we have been on this bill for 3 weeks--and we are \ngoing to be on it next week. I will have to ask somebody to look up \nwhen was the last time we have spent\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\n4 weeks on a single piece of legislation, but it is not very often, \nobviously.\n  Mr. President, I think the point here is that we have been 3 weeks \ndebating this bill. We have debated many aspects of it, some aspects of \nit, in the case of attorneys' fees, more than once, and that may be \nrevisited again. But let us look at what we have done. We have provided \ncritical funding for ground-breaking health research to find new \ntreatment and cures for killer diseases including cancer and heart and \nlung diseases. These initiatives obviously are supported on both sides \nof the aisle. It includes assistance to our Nation's veterans who \nsuffer from smoking-related illness.\n  Mr. President, I thought one of the least laudatory things that took \nplace in the ISTEA process was that we basically, at least at one \npoint, declared that veterans who smoked while they were in the service \nwere guilty of gross misconduct. I still find that unbelievable, since \nwe all know that veterans and members of the Armed Forces were \nencouraged to smoke. Tobacco was provided along with meals--smoke \nbreaks. We all know that smoking was encouraged. In this bill, now we \nare going to earmark $3 billion to try to treat veterans who have \nincurred tobacco-related illnesses. I think that is very important, \nthat they receive that assistance. I think it has to be one of our \nhighest priorities.\n\n  We have included a major antidrug effort to attack the serious threat \nposed by illegal drugs, both through prevention education as well as \ninterdiction. By the way, that is a Republican amendment, a \nconservative amendment, and one that was approved by both sides of the \naisle because of the importance that the American people feel is \nassociated with illegal drugs.\n  It now contains one of the largest tax decreases in many years, a \nnearly $200 billion tax cut that would eliminate the marriage penalty \nfor low- and moderate-income Americans and achieve 100 percent \ndeductibility of health insurance for self-employed individuals. I \nthink most of us on both sides of the aisle believe the marriage \npenalty is unfair and that low-income Americans should be the first \nones to receive relief. We think it is unfair for companies and \ncorporations to have tax deductibility for their health care insurance \nyet individuals do not.\n  I think it is important that we understand, also, when we are talking \nabout taxes on the American people, that today $50 billion of America's \ntax dollars go to treat tobacco-related illnesses, almost $455 per \ntaxpaying household in every year. It provides the opportunity to \nsettle 36 pending State cases collectively, efficiently, and in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I also want to mention again, some are of the impression that if this \nbill leaves the floor of the Senate, it disappears --as some, I am \ntold, especially in the other body, would like to see happen. But there \nwould still be 37 States that go to court. There will still be enormous \nlegal fees. There will still be incredibly high settlements. In \nMinnesota, it was a $6.5 billion settlement, which was $2.5 billion \nabove what was agreed to in the June 20 agreement. Just a few days ago, \nan individual won a court case that included punitive damages. There \nare literally thousands and thousands of cases lined up to go to court. \nMr. President, those who believe that somehow this issue will not go \non--the question is: Where does it go on? Does it go on in every \ncourtroom in America?\n  Does it go on in States, 37 of them now--and I cannot imagine the \nremaining 10 of the 40 that did not enter into agreement between the \nattorneys general and the industry will not join sooner or later. Would \nthat not continue, in fact would that not accelerate? The attorneys \ngeneral tell me they are just waiting to see what we do.\n  There is a settlement in Mississippi. There is a settlement in \nFlorida. There is a settlement in Minnesota. They entail billions and \nbillions of dollars. What about the tax? According to reliable \npublications, the price of a pack of cigarettes just went up 5 cents \nbecause of the Minnesota settlement. Does anyone believe that when they \nmake these massive payments the cost is not passed on to the consumer?\n  So I want to remind everybody, we are coming up on a crucial week. It \nis hard for me to imagine that we would continue on this legislation \nfor very much longer. We can either move forward to a conclusion, \nbecause we have addressed most of the issues--the farm issue is still \nout there and we need to get a reasonable resolution of it--but for the \nlife of me, I do not know of another major issue associated with this \nlegislation. There may be substitutes that refine it, or even change it \nsubstantially, but the general outlines of the legislation we all know. \nSo we are either going to move forward and cloture will be invoked, \nwhich puts us on autopilot to completion, or we will not.\n  I am not an expert on tobacco. I am not an expert on public health, \nnor have I ever claimed to be. I claim some expertise on national \ndefense and security issues. I claim some expertise on \ntelecommunications, aviation--other issues. I don't claim expertise on \nthis. But I was asked by the leadership to move a bill through the \nCommerce Committee. We did, with a 19 to 1 vote. Then the majority \nleader scheduled the bill to come to the floor. I did not. I didn't \nmake the scheduling decisions. Obviously, since the legislation went \nthrough the committee which I chair, I am the manager of this bill. I \ndo not seek any sympathy for the fact that I have been criticized by \nboth sides of the political spectrum rather severely, including a $100 \nmillion, so I am told, tobacco advertising campaign. But I do believe \nthat all of us have the right to expect now to move to a conclusion to \nthis issue. That conclusion is either a final passage or, somehow, the \nbill leaves the floor--although I am not sure my friends on the other \nside of the aisle would do so with alacrity.\n  But if the decision is made, or if we are unable to move forward, \nplease, let no one be under the illusion that the issue is going away \nif it leaves the floor of the U.S. Senate. There will be a myriad of \nlawsuits. There will be incredible activity in the courts of America. \nAnd to those who are concerned about lawyers getting rich, I guarantee, \nthey will get a lot richer under those circumstances than under ours. \nBut that doesn't bother me. The thing that bothers me is, if we do not \nmove forward, as I mentioned the other day, there are winners and \nlosers; and the winners will, obviously, be the tobacco companies. They \nwill have gotten a significant return from their $100 million ad \ncampaign. The losers may be me, maybe even the Senator from \nMassachusetts, but the real losers will be the children of America.\n\n  Today, 3,000 kids start smoking. One thousand of them will die early. \nTomorrow, the same, and the next day, the same, and it is on the rise. \nWe will address, as a nation, the issue of tobacco and the issue of \nkids smoking. There is no doubt of that in my mind, because of the \nobligation we have. It is a question of how, and when. By moving this \nlegislation forward, we can do it sooner rather than later. I am more \nthan willing to stay on this floor all summer, if necessary. But I do \nnot think we can afford to do that, because of the compelling \nlegislation that we have to achieve legislative results on by the \nbeginning of October when, there is no doubt in my mind, given the fact \nthat it is an even-numbered year, we will go out of session.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to recognize that we are now reaching \na point, next week, where we either have to move forward or not. I will \nabide by the will of the majority and what the leadership on both sides \nof this body decide. I will regret it, obviously, if we do not move \nforward. But I also will far, far more regret the effect that it will \nhave on the children of America.\n  I note the presence of my friend from Massachusetts as well as the \nSenator from Rhode Island, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6274-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the plan this morning is for us to \nhave the Senator from Rhode Island proceed on the amendment that he \nlaid down last night. And subsequent to that, the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, will debate his amendment for a period of time.\n  Let me just say, for a couple of minutes before we proceed --I want \nto pick up on what the Senator from Arizona said--this will close the \nthird week of effort on this bill. Obviously, next week will be \ncritical. We have dealt with three or four of the most contentious \nissues. We visited the issue of attorneys' fees twice now, \nnotwithstanding the fact that no attorney has been paid the fees that \nhave been thrown around on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In every \nState, those fees are being renegotiated, they are being subject to \narbitration, subject to court decision, but we revisited that twice.\n  We had a spirited and important debate on the subject of liability. \nIn fact, the bill, as brought to the floor, was changed by those who \nwanted to have a stronger section, and that is the will of the Senate \nworking its way. The look-back provisions were strengthened by the will \nof the Senate. So the bill has, in some respects, been strengthened \nfrom the bill that was brought to the floor.\n  In addition to that, we have had a very long and contentious debate \non the subject of how the money would be spent. The Senate, again, \nspoke by deciding that a significant component of that fund will go \nback to the American people in the form of tax relief for the marriage \npenalty.\n  In addition to that, the Senate spoke on the issue of drugs, and a \nvery significant measure was incorporated where, again, a certain \nproportion of the revenues that will come from the increase of the \nprice of cigarettes is going to go to help fight the war on drugs. I \nmight add, the war on drugs is, in fact, the same as the war on \ntobacco, because tobacco is an addictive substance that kills people. \nIn this legislation, we are seeking to have the Food and Drug \nAdministration have the capacity to regulate it, and that is in the \nbill.\n  That is an important measure for America, that for the first time the \nFDA will be given the capacity to undertake important regulatory \nefforts with respect to the use of tobacco. All of that is now \ncontained in this legislation.\n  We hear talk that there are a couple of substitutes floating around \nout there. I ask that those who have a substitute to come forward with \nthem perhaps on Monday or Tuesday, and we will be able to move forward \nwith respect to the substitutes if, in fact, they really do exist.\n  In addition to that, we have a major contentious issue left at some \npoint in time to deal with, which is how to help the farmers. I am \ncertainly particularly sensitive with respect to the Senator from \nKentucky and the Senator from South Carolina and the Senators from \nVirginia and others who are concerned about what happens to those who \nare impacted by a decision that the U.S. Government may take.\n  Traditionally, we have tried to help people who are impacted \neconomically negatively as a consequence of decisions that we make that \nsuddenly come in and change their lives. I have always thought that is \nappropriate. I fought to do that, whether it was people in the Midwest \nor the South or the West. An example is the fishermen of New England \nwho were adversely impacted by Government decisions that were made on \nwhether or not they could fish the Georges Bank. When we took the \nGeorges Bank away from them for a period of time, we tried to provide \neconomic assistance. We provided, for the first time, a buyout program \nfor some of the fishing vessels in order to help them deal with that \nissue.\n\n  I might add, we are not the first country to do that. Great Britain, \nNorway and Iceland where they tried to regulate fishing, they also \nprovided significant buyout efforts to do that.\n  So it is appropriate for us to try to, in the context of the \nlegislation, deal with the problems of the tobacco farmers.\n  My hope is, Mr. President, that in the next few days, we can do that. \nThe real test before the Senate is very, very simple. There are some \npeople who seem prepared and satisfied with the notion that we can have \nthe status quo be the victor here; that we can leave the tobacco \ncompanies without any Federal settlement, without any global \nsettlement, and that the Senate can somehow walk away from the children \nof America and have done well by the country.\n  The only people who will benefit by that will be the tobacco \ncompanies. Those are the only people who will benefit, and I am not so \nsure, given the jury verdict in Florida 2 days ago, and given the size \nof the settlements that have taken place in Minnesota and elsewhere, \nthat they will actually wind up doing that well because, in the end, \nthe lawsuits will proliferate. We may well wind up as we were with the \nasbestos companies where all of a sudden there is nothing left, and we \ndon't have a tobacco cessation program, we don't have \ncounteradvertising, we don't have any of the restraints that the FDA \ncan impose, but at the same time nor do we have order within the \nprocess by which these companies are going to be sued. I think, in the \nend, nobody benefits from that--nobody benefits.\n  What is very, very clear is that during that period of time, a lot \nmore young children in America will be subjected to the same barrage of \nopportunities to pick up a cigarette and get hooked and ultimately die \nprematurely of it as they are today.\n  During the time this debate has taken place, more than 60,000 \nchildren have started smoking, and we all know that 20,000 or so of \nthem are going to die prematurely as a result of the habit they now \nhave. We know to a certainty that 86 percent of all the people who \nsmoke in America began as teenagers, and we know to a certainty if you \nraise the price and simultaneously have concerted efforts to reach \nthose children, you will reduce the number of people who smoke.\n  If you reduce the number of people who smoke, you will give America a \ntax cut, because every American today is paying a very significant \namount of their income to cover the health care costs of a nation that \npays for people who are for a long time hooked up to tubes or require \noxygen or suffer long-term stays in hospitals as a result of the \ndiseases they get, whether it is cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the \nthroat, cancer of the larynx, kidney problems, heart problems, \nemphysema--all of these are costly to America. That is the tax on \nAmerica. And if we want a tax cut, the way to get that tax cut is to \npass tobacco legislation.\n  The only benefit of not passing it would be to keep the tobacco \ncompanies liberated to pursue the policies of predatory practice which \nthey have pursued that we now know to a certainty over the last years.\n  I hope we are going to vote on this next week. I hope we can have \ncloture on this next week. I hope the majority leader will join us next \nweek by offering a cloture motion and bringing the Senate together to \ncomplete its important task of reducing teenage smoking in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I listened to the statements of the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island and\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\nthe Senator from Massachusetts. I am struck, because I think an awful \nlot of people become confused about what this bill is. In part, that \nconfusion comes as a result of a substantial amount of expenditures by \nthe tobacco companies saying to citizens of this country that this bill \nis a tax increase.\n  I heard the last few words the Senator from Massachusetts was saying. \nI believe he was saying this bill is not a tax increase; is that what \nthe Senator from Massachusetts was saying? As I understand it, the \nunderlying bill, prior to it being amended by the Senator from Texas, \nwho has been arguing essentially that it is a tax increase, because he \nis using the same language the tobacco companies are using on \ntelevision--that it is a tax increase; thus, we should have a tax cut \nin here as well.\n  As I understand the underlying bill, it is not a tax increase at \nall. It is a $15 billion payment into a tobacco trust fund by the \ntobacco companies that they agreed to last June 20, 1997, and it phases \nup to a $23 billion fee that the tobacco companies would be paying into \na tobacco trust fund as a result of another settlement which occurred \nin Minnesota where they basically agreed to 50 percent more.\n\n  So this bill is not a tax increase. It is a fee being paid by the \ntobacco companies as a consequence of them now saying that they are \nstipulating in court documents--and the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts knows more about prosecutorial law than I do--because, as \nI understand it, they have stipulated now in court documents that \nnicotine is addictive, that they have been targeting our youth, that \nthey have been failing to disclose all the dangers and risks that are \nassociated with tobacco.\n  So if you want to talk about tax cuts, I would love to come to the \nfloor and argue about cutting the payroll tax. There are lots of \ninequities in our tax system I would love to debate. The distinguished \nSenator from Texas has converted, very intelligently, this debate from \none of trying to help Americans who are addicted to stop smoking--they \nare not just smoking; we now know they are addicted. There is a big \ndifference between just doing something sort of casually and doing what \ntobacco smokers do.\n  Forty-five million Americans--likely a very high percentage of those \nindividuals--are addicted. That means they cannot quit, they have a \nphysical addiction, and when they stop smoking, they have withdrawal \nsymptoms, and they have a very difficult time.\n  There are 330,000 Nebraskans who smoke. They spend $250 million a \nyear on cigarettes every single year. And I see what the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Arizona are trying to \ndo is write a law so that we have resources at the State level to help \nthose who are addicted to stop smoking.\n  Just take Nebraska, I would say. We have $250 million a year being \nspent by 300,000 or so people who smoke. If we are able to get smoking \ncessation programs and educational efforts, that would mean, let us \nsay, $50 million less a year being spent on tobacco as a result of \nhelping people break away from this terrible addiction to nicotine. \nThey break away from that addiction, and $50 million less, that is $250 \nmillion in their pockets.\n  The Senator from Texas is talking about a tax increase. We are trying \nto help decrease expenditures on tobacco. And the more we decrease \nexpenditures on tobacco, the more we get a win-win: Money in the \npockets of our citizens, the people who are addicted, who did not \nrealize that tobacco was addicting; and improve health consequences.\n  I note with great interest that the Chamber of Commerce--U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce--and the National Restaurant Association are opposed to \nthis legislation. They are opposed because they are misinformed, in my \njudgment. I can make the case at home--and intend to make the case at \nhome--to my State chamber of commerce and my State restaurant \nassociation that it is in their interest to reduce the number of \ncitizens in our State who are smoking.\n  Their health insurance costs are going to be lower; their absentee \nrates are going to be lower; their productivity rates are going to be \nhigher. I said yesterday that one of my most conservative business \nfriends will not even hire people who smoke as a consequence of \nunderstanding the costs that are associated with it.\n  I see that my friend from Texas has come to the floor. We perhaps can \nengage in a little colloquy about this, because as I understand this \nlegislation that the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nMassachusetts have brought to the floor, there is a $15 billion fee in \nit phased up to $23 billion that the tobacco industry has agreed to \npay. They agreed to pay $15 billion. And they have agreed in Minnesota \nto pay 50 percent more. As I see it, the more we are successful in \nhelping people stop their smoking, break away from this terrible \naddiction, that is going to make them more prosperous, more healthy, as \na consequence.\n  I have talked, and there are a number of questions in there. I would \nappreciate very much if the Senator from Massachusetts could help me \nunderstand if that isn't what is in this legislation, if that isn't the \nintent of what is in the law as seen by the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I can respond, I do not think the Senator needs a lot \nof help. I think the Senator has adequately--more than adequately--\ndescribed the virtues of what is being attempted here.\n  I just say to the Senator, in my State of Massachusetts we have \ndiscovered, through research, that our addicted citizens are spending \n$1.3 billion a year to try to get unaddicted--$1.3 billion that is \ndiverted from money they could be putting into schools, putting into \ntheir kids' education, that they are paying for nicotine patches, they \nare paying for the gum, for the hypnosis, for counseling. It is an \nextraordinary amount of money.\n\n  This is happening because almost 90 percent of those citizens got \nhooked when the tobacco companies targeted them specifically as \nteenagers. We have now seen--and it is in the record--the degree to \nwhich that targeting was a very purposeful replenishment effort for \nbusiness. They said to themselves, ``We've got to replenish the people \nwho are dying off, and we've got to get these people hooked when they \nare young.''\n  So, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson--their own \ndocuments testify to the degree to which they were targeting teenagers \nin order to get them hooked forever.\n  I do not want to abuse the courtesy of the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwho is expected to proceed forward here. I think he has some time \nproblems, so I do want to allow him to go on with his amendment. And \nthen I know the Senator from Texas is going to go.\n  But the Senator from Nebraska is absolutely correct. The tax cut in \nthis bill comes from the reduction of the cost of health care to all \nAmericans, the reduction in the cost of lost productivity. All the \nthings the Senator from Nebraska has said are correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2702\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I rise to continue my discussion of \nthe amendment I offered last evening, an amendment which would deny the \ntax deduction for advertising expenses for those tobacco companies \nwhich disregard and violate the FDA rule with respect to advertising to \nchildren.\n  This is an amendment that is being cosponsored by my colleagues: \nSenator Boxer, Senator Wyden, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, and \nSenator Conrad.\n  In addition, it has received the widespread support of the public \nhealth community. In a recent editorial in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, Dr. C. Everett Koop, David Kessler, and George \nLundberg wrote about the history of the tobacco industry in the United \nStates. In their words:\n\n       For years, the tobacco industry has marketed products that \n     it knew caused serious disease and death. Yet, it \n     intentionally hid this truth from the public, carried out a \n     deceitful campaign designed to undermine the public's \n     appreciation of these risks, and marketed its addictive \n     products to children.\n\n  Numerous, numerous studies have implicated the tobacco industry's \nadvertising and promotional activities as\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nthe cause of a continued increase in youth smoking in the United \nStates. Research on smoking demonstrates that increases in youth \nsmoking directly coincide with effective tobacco promotional campaigns.\n  My amendment addresses this critical issue in this ongoing debate \nabout how we can control teenage smoking in America. It targets the \nindustry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. It is time for \nCongress to put a stop to the tobacco industry's practice of luring \nchildren into untimely disease and untimely death.\n  This amendment is based on a bill that I introduced earlier this \nyear, along with Senators Boxer, Chafee, and Conrad. I would also like \nto recognize the leadership of many of my colleagues in prior \ncongresses. Senator Harkin, along with former Senator Bill Bradley, has \nmade continuous efforts to try to eliminate in total the tax deduction \nfor tobacco advertising.\n  While I concur with Senator Harkin that this deduction is of \nquestionable value, I would like to emphasize today that my amendment \ndoes not attempt to eliminate the entire deduction for tobacco \nmanufacturers. Indeed, under my amendment, they maintain the deduction \nas long as they do not advertise to children. Eliminating the promotion \nof tobacco products to children is a necessary part of any \ncomprehensive effort to prevent tobacco use by minors. My amendment \noffers a constitutionally sound way to enforce strong tobacco \nadvertising restrictions.\n  Under my amendment, if tobacco manufacturers do not comply with the \nadvertising restrictions promulgated by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the manufacturers' ability to deduct the cost of \nadvertising and promotional expenses will be disallowed in that \nparticular year. The restrictions promulgated by the FDA are \nappropriately tailored to prevent advertising and marketing of tobacco \nproducts to minors.\n  Key components of the FDA regulation include the banning of outdoor \nadvertising within 1,000 feet of a school; black and white text-only \nadvertisements in youth publications--and those are publications which \nhave a readership of more than 15 percent of young people under 18--\nbanning the sale or giveaway of branded items--caps and trinkets, and \nall sorts of T-shirts--and the prohibition of sponsorship of sporting \nor entertainment events by brand name.\n  The FDA has already promulgated these regulations. They are being \ncontested as we speak in the fourth circuit.\n  Today, my amendment offers an additional enforcement mechanism, an \nenforcement mechanism that I think will put real teeth into the \nrestrictions. We will put on notice to the companies that they \nthemselves have to carefully watch what they spend on advertising for \nyoung people. If they fail to adhere to the FDA rules, they will pay, \nand they will pay immediately because they will lose their advertising \ndeduction.\n  Support for this amendment is broad based in the public health \ncommunity. It is supported by Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States. It is supported by the American Lung \nAssociation, by the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, and by the ENACT \nCoalition. This is a coalition comprised of leading public health \ngroups, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart \nAssociation, and many others.\n  The importance of this issue is enormous. The facts speak for \nthemselves. Today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco. \nOne of every three of these long-term users of tobacco will die \nprematurely from diseases related to their tobacco use. Tobacco is also \nclearly a problem that begins with children. Almost 90 percent of those \npeople who smoke today started before they were 18 years old. The \naverage youth smoker in the United States starts at 13 and is a regular \nsmoker by the age of 14\\1/2\\.\n  This is the greatest pediatric health care problem in the United \nStates today. We have not only the opportunity but the obligation to \nstop it. A key component in that campaign to give children a chance to \navoid smoking is effectively controlling advertising aimed at children. \nEach year, 1 million children become regular smokers and one-third of \nthese children will die prematurely of long cancer, emphysema, and \nsimilar tobacco-caused diseases. Unless current trends are reversed, 5 \nmillion children today under the age of 18 will die prematurely from \ntobacco-related diseases.\n  More and more, we are learning that children are being enticed into \nsmoking because of industry advertising and promotional efforts. A \nrecent study by John Pierce and others found evidence that the tobacco \nindustry's advertising and promotional activities actively influenced \nchildren who have never smoked to start smoking. Among the findings, \ntobacco industry promotional activities in the mid-1990s will influence \nalmost 20 percent of those who turn 17 and try smoking. At least 34 \npercent of youthful experimentation with cigarettes is attributed to \nadvertising and promotional activities.\n  This is an industry which has a sordid record when it comes to \ndealing with the children of America. We have to learn from their past \nrecord to adopt appropriate means of controlling their future conduct. \nThey have made money ruthlessly by marketing to children. They have \nshown no concern for the children of America. They have only shown \nconcern for the bottom line. And they will continue to target children \nunless it affects their bottom line.\n  The culture of big tobacco is one that has yielded incredible revenue \nby capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of our children. The story of \ntobacco and their promotional activities is a story of our century and \nbeyond. In the 1920s, the cigarette industry, knowledgeable, of course, \nthat their products were not safe, had the temerity to enlist \nphysicians--or people dressed up like physicians--to be models in their \nadvertising, to suggest that smoking was not only harmless, it was in \nsome way beneficial. Lucky Strikes advertised ``20,679 Physicians Say \nLuckies are Less Irritating'' and ``For Digestion's sake, smoke \nCamels,'' another advertising jingle of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1950, \nthe Federal Trade Commission found that Camel advertising was \ndeceitful, that they were suggesting that their products weren't \nharmful, and they, in fact, took action against them for false and \ndeceptive advertising.\n\n  So for more than 50 years--indeed, for as long as you can recall the \nhistory of the tobacco industry--there has been a constant attempt to \ndeceive the American public about what they are selling. That record is \none that has to be countered by our legislation in this Congress.\n  Today, we have Winston ads that are trying to suggest that tobacco \nproducts are like health foods, proclaiming ``no additives.'' We have a \nnew Camel campaign, ``Live Out Loud,'' which is a not-so-subtle stand \nin for the ``cool'' Joe Camel target of so much criticism.\n  We know from the documents released by the industry itself they \nconsciously, deliberately, and consistently targeted children. In 1973, \na memorandum written by a Claude Teague of RJR said, ``if our Company \nis to survive and prosper, over the long-term we must get our share of \nthe youth market.'' Another memorandum from a vice president of \nmarketing at RJR, in 1974, C.A. Tucker, concluded, ``this young adult \nmarket, the 14-24 age group * * * represent(s) tomorrow's cigarette \nbusiness.'' What responsible group of people would describe 14- and 15-\nyear-olds as ``young adults''? This is what has been going on for years \nnow with respect to the tobacco industry and their conscious, \ndeliberate attempts to entice children to smoke.\n  In 1982, the then-chairman and chief executive officer of R.J. \nReynolds Tobacco Co., Edward Horrigan, testified before the Commerce \nCommittee and tried to dismiss suggestions that they were going after \nchildren by simply saying, ``No''--in his words --``[p]eer pressure and \nnot our advertising provides the impetus for smoking among young \npeople.''\n  Yet, just a few years later, in 1986, a R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel \nadvertising memo said this:\n\n       Camel advertising will be directed toward using peer \n     acceptance/influence to provide the motivation [to] target \n     smokers to select Camel. Specifically, advertising will be \n     developed with the objective of convincing target smokers \n     that by selecting Camel as their usual brand they will \n     project an image that will enhance their acceptance among \n     their peers.\n\n  What could be more cynical, what could be more hypocritical, than an \nindustry objective trying to dismiss their\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\nadvertising, saying it has no effect at this time--it is peer \npressure--and internally, in their boardrooms, consciously plotting to \nuse that peer pressure tied into their advertising to force children to \nsmoke.\n  That is the record of this industry. That is why we are here today to \nenact comprehensive tobacco control legislation. I argue that without \nappropriate restrictions on advertising, it will not be successful.\n  The documents that we have seen from all of these different \nlitigations around the country reveal, time and time again reveal they \nhave consciously targeted the young adult smoking market. A 1987 \ndocument discussed the ``Project LF (Camel Wides), and it states: \n``Project LF is a wider circumference non-menthol cigarette targeted at \nyounger adult male smokers (primarily 13-24 year old male Marlboro \nsmokers.)'' Executives were sitting around in the boardrooms, \nconcocting schemes, so that 13-year-olds will begin to smoke. That is \nwhat the record of the industry is.\n  I am deeply skeptical that this tobacco industry is willing, even \ntoday in the glare of publicity with adverse court rulings, to change \ntheir behavior unless we act appropriately and with great vigor to \nensure that they do what is right and not try to addict children in \nthis country.\n  Every year the industry spends billions and billions of dollars to \nfind new ways to hook kids into smoking. Examples of what they do are \nendless. We know from the research and we know from our own experience \nthat pivotal in the decision of a young person to smoke is the \nadvertising they are seeing constantly. Eighty-six percent of underage \nsmokers prefer one of the three most heavily advertised brands--\nMarlboro, Newport and Camel. That is not a coincidence. That is the \neffect of a repeated, unending assault on their minds and bodies by \ntobacco advertising, aimed at getting them to smoke.\n  One of the advertising campaigns most criticized is the Joe Camel \ncampaign by R.J. Reynolds. When they introduced this campaign, their \nmarket share among underage smokers leaped from 3 percent to 13 percent \nin 3 years--a huge increase. Once you have someone hooked on a brand at \n13 or 14 years old, they will probably be your smokers for life, \nrepresenting to them billions of dollars in profit. They did it \ndeliberately. They did it consciously. They were prepared to accept the \ncriticism because they knew they were hooking these kids, they were \nhooking them for life, and it was going right into their bottom \nline. And although the Congress banned television advertising in 1970, \ntobacco companies routinely circumvent this restriction through the \nsponsorship of events that give their products television exposure. You \ncan see that their advertising expenditures have been exploding over \nthe last several years. As this chart indicates, from 1975 until today, \ntheir advertising expenses have increased tenfold. In 1975, the \nindustry was spending about $491 million a year on advertising.\n\n  In 1995 alone, tobacco manufacturers spent $4.9 billion on \nadvertising and promotional expenses, and we are subsidizing these \nexpenses through the tax deduction. In 1995, American taxpayers \nsubsidized $1.6 billion of these expenses that are used in a concerted, \nconscious effort to hook our kids. We are helping to write the check \nfor that.\n  (Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REED. In effect, we are subsidizing their advertising costs. In \n1995, the amount of our subsidy, the $1.6 billion, paid for all of \ntheir efforts to send coupons, to have multipack promotions, to have \nretail value-added items such as key chains, hats, T-shirts--all the \nthings the kids really like to wear. I don't see many adults running \naround with them, but I see lots of kids with Joe Camel T-shirts, and \nkey chains, and all the cool things they get. In effect, we paid for \nthat through this subsidy.\n  You can see the record on this chart of their expenditures and our \nsupport of those expenditures through this deduction. As I said, they \nare spending a huge amount of money trying to get kids to smoke. In \nironic contrast, we spend a pittance trying to help people who are \nafflicted with the diseases caused by smoking. In 1995, that $4.9 \nbillion was double the amount of money we spent for the National Cancer \nInstitute. It was four times the amount of money we spent for the \nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It represents 40 times what \nwas spent at the National Institutes of Health on lung cancer research.\n  Those are the proportions. That is the huge amount of advertising \nexpenditures that are being bombarded on the American public, but \nparticularly on the children of this country. We know the cost to our \nsociety is significant: $100 billion a year in health costs and lost \nproductivity is estimated. In 1993, health care expenditures directly \ncaused by smoking totaled about $50 billion; 43 percent of those costs \nwere paid for by Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We are paying both ways. We are helping them sell their products, and \nthen we are taking care of the people who are ill because of their \nproducts. We have to do much more. We have to go ahead and ensure that \nthe advertising ban that has been enacted by the Food and Drug \nAdministration is supported with real force and real effect. That is \nthe purpose of my amendment.\n  Of course, any time you talk about a situation where you are \nattempting to affect the commercial speech of anyone in this country, \nyou have to reckon with the first amendment to the Constitution, and I \ndo recognize that.\n  Let me again remind you that the story of the tobacco industry in \nAmerica is a story inextricably linked to advertising. For decades, the \ntobacco industry ingeniously promoted its products and has done so with \ntotal disregard for the health of its customers. The industry relied \nupon image rather than information to sell its product. The tobacco \nindustry has taken an addiction that prematurely kills and dressed it \nup as a glamorous symbol of success in all manner of endeavor. All of \nthis is unsettling, but with the revelation that the industry has \ndeliberately and ruthlessly targeted children, it becomes \nunconscionable, and we should not and need not accept it.\n  Now, as I said, we do and must and should recognize that any time you \nattempt to suggest restraints on commercial speech, you have to reckon \nwith the first amendment. But the amendment I am proposing today \ncombines the narrowly drafted and focused restraints of the FDA rule to \nprevent marketing to children with the recognized and broad-based \nauthority of Congress over the Tax Code to create a provision that \nconforms to the first amendment.\n  First, let's be clear that the Constitution affords a much lesser \ndegree of protection to commercial speech than to other \nconstitutionally guaranteed expression. In 1975, the leading Supreme \nCourt case on the subject of commercial speech essentially said that \nthe Constitution imposed no restraint on Government with regard to \n``purely commercial speech.'' Today, commercial speech may be banned in \nadvertising an illegal product or service, and, unlike fully protected \nspeech, pure speech, it may be banned if it is unfair or deceptive. \nEven when it advertises a legal product and is not unfair or deceptive, \nthe Government may regulate commercial speech more than fully protected \nspeech.\n  The record of the tobacco industry clearly demonstrates that this \nindustry, over decades, has deliberately carried out a scheme to \nviolate the laws of every State in the Union. All 50 States bar the \nsale of tobacco products to minors. But as I have shown in these \ndocuments, those laws were carelessly and callously disregarded by the \nindustry in their attempt to, as they say, ``get the young adult \nmarket''--13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds.\n\n  Since this advertising campaign consciously sought to illegally \nmarket their products to children, there should be no protection. The \nfirst amendment does not give them the right to engage in illegal \nmarketing schemes. Thus, the most basic reason that this amendment will \npass constitutional muster is the fact that it is designed to prevent \ntobacco companies from promoting illegal transactions.\n  Even if one were to invoke the constitutional test applied to the \nlegal sale of commercial products, this would still pass muster. In the \nCentral Hudson case, the Supreme Court established the standards for \nevaluating a purported restraint on commercial speech. As a preliminary \npoint, the Court drew a distinction between legal\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nactivities and unlawful activities or misleading speech.\n  As I have already indicated, if the commercial speech in question \ninvolves unlawful activities or it is misleading, then the Government \nmay restrict it. Or, as the Supreme Court indicated in Central Hudson, \nthere can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of \ncommercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about \nlawful activity.\n  Now, assuming for the sake of argument, despite the rapidly \naccumulating evidence to the contrary, that tobacco advertising would \nbe treated as routine commercial speech and the Court would ignore the \ninherent illegality of their plans to market to children, the proposed \nrestriction still meets the standards of Central Hudson. First, there \nis a substantial governmental interest in restricting advertising aimed \nat minors. Second, the proposed restraints directly advance this \ngovernmental interest. Finally, the proposed legislation is no more \nextensive than necessary to serve this substantial governmental \ninterest.\n  Now, what could be of greater interest to the American people than \nthe prevention of 3,000 children a day from becoming addicted to \ncigarettes? I daresay that every Member of this Senate would concur \nthat this is not only a valid governmental interest, it is a compelling \none--1 million children a year become addicted to cigarettes, and one-\nthird of these children will die prematurely as a result. The FDA has \nconcluded in extensive rule-making that limits on advertising will \navert the addiction of anywhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of \nthese children at risk. Literally, we have it within our power to save \n250,000 children a year from the ravages of smoking. Prevention of \nchildhood smoking is clearly and unequivocally a substantial \ngovernmental interest.\n  The second prong of the Central Hudson test requires a showing that \nthe proposed restraints directly advance this substantial public \ninterest. Perhaps the most compelling evidence to establish this point \nis the behavior of the tobacco industry itself. They certainly feel \nthat advertising and marketing is an important part of their strategy \nto addict children. The industry, overall, spends $5 billion a year on \nadvertising; that is $13 million a day.\n  We know from the internal documents I have shared with you that much \nof this effort is directed at ensnaring children. I can remind you of \nthe numerous documents I have cited. They indicate a deliberate and \ncalculated attempt to addict children. Unless we restrain advertising \ndirected at children, we will never effectively prevent the use of \ntobacco products by children.\n  All of this evidence is substantiated by the research underlying the \nFDA rule. In its rule-making, FDA relied on two major studies \nsummarizing the effects of advertising on youthful tobacco use--the \nstudy of the Institute of Medicine in 1994 and the Surgeon General's \nReport in 1994 concluded that advertising was an important factor in \nyoung people's tobacco use. Moreover, these reports indicated that \nadvertising restrictions must be part of any meaningful approach to \nreduce underage smoking. In promulgating its rule, the FDA declared:\n\n       Collectively, the studies show that children and \n     adolescents are widely exposed to, aware of, respond \n     favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. \n     One study found that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent \n     of 6-year-olds identified Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking. \n     Other studies have shown that young people's exposure to \n     cigarette advertising is positively related to smoking \n     behavior and their intention to smoke.\n\n  All of this shows that the FDA rules and my amendment are directly \nrelated to achieving the substantial government interest.\n  And the final issue that has to be addressed with respect to the \nCentral Hudson test is to ensure that the proposed restrictions are no \nmore extensive than necessary to accomplish the governmental objective. \nIn the realm of commercial speech, the court requires there be a \n``reasonable'' correlation between the proposed restraint and the \npolicy outcome sought.\n  Now, it is important to note that the proposed restrictions under the \nFDA rule do not absolutely prohibit the advertising of tobacco \nproducts. They have been carefully tailored to allow continued \npromotion of cigarettes to adults. Their objective is to prevent \nmarketing to children. The FDA regulations retain the informational \nvalue that such advertising has for adults, but affects in a positive \nway access to these images by children.\n  It is also important to note that we have, over several decades, \ntried other means short of advertising restrictions to stem the \nepidemic of underage smoking. Warning labels have not worked. They are \nignored by children in the clutter of the ``live out loud,'' rock-and-\nroll imagery, or the Joe Camel character, all of those things.\n  In fact, ironically, the only one the warning labels seem to have \nhelped at least for a while is the industry itself, because they use \nthem in their defense to say that smokers assumed the risk when they \npicked up a pack of cigarettes because of that label. We tried to ban \nadvertising on television. That has not worked either.\n  As Chairman Robert Pitofsky of the Federal Trade Commission pointed \nout in his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee:\n\n       After cigarette manufacturers were prohibited from \n     advertising on television and radio in 1969 (a prohibition \n     that was intended, in part, to protect children), they put \n     tens of millions of dollars in print advertising to sell \n     their products. In more recent years, the cigarette \n     manufacturers have shifted an increasing amount of money away \n     from traditional advertising and into sponsorships and so-\n     called ``trinkets and trash''--T-shirts, caps, and other \n     logo-adorned merchandise--that some believe are very \n     attractive to young people.\n\n  We simply cannot rely on the good faith of this industry to do what \nis right. Today, as we debate this legislation, they continue to target \nchildren. Just a few weeks ago I received a letter from a constituent \nin Rhode Island. He wrote me and said:\n\n       As you consider legislation regarding tobacco company \n     advertising aimed at children, I thought you might like to \n     see a mailing piece that my oldest son, Mark, a junior in \n     high school, recently received. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \n     Company evidently got his name because he attended a concert \n     last summer in which the group featured in the advertisement \n     performed. I suspect that the great majority of the audience \n     was under 18 years of age.\n\n  And this is the flier that a high school junior, a 16-year-old child \nreceived in Providence, RI.\n  Here it is: This is the first piece, and this is a very sophisticated \npiece of direct mail. This was individually addressed to the child, not \nto occupant, not to parent. This was individually addressed to him. It \nis his own mail. And we all know, when you are a youngster and you get \nyour own mail, that is a big deal to think that you are so special that \na big company like Brown & Williamson would write to you directly.\n  Here is what it said: ``We Know You Like It Loud,'' the rock concert \nmotive which they might well have sponsored. Again, as Pitofsky pointed \nout, they have shifted a huge amount of money away from the traditional \nadvertising to go into rock concerts and trinkets and direct mail, and \neverything else.\n  And this is the bulk of the advertising: ``You like it loud, and \nvery, very smooth, Kool Milds, Kool Filters. Kick back today and enjoy \nbold taste, refreshing menthol.''\n  And a coupon: ``Relax with Kool and slip into something smooth.''\n  ``Slip into something smooth,'' a lifetime addiction to tobacco. That \nis what they want. It is happening today, directly targeted at \nchildren. That is what we are about in the Chamber. It is not about \ntaxes. It is not about lawyer's fees. It is about an industry that \ncontinues to go after our kids without any letup, ruthlessly, \nrelentlessly, and they are doing it today, and they will continue to do \nit today unless we make them understand. And the only way we do it is \nthrough the bottom line, that they can't keep doing this again and \nagain.\n\n  We have been debating on this floor the last few weeks whether we are \ngoing to increase the price of cigarettes $1.10 or $1.50. What do they \ndo in their promotions? They are cutting a buck. Here is one dollar off \nthe two-pack package. Any style of Kool you want, young man. You are \n16. You should be smoking. We will give you a break.\n  That is what this is about. We want to raise the price per pack \nbecause we don't want kids to go out there and smoke cigarettes. They \nwant to cut\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\ncigarette prices to addict children. It is happening today, shamelessly \nhappening today. We can stop it. We must stop it. We have to go ahead \nand ensure that this type of activity doesn't take place.\n  Now, this whole promotion--and I am not the expert on this. This is \nthe whole rock-and-roll series of concerts that are directed at kids. \nSure, there might be some college kids there, but this is what is hot \nin high school. They want to be grown up. They want to go to the rock \nconcert. They are sponsoring the concerts. They are tracking the kids \ndown afterwards. They are sending them promotional materials. They are \ngiving them coupons. Absolutely shameless. We shouldn't accept it. We \ncan't accept it.\n  Now, the proposed FDA regulations have been carefully tailored to \nprevent this type of activity, to allow them to market to adults, to \nmake conscience choices, that we can't stop, that we don't want to \nstop. But we have to, I think, ensure that they are not allowed to \ncontinue this type of behavior. My amendment will do that.\n  Now, moving away from the issue of the constitutionality, and very \nquickly, with respect to the tax law consequences, the Supreme Court \nhas held that Congress is not required to subsidize first amendment \nrights through a tax deduction, but a first amendment question would \narise if Congress were to invidiously discriminate in its subsidies in \norder to suppress ``dangerous ideas.''\n  Now, the appropriateness of this denial of a deduction which touches \nupon first amendment issues rests fundamentally on the underlying \npropriety of the proposed restraint. And as I indicated, the proposed \nFDA regulations do not ``invidiously discriminate.'' They have been \nnarrowly drafted to conform to the ``commercial speech'' doctrine of \nCentral Hudson. They will, in fact, stand the test of a court.\n  And in addition, denying of a deduction as I propose would not ban \nany speech. The standing bill itself, my amendment, would not require \nthe companies to say anything or refrain from saying anything. But if \nthey violate these rules, they will have to do it on ``their own \nnickel.'' It won't be subsidized to the tune of $1.6 billion a year by \nthe taxpayers of the United States.\n  Let me mention something else which I think is appropriate in this \ncontext. It is that we have to be realistic and understand that this \nindustry has avoided any type of real regulation for as long as we all \ncan remember. There are laws on the books of the FTC for misleading in \nadvertising. And what happens, the FTC brings a case, it takes 2 years \nto go through the administrative appeals, they might get an adverse \ndecision. They will appeal it to the courts, and by that time the \nadvertising campaign is gone anyway. They are not going to run a \ncampaign for 100 years. It is the game they are playing. This approach, \nmy approach will make them each year look at what they have done \nbecause they have to file their taxes. It will put their auditors and \ntheir accountants and their tax attorneys on notice that they can't \nclaim these deductions if they are violating these rules. No messy FDA \nbureaucracy. No FDA agents running around scouring the countryside \nmeasuring the distance between schools and billboards. They are going \nto have to do it. They should do it. This enforcement mechanism, I \nthink, is another positive aspect of this legislation.\n  Now, in another context this Senate has voted to deny tax benefits \nfor those groups that engage in speech activities. The most prominent \none is the fact that we have denied tax-exempt status to nonprofit \ngroups if they engage in lobbying activities. Lobbying activities--\npolitical speech has the strictest scrutiny of the Supreme Court. It is \npure speech, not commercial speech, yet we in our wisdom have said: \nListen, if you are going to use your tax advantage to go ahead and \nengage in lobbying, you lose that tax advantage. If we do that to not-\nfor-profit groups, where we do that to groups that are trying to affect \npositively the health of youth in this country, why should we be \nreluctant to go ahead and deny this group tax deductions if they are \nengaged in this type of shameless behavior? I think we should move \naggressively to do that.\n\n  Let me emphasize my proposal is very narrowly tasked. It is targeted \nvery closely along the lines of the FDA regulations to prevent access \nof children to this type of tobacco advertising.\n  Let me make another point about the context of the legislation and \nhow it fits within the particular McCain bill. I commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his effort toward the goal of this legislation. \nIndeed, his perseverance, his strength, his endurance has carried us \nthis far along, along with many other colleagues. But this legislation \nis designed to prevent children from smoking. It is not about taxes. It \nis not about big government. It is about making the companies stop \nsoliciting kids to smoke.\n  There are two ways in which the bill does it. First, it reaffirms the \nfull authority of the FDA to promulgate these rules. In effect, it \nsupports the FDA's advertising bans that are being tested now by the \nindustry. A second part is a protocol, a contractual relationship \nbetween the industry and the government, which actually imposes further \nrestrictions on what they can do. My amendment affects only the first \npart of the McCain legislation. It would deny tax deductibility if the \nindustry violated the FDA rule. Again, it is narrowly tailored, it is \nconsistent with the Constitution, and it is something that will \neffectively stop the industry from doing what they are doing.\n  We have witnessed, for years and years and years, the industry's \nunrelenting attempts to addict children to nicotine. They are doing it \ntoday. They are doing it through rock concerts, through promotional \ngiveaways, through T-shirts, through every other method of advertising. \nWe know that. We can stop this assault on America's children. We can \nstop it by supporting the FDA rules and we can stop it, I think, much \nmore decisively and definitively by adopting the amendment I propose, \nby telling the tobacco companies very straightforwardly: If you choose \nto advertise to children, you will lose your tax deduction. You will \nfeel it in the bottom line. You will have to pay, as these kids and our \nsociety pay for their addiction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Reed for his leadership \non the amendment that is before the Senate at the present time. He has \nproposed a creative and effective enforcement mechanism to deter \ntobacco industry marketing targeted to children. I strongly support his \namendment to eliminate the tax deduction for tobacco industry \nadvertisements that violate FDA advertising restrictions.\n  Clearly, the tobacco industry should not be marketing its addictive \nproducts to children. For years, Big Tobacco has appealed to children \nthrough its advertising and promotional campaigns. Tobacco advertising \nwas banned from television in the 1970s, but cigarette manufacturers \nhave found new ways to hook kids on their products through colorful \nmagazine advertisements, free t-shirts and caps with brand logos, \nproduct placements on prime-time television shows and in the movies, \nand sponsorship of sports events and cultural events.\n  In fact, studies show that more cigarette ads are placed in stores \nnear schools than in other stores. Ads are put next to the candy \ncounters more often than elsewhere in stores. Displays are set at eye-\nlevel for children. In stores near schools and in neighborhoods with \nlarge numbers of children under 17, there are more tobacco ads outside \nthe store and in the store windows than in cases where schools are \nnearby.\n  Recently in Massachusetts, 3,000 teenagers surveyed stores in their \ncommunities to identify cigarette advertising aimed at children. Stores \nwithin a thousand feet of schools in low-income and minority \nneighborhoods had more cigarette advertising than stores in affluent \ncommunities.\n  According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, children watching the Marlboro Meadowland Auto Race on \ntelevision were exposed to Marlboro ads over 4,700 times in 90 \nminutes--4,700 times in 90 minutes. Cigarette ads are theoretically \nprohibited on television--but the tobacco companies have obviously \nfound a way to get around that prohibition.\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\n  These advertising placements do not happen by accident. Tobacco \ncompanies have consistently targeted children as young as 12--because \nthey know that once children are hooked on cigarettes, they are \ncustomers for life.\n  In fact, a 1996 study in the Journal on Marketing found that \nteenagers are three times as responsible as adults to cigarette \nadvertising.\n  Before the Joe Camel advertising campaign began, less than 0.5 \npercent of young smokers chose Camel. After a few years of intensive \nJoe Camel advertising, Camel's share of the youth market rose to 33 \npercent--33 percent.\n  Some 90 percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before the \nage of 18. If young men and women reach that age without beginning to \nsmoke, it is very likely that they will never take up the habit in \nlater years. And so the industry has cynically conducted its \nadvertising in a way calculated to hook as many children as possible.\n  For at least a generation, Big Tobacco has targeted children with \nbillions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that \npromise popularity, maturity and success for those who begin this \ndeadly habit.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the average \n14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in tobacco advertising--$20 \nbillion--beginning at age 6. It is no coincidence that the three most \nheavily advertised brands are preferred by 80 percent of children--\nMarlboro, Camel, and Newport.\n  A study published in the February 8, 1998 Journal of the American \nMedical Association also reported a strong correlation between \ncigarette advertising and youth smoking.\n  It analyzed tobacco advertising in 34 popular U.S. magazines and \nfound that as youth readership increased, the likelihood of youth-\ntargeted cigarette advertising increased as well.\n  Two recently disclosed industry documents reveal that Big Tobacco had \na deliberate strategy to market its products to children. In a 1981 \nPhilip Morris memo entitled ``Young Smokers--Prevalence, Implications, \nand Related Demographic Trends,'' the author wrote that ``it is \nimportant to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns \nand attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's regular customer, and the \noverwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in \ntheir teens. Because of our high share of the market among the youngest \nsmokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than other companies from the \ndecline in the number of teenager smokers.''\n  A 1976 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company memorandum stated that ``young \npeople will continue to become smokers at or above the present rates \nduring the projection period. The brands which these beginning smokers \naccept and use will become the dominant brands in future years. \nEvidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old group \nis an increasing segment of the smoking population. R.J. Reynolds \nTobacco must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if \nour position in the industry is to be maintained over the long-term.''\n  The conclusion is obvious. Big Tobacco's goal is to hook children \ninto a lifetime of nicotine addiction and smoking-related illnesses. \nThey've used Joe Camel, the Marlboro Man, and the prominent placement \nof tobacco advertising. Obviously, Big Tobacco knows how to stop \ntargeting children. That's why the Reed amendment is so important. If \ntobacco companies continue to target children with their billboard \nadvertisements near schools, giveways of branded items, sponsorships of \nsporting events, and magazine promotions, they'll lose their tax \ndeduction.\n  The health of the nation's children deserves to be protected. The \nReed amendment is an important enforcement mechanism to ensure that Big \nTobacco plays by the rules.\n  If we continue to permit tobacco companies to deduct the cost of \nadvertising targeted to children as an ordinary and necessary business \nexpense, we will literally be providing a tax subsidy for this unlawful \nand immoral conduct. Unless we adopt the Reed amendment, the taxpayers \nwill be paying approximately 35 cents of every dollar spent by the \nindustry on a billboard, on a magazine ad, on a promotional item \ndesigned to entrap our children into a lifetime of addiction and \npremature death. The Senate should declare in one resounding voice that \nwe do not consider addicting children to be ``an ordinary and necessary \nbusiness expense.''\n  This amendment speaks to the tobacco industry in the only language it \nunderstands--money. It will dramatically increase the cost, and \ntherefore help to deter, marketing campaigns which seek to convert \nimpressionable kids into lifelong smokers. For every advertisement \nwhich does not appear because of this amendment, there may well be a \nchild who does not light up his or her first cigarette.\n  The Reed amendment deserves the support of every Senator. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \namendment of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. The amendment of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island is an important amendment. Senator Reed \nhas been a very important member of the task force that I chaired on \nthe Democratic side on the tobacco issue. He has been a superb \ncontributor to the work of the task force. In fact, he traveled to \nNorth Dakota to participate in a hearing on the tobacco issue with me. \nI went to Rhode Island, and we held a very informative hearing at Brown \nUniversity in his State.\n  No one has played a more constructive role than the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed. He is absolutely dedicated to the cause of \ntrying to craft responsible national tobacco policy. As part of that \neffort, Senator Reed has brought to us an amendment. I believe it is an \nimportant amendment. It says very simply that the tobacco companies \nwill be denied tax deductibility for advertising if, and only if, a \ntobacco manufacturer violates the Food and Drug Administration's \nadvertising restrictions.\n  I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe it is an amendment that \nought to pass 100 to nothing. There is absolutely no reason why every \nMember of this Chamber should not support the Reed amendment. We all \nknow that the tobacco industry has a history of marketing to children. \nAfter we received through the various trials the documents that were \npreviously secret and beyond our observation, we now know beyond \nquestion that this industry has targeted children, sometimes as young \nas 12 years old. We have seen document after document from the industry \nitself that demonstrate the truth of those statements.\n  The advertising restrictions included in the FDA rule are not \nextraordinary. These restrictions are constitutional. They are \ncarefully targeted to prevent the tobacco industry from advertising to \nkids. In every State of the Union it is illegal to sell tobacco \nproducts to children under the age of 18--in every State in this \nNation. It is illegal to market to kids under the age of 18.\n  In every State of the Nation, the tobacco industry should be stopped \nfrom advertising to children under the age of 18. These advertising \nrestrictions are sensible and reasonable, and again, fully \nconstitutional. In fact, the tobacco industry found them reasonable \nenough to agree to them in the proposed settlement which they reached \nwith the State attorneys general. The tobacco industry actually agreed \nto some restrictions that went beyond those provided for in the FDA \nrules. The FDA determined that in order to reduce youth smoking, the \nfollowing restrictions to advertising should be enforced:\n  No. 1, no outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a public school or \nplayground. We know that outdoor advertising has an impact. Billboards \nplaced close to places where kids spend a great deal of time can be \nvery influential. The tobacco industry is aware of the power of the \nbillboard. According to the industry's own marketing materials:\n\n       Outdoors is right up there, day and night, lurking, waiting \n     for another ambush.\n\n  Those are the tobacco industry's own words. The FDA rules also limit \nadvertising in publications with a significant youth readership to a \nblack-on-white, text-only format. They also limit advertising in an \naudio format to words with no music or sound effects. They also limit \nadvertising in a video format to static, black-on-white text. They also \nprohibit the marketing, licensing, distribution or sale of all \nnontobacco promotional items such as T-shirts and caps. These \nrestrictions do\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\npass constitutional muster. They were designed to pass constitutional \nmuster. These restrictions are aimed at ads that target kids. They do \nnot attempt to ban legitimate commercial speech. Mr. President, that is \nwhy they pass constitutional muster.\n  Senator Reed's amendment is intended to penalize the tobacco \nmanufacturer if it fails to limit its advertising and marketing to \nthose who are legally able to buy the product. We know from the \nthousands and thousands of internal industry documents that the tobacco \ncompanies purposely and aggressively sought a youth market share. There \ncan be no question about it. How many times have we heard on the floor \nthe words ``youth replacement smoker''? Because the industry has to \nfind someplace to get those to fill the shoes of the 425,000 smokers \nwho die every year from tobacco-related illness. Where do they recruit \nthem? They recruit them from our youth. Maybe we could put up those \ncharts that speak to these questions. These are not my words. These are \nnot the words of the public health advocates of this bill. These are \nthe words of the industry itself. They have said to us they don't \nmarket to children.\n  But in a 1978 memo from a Lorillard executive, they said, ``The base \nof our business are high school students.''\n  ``The base of our business are high school student.'' What could be \nmore clear?\n  Again, they have said they don't market to children, but if we look \nat their own documents, in this case a 1976 R.J. Reynolds research \ndepartment forecast:\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18 \n     year old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking \n     population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in \n     this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained over the long term.\n\n  These are not my words. These are the industry's own documents, \nAgain, the claim that they don't market to children and another \ndocument from the industry, a 1975 memo from a Philip Morris \nresearcher:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . [it goes \n     on to say] my own data . . . shows even higher Marlboro \n     market penetration among 15 to 17 year olds.\n\n  Can there be any question that they targeted kids? Can there be any \nserious question when their own documents reveal that is precisely what \nthey have done?\n  Finally from a Brown & Williamson document.\n\n       The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for \n     starting, their brand preferences, et cetera, as well as the \n     starting behavior of children as young as 5 years old . . . \n     the studies examined . . . young smokers' attitudes towards \n     addiction, and contained multiple references to how very \n     young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, \n     only to later discover, to their regret, that they are.\n\n  These are the industry's documents and they reveal that they have \ntargeted kids. This industry has spent more than $5 billion a year on \nadvertising and marketing each year. The industry says this effort is \naimed at getting adult smokers to switch. But their own documents \nreveal that these ads are also aimed at building youth market share. \nThey repeatedly talk about the need to build the youth market, and they \nknow that smokers are very loyal to the first brand they smoke. Few \nadults switch brands as a result of tobacco advertising. The reality is \nthat the toys and the slogans and the marketing and the ads are \ntargeted at kids. The campaign by the tobacco industry against our \nyouth must stop. This amendment, the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island, Senator Reed, I think, would help. It would be another \ntool in the tool box to help us achieve the goals of protecting public \nhealth and reducing youth smoking.\n  Mr. President, I call on our colleagues to support the Reed amendment \nwhen we have a chance to vote on it next week.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise once again to address the issue of \nthe constitutionality of the Commerce bill, as modified by the floor \nsubstitute.\n  A buzz seems to be in the air that perhaps the pending substitute \nbill might actually pass.\n  What seems to be forgotten--or ignored--however, is there are serious \nquestions surrounding the bill's constitutionality. In a rush to do \ngood, in the haste to pass legislation that limits youth cigarette \nsmoking, some have either ignored the constitutional problems or \ndeluded themselves that no such problems exist.\n  In 1845, Justice Joseph Story complained ``how easily men satisfy \nthemselves that the Constitution is exactly what they wish it to be.'' \nWell, the courts will not ignore the Constitution. They will scrutinize \nthe legislation according to applicable case law and constitutional \ndoctrine and, most assuredly, will strike down as unconstitutional \npertinent provisions of the bill.\n  So what will we have accomplished? Major portions of this bill will \nfail. Teen smoking may not decrease. Or, even worse, from a public \nhealth standpoint, the bill will be tied up for a decade or more in \nlitigation; no national tobacco program could be implemented until the \nlitigation is resolved; and more and more teens will start and continue \nsmoking. Many of our youth, naturally, will die prematurely--at least \n10 million kids--while this is litigated, assuming it passes in its \ncurrent form, as unconstitutional as it is. There will be at least 10 \nyears of litigation, and another 10 million kids will become hooked on \nsmoking, a high percentage of whom will probably die prematurely as a \nresult of that.\n  We must, as a body, address the constitutional concerns raised by the \ntobacco legislation, and we should not evade this issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear that I am a strong advocate of \nlegislation that will reduce youth consumption of tobacco products. I \nalso want to make it abundantly clear that I am a vociferous critic of \nthe tobacco industry. But should our disdain for tobacco and our desire \nto help young people prevent us from crafting an efficacious bill that \nmeets constitutional requisites?\n  We must heed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who in 1904 observed \nthat it must always be ``remembered that legislatures are the ultimate \nguardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great \ndegree as the court.'' So we must act as guardians of the Constitution. \nOur oaths of office require it. The American people demand no less of \nus.\n  The Commerce bill raises a number of serious constitutional issues \nwhich involve the following: No. 1, the first amendment; 2, the \nprohibition of bills of attainder contained in article I; 3, the \ntakings clause; and 4, the due process clause. Allow me to address each \nof these issues in the order I listed them.\n  Let me first turn to the first amendment issue.\n  The Commerce bill unconstitutionally restricts tobacco product \nadvertising, one, by apparently enacting the August 1996 FDA rule, and, \ntwo, by imposing additional restrictions that go beyond these \nregulations through a so-called ``voluntary protocol'' modeled after my \noriginal tobacco plan.\n\n  Section 103 of the floor vehicle deems the FDA rule to be ``lawful \nand to have been lawfully promulgated under the authority of this \nchapter.'' The meaning of this is unclear, but the language will \nprobably be interpreted as codifying the rule.\n  As to the protocol section of the Commerce bill, one must remember \nthat it is intended to be voluntary. It is null and void without the \nparticipation of the tobacco companies and the other parties to the \nJune 20, 1997, settlement.\n  Both of these restrictions violate the first amendment and the \nSupreme Court's cases defining commercial speech. Moreover, the \n``counter-advertising'' provisions--the ``coerced speech doctrine''--of \nthe bill are subject to first amendment challenges unless consented to \nby the tobacco companies, who have said they will not consent to this \nCommerce Committee bill.\n  Let me discuss these concerns in more detail.\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\n  On August 28, 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a \nrule which restricted tobacco advertising. These limitations include: \nNo outdoor advertising for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including \nbillboards, posters, or placards, within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of \nany public playground, elementary school, or secondary school; other \nadvertising must be in black text on a white background only, in FDA-\napproved publications; labeling and advertising in audio format must be \nin words only, with no music or sound effects, and in video format in \nstatic black and white text only, on a white background; the sale of \nany item--other than cigarettes or smokeless tobacco--or service, which \nbears the brand name, logo, et cetera, identical or similar to any \nbrand of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco is prohibited; offering any \ngift or item--other than cigarettes or smokeless tobacco--to any person \npurchasing cigarettes or smokeless tobacco is prohibited; and \nsponsoring any athletic, musical, or other social or cultural event is \nprohibited.\n  In April 1997, the U.S. District Court in Greensboro, NC, while \nupholding the FDA's general jurisdiction over tobacco, held that the \nFDA did not have statutory authority to regulate advertising. The first \namendment issues, therefore, were not addressed by the court. An appeal \nis pending in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were \nheard earlier this week.\n  These advertising restrictions propose to be codified in a \nfreestanding FDA regulation of the tobacco section of the Commerce \nbill. The Commerce bill also broadens these restrictions, and, much \nlike the original Hatch bill, it places these broader restrictions in a \nvoluntary yet binding contract termed the ``protocol.''\n  Pursuant to the protocol, the tobacco companies waive their first \namendment rights in exchange for the settlement of existing suits and \nthe scaled-back civil liability limitations--in the original floor \nvehicle, the ``soft'' cap on annual payments--that is, $6.5 billion per \nyear. These modest civil liability limitations may be nullified if the \nGregg amendment is adopted.\n  As the bill currently stands, the proposed incentives for the tobacco \nindustry to agree voluntarily are largely illusory, hence the \nexplanation for the recent withdrawal by the industry from the June 20 \nsettlement. So there is no longer any voluntary consent protocol. \nPrivate parties may waive their constitutional rights. I cite with \nparticularity the Snepp v. United States 1980 case. We can only assume \nthat without this waiver, parties will tie up the legislation in the \ncourts for years. I don't think there is any question about it.\n\n  The Supreme Court has consistently held that constitutional rights \nmay be waived provided that such waiver is knowing, voluntary and \nintelligent. [See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 95 (1972); D. H. \nOvermyer Co., Inc. Of Ohio v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174, 187 (1972).] Of \ncourse, the tobacco companies have now withdrawn from the settlement, \nso no waiver can occur unless they rejoin the negotiations.\n\n  So, the tobacco industry will not enter into the protocols and we \nmust analyze the bill's constitutionality on this fact. With this bill, \nwe are not discussing restrictions which will be agreed to. Hence, the \nconstitutionality is the problem.\n  Because the advertising restrictions affect only commercial speech, \nthey are entitled to less First Amendment protection than, let's say, \npolitical speech. [E.G., Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public \nService Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980).] Yet, according to the 1980 \nSupreme Court decision in Central Hudson v. Public Service Commission, \nthe government still bears the burden of justifying a restriction on \ncommercial speech. I also cite, Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co. [, 115 S.Ct. \n1585, 1592 (1995).] According to Central Hudson, the Supreme Court has \nenunciated a four-part test governing the validity of commercial speech \nrestrictions: 1. Whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by \nthe First Amendment, whether it concerns a lawful activity and is not \nmisleading; and 2. Whether the asserted governmental interest in \nrestricting it is substantial; If both inquiries yield positive \nanswers, then; 3. Does the restriction directly advance the \ngovernmental interest asserted; and 4. Is the restriction not more \nextensive than is necessary to serve that interest?\n  In the 1996 case of 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, [116 S. Ct. \n1495 (1996)], the Supreme Court heightened the protection that the \nCentral Hudson test guarantees to commercial speech. It makes clear \nthat an effectively total prohibition on ``the dissemination of \ntruthful, non-misleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to \nthe preservation of a fair bargaining process'' will be subject to a \nstricter review by the courts than a regulation designed ``to protect \nconsumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices.''\n  The proposed restrictions would fall with in the scope of the first \nprong of the test because, presumably, the advertising is lawful and \nnot misleading. They would also meet the second prong because \nprotecting the public health, safety, and welfare (particularly when \nthe public group being protected is comprised of children) is a \nsubstantial interest.\n  So, a court in analyzing the constitutionality of the advertising \nrestrictions will be left to question seriously whether the third and \nfourth prong of the Central Hudson test has been met. In other words, \nthe questions facing the Congress and a future court are whether the \ngovernment could carry its burden of proving the advertising \nrestrictions will directly advance the reduction of youth smoking and \nthat the restrictions are not more extensive than necessary to \naccomplish this objective.\n  Because ``broad prophylactic rules in the area of free speech are \nsuspect,'' courts rigorously apply the third and fourth factors of the \nCentral Hudson test. The Supreme Court noted in Edenfield v. Farre [507 \nU.S. 761, 777 (1993),] that as to the third and fourth factors \n``[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so \nclosely touching our most precious freedoms''.\n  Although Congress may reasonably believe that the severe curtailment \nof tobacco product advertising will impact youth smoking, that fact \nalone will not satisfy the government's burden of providing a direct \nadvancement of its interest. As the Second Circuit held recently, to \nsatisfy this burden, the government must ``marshall . . . empirical \nevidence'' supporting its ``assumptions,'' and must show that its \nputative interest is advanced ``to a material degree'' by the \nrestriction on speech. [Bad Frog Brewery, Inc. v. New York State Liquor \nAuthority, 134 F.3d 87, 98, 100 (2d Cir. 1998).]\n  This burden is a heavy burden.\n  It is unlikely that there is uncontroverted ``empirical evidence'' \nproving, for example, that prohibiting sponsorship of athletic, social, \nor cultural events under the brand name of a tobacco product, or that \nprohibiting advertising without notice to the FDA in any medium not \npre-approved by the FDA would have a material impact on youth smoking. \nThe Senate has held more than 30 hearings on the tobacco settlement, \nbut have we been provided any such ``empirical evidence?'' And the \nanswer is ``no.''\n  But, even if the government could carry its burden of proving direct \nadvancement of its interest, it cannot survive the fourth prong of the \nCentral Hudson test and prove that the FDA regulations are not more \nextensive than necessary.\n  The Supreme Court has found that a restriction on commercial speech \nis not sufficiently narrow, and is, thus, unconstitutional, when there \nare available to the government ``alternatives that would prove less \nintrustive to the First Amendment's protections for commercial \nspeech.'' [Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 491 (1995).]\n\n  There are obvious regulatory and legislative alternatives here.\n  First, the entire premise of the Commerce bill is that other \nregulations that do not impact First Amendment freedoms will advance \nthe government's interest in reducing youth smoking. These include (1) \nenforcement of the current access restrictions, public education and \ncounter-advertising projects (2) price increases, and (3) cessation \nprograms.\n  For example consider the 44 Liquormart case I mentioned earlier, [116 \nS. Ct. at 1510], which held that liquor price advertising restrictions \nfailed Central Hudson's fourth factor, since the government could have \naccomplished its objective through increased\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\ntaxation, limits on purchases, and educational campaigns.\n  Moreover, any assertion by the government that non-speech \nalternatives would be ineffective in reducing youth smoking would not \nbe viewed favorably by the courts.\n  In publishing final regulations promulgated under the ADAMHA \nReorganization Act of 1992, that's alcohol, drug abuse, mental health \nadministration, an act which conditioned federal grants on state \nenforcement of tobacco access restrictions, Department of Health and \nHuman Services--the federal agency with expertise on the matter--\nproclaimed that ``aggressive and consistent enforcement of states are \nlikely to reduce substantially illegal tobacco sales.'' [61 Fed. Reg. \n1492 (Jan. 19, 1996).]\n  Likewise, the Surgeon General stated that the ADAMHA Amendments would \n``provide significant new leverage for increased enforcement of laws to \nreduce sales of tobacco products to youth.'' I might add, this was \nincluded in ``A Report of the Surgeon General: Preventing Tobacco Use \nAmong Young People,'' 254 (1994).\n  In addition, other measures directed at youth contained in the Hatch \nbill, but not the Commerce bill--such as imposing criminal penalties on \npurchases or possession of cgiarettes by underage persons, or making \nentitlement to a driver's license dependent on a record without such \noffenses--would clearly advance the government's interest more directly \nthan would advertising restrictions.\n  Finally, the Commerce bill's Protocol restrictions, if they are \nsomehow imposed without consent, would work an even more clear \nviolation of the First Amendment.\n  The Protocol restrictions are no less broad than the voluntary \nrestrictions in the Proposed June 20 settlement. And nearly every First \nAmendment scholar who has testified before Congress has concluded that \nsuch restrictions would violate the First Amendment if enacted \nunilaterally. I refer my colleagues to the testimony of Laurence H. \nTribe, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last July \nthat any legislation containing the Proposed Resolution's advertising \nrestrictions would be ``extremely problematic under the First \nAmendment.''\n  I also refer my fellow Senators to the testimony of Floyd Abrams, one \nof the leading legal experts in the first amendment privileges and \nrights, before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 10, 1998, \nwhere he asserted that any act containing the proposed resolution's \nadvertising restrictions would be ``destined to be held \nunconstitutional'' under Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, [117 \nS. Ct. 2329,2346 (1997)].\n  Now, let me next discuss the counteradvertising provisions.\n  Another first amendment problem plaguing this bill is that, if \nenacted, the bill would also violate the U.S. Constitution insofar as \nthe ``counteradvertising'' provisions would require the tobacco \nindustry to fund directly political and commercial speech with which it \ndisagrees. This violates the so-called ``coerced speech'' doctrine.\n\n  Section 221 of the Commerce bill would directly require the tobacco \nindustry to fund a tobacco-free education program, which would award \ngrants to public and nonprofit, private entities to carry out public \ninformational and educational activities designed to reduce the use of \ntobacco products.\n  Section 1172 would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto disburse funds appropriated for the tobacco industry to be used ``to \ndiscourage the use of tobacco products by individuals and to encourage \nthose who use such products to quit.''\n  Now, I do not question these objectives or the motives of those who \ndrafted these restrictions. They certainly had the best interests of \nthe public at heart in doing so.\n  Nevertheless, the Commerce Committee bill would--in these two \nseparate instances--compel the tobacco industry to directly fund \npolitical and commercial speech to which they may be opposed, in \nderogation of the first amendment rights to be free from compelled \nspeech and compelled association. Compare this to a situation where \nspeech is subsidized by Government, but the revenues come from the \nGeneral Treasury. In this situation, there would be no constitutional \nviolation. But the bill is constitutionally infirm and violates the \nConstitution.\n  As the United States Supreme Court has held, the first amendment \nprohibits Government from ``requiring a speaker to associate with \nspeech with which it may disagree.'' That is Pacific Gas & Electric Co. \nv. Public Utilities Commission of California [475 U.S. 15 (1986)]. \nGovernment-compelled funding of objectionable speech infringes upon \nboth the right of free speech and the right of free association. [Id. \nat 20-21]\n  At issue in the Pacific Gas case was a State order that required the \nPacific Gas and Electric Company to disseminate the views of one of its \nregulatory opponents. In finding that such an order violated the first \namendment, the Supreme Court held that ``for corporations, as for \nindividuals, the choice to speak includes within it the choice of what \nnot to say. . . . Were the Government freely able to compel corporate \nspeakers to propound messages with which they disagree, this protection \nof the first amendment would be empty.''\n  I refer my colleagues to Abood v. Detroit Board of Education [431 \nU.S. 209, 234-35 & n.31], a 1977 case, where the Court held that \nGovernment-compelled union dues may not be used for ideological \npurposes.\n  Various Federal courts of appeals, including the Third, Seventh and \nNinth Circuit Courts of Appeal, have also held that the freedom of \nspeech includes the right not to be compelled to render financial \nsupport for other speech, especially when the views expressed are \ncontrary to one's own. These cases include Cal-Almond, Inc. v. U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture [14 F. 3d 429, 434-35 (9th Cir. 1993)], U.S. \nv. Frame [885 F. 2d 1119, 1132-33 (3rd Cir. 1989)], and Central \nIllinois Light Company v. Citizens Utility Board [827 F. 2d 1169 (7th \nCir. 1987)].\n  This right to be free from compelled funding of objectionable speech \nis hardly a new development in the law.\n  As early as 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson declared that ``to compel \na man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions \nwhich he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.'' [See Abood, 431 U.S. \nat 235 n.31.]\n  Moreover, as recently as last year, the Supreme Court reiterated that \nthe protections of the first amendment are called into play whenever \nGovernment seeks to ``require speakers to repeat an objectionable \nmessage out of their own mouths, or require them to use their own \nproperty to convey an antagonistic ideological message. . ..'' That is \nGlickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc. [117 S. Ct. 2130, 2139 \n(1977)], a 1997 case decided last year.\n  Thus, the Commerce bill--by essentially forcing tobacco manufacturers \nto finance an advertising campaign--could be found to infringe on their \nrights to be free from compelled speech and compelled association. \nUnless heightened legal strictures are first met, the Commerce bill may \nnot constitutionally require the industry to fund antitobacco speech.\n  Keep in mind, this is a legal industry. As bad as it is, as much harm \nas it does, it is still legal. We are unwilling to ban this industry \nand to force these companies to leave our country because we have \napproximately 50 million smokers in this country who are hooked on \ncigarettes. And it has always been approved as a legal business through \nall of these years. So these constitutional points are important \npoints, in spite of the fact that we may despise what these companies \ndo.\n  In order for the ``counter-advertising'' provisions of the Commerce \nbill to pass constitutional muster, there must be a ``narrowly tailored \nmeans of serving a compelling State interest.'' [See Pacific Gas, 475 \nU.S. at 19]\n  Although the Federal Government may have a ``compelling State \ninterest'' in reducing the health hazards associated with smoking, the \nCommerce bill addresses that concern with a broadside approach that is \nfar from narrowly tailored, and which unnecessarily tramples on \nimportant first amendment rights. The lack of ``narrow tailoring'' is \nmost evident from the fact that Congress has available to it a whole \nhost of alternative methods to encourage and finance antitobacco speech \nthat would not impinge on any constitutional concerns.\n\n  For example, Congress could provide tax incentives to members of the \nmass\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\nmedia in exchange for their cooperation in supporting counter-\nadvertising. Or Congress could condition the receipt of certain Federal \nfunds--that is educational and research grants--on the requirement that \nrecipients promote measures to reduce tobacco use. Or Congress could \neven directly subsidize antitobacco advertising through the Department \nof Health and Human Services, provided that all such funding was drawn \nfrom taxpayers ``generally''--and not exacted from the tobacco industry \nin particular. I refer my colleagues to the Supreme Court's opinion in \nU.S. v. Frame [885 F. 2d 119, 1132-33 (3d Cir.)], a 1989 case, which \nemphasized the distinction between ``money from the general tax fund'' \nand money from ``a fund earmarked for the dissemination of a particular \nmessage associated with a particular group.'' Should this bill become \nlaw, a Federal court would have to conclude that instead of choosing \nany one of these constitutionally permissible methods of funding \ncounter-advertising, the Congress will have adopted a scheme that \nunnecessarily infringes upon the first amendment rights of the tobacco \nindustry.\n  Let me discuss bill of attainder, takings, and due process issues \nraised by the Commerce bill.\n  The Commerce bill would impose large annual payments on these tobacco \nproduct manufacturers that enter into a voluntary protocol.\n  Keep in mind, they have said they are not going to enter into a \nvoluntary protocol if the McCain bill is the bill that passes. But \nlet's assume otherwise.\n  The first six annual payments are to be made regardless of sales or \nprofits. The bill would also provide for a $10 billion up-front \npayment.\n  Any attempt to impose the Commerce bill's payment scheme on an \ninvoluntary basis would be subjected to legal challenge under at least \nthree independent constitutional provisions--the Bill of Attainder \nClause, the Takings Clause, and the Due Process Clause of the \nConstitution.\n  The implementation of the ``look-back'' penalties--if the industry is \nwithout fault--raises the same constitutional concerns.\n  The Comprehensive Tobacco Resolution agreed to between the tobacco \ncompanies and the State attorneys general contains a ``look-back'' \nprovision, whereby, if prescribed goals for reducing teen smoking rates \nin future years are not achieved, the tobacco companies would be \nsubject to specified monetary liabilities.\n  The Commerce bill imposes greater ``look-back'' liabilities upon the \ntobacco companies--amounting to more than $5 billion per year--without \nthe consent of the industry. Thus, the bill would impose multibillion \ndollar liabilities upon tobacco companies--over and apart from the \nongoing payments the companies would be called upon to make as part of \nthe resolution.\n  Even if the companies fully complied with all measures imposed by the \nresolution to prevent teen smoking, they would be subject to the \npenalties without any showing of illegal or wrongful conduct whatever.\n  Let me discuss why certain provisions in this bill violate the \nprohibition of bills of attainder contained in Article I, Section 9, \nClause 3 of our Constitution. This provision simply reads, ``No Bill of \nAttainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.''\n  What is a bill of attainder? The Bill of Attainder Clause prohibits \nthe imposition of a punishment by Congress without a judicial trial. \nThat was decided as early as 1866 in the Cummings v. Missouri case [71 \nU.S. 277 (1986)]. The clause reflects the framers' belief that ``the \nlegislative branch is not so well suited as politically independent \njudges and juries to the task of ruling upon blameworthiness.'' That is \nU.S. v. Brown [381 U.S. 437. 445 (1965)], a 1965 case. Legislation \nviolates the Bill of Attainder Clause if it singles out a specific \ngroup for unique treatment imposing punitive liability upon that group \nwithout a trial.\n  I refer my colleagues to Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public \nInterest Research Group, [468 U.S. 841, 846 (1984)], and also generally \nto Nixon v. Administrator of General Service [433 U.S. 425, 469-475 \n(1977).]\n  In sum, a general definition of what constitutes a bill of attainder \ndemonstrates that a bill of attainder prohibited by the Constitution is \ncomposed of two elements: first, an element of punishment inflicted by \nsome authority other than a judicial authority; and second, an element \nof specificity, that is, a singling out of an individual or \nidentifiable group for the infliction of the punishment. In other \nwords, a bill of attainder is primarily a legislative act designed to \npunish an individual or discrete class of individuals without a hearing \nor a demonstration of fault.\n  It is clear that a court would interpret the floor vehicle's \npenalties as punitive and would thus violate the Bill of Attainder \nprohibition.\n  The so-called ``look-back penalties'' in the floor vehicle--in other \nwords, in the Commerce bill before this body--which are imposed on the \ntobacco companies if teen smoking does not meet certain goals for \nreduction, are subject to constitutional challenge unless they are \nvoluntarily agreed to by the tobacco companies.\n  I might add, which, of course, is not the case. The companies have \nsaid they will not voluntarily agree to what they consider to be the \nexhorbitantly punitive bill that is before the Senate at the present \ntime.\n  I am talking about even the substitute as brought forward by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  I might add that the bill now terms the penalties ``surcharges.'' But \nthis simply is an attempt to elevate form over substance. No matter how \nthey are termed, these payments are the functional equivalent of fines. \nThus, the Supreme Court in United States v. Lovett, [328 U.S. 303 \n(1946)], held that legislative acts--no matter what there form or what \nthey are called--that apply either to an individual or a discreet class \nin such a way as to impose punishment without a trial--are bills of \nattainder prohibited by the Constitution.\n  Given what we know--or do not know--about how teens react to \nadvertising, it is possible that even if the tobacco industry does all \nit can to prevent teen smoking, and teen smoking still will not meet \nthe target, then they are being punished unnecessarily, Moreover, \nbesides the look-back penalties, the floor vehicle contains an \nadditional provision that companies lose their liability cap protection \nif underage smoking exceeds the targets by a set amount. This is also \ndone without a showing of fault.\n  The Bill of Attainder Clause has been invoked by lower courts to \ninvalidate similar punitive economic legislation aimed at particular \nindustries, companies, or individuals. Thus, for example, in SBC \nCommunications, Inc. v. FCC, the District Court struck down provisions \nof the recently enacted Telecommunications Act, which subjected \nregional telephone companies to burdensome requirements for entry into \nthe long distance business. [981 F. Supp. 996, 1004 (N.D. Tex 1997).] \nBecause the ``Baby Bells'' were singled out for unique and economically \npunishing regulatory treatment--based on an unproved legislative \npresumption that they were engaged in ongoing anti-competitive \npractices--the Court held that the provisions violated the Bill of \nAttainder Clause.\n  As another example, in News America Publishing, Inc. v. FCC, the D.C. \nCircuit invalidated on First Amendment grounds a law that singled out \nRupert Murdock for unfavorable treatment. [844 F.2d 800, 813 (D.C. Cir. \n1988).]\n  Explaining that the ``safeguards of a pluralistic system are often \nabsent when the legislative zeros in on a small class of citizens,'' \nthe D.C. Circuit found that the challenged provision ``strikes at \nMurdoch with the precision of a laser beam,'' and held the provision \nunconstitutional. ``Congress' exclusive focus on a single party clearly \nimplicates values similar to those behind the constitutional \nproscription of Bill of Attainder.''\n  The Supreme Court in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, [433 \nU.S. 425, 468-484 (1977)] has indicated that the existence of \npunishment is dependent upon the circumstances of individual cases.\n  A three-part test to determine whether a legislative act is a bill of \nattainder was developed. One test is that of historical experience \nunder the law of England and our own country the United States. This \ntest involves an analysis of punishment in terms of what traditionally \nhas been regarded\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nas punishment for purposes of bills of attainder--which were used to \nseize or escheat property--and bills of pains and penalties--which were \nused to deprive individuals of their civil rights.\n\n  A second test is a functional one which takes into account the extent \nto which any enactment challenged as a bill of attainder furthers any \nnon-punitive purposes underlying it.\n  A third test for determining the existence of the punishment element \nis a motivational one, involving an assessment of the purposes or \nmotives of the legislative authority.\n  There can be little doubt that applying the Supreme Court's three-\npart test would result in the conclusion that the look-back penalties \nconstitute a bill of attainder. Imposing the floor vehicle's payment \nscheme upon the tobacco industry without its consent would, in effect, \nbe a fine for the tobacco industry's past conduct and would therefore \nconstitute a bill of attainder, even if a due process hearing were held \nto determine factually whether goals were met or not.\n  First, the scheme would single out a discrete group for unique \ntreatment, since the payments would be forced only upon the country's \nfive major tobacco manufacturers. And, second, payments would be \nimposed by the terms of a congressional decree, not through a trial.\n  That these measures are ``punitive'' would be readily apparent to any \ncourt (1) from the huge payments which historically and functionally \namount to a deprivation and confiscation of property; and (2) from the \nlegislative record, which is replete with expressions of congressional \ncondemnation of the tobacco industry and, therefore demonstrate a clear \nmotive to punish. Thus, the bill punishes and is directed at a discrete \ngroup, that is, the tobacco companies.\n  Let me make clear that there is no greater critic of the tobacco \nindustry than Orrin Hatch.\n  I have fought them vigorously for most of my career.\n  I believe that the tobacco companies have done great harms \nparticularly to the children of this nation.\n  They have hidden documents demonstrating the addictive nature of \nnicotine.\n  They have concealed evidence that cigarette smoking is a significant \ncontributor to such diseases as cancer and emphysema.\n  Nevertheless, we must put our faith in the judicial process. If \nwrongs have been committed by the tobacco industry, the courts will \nreveal and punish them. That specter is what has brought the tobacco \ncompanies to the bargaining table. That threat is what caused the \ntobacco companies to settle with the 40 state attorney generals. That \nrisk is what led the tobacco companies to settle the individual state \nsuits in Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota.\n  Our task is to pass moderate legislation that implements the \nsettlement and adheres to the Constitution. Passing legislation that \namounts to a bill of attainder is a very dangerous precedent.\n\n\n                           the takings clause\n\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to the property rights issues that the \nbill raises.\n  The Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment provides, ``nor shall \nprivate property be taken for public use without just compensation.'' \nThe Takings Clause ``conditions the otherwise unrestrained power of the \nsovereign to expropriate, without compensation, whatever it needs.'' \nUnited States v. General Motors Corp., [323 U.S. 373, 377 (1945).]\n  As the Supreme Court in Dolan v. City of Tigard, [512 U.S. 374, 384 \n(1994).] held: ``One of the principal purposes of the Takings Clause is \n`to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public \nburdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the \npublic as a whole.' ''\n  Where there is, in fact, a permanent physical occupation--no matter \nhow small--the Supreme Court has held that there is a per se taking, \nimmune from application of the balancing test, which I will discuss \nshortly. [See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan, CATV Corp., 458 U.S. \n419 (1982). I refer my colleagues to the Lucas v. South Carolina \nCoastal Council, [505 U.S. 1003 (1992)] case and its discussion on the \ndistinction between per se or categorical takings and regulatory \ntakings.\n  As the Supreme Court noted in the 1984 case of Ruckelshaus v. \nMonsanto Co., while ``[c]ondemnation of land by the power of eminent \ndomain is the commonest example of [a] taking,'' it is well-established \nthat the ``taking of personal property'' is likewise protected by the \nTakings Clause. [Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1003-04 \n(1984).]\n  And the Supreme Court has held explicitly that the Takings Clause \nprotects not only against government expropriations of intangible \npersonal property but also against government expropriations of money. \n[Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 162-63 \n(1980).] In Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies v. Beckwith, a state court, \nwhich had maintained funds owed the plaintiff in a court bank account, \ntried to withhold over $9,000 of interest as a fee for ``receiving \nmoney into the registry of court.'' The Supreme Court held that because \n``the exaction [amounted to a] forced contribution to general \ngovernmental revenues, and [was] not reasonably related to the costs of \nusing the courts,'' it constituted a taking.\n  It seems to me that the Commerce bill's expropriation falls under the \nbright line per se takings rule. Clearly, monies and assets are being \nexpropriated, and this is not an example of a regulatory taking, where \na court must balance certain factors to determine whether a diminution \nof value constitutes a taking. [See generally Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, \n467 U.S. 986 (1984).]\n  Moreover, even if the regulatory takings balancing test were applied, \nthe Commerce bill's confiscations probably would be considered \nunconstitutional. In determining whether expropriation of money from \nthe tobacco product manufacturers constitutes a taking, a reviewing \ncourt would focus upon the following factors: the character of the \ngovernment action; the economic impact of the regulation on the \nclaimant; and the extent to which the regulation has interfered with \nreasonable investment backed expectations.\n\n  Application of this three factor Penn Central test shows that forcing \nthe Commerce bill's payment scheme upon the tobacco industry would \nconstitute a taking.\n  First, the character of the governmental action is--quite clearly--a \nseizure of money. It does not even purport to function as a ``fee'' or \na ``tax,'' since the initial $10 billion payment and the first 6 annual \npayments are owned regardless of whether there is any income and \nregardless of whether there are any sales.\n  Moreover, there is no effort to make the amount of the payments \nrelate in any way to the costs of smoking programs that the bill \nauthorizes. And, no industry--not even the tobacco industry--could be \nsaid to ``expect'' that its capital could be simply expropriated in \nlump sum amounts for the public's benefit. Indeed, the Supreme Court \nfound a taking in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacy when the Government merely \ninterfered with the right to receive interest on capital.\n  In this nation's history, there is no statutory precedent whatsoever \nfor forced lump sum payments in anything even approximating the amounts \ncontemplated here in this proposed legislation.\n  In addition, the floor vehicle's document provision is \nconstitutionality suspect. I must point out that the June 20 settlement \nagreement presupposed voluntary participation by the tobacco companies \nin releasing proprietary documents.\n  While litigation documents already made public can be released to the \nFDA, as required in the bill, it is problematic that the industry could \nbe required to release additional documents, especially work product, \nconfidential, or privileged documents without the Court saying so. Such \ndocuments are property as defined by the Fifth Amendment.\n  Thus the district court in Nika Corp. v. City of Kansas City, [582 \nF.Supp. 343 (W.D.Mo. 1983),] held that a corporation's documents \nconstitute property under the Fifth Amendment. I now refer my \ncolleagues to other cases--United States v. Dauphin Deposit Trust Co., \n385 F.2d 129 (3rd Cir. 1967), where the court found that a trust \ncompany has property interest in documents and business records. I also \nrefer\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nmy colleagues to Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. [at 162-63.]\n  Pursuant to the same theory, the forced funding by the industry of \nthe depository--the leasing of the building, the salaries of the \npersonnel, etc., indeed as for any confiscation of cash or any valuable \nassets--would constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment requiring \ncompensation. [See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. at 162-63.]\n  Furthermore, the multi-billion-dollar appropriation by the government \nof the tobacco companies' funds through ``look-back'' provisions \nconstitutes the very type of government expropriation that the Supreme \nCourt has held in the past to be an unconstitutional taking. Thus, \nwhere the Government does not merely impair an owner's use of private \nproperty, but actually seizes ownership of private property (such as \nmoney) for its own use without compensation, there is an \nunconstitutional taking. [See, e.g., Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, 449 \nU.S. at 163; Loretto, 458 U.S. 419 (1982).]\n\n\n                              due process\n\n  In addition to First Amendment, Bill of Attainder, and Takings \nconcerns, forced industry payments would also violate due process. The \nsubstantive due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment bars \n``arbitrary . . . government actions `regardless of the fairness of the \nprocedures used to implement them.' '' [Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. \n113, 124 (1990).]\n  The Commerce bill's payment scheme--if imposed involuntarily--would \narbitrarily compel settlement of various pending and potential \nlitigations for the arbitrary amount. Indeed, the arbitrariness of the \npayments is clear on its face: the Bill expressly provides that the \npayments would be, in part, to settle the state attorneys general \nactions.\n  But, at the same time, the Bill gives each state the right to opt out \nand pursue its claims, yet fails to give the tobacco product \nmanufacturers any offset if the states choose to exercise this right.\n  The possibility remains that, through no fault of the tobacco \nindustry--and indeed despite the industry's full cooperation in efforts \nto end tobacco use by minors--teen smoking reduction goals established \nas part of a resolution may not be reached within the planned \ntimetable.\n  In that event, if look-back obligations were imposed by legislative \nedict without the companies' consent, the companies would incur massive \nand unpredictable monetary liabilities, not because they failed to \nimplement the terms of the resolution in good faith or otherwise acted \nimproperly, but merely because the nation was unsuccessful in fully \nachieving its goals for reasons unrelated to any conduct of the tobacco \ncompanies. Such a legislative imposition of ``look-back'' liability--\nabsent any finding of actual responsibility on the part of the tobacco \ncompanies--would flout fundamental tenets of due process.\n  Due Process contains two components: procedural due process and \nsubstantive due process. A statutorily imposed, non-consensual look-\nback scheme violates each of these components.\n\n\n                         procedural due process\n\n  As the Supreme Court restated in 1992, the right to procedural due \nprocess guarantees a ``fair procedure in connection with any \ndeprivation of life, liberty or property.'' [Collins v. City of Shaker \nHeights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).] Among other things, procedural due \nprocess requires that individuals must receive notice and an \nopportunity to be heard before government deprives them of property, \n[United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 48 \n(1993),] and a fair trial in a fair tribunal. [In re Murchison, 349 \nU.S. 133, 136 (1955).]\n  Here, no such fair procedures exist.\n  The proposed legislatively-mandated ``look-back'' schemes essentially \nprovide that if teen smoking fails to decline by certain percentages, \nthere will be no notice, no opportunity to be heard as to whether that \nevent were caused by any tobacco company conduct, and no trial.\n\n  Instead, the tobacco companies are automatically proclaimed liable to \npay billions of dollars if the Secretary determines that the goals are \nnot met. This violates procedural due process.\n  The Commerce bill does provide for court review upon imposition of a \npenalty. But this review is simply to determine the factual \ndetermination of the Secretary of HHS on whether the targets of \nreduction in youth smoking have been met. If not met, the penalties, \naccording to the bill's language, must be imposed.\n\n\n                        Substantive Due Process\n\n  Even apart from its manifest failures as a matter of procedural due \nprocess, a legislatively imposed ``look-back'' scheme would violate \nsubstantive due process as well. The substantive due process guarantee \nof the Fifth Amendment bars ``arbitrary . . . government action \n`regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.' \n'' [Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 124 (1990).]\n  Here, the arbitrariness of the look-back scheme is clear; the look-\nback scheme would automatically assign massive liability to tobacco \ncompanies even if the companies fully complied with all steps to reduce \nteenage smoking.\n  Indeed, if one steps back from the current issues surrounding tobacco \nand looks to analogies for other industries, the arbitrariness, and, \ntherefore, the unconstitutionality, of the proposed look-back scheme is \neven more obvious. Thus, the proposed legislative mandate would be the \nequivalent--for constitutional purposes--of imposing multi-billion-\ndollar liabilities on the automobile industry if--despite car \ncompanies' full compliance with government safety and design mandates--\ndeath rates from automobile accidents did not decline by certain \ndesired percentages;\n  It would be the equivalent of imposing liabilities on the beef \nindustry if--despite its funding of increased public health advertising \nprograms--Americans failed to limit their meat intake and the instance \nof heart disease in America did not decline by certain percentages;\n  It would be the equivalent of imposing liabilities on the alcohol \nindustry if--despite its best effort to educate the public and promote \nenforcement of state minimum age purchase laws--underage drinking and \ndrunk driving fatalities will not decline by certain percentages.\n  It would be the equivalent of imposing liabilities on the airline \nindustry if its on time performance failed to satisfy government \ntargets, without regard to whether such deficiencies resulted from \nfailures in the government-run air traffic control system or bad \nweather, rather than industry conduct.\n  In each of these cases, such liability would be imposed regardless of \nthe reasonableness of the ``targets.''\n  There can be no question but that the look-back provisions here would \nbe just as arbitrary and irrational as the above hypotheticals.\n  Thus, the various proposed look-back schemes irrebuttably presume \nthat, if teen smoking does not drop by a certain percentage, it \ndefinitively is a result of conduct by the tobacco companies. This \nwould be irrespective of any showing a tobacco company could make that \nit fully complied with all steps to reduce teen smoking and that the \nfailure of the nation to meet its teen smoking goals was based solely \non external factors.\n  Such irrebuttable presumptions have been repeatedly struck down by \nthe Supreme Court. [Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 446 (1973),] The \nCourt struck down as an irrebuttable presumption a stricture that \nanyone who had an out-of-state address at the time they applied for \nadmission to a university remained a non-state-resident throughout \ntheir tenure at the university. [See also Tot v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 463, 467-68 (1943).]\n  Moreover, in only recently striking down a punitive damage judgment, \nthe Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause precludes the \nimposition of liability that does not bear a justifiable relationship \nwith actual conduct. [BMW v. Gore, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 1599 (1996).\n  Here, the proposed ``look-back'' scheme would impose multi-billion-\ndollar liability without any showing of any improper conduct \nwhatsoever. The Due Process Clause simply does not permit such a \n``deprivation [of property], through the application, not of law and \nlegal processes, but of arbitrary coercion.'' [Id. at 1605 (Breyer, J., \nconcurring).] [I refer my colleagues to Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht \nLeasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 689 n.27 (1974), where the Supreme Court \nnoted that liability must be imposed ``with a due\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\nregard to the rights of property and the moral innocence of the party \nincurring the'' liability.]\n  Mr. President, we can be sure--as sure as anything--that the tobacco \nindustry will challenge the constitutionality of this bill on these, \nand perhaps even other issues.\n  I am confident that every argument that I have made is legitimate. \nThe tobacco companies need only prevail on one of these theories and \nthis opportunity we have had will have been squandered.\n  Mr. President, in 1878, William E. Gladstone, the famous future Prime \nMinister of Great Britain, remarked that the ``American Constitution is \n. . . the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the \nbrain and purpose of man.''\n  Indeed, the Constitution by limiting the scope of government has \nfostered individual autonomy, which in turn has unleashed the creative \nenergies of the American people.\n  The Constitution, for over two centuries now, has been the source of \nour prosperity, as well as our liberty. Let us abide by its strictures. \nLet us pass legislation that both helps our kids and is also \nconstitutional.\n\n\n                          explanation of vote\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senate of the reason \nI voted ``present'' on the Faircloth-Sessions amendment relating to a \ncap on attorneys' fees in tobacco cases.\n  I abstained on this vote because my husband's law firm is co-counsel \nin several lawsuits against tobacco companies filed in California state \ncourt by health and welfare trust funds.\n  This Ethics Committee has advised me that voting on an amendment such \nas this ``would not pose an actual conflict of interest'' under the \nSenate Code of Conduct.\n  However, I decided that voting on this amendment could create the \nappearance of a conflict of interest and therefore I abstained by \nvoting ``present.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

He \nserved with great distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives for \n30 years, and he was deeply respected as an influential and prominent \npolitical leader.\n  Tom Abernethy was born in Eupora, MS, on May 16, 1903.

He continued to practice law there and was elected district \nattorney in 1936. He was elected to Congress in 1942.\n  Tom Abernethy became a close friend and an adviser to me. I sought \nhis advice on matters involving agriculture, the Natchez Trace Parkway, \nand many other issues of importance to me and to our State. I always \nfound his advice and counsel very valuable and helpful.\n  I extend to his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren my \nsincerest condolences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Foreign \nRelations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n235 and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today marks the centennial of the \nPhilippines' independence from Spain and also the 100th anniversary of \nPhilippine-American relations. I urge my colleagues to reflect upon our \nfriendly relationship with the Filipino people and their Republic.\n  The Sun and Stars, the flag of the Republic of the Philippines, has \nonce again been unfurled on the same balcony where General Emilio \nAguinaldo declared the country's independence, overthrowing 300 years \nof Spanish colonization on June 12, 1898.\n  With that act by General Aguinaldo, Filipinos earned the distinct \nhonor of being the first indigenous people in Asia to wrest their \nfreedom and independence by force of arms from their European colonial \nmasters.\n  The Philippine Centennial is a toast to the Filipino spirit, to the \nrebirth of a courageous nation, to Asia's first republic and \nconstitutional democracy, and to a glorious and progressive future for \nthe Filipino Nation.\n  There is no better time than now to recognize the enduring friendship \nbetween our two countries. It is a friendship which flourished despite \ntragic beginnings in a conflict first with the Spanish in 1898, and \nsubsequently with Filipino independence fighters. But we moved beyond \nthat struggle and worked diligently to grant full Philippine \nindependence in 1946.\n\n  During World War II, Filipino troops fought bravely side-by-side with \nAmerican forces and Filipino guerrilla fighters were indispensable in \nthe liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation.\n  The Philippines continued, even after independence, to be America's \nmost important ally in Asia, again contributing troops to the Korean \nconflict and to the Vietnam war.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude, if not more, to our Filipino friends. We \nrejoiced when the peaceful ``people power'' revolution restored \ndemocracy to the Philippines twelve years ago. Presidents Corazon \nAquino and Fidel Ramos established a democratic government and \ninstituted market-based reforms which placed the Philippines--\npolitically and economically--on a strong foundation for the 21st \ncentury.\n  I am confidant that newly elected President, Joseph Estrada, will \ncontinue to nurture these reforms. The Multilateral Aid Initiative for \nthe Philippines that Congress launched following the ``people power'' \nrevolution was an effort not only to demonstrate support for Filipino \ndemocracy but also to show our lasting commitment to an enduring \nrelationship with the Philippines. This continues to be the basis for \nour policy, and it is instructive that during the current Asian \nfinancial crisis the Philippines has escaped the worst effects of the \ncrisis.\n  The United States continues to be the largest trading partner and \nforeign investor in the Philippines. One-third of Philippines' exports \ncome to America. Two-way trade between our two countries exceeds $12 \nbillion.\n  Today, all Americans should honor our good friendship with the \nPhilippines on this important commemoration of their independence, \nsupport their continued political and economic progress, and work to \nmaintain the special and close relationship between our sister \ndemocracies. The Philippines has clearly become a positive role model \nfor its Asian neighbors.\n  Mr. President, because of the deep and enduring ties that have \ntradionally bound the people of the Philippines and the United States \ntogether, I strongly urge our colleagues to adopt S. Res. 235, a \nresolution commemorating 100 years of friendly relations between the \npeople of the United States and the Philippines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and the \npreamble be agreed to, en bloc, and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is the last day that the Spring page class will be \nwith us. And I am going to take a moment to recognize and thank this \nfine group of young people for their invaluable assistance in the \nSenate. Their hard work keeps the Senate running smoothly on a day-to-\nday basis. All of our pages are accomplished students and involved in \ntheir schools and communities. However, I would like to specifically \ncommend the page from my home State of Washington, Sina Nazemi, for his \noutstanding efforts. Even among this class of exceptional young people \nSina has set himself apart.\n  Over the last 6 months I have had the opportunity to get to know Sina \nand while I recognized that he was a fine student and a personable \nyoung man, I have also learned that Sina is rather secretive. After six \nmonths of working in the Senate, today I learned that his peers chose \nSina to serve as President of the page class. Today, the faculty and \nprincipal at the page school also recognized Sina with the Leadership \nAward and the Good Citizen Award. What initially prompted my \nrecognition of Sina was his winning essay in the 1998 Law Day Essay \nCompetition sponsored by the District of Columbia Courts and The Bar \nAssociation of the District of Columbia, which I only learned of last \nweek.\n  Sina's essay is a well written piece on the importance of the first \namendment that draws heavily on his first hand experience as an \nimmigrant from Iran. He writes that the first amendment creates ``a \nbattlefield of ideas which allows the best ideas to emerge''. I hope he \nwas at least in part inspired by the ``battlefield of ideas'' that is \nevident each day on the Senate floor.\n  In addition to serving as class president, Sina kept pace with the \nrigorous academics at the Page School and the work schedule of the \nSenate. We keep these kids working so hard that Sina didn't even have \nthe whole week of Easter recess off. I held an education forum in the \nstate that week, and Sina served admirably as the moderator and \nspokesperson for the student group. All of this is done with diligence \nand enthusiasm. Sina has a great deal to be proud of yet, the modesty \nhe shows reflect maturity beyond his years. These attributes will \nundoubtedly serve him well in his future. Sina, you have my best wishes \nand thanks for your service to the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say farewell to a wonderful \ngroup of young men and women who have served as Senate pages over the \nlast five months, and thank them for the contributions they make to the \nday-to-day operations of the Senate.\n  This particular group of pages has served with distinction and has \ndone a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their \nstudies and to this body.\n  Page life is not easy. I suspect few people understand the rigorous \nnature of the page's work. On a typical day, pages rise early and are \nin school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours in school each morning, \npages then report to the Capitol to prepare the Senate Chamber for the \nday's session.\n  Throughout the day, pages are called upon to perform a wide array of \ntasks--from obtaining copies of documents and reports for Senators to \nuse during debate, to running errands between the Capitol and the \nSenate office buildings, to lending a hand at our weekly conference \nluncheons.\n  Once we finish our business here for the day--no matter what time--\nthe pages return to the dorm to prepare for the next day's classes and \nSenate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep.\n  Even with all of this, they continually discharge their tasks \nefficiently and cheerfully.\n  This page class had the good fortune to be present on the Senate \nfloor for several landmark votes, including NATO expansion and IRS \nreform.\n  I hope before they leave they will see us pass a comprehensive \nnational bill to reduce teen smoking.\n  It seems to me that would be a fitting way to thank these particular \nyoung people for their service to their country.\n  I hope every person in this page class gained some insight into the \nneed for individuals to become involved in community and civic \nactivities.\n  The future of our nation strongly depends on the generations who will \nfollow us in this august body.\n  I look forward to the possibility that one or more of this fine group \nof young people will return as a Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record the names and \nhometowns of each of the Senate pages to whom we are saying goodbye \ntoday.\n  They are: Philip Amylon, North Scituate, RI; Sarah Argue, Little \nRock, AR; Marisa Boling, LaCrosse, WI; Sara Cannon, Seaford, DE; Colin \nDavis, Sioux Falls, SD; Laney Fitzgerald, Montgomery, AL; Sarah Flynn, \nNashua, NH; Sarah Fowler, Kansas City, MO; Julia Le, Wilbraham, MA; \nBari Lurie, Milwaukee, WI; Monique Luse, Farmington Hills, MI; Shana \nMarshall, Scottsburg, IN; Josh Melgaard, Pierre, SD; Sina Nazemi, \nWoodinville, WA; Georgia Sheridan, Santa Fe, NM; Michael Stahler, \nLyndonville, VT; Angela Swanson, Springville, UT; Dan Teague, Concord, \nNH; Amanda Anderson, SC; Ashley Anderson, SC; Hunter Holmes, SC; Erin \nLindsay, SC; Jennifer Lowry, UT; Stacie Seigler, SC; Tamarah Siegel, \nRI; and Bradley Wolters, WI.\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\n  I am sure all of my colleagues--I know all of my colleagues join me \nin thanking these fine young men and women and wish them well as they \nproceed to a new phase of their life.

Mr. President, I want to take this body on a quick trip to \nthe other part of the world to talk very briefly about what is \nhappening in Southeast Asia, Japan, China, Russia, and how it is \nimpacting and affecting all of us in this country, how it will affect \nthe geopolitical economic dynamics the rest of this year and on into \nthe next year and, actually, on into the next century.\n  We start at Southeast Asia where the Asian crisis has become a \nsignificant crisis, stretching past that region of the world, now up \ninto Japan, where we find in Japan that its economic planning agency \nconfirmed that Japan is now in a serious recession. Last quarter, Japan \nfound that its economy fell by an annualized rate of 5.3 percent. The \nyen is at an 8-year low against the dollar. The yen has dropped 50 \npercent in 3 years. The Japanese find themselves essentially without a \ncredible banking system.\n  The President of South Korea was here this week addressing a joint \nmeeting of Congress. Some of us had an opportunity to meet with him \nprivately to talk about South Korea, what it is going to take to build \nSouth Korea back--infrastructure reconstruction, currency \nreconstruction, investment reconstruction.\n  Let's go further around that loop of the world to Russia. I spent \nsome time yesterday with the Russian Ambassador to the United States. \nThe two of us spoke for more than an hour alone. Russia has immense \neconomic problems, and when Russia has immense economic problems and \nJapan has immense economic problems, as does South Korea, Southeast \nAsia, that spills over on to all of us.\n  China announced yesterday that it may have to devalue its currency. I \nwas in China in December and met with the Premier. At that time, he \nassured me--and Senator Chafee from Rhode Island was with me--that \nunder no circumstances would China devalue its currency, and that has \nbeen China's position all along. But the dynamics of the economic \nimpact and the consequences of the Southeast Asian crisis have become \nso severe that it is now taking a rather significant toll on all those \nnations, including China, Japan, and Russia.\n  Our markets yesterday in the United States went down 160 points. The \nDow Jones dropped yesterday, and as of this hour, our market in New \nYork is down well over 100 points.\n  What does this tell us? If we listen to farmers and ranchers, as I do \nin Nebraska, and exporters and people who understand the realities and \nthe importance of exports and the fact that economies are linked and \nstability is linked to economies and to economic growth, security is \npart of that and confidence underpins all of that.\n  When nations and investors lose confidence in markets, they are \nsending a very direct signal to all of us. They are saying clearly, \nplainly, ``Something's wrong.'' We must understand that even though \nthis is a half a world away, it is impacting us today all over this \ncountry, and it will continue to very severely impact our growth, our \neconomy, our opportunities, and our markets. And as this economic \ninstability and unrest continues to unfold and deepen and widen, it \nwill require a longer time and more resources and more investment and \nmore attention and more leadership to put it back together.\n  I am very concerned, Mr. President, that this Congress is not paying \nenough attention to what is going on around the world. I am concerned \nthat we are not linking it, we are not interconnecting the dots. I find \nit remarkable that on this floor, the floor of the U.S. Senate, the \nlast few weeks we have been consumed with billions of dollars of new \ntaxes, building a larger Government, when essentially half of the world \nis burning.\n  I hope that our colleagues in the House take a rather serious look at \nwhat is going on around the world. I strongly recommend to our friends \nand colleagues in the House that they start with looking at the IMF. \nThe IMF is not, cannot be, will not be, should not be, never was \nintended to be, the rescuer of all economies and all problems. But if \nwe in this Congress continue to turn our backs on what is going on \naround the world, we will pay a high price.\n  We are paying a high price now. When you ask any farmer or rancher or \nexporter--not just in the Midwest, not just in my State of Nebraska, \nbut all over the country--whether this is affecting them, we will pay a \nhigh price when it comes to military issues, strategic issues, as \nSecretary of Defense Bill Cohen warned earlier this year, as Secretary \nof State Madeleine Albright has warned earlier this year. Chairman \nGreenspan talked about it this week. Secretary of Treasury Rubin talked \nabout it this week. We are playing a very dangerous game here. And the \nlonger we lock up, the longer we lock up important decisions on IMF, \nand other issues that we should be tending to and focusing on, the more \ndangerous this world becomes.\n  I hope my friends in the House are going to unlock this debate on IMF \nand allow this IMF debate to come to the floor of the House for an \nhonest, open debate, and a vote. There has been a lot of misinformation \nspread around about IMF--what it does, what it does not do.\n  I recall specifically, Mr. President, in our meeting with President \nKim, the President of South Korea, he brought up IMF and he said this: \n``I don't like a lot of what IMF is forcing us to do, but without IMF \nwe wouldn't do it. And if we didn't do it, we would have a complete \nbreakdown of all financial discipline, and there would be some question \nas to whether we could dig ourselves out of where we are.''\n  I say these things knowing full well that these are complex, \ncomplicated issues. And there is not one answer to these. But surely, \ncumulatively, all of the pieces must come together, like the United \nStates stepping up to its world responsibilities. And the IMF is one of \nthose. And at the same time, Mr. President, this body, committees in \nthis body will be debating--have been debating--more sanctions on \nnations. We are imposing more sanctions on countries today than we ever \nhave in the history of America.\n  We cannot do much about the sanctions that the President was forced \nto impose on India and Pakistan. That is law. Do we really believe, for \nexample, that that helps the situation by pushing India and Pakistan \nfurther away, and in Pakistan's case, in particular, grinding them down \nfurther and further into economic despair? Does that really improve the \npossibility that we are going to be able to resolve some of these \nissues--deadly, deadly issues--to continually isolate some of these \ncountries, but, more importantly, isolating ourselves by sanctions? I \ndo not think so. There is talk about more sanctions for China.\n  I hope we get very serious about this, Mr. President, and understand \nthe consequences of what is happening around the world.\n  Confidence, courage, leadership, doing the right thing, making the \ntough choices--that is what makes the difference; always has made the \ndifference. Imperfect possibilities? Imperfect choices? Absolutely. But \nwe must make some choices. We must lead, just like Bosnia, just like \nKosovo--bad choices all. But the longer we let, for example, Kosovo go \nwithout making any decisions, without making any choices, we run a \nterrible risk of great conflagration in that area.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n  I am grateful for an opportunity to share some of my thoughts on \nthese issues because they are real, they are not theoretical. They \nimpact our Nation, the world, our opportunities, and the future. We \nmake decisions today, not to deal with problems today, we make \ndecisions today to deal with problems tomorrow. The future is connected \nto our leadership, and we must act.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to the \nHarley-Davidson Motor Company on this great American company's 95th \nanniversary.\n  As a long time Harley-Davidson rider, I have enjoyed many years of \nsatisfaction with the company and its legendary machines. After a long \nday on Capitol Hill, there is nothing I enjoy more than firing up my \nSoftail Custom. I even had one of my two official Congressional \nportraits taken with my Softail in front of our nation's Capitol. When \nI am back home in Colorado, I tool around on my black Road King, often \nwith my wife Linda, who also has her own Heritage Softail Classic.\n  I can tell you that there is no better way to enjoy Colorado's great \nscenic beauty than from the saddle of a Harley-Davidson. The freedom of \nthe open road and the often imitated, but never duplicated, throaty \nroar of an American-made machine is something that I have thoroughly \nenjoyed for countless thousands of miles.\n  Harley-Davidson not only makes great motorcycles; it also exemplifies \nthe kind of company that I am proud to support. From its humble \nbeginnings in a small 10 foot by 15 foot shed in a Milwaukee backyard \nin 1903, this company had its share of good times and bad. The Great \nDepression was a major blow to the American motorcycle industry, and \nwhen the dust finally cleared Harley-Davidson was one of only two U.S. \nmotorcycle manufacturers left standing.\n  And it is a good thing that Harley-Davidson survived because when \nWorld War Two erupted, our country needed to call on Harley-Davidson to \nbuild bikes for U.S. and Allied troops during WW-II. Many of the orders \nand other messages needed to achieve victory would not have been \ndelivered to the front lines if it had not been for brave G.I. \nmessengers riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n  Following the Allied victory in World War Two, the Harley-Davidson \nCompany refocused on developing new styles of motorcycles for the \nAmerican people to enjoy. The company's second generation of management \nbrought fresh ideas that helped usher-in the celebrated ``motorcycle \nculture'' of the 1950's and 60's.\n  When Harley-Davidson hit a rough patch of road in the 1980's it was a \ndaring combination of re-found independence, innovation and serious \nreengineering that brought this legendary company back from the brink. \nHarley-Davidson successfully carried out a classic textbook comeback \nthat exemplifies many of our nation's best traits: independence, \ndaring, grit, tenacity, smarts, and a penchant for continuous \ninnovation and progress while remaining firmly rooted in our heritage.\n  On that note, I conclude my tribute to the people of Harley-Davidson \nwith my congratulations on 95 great years while looking forward to many \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6292-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL WOMEN IN BUSINESS ADVOCATE AWARD FOR 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my privilege to call to my \ncolleagues' attention the recent announcement by the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration that Ms. Bernadette Martinelli of Park City, \nUtah, has been named the National Women in Business Advocate for 1998. \nI am sure all senators will agree that she is well-deserving of this \nprestigious award.\n  In November 1992, Ms. Martinelli founded the Park City Women's \nBusiness Network. As the owner of ``Blinds of Bern,'' she observed that \na lack of educational and networking opportunities stifled the \nentrepreneurial potential for many women in the Park City area.\n  Bernadette Martinelli decided to make a difference. In founding the \nPark City Womens' Business Network, she has brought women small \nbusiness owners together to meet one another, to share ideas, and to \nlearn techniques for improving productivity. The results have been \nnothing short of remarkable. These efforts have helped launch the \ncreation and fuel the expansion of many women-owned businesses in Utah.\n  Ms. Martinelli's organization also fulfills an important role in the \ncommunity. Members volunteer their time speaking to high school \nstudents about entrepreneurial careers and providing indispensable \nmentoring programs for interested students. The Park City Womens' \nBusiness Network has also established an all-important ``Future \nEntrepreneur'' scholarship, awarded annually to a female high school \ngraduate to help her to reach her goal of business ownership.\n  Ms. Martinelli has accomplished all of this through great personal \nsacrifice and perserverance. In the past few years, she found the \nstrength to build her business, establish the networking organization, \nand to care for her children and her husband who is battling cancer.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of Bernadette Martinelli's achievements and \ngrateful for her many contributions to the growth of small businesses \nin the state of Utah and to the opening of doors and possibilities for \nthe next generation.\n  I join with the U.S. Small Business Administration and small business \nleaders around the nation in congratulating Ms. Martinelli. I ask all \nSenators to join me in saluting her for this well-earned national \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6292-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6292-S6295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5397.

A bill to encourage States to require a holding period for \nany student expelled for bringing a gun to school; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                            gun legislation\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.  Mr. President, these tragic incidents involving students \nbringing guns to school have taught us that we must proceed on two \ntracks. Government's first responsibility is to protect our citizens, \nparticularly our young people, from violence. The only way to do that \nwhen a student brings a gun to school is to get them out of the \nclassroom, off the streets, and in front of someone who is in the best \nposition to determine what steps to take. The legislation I am \nintroducing today with Senator Gordon Smith will help that happen.\n\n  Mr. President, all over my state people are calling out for help. The \nSpringfield Chief of Police and the Governor both recognize that the \nway we currently deal with kids and guns is not working. These kids are \nslipping through the cracks--only to resurface in deadly and dangerous \nways. Mr. President, our current policies are not working. They are not \nserving anyone. Simply put, when it comes to kids bringing guns to \nschool, we can and must do a better job. We must stop the violence \nbefore it spreads across one more school yard. The memorial fence at \nThurston High School is the last memorial fence I ever want to see--in \nSpringfield, Oregon, in Pearl Mississippi, in Jonesboro, Arkansas--or \nanywhere else in the country. Let it end here.\n  Today, Senator Smith and I are introducing legislation that \nencourages states to pass laws to require a student who brings a gun to \nschool to be held for up to 72 hours and undergo a psychological \nevaluation. If a state adopts such a law, the state would be eligible \nfor an increase of 25% in the Juvenile Justice funds that would enable \nit to provide the type of psychological evaluation and other treatment \nthat such a student needs.\n  Bringing a gun to school is a warning sign that must be taken \nseriously. And while so-called ``zero tolerance policies'' that mandate \na student be expelled for bringing a gun to school may adequately \npunish the behavior, they are clearly not enough. We must offer \nservices to this student--see what is going on in that student's head \nand help them through the rough spots. We must find a balance between \npreventing these crimes from occurring and punishing them once they do.\n  Voters in Oregon are tough on juvenile crime, especially serious \ncrimes. We have the minimum sentences. We have the prisons. We do not \nallow juveniles probation or parole. We do not release juveniles early \nfor good behavior. What Oregon needs is a system that works from the \nbeginning--when the warning signs appear, not just at the end, when \nharm has been done. Oregon needs resources to identify these kids and \nhelp them before there's an arrest to be made. Across the country the \nmessage is spoken loud and clear: punishment, while important, is only \npart of the solution. It does not save lives. Prevention does.\n  Mr. President, my bill will help communities better identify and \nservice students at-risk of endangering themselves or others with a \nfirearm. My bill gives everyone involved--teachers, public school \nadministrators, law enforcement, police officers and juvenile justice \nprofessions--the tools they need to get a troubled student the help he \nor she needs. Under the State laws my bill would promote, when a \nstudent brings a gun to school, the public school must report this \nbehavior to law enforcement and the juvenile authorities immediately. \nPolice must then come to the school and determine if there is probable \ncause to take action. If there is cause to take action, the police must \nbring the student into the station for two purposes: first, the student \nmust have a mental health professional give him or her a psychological \nevaluation, and second, the student must immediately be scheduled for a \njudicial hearing. The State has up to 72 hours to complete these \nintervention measures. States pass a law following these parameters \nwill receive a significant bonus: they will receive 25 percent more \nmoney to spend on juvenile prevention and intervention services.\n  Mr. President, no one wishes to see the tragedy at Thurston High \nSchool repeated. It is my hope that this legislation will give States \nthe incentive they need to enact tough preventative detention laws to \nassure that this doesn't happen again. I ask unanimous consent that my \nstatement and a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nHannibal Courier-Post on it's 160th Anniversary. Several years ago, a \nCourier-Post reporter, Gene Hoenes, was quoted as saying, ``People \nlisten to facts announced on the radio and see news on television, but \nthey don't really believe it until they read it in the newspaper.''\n  From the beginning, this newspaper has provided important information \nfor the people of Hannibal in my home State of Missouri. In the early \ndays, just about anyone who had a cause started a paper, although few \nsurvived. Eventually, several of the small and struggling papers merged \ninto what is now the Hannibal Courier-Post, the oldest existing \nnewspaper in Missouri.\n  It is truly impressive that Hannibal Courier-Post is having it's \n160th Anniversary. I commend all of the people who have helped to make \nthe Courier-Post succeed throughout it's many years of \nexistence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6305-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6305-S6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATHY WEMHOFF\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my Idaho \nconstituents, Kathy Wemhoff. With Flag Day quickly approaching on June \n14th, I wanted to congratulate Kathy on being the Idaho state winner of \nThe Citizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest. Kathy won a scholarship and \nwent on to compete in the national competition.\n  Her essay, titled, ``The American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right \nof the People * * * The Right Thing to Do'' focuses on the importance \nof the American flag to all citizens and discusses reasons why we \nshould have a flag protection amendment. I think she has done an \nexcellent job of making the case for protecting the flag, and I\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nrecommend her essay to every member of the Senate.\n  I feel strongly about the protection of this flag. It is a beacon to \nus--a reminder of those who died for us and the values that unite us. \nAs we near U.S. Flag Day, I'd like to remind the Senate of the already-\nproposed amendment to protect our flag and ask all my colleagues to \nsupport this important matter. Kathy's feelings are shared by most \nAmericans. Let's not ignore them. Let's support them and build our \nnation's pride! Let me now read Kathy's essay:\n\nThe American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People * * * The \n                           Right Thing To Do\n\n       I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of \n     American. . .'' Every day, millions of voices speak these \n     words first published in ``Youth's Companion'' on September \n     8, 1892: voices belonging to the men of the armed forces, \n     school children, and the citizens of the United States of \n     America. The pledge, written for the National Public Schools \n     Celebration of Columbus Day, became enormously popular in a \n     very short time. On Columbus Day of that year, only one month \n     after its publication, more than twelve million school \n     children took the pledge (Quaife 154). The birth of the \n     pledge and its enormous success demonstrate the importance \n     that the American populace place on the flag.\n       The pledge must hold some special meaning for such a great \n     number of people to believe and repeat these words daily. No \n     words could be clearer than those of the Pledge of \n     Allegiance. Every man, woman, and child who repeats the words \n     not only understands them, but also lives by them. The people \n     are voicing their loyalty to and belief in the nation and its \n     flag as they put their hands to their hearts. Even centuries \n     after the nation's establishment, the flag remains a symbol \n     of the United States and the freedom of the people who reside \n     within.\n       Symbols have substantial importance in this world, but what \n     exactly is a symbol? A symbol may be an object or idea which \n     suggests some other more distinguished idea by reason of \n     relationship, association, or convention. A Christmas tree or \n     stockings, for example, are symbols heavily depended upon by \n     most people. Few can imagine Christmas without a tree or \n     stockings. The symbol relates the person to that event or \n     object which would otherwise seem unimportant. Without the \n     flag to represent the dedication, honor, and freedom of the \n     United States, we the people will lose our faith in the \n     country. The flag reminds the citizens of their freedom and \n     the soldiers who fought and died for that freedom. The flag, \n     so admirable fluttering in the air, must be preserved from \n     the elements and protected from desecration. The thought of \n     the flag torn and dirtied by carelessness or hatred turns the \n     stomachs of the people who look to the flag with admiration. \n     Not only can this behavior be labeled unjust to the flag, \n     but also to the country and all its people. The need for a \n     law to protect the flag from inequitable harm has arisen, \n     for the flag is relied upon as the national symbol of \n     freedom.\n       Old Glory, millions of times unraveled and sewn again since \n     Independence Day, July 4, 1776, remains for the most part \n     preserved and protected throughout the country (Quaife 109). \n     People young and old care for the flag as if it were a \n     delicate vase shielded from all harm for many centuries, \n     carrying it in from the rain, never letting it touch the \n     ground, and even guarding it with rifles. When the flag \n     rises, American citizens young and old stand and salute it to \n     show their respect for what it represents: honor, nobility, \n     and the individual soldiers who fought for our freedoms: of \n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (Berkin 425). \n     These freedoms are extremely important, yet often taken \n     advantage of.\n       There remains an exception to the behavior that most \n     possess around the flag; people may desecrate it without \n     punishment. No law exists at this time to protect the flag \n     from ill treatment. Those who desire to fight in the flag's \n     honor can do so by joining forces with all our nations' \n     people and fighting for the creation of a law to protect and \n     preserve it. The Constitution and laws of the country are \n     made by the people, and for the people; therefore, the people \n     have the right to fight for the protection of the American \n     flag. Not a law of one town or of one state, but a law of the \n     nation should be created: an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution guarding against desecration of our nation's \n     symbol of freedom.\n       The American Flag remains protected from ``disloyal \n     utterances'' by the Sedition Act, passed in 1918, but holds \n     no personal amendment or act to prevent it from being \n     physically damaged (Berkin 425). An amendment with strength \n     will uphold the credibility of the flag, saving it the \n     humility of desecration or desertion. A simple and unadorned, \n     yet specifically detailed amendment will hold anyone \n     disrespectful to the flag's rights in contempt of the nation. \n     Any purposeful act of aggression against the flag, such as \n     dragging it in the dirt or burning it, would result in heavy \n     punishment. The guidelines of what exactly would be \n     punishable would be stated in the Flag Amendment; the Supreme \n     Court would have the authority to enforce punishment when \n     these laws were violated.\n       A decision of the court may be based upon much of the same \n     facts as was the case ``United States vs. O'Brien, 1968'' \n     when four young men burned their draft cards in protest of \n     the Vietnam War. The O'Brien case dealt with the issue of \n     symbolic speech, whether or not certain actions should be \n     allowed to fall under the First Amendment's guarantee of free \n     speech (McClenaghan 118). Burning a flag or desecrating one \n     in any other manner would follow the court ruling of the \n     O'Brien case; a limitless variety of conduct cannot be \n     labeled ``speech''; therefore, unacceptable behavior toward \n     the flag can be punishable by law. The flag, protected by the \n     First Amendment under symbolic speech, would then also have \n     an amendment that described the limits of what behavior would \n     be acceptable in its handling and what punishment could be \n     given in the event of its desecration.\n       The flag, for so many reasons, deserves and needs \n     protection from desecration and misuse. Since the majority of \n     the nation's people view the flag as a symbol of their \n     freedom, it deserves an amendment to recognize and protect \n     it. The need for this amendment exists because of the few \n     people of the nation who cannot respect the flag or look to \n     it as a symbol of their freedom. All citizens should support \n     the cause of creating an amendment to protect the flag from \n     dishonor. It is of great importance to have a symbol of the \n     nation's freedom and unity so that the people do not forget \n     or take advantage of the rights they possess by living in \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/12/senate-section/article/S6305-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3978\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.
