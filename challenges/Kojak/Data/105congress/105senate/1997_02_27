Following \n90 minutes of debate on Senator Graham's amendment, a vote will occur \non or in relation to the Graham amendment at approximately 12:30 p.m.\n  Following that vote, Senator Feingold will be recognized to debate on \none of his amendments, and we will continue debate on several pending \namendments with those votes stacked this afternoon. I do not believe we \nhave an exact time agreed to yet when that will occur. We will notify \nthe Members, when we have the 12:30 vote, when the next vote will \nactually occur.\n  Following those stacked votes, we will turn to Senator Bumpers' \namendment, with additional rollcall votes expected during today's \nsession. We will also, hopefully, get a final agreement on all the \namendments that may be offered, and then we will be able to give the \nMembers some information about what to expect, if anything, on Friday \nand also on Monday.\n  Even though we had some disappointment yesterday with one of the \nSenators who indicated he would be voting for this amendment last year \nand now has indicated he will not, I encourage my colleagues to \nremember the vote has not been taken yet, and I still am hopeful that \nwe are going to find a way to have the number of votes, the 67, that is \nrequired to pass this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. \nWe are still working on it, and I am looking forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida.

The clerk will report the \npending amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       An amendment (No. 7), previously proposed by the Senator \n     from Florida [Mr. Graham] for himself and Mr. Robb:\n       On page 2, line 17, strike ``held by the public''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this amendment, there are 90 minutes \nequally divided. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the balanced \nbudget amendment. I support the amendment. It is an important measure, \nboth to maintain the momentum toward a balanced budget and to assure \nthat, once we have reached a point of balance, we will stay there. For \nfar too long, our Nation has been living on borrowed money, the credit \ncards of our children and our grandchildren. Our children and \ngrandchildren deserve better. They deserve to inherit a nation whose \nfiscal house is in order.\n  Today, every child in America is saddled with a debt at birth of more \nthan $20,000. That debt is growing. I believe strongly that the long-\nterm economic future of our country is in jeopardy. It is in jeopardy \nunless we are able to arrest this mountain of annual deficits and the \ncumulative national debt. Arresting this increase is the only way to \nassure fiscal restraint over the future decades.\n  This administration deserves a great deal of credit. When President \nClinton came into office, he was faced with the largest annual deficit \nin the history of America, $290 billion. Over the past 4 years, that \ndeficit has been reduced to $107 billion--a very significant \naccomplishment. However, a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution can guarantee that future Presidents and future Congresses \ncannot repeat the mistakes of recent history. We cannot do as we have \ndone in the last 20 years, add $4.5 trillion to our national debt.\n  I believe, therefore, that in its current form, the balanced budget \namendment is clearly superior to the alternative, which is the status \nquo that has served us so poorly over the last two decades.\n  That said, I want to point out that the balanced budget amendment as \nit is currently written is, in my judgment, flawed. Section 2 of the \nbalanced budget amendment--and I ask my colleagues who are here today, \nand those who might be watching on television, if they would take this \nopportunity to read section 2--section 2 purports to control the limit \non debt held by the public. But I believe that the complex policy \nimplications of this section make it one of the least understood \nprovisions of this constitutional amendment. Without a doubt, section 2 \nis the key to ensuring the enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment. It has been referred to as the safety lock of the balanced \nbudget amendment. But it simply does not go far enough to control the \ngrowth of the Federal debt, and it denies us some important policy \nobjectives which could be accomplished by the adoption of the amendment \nwhich I offer.\n  I would like to first read the precise language of section 2. Section \n2 states:\n\n       The limit of debt held by the public shall not be increased \n     unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall \n     provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  That is, verbatim, the language of section 2. My amendment would \nstrike four words from section 2. Those words are ``held by the \npublic,'' therefore, leaving the amendment as originally written except \n``the limit of debt shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the \nwhole number.\n  These four words constitute less than a sentence within the balanced \nbudget amendment. They carry with them a number of important policy \nimplications.\n  Under the proposed amendment, three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House would be needed to raise the debt ceiling as it relates \nonly--and I emphasize only--to that debt held by the public, not to the \ntotal Federal debt.\n  This provision will assist in enforcing the balanced budget amendment \nby creating a voting requirement of 40 percent plus 1 to increase the \ndebt. Simply that 41 Senators will refuse to go along with the proposal \nto raise the debt held by the public should serve as a powerful \nenforcement mechanism, but it does not go far enough to halt the growth \nof the Federal debt.\n  Mr. President, let me provide a little background regarding the \ndistinction between debt held by the public, the language that is \ncurrently in section 2, and the total national debt, which would be the \napplication of section 2 if my amendment were adopted.\n  The total national debt, sometimes referred to as debt subject to \nlimit, is divided into two categories: debt held by the public and debt \nthat the Government owes itself.\n  On this chart, the blue section is that portion of our national debt \nwhich is held by the public. Today, it is approximately $3.9 trillion. \nDebt held by the public is that debt which is issued to individuals, \ncorporations, State or local government, the Federal Reserve System, \nforeign governments, and central banks. All of that constitutes debt \nheld by the public which today represents $3.9 trillion.\n  Debt the Government owes to itself is the total of all trust fund \nsurpluses, including those of Social Security, Medicare, and Federal \nretirement programs. Under current law, surpluses in these trust funds \nmust be invested in Federal Government securities. Social Security is \nthe largest of these, currently accounting for $638 billion of trust \nfund balances.\n  Mr. President, the red component of this chart represents the amount \nof the total Federal debt which is owed to the Social Security trust \nfund. Today, it is $638 billion. The green represents the borrowing of \nthe Federal Government from all other Federal trust funds. That number \nhas been, over time, approximately $900 billion. And I have depicted it \non this chart, for purposes of display, as a consistent $900 billion.\n  The total of the Federal Government debt that is not held by the \npublic--that is, that debt which would not be subject to constraint \nunder this amendment--is currently $1.6 trillion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total Federal debt, \nall debt owed by the Federal Government, will be $5.4 trillion at the \nend of this fiscal year.\n  I am not surprised that there is some confusion about this arcane \nsubject of the allocation of the total Federal debt among various \ncategories. That confusion has permeated the committee that reported \nthis bill, it has permeated Members of the executive branch and the \nmedia. Let me just cite some examples of that misunderstanding.\n  Mr. President, on our desks, each Senator has a copy of the report of \nthe Judiciary Committee when it recommended favorably the adoption of \nthe balanced budget amendment. Let me quote from the committee report \non page 20. It states:\n\n       To run a deficit, the Federal Government must borrow funds \n     to cover its obligations. Section 2 removes the borrowing \n     power from the Government, unless three-fifths of the total \n     membership of both Houses vote to raise the debt limit.\n\n  Wrong. This statement is inaccurate, because section 2 does not limit \nthe Government's ability to borrow. In fact, as this chart indicates, \nunder current law and the requirement that the Federal Government \nborrow all of the surpluses that are available from these trust funds, \nby the midpoint of the second decade of the 21st century, the Federal \nGovernment will have an indebtedness of $8.5 trillion, and everything \nabove the blue line can be encumbered by a majority vote of the \nCongress, without the protection of the three-fifths vote. This is not \nspeculation, this is ordained by the laws that we have passed and the \nabsence of a three-fifths vote for all of the debt above the blue line. \nThe Government will borrow almost $2 trillion of additional \nindebtedness between the year 2002 and 2019.\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n  But it is not just our own Judiciary Committee that misunderstands \nthe application of section 2. The Secretary of the Treasury, Robert \nRubin, blurred the distinction in an opinion column he wrote in the \nWashington Post on February 2 of this year, where he said:\n\n       Finally, as we saw in 1995 and 1996, the history of debt \n     limit shows that raising the statutory debt limit is never an \n     easy process. Yet, right now it is possible to raise the debt \n     limit with a simple majority vote in both Houses. By \n     requiring a three-fifths supermajority vote, the amendment \n     would make it far more difficult.\n\n  Again, the Secretary fails to point out the distinction that the \nthree-fifths vote only applies to that portion of the debt which is \nheld by the public, not to that growing portion of debt which is going \nto be represented by borrowings from the surpluses of the Federal trust \nfunds, especially that enormous trust fund of Social Security.\n  Even more, the news media has led the American people to believe that \nthis amendment will provide a safety lock on all future borrowings. The \nFebruary 21, 1997, edition of the Washington Post, for example, \nindicated that ``a three-fifths majority of both Houses would be \nrequired to waive the requirement and to raise the national debt \nlimit.''\n  Wrong. The only three-fifths requirement would be to that dwindling \nportion of the national debt which is represented by that which we \nborrow from the general public and would not apply to the indebtedness \nwhich we borrow, essentially, from ourselves through the Federal \nsurpluses in trust funds.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we should deliver to the American \npeople what the American people expect. They expect an amendment that \nwould provide for control on the total national debt. That is what we \nhave led them to believe we are considering.\n  Probably one of the most commonly used examples of our runaway \nnational debt is the debt clock. It is not on the floor today, but it \nwas in the Judiciary Committee on the day that I testified in favor of \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  What are the numbers on that clock? The numbers on that clock are not \nthe numbers that reflect debt held by the public. The numbers on that \nclock are those that are consistent with the national debt of $5.4 \ntrillion. That is the debt that the American people have been led by us \nto believe that we are trying to control.\n  I believe that in order to avoid further adding to the skepticism and \ncynicism of the American people, we ought to give them an amendment \nwhich is consistent with what they believe we are providing to them \nbecause that is what we have told them we are trying to accomplish.\n  Unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, we should pass a \nbalanced budget amendment that meets the expectations of the American \npeople and places a constraint on total national debt.\n  It will be to those who wish to use their portion of the time to \noppose my amendment to explain what that compelling national interest \nis that says that we should only limit one segment of the national debt \nand should let the other balloon to an $8.5 trillion national debt \nwithin the lifetime of most of the people who are in this room and \nlistening to this on television.\n  I find no such compelling reason. I find, to the contrary, powerful \nreasons to deliver an amendment that the people expect. Not only would \nsuch an amendment be consistent with our representations and the \nexpectations of the American people, this amendment would have some \npowerful policy benefits.\n  First, it would have the effect of avoiding another massive increase \nin national debt. Adopting the amendment that I offer would say that as \nof the effective date, the year 2002, that rather than have the then \n$6.7 trillion continue to grow to $8.5 trillion, that $6.7 trillion--an \nenormous, staggering national debt as it is--at least would become the \nplateau for our national debt, that we would not allow further growth \nin our total debt without a three-fifths vote of the Congress to do so. \nI believe that would be a tremendous benefit to the American people.\n  I would like to talk about some of the other policy implications that \nare involved in subjecting total national debt, as opposed to only that \ncomponent of debt held by the public, to the three-fifths requirement.\n  Applying the three-fifths restraint to debt held by the public is \ngoing to create an unintended consequence. That unintended consequence \nis that there will be an incentive to borrow from these trust funds \nbecause you can borrow from the trust funds by a majority vote. It \ntakes a three-fifths vote to issue debt to the public. Therefore, the \nlikelihood is that we will see, as the chart indicates, a dramatic \nexpansion in the proportion of our national debt which is held by these \ntrust funds.\n  Those who are concerned about the long-term security of Social \nSecurity ought to be very concerned when they see that not only is the \nnational debt rising to $8.5 trillion, and every one of those trillion \ndollars will require in the range of $65 to $75 billion a year in debt \nservice, but also they will see that we have not accomplished what the \nGreenspan commission in 1983 contemplated would be accomplished in \nterms of the use of the Social Security surpluses.\n  Let me just divert for a moment to go back to where we were in the \nlate 1970's and the early 1980's.\n  Up until that time Social Security was a pay-as-you-go system. Every \nyear the Congress would look at the amount of money that was likely to \nbe required to meet obligations in the next year, would examine how \nmuch was coming into the trust fund and, if there was a gap, would \nappropriate what was required in order to meet that year's obligations \nfor Social Security.\n  There was recognition that as our demographics were changing and \nlarger and larger numbers of people were coming into the Social \nSecurity system and they were living longer and therefore utilizing the \nsystem for more years, that that pay-as-you-go system was a certain \nrailroad track to disaster.\n  So in 1983, under President Reagan, a commission was established to \nlook at the long-term well-being of Social Security. That commission \nrecommended that the United States adopt a system, which is used by \nmost other industrialized countries which have a Social Security \nSystem, that rather than have a pay-as-you-go program, we would have a \nprogram in which the Social Security System would consciously and \npurposefully operate in a surplus position during those years when \nthere was relatively less demand on the system so that when the demand \nincreased, there would be a pool of resources in order to meet those \nadditional obligations of the Federal Government to America's retirees.\n  This all occurred at a time when we were still operating in the \nnational tradition of relatively modest national debt. As recently as \n1980, we had a national debt of less than $1 trillion. That was the \nenvironment in which the Greenspan commission was making its \nrecommendations.\n  So what did they expect we would do with all of these surpluses that \ntheir proposal was directing be accumulated in order to have a pool of \nresources to meet future demands? What they contemplated was that the \nSocial Security surpluses would be used to buy down the debt held by \nthe public. In fact, their calculations in the early 1980's were that \nwe would have virtually eliminated the debt held by the public, the \nsurpluses in Social Security would have been so great.\n  What they failed to anticipate was the fact that we would lose all \nthis tradition of fiscal discipline in the country and would go into an \nunprecedented period of a binge of deficits that would escalate our \nnational debt from less than $1 trillion to today's $5.4 trillion.\n  My amendment will return us to what was the expectation of the \nGreenspan commission, albeit not to the extent that they had \ncontemplated because conditions are different in 1997 than they were in \n1983.\n  What we will be doing with this amendment is we will be not adding to \nthe national debt through the additions to the Social Security surplus, \nbut rather will be buying down the debt which is currently held by the \npublic so that when we reach the point that we will start making \nsubstantial payments to the baby-boomer wave of retirees, we will be \noperating from a\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\ndramatically lower level of total national debt and an equally \ndramatically lower level of debt held by the public.\n  If you are concerned about the security of the Social Security \nSystem, if you want to say, ``I want to have a balanced budget \namendment, but I don't want to have a balanced budget amendment that is \nexcessively complex which is written in statutory terms rather than \nconstitutional terms,'' my friends, I would suggest that the way to \naccomplish all of those objectives and to do what the commission that \ngave us our current Social Security System contemplated is to adopt my \namendment and direct that these Social Security surpluses will not be \nused as the basis of new national debt but rather will be used as the \nbasis for substitution for the debt that is currently held by the \npublic.\n  In my opinion, and representing a State which has proportionately \nmore Social Security beneficiaries than any other State in the Nation, \nthis is the way to protect Social Security at the same time we protect \nour grandchildren against an enormous layering on of additional debt.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered would eliminate the \ncurrent amendment's incentive to excessively borrow from Social \nSecurity because all national debt, whether it is held by the general \npublic or held from internal accounts such as Social Security, will be \ntreated equally in terms of the three-fifths requirement in order to \nexceed the level of debt that existed in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that this is a somewhat difficult subject \nmatter, however, it is critical subject matter if we are to accomplish \nour objective of providing to the American people what they believe \nthey are getting from this balanced budget amendment, to save the \nAmerican people almost $2 trillion in debt between now and the year \n2019.\n\n  I point out, Mr. President, that all of the numbers I have used in \nthese charts are numbers that have been provided by the Congressional \nBudget Office. They are the numbers that we as Members of Congress are \nobligated to use in our budget analysis in our budgetary decisions.\n  Mr. President, I believe, in summary, that there are five reasons why \nwe should adopt this amendment. It is honest. It limits debt as it has \nbeen defined historically. It is the same definition of debt that we \nuse when we have to periodically pass resolutions to raise the national \ndebt. We are raising the total national debt limit, not just that \ncomponent that is held by the public. We will be doing what the \nAmerican people think they have directed us to do.\n  Second, it is fiscally conservative. It will prevent adding another \n$2 trillion to the national debt in the next 25 years. In fact, this \namendment is the most conservative of any amendment which is currently \nbeing considered by the Senate.\n  Third, it is simple. It does not add complex additional theories to \nthe balanced budget amendment. It deletes words which may appear to be \nbenign but which, in my opinion, have serious negative policy \nimplications when we only restrict the national debt to that held by \nthe public.\n  Fourth, it will have a very positive impact on the Nation's economy. \nIt will release the $2 trillion, which under the amendment, the \nbalanced budget amendment section 2 language that is currently before \nthe Senate, will be used to fund additional national debt, will become \n$2 trillion that can be used to invest in the private sector, \ncontribute to lower interest rates, stimulating economy growth and more \njobs.\n  When the Social Security surpluses are used to buy down the debt held \nby the public, less private capital will be tied up in Government \nborrowing. Those private investment resources will be redirected to the \nprivate sector, creating positive economic growth.\n  Fifth, it will protect the Social Security from those in Congress who \nwould exploit its unique standing as the easiest source of capital from \nwhich to borrow. Social Security trust funds will be treated equally \nand fairly under my amendment with all other sources of borrowing by \nthe Federal Government, without giving any program any special standing \nin the Constitution and not creating the perverse incentive to go first \nto the Social Security trust fund for borrowing.\n  Mr. President, again, I recognize we are dealing with an arcane, \nfrequently misunderstood section of the balanced budget amendment. From \nthe Judiciary Committee report, to opinion columns, to leaders in the \nadministration, there is confusion about what section 2 means and what \nit will do. But there is no excuse for this Senate to misunderstand \nwhat this provision means. Our whole purpose in the constitutional \nscheme is to be that part of the Government that can deliberate, can \nconsider complex matters and reach resolutions that are in the national \ninterest. Let us not allow this opportunity to pass us by.\n  We have the chance here to save almost $2 trillion in financial \nobligations for our children and grandchildren. To release that $2 \ntrillion to help create the jobs for our children and grandchildren, to \npreserve the Social Security trust fund, and to give the American \npeople what they have a right to expect from this balanced budget \namendment, a restriction on the total national debt that they will be \nrequired to pay. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think maybe it is appropriate that the \npages brought to the floor after we went into session what is \nessentially 26 years of unbalanced budgets. I think this is a great \nsymbolic pile of stuff. We ought to remember that is what this whole \nthing is about.\n  We hear people continuing to say, ``Well, let's just do it.'' We have \nnot just done it, and here is the evidence.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for yielding. Let me say \nat the outset of my comments that I am pleased to join with Senator \nGraham today in a discussion about an area of the balanced budget \namendment that he admits is not necessarily viewed with the kind of \ncritical nature that other parts of the amendment have been. The \nSenator from Florida has, in a very sincere way, taken a close look at \nthis and tried to offer an alternative that maybe on the outset bears \nsome attractiveness. I was approached by the Senator and in good faith \ntook a detailed look at his amendment, and my reaction in the next few \nminutes are as follows.\n  I do not question the sincerity at all of the Senator from Florida \nfor what he is attempting to do here, to assure that the trust funds of \nSocial Security are held solvent from his perspective and yet to deal \nwith the issue of debt. Our amendment is straightforward.\n  Section 1 contains the balanced budget rule, total outlays should not \nexceed total receipts except by a three-fifths vote. Section 6 allows \ngood-faith use of reasonable estimates in planning a balanced budget. \nIn Senate Joint Resolution 1 the numbers match up. The balanced budget \nrule and the enforcement of that rule correspond with each other.\n  Over the years, as we have worked to refine this amendment, and I \nmust say that the amendment that we have before the Senate has been \nwell over a decade in refinement so that if we enshrine this in the \nConstitution we believe it will work in a total sense, while I say all \nof that, section 2 requires a three-fifths vote to increase the limit \non debt held by the public. If the Congress balanced the budget every \nyear, the debt held by the public will not increase. That is, in \nreality, the balanced budget. That is what the public would expect that \nis what we would accomplish by the language of the amendment.\n  Therefore, freezing the limit on debt held by the public directly \nenforces honest and accurate estimates to produce a balanced budget. \nThat, of course, is another one of our goals, to engage the executive \nand the legislative branches, the Office of Management and Budget with \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the appropriate budget members to \nmake as accurate as possible the projections that produce the revenue \nto offset the expenditures.\n  The relationship among deficit debt and trust funds is important here \nand this is the crux of the Graham amendment. Debt held by public is \nFederal debt owed to debtors outside Government. When an official trust \nfund runs a surplus, by law it must invest the surplus funds in \nTreasury securities.\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nFor example, the Treasury is required to borrow those funds--money \nmoving inside Government, not outside Government.\n  These interagency or intragovernmental borrowings, plus debt held by \npublic, money we borrow from the public with the selling of Treasury \nnotes, is included in gross debt. If the budget is balanced, debt held \nby public does not change. If the budget is balanced and all trust \nfunds continue to run a surplus, then the gross debt goes up. By the \nvery nature of the money in those surpluses, of those trust funds being \nloaned to the Government, so the Government general fund, if you will, \nowes. Therefore, it has debt, debt back to the trust funds. If the \nbudget is balanced and the trust funds run a deficit, the gross debt \ngoes down. That is the frustration of the Graham amendment.\n  Under the Graham amendment the numbers, in my opinion, do not match \nup. The Graham amendment places a section 2 limit on debt held by the \npublic with a limit on gross debt. That is the crux of his amendment, \nchanging public to gross. Congress can only comply with the section 1 \nbalanced budget rule and still be significantly out of compliance with \nsection 2 limits. That creates the schism, if you will, in the \namendment to the Constitution, in my opinion, if the Graham amendment \nwere to become a part of it.\n  Therefore, if Congress precisely balances the budget, then it must \neither repeatedly muster a three-fifths vote to allow the trust funds \nto run a surplus, or to avoid a three-fifths vote on the gross debt \nlimit raid and reduce the trust fund surpluses. That would be the \nultimate outcome in my opinion of how Congress would have to react to \nthe Graham amendment if it were to become a part.\n  If Congress does not want to reduce the trust fund balance, then it \nmust run large surpluses by cutting spending in the nontrust fund part \nof the budget or by raising taxes.\n  For the years 2002 to 2007, that means up to $435 billion in \nadditional cuts or taxes, in my opinion. Long-term impact of the Graham \namendment on debt and deficit would then be as follows. It would be \npolitically difficult for Congress to continually outperform the \nbalanced budget rule in section 1, that is, run large surpluses. It may \nbe much easier to muster the three-fifths vote to increase the gross \ndebt limit and say it is a ``technicality,'' a ``necessity,'' to allow \ntrust funds to run a surplus; therefore, there will be upward pressure \non debt.\n  Senator Graham is right, this is complicated. That is why not a lot \nof people focus on it. But I disagree with him not only on the \nfrustration of it, but on the outcome of it. Without a section 2 limit \non debt held by the public that directly enforces honest and accurate \nbudget estimates, Congress and the President will continue to face \npolitical pressure to use the rosy scenario estimates; therefore, it \nwill still be easier to deficit spend.\n  One of the things I believe the amendment that we have introduced on \nthe floor forces is as accurate and as honest estimates as you can get, \nbecause if, in fact, you produce a deficit, the ability to move that \ndeficit in the debt is a tough vote, and it really forces the fiscal \nconstraints and the tough decisions that we want our balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution to cause this Congress to deal with.\n  Even if the gross debt limit under the Graham amendment remains \nfrozen at $6.7 trillion, as his chart would suggest, it still leaves \nroom to add an additional $2.9 trillion to debt held by the public \nbetween the years 2019 and 2029.\n  My argument is simply this, Mr. President, and I will take the Graham \nchart and simply extend the line, because this is discretionary on the \npart of the Congress. It is arguable, by his figures, that there is a \ndecline, but the ceiling remains upward. I know the Congress, and I \nthink Senator Graham knows the Congress. If they have room to spend, \noh, boy, do they love to spend. That $2.9 trillion gives them that \nopportunity, to actually increase real debt. So what would happen down \nhere in debt held by the public, potentially, under this? This line \nturns upward. This category of debt held by the public versus the green \ncategory, which is debt held by other trusts, and the red, of course, \nis the Social Security trust funds, that line begins to move up.\n  In the year 2029, the Graham amendment allows a $6.7 trillion debt, \nwhile our amendment as proposed, Senate Joint Resolution 1, allows a \n$5.8 trillion debt--almost a trillion dollars less. I figure that a \ntrillion dollars is a lot of money, especially when it's borrowed, it's \ndebt, and you are paying interest on it. That is one of the great \nfrustrations we are dealing with today --that finally debt has caught \nup with us. We used to argue that debt was a good stimulus to the \neconomy and, oh, well, the public owed it to themselves, it was no big \ndeal. But, today, it is the second largest item in the Federal budget, \nsoon to shove them all out if we continue this kind of debt creation \nunder deficit spending.\n  This is why I have to oppose the Graham amendment, because I don't \nbelieve that it gets us to where we want to go. I think I now \nunderstand what the Senator from Florida tries to do, and it is not a \ncriticism of what he tries to do; it is an observation of what he tries \nto do. Where I think its weaknesses rest--because, if you talk gross \ndebt but you don't talk debt held by the public, it changes the whole \ndynamics of the process, as I understand it, and in this outyear \nperiod. Somebody might say, ``Senator Craig, why are you worried about \n2029?'' We are talking about the 28th amendment to the Constitution. We \nare talking about a process that we have been well over a decade in \ntrying to create, and it will not be changed easily, or overnight, if \nit is in error or if the Graham amendment were to become part of it and \nthen we were to find it creates this kind of glitch. We would struggle \nfor decades trying to solve that, with the potential of increasing the \ndebt structure by well over a trillion dollars. The last I checked, \ninterest on a debt of a trillion dollars is significant--probably \naround $50 billion a year.\n  That is the reality of the amendment, as I see it, and certainly I \nstand to be corrected. Of course, he knows his amendment a great deal \nbetter than I. I tried to study it because I knew the Senator was \nsincere in his effort to deal with this in a legitimate way and at the \nsame time recognize, as we all want to recognize, the protection of the \ntrust funds, which now help finance the debt structure of this country.\n  I believe, if you keep it within the unified budget, if you recognize \nall debt, then you create the kind of honesty that you must play with \nin a sincere and direct way and force both the executive branch of our \nGovernment and the legislative branch of our Government, in each and \nevery budget cycle, to produce the kind of honest estimates that drive \nthe budget process to produce actual spending at or near balance on an \nannualized basis.\n  With those comments, I stand in opposition to the Graham amendment \nand certainly urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 16 minutes 46 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield myself such time as is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, since this debate started, I have received \na letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare, dated today, which I would like to submit for the Record. To \nquote one paragraph:\n\n       S.J. Res. 1 requires a three-fifths, super-majority vote to \n     increase ``public'' borrowing, but since it does not require \n     such Congressional approval for trust fund borrowing, it \n     provides a powerful incentive for the increased use of trust \n     fund borrowing as a means to pay for general fund programs. \n     We support your effort to correct this definition of ``debt'' \n     as a needed improvement.\n\n  The letter is signed by Martha McSteen, president of the National \nCommittee to Preserve National Security and Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho raised several \npoints. I want to focus on three.\n  First, he raises the issue of, are we adding a speculative element \ninto this balanced budget amendment by applying debt to the total debt \nrather than\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nto only that component of the national debt which is held by the \npublic. I suggest quite to the contrary--that it is exactly the \ndefinition that we are using which this Congress has written into the \nstatute. It is the definition that we use when we are required to \nassess whether we are about to exceed the national debt. So it is the \ndefinition that is not speculative. It is the definition that we are \naccustomed to using. It is the definition that the American people \nunderstand, in part because we have helped them understand it by using \nthings like the debt clock, which focuses on the total national debt.\n  Finally, and most fundamentally, the debt is not a projected amount, \nit is a fiscal reality. It is, as anyone knows who has ever balanced a \nfamily budget or dealt with the books of a business, the last number on \nthe page after you have looked at what your revenues are, what your \nexpenses are, and you can see whether you are in a profit or a debt \nsituation. That is the circumstance that the U.S. Government is in when \nwe look at that bottom number and say, oh, my goodness, we have just \nadded another $107 billion of deficit in the fiscal year 1997 that will \nthen become an additional layer on top of our national debt.\n  Second, the Senator from Idaho raises a very significant and \ninteresting issue. That is what are we going to do after the year 2019.\n  I might say the chart that the Senator has could be replicated \nprecisely on the chart of the balanced budget amendment as submitted. \nThat is the amendment that only restricts debt held by the public. This \nconstitutional amendment and the constitutional amendment with my \namendment, all are going to face the very difficult issue of what do \nyou do when you reach that point sometime in the second decade of the \n21st century when, instead of running a surplus in the Social Security \nsystem, as we are today, and will for the next 20 or so years, we \nsuddenly start to run big deficits as all of those people born after \n1945 begin to retire? It is their turn to become eligible for Social \nSecurity. And enormous deficits are going to be run in the Social \nSecurity system.\n  Those are not speculative or imaginative. They are exactly what the \n1983 Social Security Commission contemplated. Add surpluses during \nperiods of relatively limited numbers of Americans benefiting by Social \nSecurity so that we can meet the obligations when we are in a \ndemographic period with large numbers of retirees.\n  So what are we going to do when we get out here to around the year \n2019? Frankly, there is no free lunch. What we have been doing is, we \nhave been borrowing from the general fund from Social Security. Social \nSecurity does not have a great bank filled up with stocks and bonds, or \nreal estate deeds, or other assets that have a market value. What it \nhas is IOU's from the General Treasury.\n  Beginning in about the year 2019, the Social Security beneficiaries \nare going to be knocking on the door of that vault, saying, ``We want \nto redeem these IOU's.'' What are we going to do? We basically have \nthree choices.\n  We have the choice of reducing spending every place else in the \nFederal Government sufficient to release the money to be able to redeem \nthe IOU's and pay off this obligation. We can raise taxes sufficiently \nto do the same thing. Or, we can begin again to borrow from the public, \nin order to be able to substitute borrowing from the public, in order \nto meet the borrowing that we have been doing for the last three \ndecades from the Social Security trust fund.\n  If somebody has another alternative to those three, or some \ncombination, I would suggest that they might want to identify them.\n  What is going to be the difference between where we will be under the \nbill as it is introduced and where we will be under the bill as my \namendment would have it? First, instead of having to repay, dealing \nwith a Federal deficit at $8.5 trillion, we are going to be \napproximately $2 trillion less in debt. If you had a big obligation \ncoming, wouldn't you feel better about your ability to meet it if you \nwere relatively less indebted than if you were more indebted? Clearly, \nthe Nation will be better off, better positioned to meet its \nobligations, if it starts from a lower position of national debt.\n  Under the amendment that we have, when we come to this period in the \nyear 2019, and we elect not to cut spending and we don't want to raise \ntaxes as the only two ways to meet this obligation to meet the payment \nof the IOU's that the General Treasury will owe to the Social Security \ntrust fund, but we would like to consider borrowing from the public, \nwhat is our position going to be? For two decades we will have been \noperating under a constitutional amendment that says you can borrow \nfrom these trust funds by a majority vote, which is relatively not easy \nbut past history has shown is not politically a Mount Everest to climb. \nBut we are going to say you have to have a three-fifths vote to borrow \nfrom the public.\n\n  So we are going to find ourselves in about 20 years facing the \nprospect of having to, for the first time, use that three-fifths vote \nrequirement to increase the debt held by the public, having ballooned \nthe debt by a majority vote from our borrowings from these other trust \nfunds. And I would suggest that is not going to be a very happy time to \nbe a Member of the U.S. Congress.\n  I think that what we are doing today is leaving to our successors--\nnot in the far distant future but just about 20 years from now--an \nextremely indebted America with a constitutional structure that is \ngoing to make it very difficult for us to meet our obligations to those \nSocial Security beneficiaries.\n  My amendment would have us enter that period with substantially less \nindebtedness. We would have been applying this three-fifths vote to all \nborrowing, not just to that held by the public.\n  But the most significant difference of how we will be in the year \n2019 goes to the very first point that the Senator from Idaho talked \nabout. It is not correct to say that the only thing you can do with \nSocial Security surpluses is borrow. If that is the case, then clearly \nwe are locked into this chart. Clearly, we are looking like a plane \nthat is on automatic pilot and all the members of the cockpit have \nbailed out.\n  We know where we are heading. We are heading to an $8.5 trillion \nnational debt, if, in fact, we are required to borrow all of the money \nfrom these trust funds and add it to the national debt. That is not \nwhat the Greenspan commission contemplated in 1983. That is not what my \namendment would allow us to do; that is, instead of adding to the \nnational debt, why don't we take those surpluses and pay off some of \nthe debt we have already so we don't have to continually place our \nchildren and grandchildren under a greater and greater burden? But, \nrather, we can face the day when we will have to make substantial \nrepayments of these Social Security IOU's. This is the best possible \nfiscal condition for America, and with our debt to the general public \nat the lowest level that our fiscal condition over the next two decades \nwill allow us to be.\n  So, Mr. President, we do have an alternative. We are not obligated to \nhave $8.5 trillion in debt. We can make that debt clock tick in the \nfuture as we are representing. We can make it a means by which we can \nprotect our future, not enslave our future.\n  Mr. President, just to summarize again with greater brevity why I \nthink this amendment is critical, it is honest. It does what the \nAmerican people expect us to do. It is fiscally conservative. It saves \nalmost $2 trillion in borrowing. It is simple and direct. It is not \ncomplicated. It will have a positive impact on our Nation's economy by \nreleasing $2 trillion into the private sector. The only real long-term \nsalvation of Social Security--and our retirement systems, whether they \nare Government or otherwise--is a strong American economy. And if we \ncan put $2 trillion more into that private economy, we will be making a \nfundamental contribution to the strength of our Social Security and all \nof our other retirement programs.\n  We would avoid the temptation, as the National Committee for the \nPreservation of Social Security and Medicare points out, to use the \nSocial Security system as the cash cow, as the point of first \npreference for borrowing for the Federal Government by saying we are \nnot going to establish a different standard for borrowing from the \nSocial Security fund than we apply to borrowing from the general \npublic. Both would be subject to a supermajority of\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nthree-fifths of the Members of the Congress in order to increase the \ntotal national debt.\n  So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I respectfully suggest the \nanalysis of the Senator from Idaho is not an appropriate projection of \nthe consequences of this amendment and that, rather, the honesty, the \nreduction of the total national debt and the protection of Social \nSecurity by, among other things, stimulating a higher rate of economic \ngrowth in America are the goals which are sought and I believe will be \naccomplished by the adoption of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of its five and a half \n     million members and supporters, the National Committee to \n     Preserve Social Security and Medicare wishes to express our \n     support for your proposed amendment to S.J. Res. 1, a \n     resolution to amend the Constitution to require a balanced \n     federal budget. Among our concerns about S.J. Res. 1 is that \n     it would change the current definition of federal debt. Your \n     proposed amendment would change the current language ``debt \n     held by the public'' in S.J. Res. 1, to include all federal \n     debt, particularly that which the government holds for \n     itself--i.e. the federal trust funds. We appreciate your \n     leadership on this important issue.\n       As drafted, S.J. Res. 1 contains a provision which \n     intentionally removes Social Security trust fund holdings of \n     U.S. securities from the definition of ``public debt,'' even \n     though the trust fund money was borrowed to finance the \n     deficit. This change would permit the Treasury to increase \n     its debt by borrowing from the trust funds without obtaining \n     the Congressional approval required to borrow money from \n     other sources.\n       S.J. Res. 1 requires a three-fifths, super-majority vote to \n     increase ``public'' borrowing, but since it does not require \n     such Congressional approval for trust fund borrowing, it \n     provides a powerful incentive for the increased use of trust \n     fund borrowing as a means to pay for general fund programs. \n     We support your effort to correct this definition of ``debt'' \n     as a needed improvement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he may use to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 31 minutes and 50 seconds, \nthe minority 3 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  I will not take much more time to discuss the Graham amendment other \nthan the disagreement that he and I might have as relates to the \nceiling that is created, and while I would argue that what he wishes to \naccomplish is impossible to do, and that is a buy down of debt, unless \nby this whole character of activity here from now until the year 2019 \nwe have changed the whole culture of political pressure in this country \nand interest group activity, my guess is that the pressure to spend \nmoney, if the system would allow it, beyond the balance because of the \nlimit on the debt ceiling, would be great.\n  He and I recognize the tremendously laudable goal of trying to buy \ndown debt, and I think Americans are all asking us, well, if you in \nfact can get the budget balanced in the timeframe that you are \nsuggesting, does that mean then we are going to get rid of some of this \ndebt, because interest on debt is going to be even higher by the year \n2002 than it is today because we are still creating debt. Even under \nour scenario, as conservative as it is and as damning as this \nadministration thinks it is, we are still going to be creating lots of \ndebt out there because we are still deficit spending. Although ours is \ndeclining and the President's is in reality increasing, we are still \ncreating debt. So I do not blame the Senator from Florida for wanting \nto find a time in which we can buy down debt. I would like to do the \nsame. But his is not an obligation to do that; his is only an \nopportunity to do that. And therein lies the difference in why I think \nwhat we do today is the right thing by not amending the proposed \namendment.\n  Social Security is a concern of all of ours and it has been, and you \nhave heard a lot of debate in the Chamber in the last 3 weeks about \nSocial Security. It is a social contract and a financial obligation \nthat we hold to the senior citizens of our country. None of us want to \ndeny it or walk away from it. We want to deal with it responsibly and \nstraightforward and we want to create the fiscal environment in which \nwe can honor that debt.\n  I am one of those who believes that if we fail to balance the budget, \nthere will come a day when we cannot honor that debt. We should not \nsuffer the illusion that a bankrupt government can send checks out. \nTragically enough, there are some Social Security recipients who \nbelieve that somehow they will be held whole while the rest of the \nworld collapses, the world of a Government that is so badly in debt \nthat it cannot honor its commitments or, more importantly, at a time \nwhen the public would simply reject it.\n  Gross interest payments this year reached $344 billion, fiscal year \n1996. The debt grows, the mandatory interest payments grow. Here are \nthe figures. Social Security, we spent $347 billion on Social Security \nthis year; gross interest on debt, $344 billion; defense, $266 billion; \nall the domestic discretionary programs, $248 billion; Medicare, $191 \nbillion; Medicaid, $92 billion; net interest on debt held by public, a \nsubset of gross interest or gross debt, the kind that the Senator from \nFlorida was talking about, $241 billion.\n  The reality of what we do is damning the future of this country, \ndamning the future of the obligations we hold to the seniors of our \ncommunities if we fail in balancing the budget.\n  The President, I believe, 12 times in his State of the Union said he \nwas going to produce a balanced budget, and we all held our breath and \ndid not criticize and waited for that budget to come to the Hill. And, \nvoila, the words did not meet the fine print--$120 billion of deficit \nstraight lined until the end of his term and then, guess what? He \nleaves office and says: Now it is time to do the heavy lifting. You \neither have to take away the tax cuts I have given or cut spending \ndramatically.\n\n  I am sorry, Mr. President. Once again your rhetoric just does not \nmatch up to your performance, and that budget does not work, and you \nhave not dealt with a balanced budget in the honest and straightforward \nway that the Senator from Florida or the Senator from Idaho or the \nmajority of Congress or a supermajority of the American people want us \nto deal with it. And that is a declining deficit structure to the year \n2002 when all of this comes into balance.\n  The reality of the obligation to Social Security does not go away, \nbut the honesty of budgeting materializes, and because we have created \na unified budget the real pressure to cut so that we can honor the debt \nobligation to Social Security is there. We must get our fiscal house in \norder. We cannot, nor should we ever, allow interest on gross debt to \nbecome the greatest single expenditure in the Federal budget, and yet \nwe are clearly headed in that direction. By most reasonable budget \nguesstimates we have missed that by only $3 billion this year.\n  I know what any good business person or any good analyst of a \nbusiness would say if the figures were like this in a business. They \nwould say you are out of business; you are bankrupt; you cannot service \nyour debt; you cannot afford to operate in this manner. However, \nbecause we can create debt in the nature that we have now for nearly 30 \nyears, we continue. Of course, that obligation gets immediately \ntransferred outward into the future to our children, to our \ngrandchildren, and somehow we are fair weather; we just go on saying we \nhave done our job in a responsible way.\n  I was saddened yesterday that the Senator from New Jersey would not \nhonor his obligation and his verbal commitment to the citizens of his \nState. That is a tragedy, but he has made his choice. We all make our \nchoices. Those are tough choices. The pressures are great here, but \nthey are not so great as to walk away from your commitment to your \ncitizens, to your public and to the oath of office. What we are trying \nto do is enshrine within the Constitution an obligation that Thomas \nJefferson was so very clear about when he said there should have been \nan 11th amendment to the Bill of Rights and that was that we could not \nborrow. Now, we could have borrowed inside the budget but we could not \nborrow from outside the budget.\n  What we are suggesting is that we cannot borrow from outside the \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nWe can borrow from inside the budget, and that is what we are doing \nnow, and that is the unified budget. It does not make the obligation go \naway. It does not make the legal commitment go away. It does not say to \nthe baby boomers that, when you get ready to retire your check won't be \nin the mail. What says to the baby boomers that your check may be \nthreatened and may someday not be in the mail is the perpetual increase \nof debt, that which the Senator from Wyoming pointed out a few moments \nago with all of those books stacked before him. It is one budget piled \nupon another budget piled upon another budget.\n  Regarding half of those 28, half of those 28 budgets, the politicians \nwho assembled them, interestingly enough, had the public tenacity to \nsay they are heading toward balance. For 3 years we have been saying we \nare headed toward balance. The President's State of the Union Address \nbefore the American people assembled: ``I will produce balanced \nbudgets.'' Oh, come on, Mr. President. We have read the fine print. You \ndo not produce a balanced budget and you are not trying. You raise \ntaxes, you raise revenue, you spend more for new programs, and after \nyou have left office you say, ``Now, if you want to get it balanced, \nyou either raise taxes or you cut spending.'' Big-time stuff, $50-\nbillion, $60-billion-type stuff--tough to do. Most important, he knows \nit's impossible to do. It is impossible to do unless Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is the organic law of the land.\n  It is the Constitution through which the public views its Government \nand controls its Government and tells its Government what to do. That \nis the test before us.\n  While the Senator from Florida in a responsible way attempts to \naddress that, I ask that we reject his amendment because of the risk of \nincreasing debt by at least another $1 trillion or more inside what we \ncould definitionally call a balanced budget. We dare not do that to our \npublic. Most important, we dare not allow that kind of latitude in \nfuture Congresses. I am not going to be here then. The Senator from \nFlorida is not going to be here then. But his action, my action, the \naction of this Senate, whether it is on Senate Joint Resolution 1 \namended by the Senator from Florida, or if it is left as it is \npresented, will be the law of the land that dictates to the Congress \nand to the Senate in the year 2019 or 2028: This is how you operate. \nThese are the parameters within which you must perform, in which you \nmust make priorities for spending. It must be balanced, it must be \nhonest, it must be fair.\n  What we do here is going to be important both in the short term and \nin the long term. What we do must be honest and must be clear and \nundefinitional to future Congresses so, just like the first amendment \nor the second or the third, they are not arbitrary, they are not \ncapricious, they do not create those kinds of actions. They are real \nand we honor them. So our language must be clear and unambiguous.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing the \namendment by the Senator from Florida. I do not believe it creates the \nenvironment in which we must operate. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. How much time remains, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining for the majority is 19 \nminutes 20 seconds. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want, first of all, to congratulate the \nSenator from Idaho for his leadership in this matter. I don't think \nthere is a more important issue before us than the idea of being \nfinancially and fiscally responsible. I say that also to my friend from \nFlorida, who supports this concept of accountability as well. Certainly \nthere will be a lot said--there has been a lot said, maybe everything \nhas already been said but maybe not everyone has said it--but it is \nbroader than the books, it is broader than the numbers, it is broader \nthan math. It is a question of being responsible to ourselves, being \nresponsible to our children, being responsible to the future. It is a \nquestion of priorities. It is a question of, really, dealing with the \nissue rather than what has been done over the last 30 years, by saying, \nyes, we are going to balance, yes, we are going to balance the budget, \nyes, we are going to do it, and not doing it.\n  I think one of the ironies is many of those who oppose this balanced \nbudget amendment say, ``Oh, yes, we are going to do it,'' and point to \nthe President's budget--which does not do it. It does not achieve \nbalance by 2002 and stay in balance. It does not provide permanent tax \nrelief. It does things in Medicare that are strictly gimmicks. It \nspends $21 billion more on welfare and raises taxes by $80 billion. It \nhas $60 billion in new entitlements.\n  So let us be clear that, if we want different results, we have to \nchange the way we do things, and that is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  Let me yield to my friend from Missouri. We have approximately 18 \nminutes left, and I will yield as much time as he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill. I have asked for this time to spend about 5 minutes to introduce \na piece of legislation, so, while it will count against the time, I ask \nunanimous consent to be permitted to proceed as in morning business for \nthat 5-minute period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 368 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe I have approximately 3 minutes \nremaining, which I would like to use to close after the opponents of \nthe amendment have completed their arguments.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think this side has said everything it \nneeds to say. I will be happy to yield any time of our remaining time, \nunless somebody else wants to speak, to our friend from Florida.\n  We have to oppose this amendment. We know how helpful the Senator \nfrom Florida is and how much this means to him. We have appreciated the \nsupport he has provided in this debate and certainly will listen to \nwhat he says here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the remaining \ntime of 3 minutes and 1 second.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to close briefly, let me underscore that I \nsupport the balanced budget amendment. I will vote for the balanced \nbudget amendment in the form it was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. I do so because I believe it is superior to the alternative \nof continuing with the status quo, a status quo that had added $4.5 \ntrillion to our national debt in less than 20 years.\n  I believe, however, that the balanced budget amendment can be \nimproved. I have suggested what I think is an important area of that \nimprovement, and that is that after we have achieved the objective of \nsection 1 of the balanced budget amendment, which is to see that we \nwill bring as rapidly as possible our annual accounts into balance, we \nwill not be adding to the national deficit, that we will then place a \nsafety lock on that gain by saying there shall not be any further \nincreases in the national debt without a three-fifths vote of both \nHouses of Congress.\n  The amendment that is before us does not do that, although there are \nmany who believe that it does that, because the three-fifths vote only \napplies to that portion of the national debt which is held by the \npublic, by individuals, by corporations, by State and local \ngovernments, by all the people who buy Federal securities.\n  My amendment would strike that limitation and have the requirement of \na three-fifths vote of both Houses of Congress apply to all of the \nnational debt. It would apply to the totality of the $5.4 trillion \nnational debt that we now have.\n  Mr. President, there was some suggestion in the concluding remarks of \nthe Senator from Idaho that in some\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nway by my amendment I had weakened the existing three-fifths \nrequirement that is in the constitutional amendment as it relates to \ndebt held by the public. Absolutely to the contrary. I am extending the \nsame three-fifths requirement to the rest of the debt of the Federal \nGovernment, continuing to apply it to debt held by the public, but also \napplying it to that debt which the Federal Government borrows from its \nown trust funds.\n  In brief summary, Mr. President, I believe the following reasons are \nwhy this amendment should be adopted:\n  It is honest.\n  It comports with what the American people believe we are doing when \nwe say we are restricting national debt.\n  It is fiscally conservative. It will result in almost $2 trillion \nless national debt over the next 20 years than will be almost certainly \nthe case if we do not adopt this amendment.\n  It is simple. It does not add new or complex concepts to the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  It will have a very positive effect on the Nation's economy. The \nresult of releasing $2 trillion that otherwise would be used to finance \nunnecessary and excessive national debt into the private sector will \nincrease our Nation's economic growth and strength.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds to conclude my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, finally, by using these surpluses, as the \n1983 Social Security Commission had anticipated they would be used, to \nreduce the amount of Federal debt which is currently owed to the \ngeneral public and, therefore, place our Nation in a stronger fiscal \nposition to meet our future obligations to Social Security, we will be \nstrengthening the Social Security system. And for that reason, the \nNational Committee for the Preservation of Social Security and Medicare \nhas endorsed this amendment.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment which I believe is exactly \nconsistent with the purposes of the balanced budget amendment, will add \nto its strength, and will add to the acceptance of the American people, \nbecause it will be the amendment that they believe we are about to \nadopt and submit to the States for ratification. I urge the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida. He has been one of the great leaders on the balanced budget \namendment, prior to this debate and certainly during this debate. I \nbelieve he deserves a lot of commendation from both sides of the floor \nfor his steadfastness and standing up on this amendment.\n  We cannot support this particular amendment to the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, and I regret that we cannot. But, in spite of \nthat fact, our colleague from Florida has been one of the leaders out \nhere, and I personally just want to express my appreciation for his \nefforts and for the work he has done on his side of the floor, as well \nas our side of the floor. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the vote cannot occur until 12:35?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order to that effect.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to move to \ntable, with the vote not occurring before 12:35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the amendment, with the understanding that \nthe vote will not occur until 12:35. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table \namendment No. 7 offered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] and \nthe Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nLouisiana [Ms. Landrieu] would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 19 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Biden\n     Landrieu\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1689-6", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 7) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

When we woke up this morning, I wonder how many of us \npaused to reflect on the great gift we have been given--the gift of our \nfreedom. It is a special gift, but so many of us take it for granted, \neven though we paid for it at quite a heavy price. As we drove to work, \nhow many of us thought about the sacrifices that were made over the \nyears by our Nation's veterans to preserve and protect those freedoms?\n  Six years ago, President Bush was in the White House and he had a \ndifficult task on his hands. The world was in crisis. The United \nNations was meeting night and day to try to stop the spread of the \nthreat of Saddam Hussein. He had invaded Kuwait and brought the people \nof that nation to their knees. Something had to be done.\n\n  When the cry for help went out from Kuwait, we sent our best to \nanswer the call. Many brave men and women went to a foreign land to \nstop the advance of that madman in the deserts of Kuwait and Iraq.\n  In the days that followed, we picked up a whole new vocabulary. We \nspoke of Scuds, Patriot missiles, chemical weapons, gas masks, Riyadh, \nand so much more.\n  It was a war we witnessed like no other battle in our history. We \ncharted our troops' progress with the reports we saw on the news every \nnight. We were a part of it all. The press took us right along with our \nsoldiers as the fighting progressed. Everything came to us live as the \nmedia brought the conflict right into our living rooms.\n  It was almost like watching a movie. It seemed so distant and \ndangerous. Yet, somehow, because of our advanced technology, we thought \nour young men\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\nand women would be safe and that they would all make it home. Would \nthat it were so.\n  When it was over, and the battle had been won, we all felt a great \nwave of relief that our casualties had been light. But light \ncasualties, don't feel so light when they include our families, our \nfriends, and our loved ones.\n  One hundred and forty-six young people did not come back. I say this \nin their memory as I mention one young man who didn't come home from \nthat battle came from Gillette, WY. Manuel Davila was a young father, a \nnice guy who always had a smile and a kind word for everyone he met. He \nwas the kind of person you'd like to have for a friend. That is why he \nhad so many friends.\n  I watched Manuel grow up. He was a remarkable young man. He came from \nthe town I call home. You didn't get to meet him, so I should use the \nwords of Ron Franscell, the editor of the Gillette News Record, who \nwrote so eloquently 6 years ago as Manuel's body was brought home for \nburial: ``I never knew Manuel, but he was from my town, he was one of \nus, and he had dreams. In that way, I knew him very well. You know him, \ntoo.''\n  Yes, Ron, we all did know him, too.\n  Manuel saw a need, and when he was asked to go, he didn't hesitate. \nHe was doing his job and it was a job he loved and felt proud to have \nbeen called to do. That's what it was to him. He felt good to be a part \nof this special mission for he understood how much it meant to the \ndefenseless people of Kuwait who needed him so very badly.\n  In Wyoming, we like to think of our State as holy ground that was \nblessed by God. It is a land of open spaces, beautiful mountains that \nseem to stretch up to God's heaven, green forests, national parks, \nclean, clear, cool air and wide open spaces.\n  Manuel traded all of that for a far different world.\n  He traded his clear blue skies for a desert sky that was pitch black \nwith the fumes and smoke of oil fields set on fire by Iraqi troops. He \ntraded his beautiful mountain paradise for an isolated desert \nwasteland. He traded the clean, crisp air of Wyoming for the use of a \ngas mask and the threat of Saddam's chemical weapons. He traded the \nsafety and security of his homeland for the uncertainty and danger of a \nbattlefield. He traded it all to go overseas and fight for freedom.\n  When it was all over, in spite of all the precautions we had taken to \nprotect our troops, this brave young man didn't make it home. A wife \nhad lost her husband, and a family had lost a son. A little girl had \nlost her father.\n  Six years ago we brought him back home to Wyoming. The loss of Manuel \nin the desert reinforced the truth of an adage made famous by an old \ntelevision show written about a different war. In one scene a doctor \nsays that there are two rules of war. The first rule is that young men \nand women die. The second rule is there is nothing that can be done to \nchange rule 1. It is the awful truth of battle.\n  Today, although we are far removed from that battlefield, we must \nnever forget the sacrifices that were made by Manuel and by so many \nmore who gave their lives for great causes like the one that claimed \nyoung Manuel's life. We must continue to honor their memory and \ncommemorate their brave and courageous actions that were done in our \nname. Truly, far too many have made the ultimate sacrifice that we \nmight be free.\n  There is no greater way we can honor Manuel's memory and that of our \nother great war heroes than to rededicate ourselves every day of our \nlives to the cause of peace. I find great inspiration for that cause \nand the importance of peace when I reflect on the beautiful words of \nthe Book of Isaiah in the Bible: ``They shall beat their swords into \nplowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift \nup sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.''\n  Yes, Manuel was one of our great heroes of Wyoming and of these \nUnited States. He was a good kid, a hometown boy who had plans for his \nfuture. That future was cruelly taken from him on foreign soil by a \nmadman. Now, the torch Manuel carried so bravely in battle is passed to \nus to light the path to peace in our lives. We had best carry it high \nand proudly as we commit our every effort to ensuring that we will \nnever again ask our young men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice, \nas we work together to avoid the horrors of war. If we are successful, \nwe will truly live in a world of peace, where nation shall not lift up \nsword against nation. That is the best way for us to care for those who \nhave borne the battle, by ensuring that it never happens again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1697-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1698-S1726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Rhode Island yield to \nme so that I may explain why I missed that last vote?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader as well as \nthe Democratic leader for attempting to hold the vote long enough for \nme to get here. I voted before in the affirmative on the Graham \namendment. We voted on it last year.\n  I was one of the speakers at the International Chiefs of Police and \nSheriffs Association discussing the juvenile justice bill. I thought I \nhad left in plenty of time from a downtown hotel to get here. But, as \nWashingtonians will tell you, there is a good deal of road construction \ngoing on. I was caught behind the most polite cab driver in Washington. \nHe stopped for everyone, which I was happy to see except for this day. \nHad I had the cab driver who runs over most people, I would have been \nup here. I should not say that. I will get letters about that. That was \na joke, an attempted joke.\n  But I want the Record to show that had I been here, I would have once \nagain voted for the Graham amendment.\n  I apologize if I inconvenienced the Senate in any way in attempting \nto hold it for me to get here.\n  I thank my distinguished friend from Rhode Island for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am prepared to speak. I would be willing \nto defer if there are any other procedural announcements at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreeement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for yielding this time so that I may enter a unanimous-consent \nagreement which has been reached with regard to an amendment that \nSenator Hollings had intended to offer to the balanced budget amendment \non campaign financing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after notification \nof the Democratic leader, may turn to the consideration of a Senate \njoint resolution, the modified text of which is Senate amendment No. 9 \nfiled yesterday to Senate Joint Resolution 1 regarding campaign \nfinancing.\n  I further ask that no amendments or motions be in order during the \npendency of the Hollings constitutional amendment, and following the \nconclusion of the debate, the joint resolution be read a third time and \na vote occur on passage of the joint resolution, with the preceding \noccurring without any intervening action.\n  Before the Chair puts this consent request to the body, it has been \npointed out to me by Senator McCain that this consent is for a \nconstitutional amendment regarding campaign spending limits. There are \nother campaign-related issues that may be pending in the Senate \ncommittees that do not amend the Constitution but are statutory \nlanguage.\n  So this is not to be in place of or in any way block other \nconsideration, or to indicate that there will not be hearings and \nfurther consideration of this matter. But Senator Hollings agreed to \nthis arrangement so that it would not be a part of or relate to the \nconsideration of the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. \nSenator McCain agreed that it be done this way. It has taken the \ncooperation of both of them and of all the Senators. This is an \nimportant issue which should be brought up freestanding with\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\na reasonable amount of time for discussion.\n  I have indicated to Senator Hollings that, if it takes a couple of \ndays or so, we will be prepared to do that. I think that is about what \nit would take, but if it takes 2 days and 2 hours, I do not know of \nanyone who would object to that. But it should be a very interesting \ndebate.\n  So I now make that request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us today.\n  For many decades, Congress found it easier to debate a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution than to actually balance the \nbudget.\n  Support for the balanced budget amendment was a convenient badge of \nfiscal austerity at a time when many Members were voting for tax \npolicies and spending proposals that saw our annual deficit and our \ncumulative national debt explode.\n  After so many years, it is no wonder that the balanced budget \namendment has become a talisman which its supporters clutch, suggesting \nthat it has extraordinary powers to translate the difficult choices \nthat this body must face into some type of simple constitutional \nformula which will miraculously erase the deficit.\n  But, as the last few years have indicated, there is no magical \nconstitutional language that will make the choices or the policies of \nbudget balancing easier.\n  Mr. President, in 1993, the Clinton administration began a process of \ndeficit reduction which has helped to create a strong economy, cut the \ndeficit by 63 percent, brought the deficit when measured as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product to its lowest level since \n1974, and given us the lowest deficit of any major industrialized \nnation.\n  It took difficult choices, not constitutional gimmicks; choices that \nRepublicans refused to support.\n  Whether or not this amendment passes, and I hope it does not, we will \nstill be confronted by these choices.\n  However, if this amendment does pass, for the first time in our \nhistory we will either surrender our role in shaping the budget and the \nsocial and economic policies which it defines to the courts, or simply \nsurrender any decision to an adamant minority which could invoke the \nprovision to block necessary action.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us today is flawed in many ways. \nIt is the wrong answer to a real problem. It is the wrong way to manage \nthe economy. It disrupts our tradition of majority rule. It needlessly \njeopardizes essential programs and it needlessly enhances the role of \nthe courts in budgetary and tax policy. The balanced budget is the \nwrong way to manage the economy.\n  Over 1,100 noted American economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, \nvoiced their opposition to this balanced budget amendment on the \ngrounds that it would hurt our economy and graft improper fiscal policy \nonto the Constitution. They said, ``It is unsound and unnecessary.'' \nThey added, ``It mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.'' \nThey went on to say it ``would prevent Federal borrowing to finance \nexpenditures for infrastructure, education, research and development, \nenvironmental protection, and other investment vital to the Nation's \nfuture well-being,'' and that it ``is not needed to balance the \nbudget.'' They also ``condemn'' the amendment and suggest it could \nplace our economy ``in an economic straitjacket.''\n  One Nobel laureate, Prof. William Vickery, developed an analysis of \n15 issues with respect to balancing the budget, reducing the deficit \nand providing for economic growth, and in this analysis he has a \ncompelling and noteworthy passage:\n\n       If General Motors, AT, and individual households had been \n     required to balance their budgets in the manner being applied \n     to the federal government, there would be no corporate bonds, \n     no mortgages, no bank loans, and many fewer automobiles, \n     telephones and houses.\n\n  But this balanced budget amendment suggests that the Government do \nexactly the opposite of what the most sophisticated private industries \ndo, and I think that is a mistake.\n  While the majority may find it appropriate and even desirable to \ninsert economic formulas into the Constitution, I would urge caution. \nFor example, we all believe and we will say time and time again that we \nshould have a full employment economy and that every able bodied \nAmerican work. However, if I were to introduce a full employment \nconstitutional amendment, I predict that the very same supporters of \nthis balanced budget amendment would rush to this floor and condemn \nthat approach, invoking the terminology that we should not enshrine \neconomic ideas or formulas into the Constitution of the United States. \nThe same thing would happen if we talked about an anti-inflation \namendment.\n  The point, I think, should be very clear. It is our responsibility, \ntogether with other institutions, outside the scope of the Constitution \nto rationally ameliorate the surges and downswings of the economy. This \nis what we should do.\n  Some people might try to say, well, no, look at the States. They \nprovide for a balanced budget. That certainly misses the point. State \ngovernments do not manage national economies. They do not issue and \nsupport currencies. They do not deal in foreign trade. And most of \nthem, if not all of them, with balanced budget requirements have the \ngood sense to separate capital spending from operational spending. So \nthat logic does not suffice to support this balanced budget amendment.\n  I also suggest that economically we are not immune from the \ndifficulties of the business cycle. We have been enjoying over the last \nseveral years good, substantial economic growth, but we know that in \npast periods our economy has faltered. If it does falter, this balanced \nbudget amendment could be a straitjacket, confining and constraining us \nin our response to these economic recessions. When the economy shrinks, \nrevenue shrinks, throwing off our revenue estimates, throwing off our \nwhole plan to get to the balanced budget, and we will be hamstrung by \nthis amendment's proposals in terms of what we can do to address a \nrecession.\n  For example, the CBO has talked about the impact of recession on the \ndeficit. Their estimates indicate that a 1 percent drop in the gross \ndomestic product would increase the deficit by $32 billion. A 1-percent \nincrease in unemployment would add $61 billion to the deficit. These \nare staggering figures with which we would have to contend in the \ncontext of a very narrowly drawn balanced budget amendment.\n\n  These are not just statistics. These are real people's lives. We have \nall lived long enough to have endured economic recessions and have seen \nthe cost in human lives. We have to, as a Government, to such \nsituations. We cannot, I think, plead, at that moment of need, we would \nlike to help you, but the Constitution prevents us from doing sensible, \nappropriate things to put people back to work in this country.\n  One of the aspects of the balanced budget amendment that would \nseverely constrain our response to recessions is the fact that it would \nsuppress the automatic stabilizers contained in our economic policy \ntoday, things like unemployment compensation and other entitlement \nprograms which exist to meet the needs of people who have fallen on \nhard times during a recession.\n  As the Congressional Research Service cautioned when it examined the \neconomic impacts of this proposal:\n\n       In sum, the balanced budget constitutional amendment could \n     require action to neutralize the automatic stabilizers in the \n     budget that expand outlays and reduce tax collections in \n     economic slowdowns and recessions. In this case, the budget \n     would no longer serve to moderate business cycles.\n\n  And, under this amendment, we would lose a valuable tool in aiding \nthe working men and women of America.\n  There is more than just constitutionally historic interest involved \nin the question of this amendment's supermajority requirements because \nthis amendment requires not a majority vote, in many cases, but much \nmore than a majority vote. This provision holds the real potential for \nconstraining effective action at the time we\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nneed Government to move decisively and purposefully.\n  For example, in times of economic crisis, there would be no automatic \nstabilizers if a small minority of Senators or Representatives \nobjected. Different regions of the Nation experiencing economic \nhardship could find no comfort in Washington because they could not \nmuster the number of Senators and Representatives to deal with their \nregion's particular problems. Frankly, over the last several years, we \nhave seen economic situations in which the country overall appears to \nbe doing fine, but when you go to the Northeast, to California, or to \nother parts of the country, you find regional recessions that need the \nhelp of this Government. Regrettably, in that situation there may not \nbe sufficient will or political support to do what we must do, which \nwould be extremely detrimental to the citizens who live in these areas.\n  There is another aspect of this supermajority that is built into this \nconstitutional amendment which should cause us all great concern, and \nthat is in order to raise the debt ceiling a vote of three-fifths would \nbe required.\n  We have just in the last Congress seen the difficulty of securing \napproval of a change in the debt ceiling with a simple majority \nrequirement. If we would require a three-fifths vote, we really would \nbe putting our Nation at severe risk.\n  As Secretary Rubin has pointed out with respect to the issue of \nraising the debt ceiling and consequently avoiding default on \nGovernment debt:\n\n       The possibility of default should never be on the table. \n     Our creditworthiness is an invaluable national asset that \n     should not be subject to question.\n       Default on payment of our debt would undermine our \n     credibility with respect to meeting financial commitments, \n     and that, in turn, would have adverse effects for decades to \n     come, especially when our reputation is most important, that \n     is, when the national economy is not healthy. Moreover, a \n     failure to pay interest on our debt could raise the cost of \n     borrowing not only for the Government but for private \n     borrowers as well.\n\n  This super majority provision would affect the Government's ability \nto deal rationally and prudently with the debt ceiling, and that is \nanother reason, a very strong reason, why this proposed constitutional \namendment is inappropriate.\n  It is bad economics; 1,100 economists would condemn it, but it is \nalso very poor budgeting. As Senator Byrd pointed out, the majority's \nproposal turns the Congress and the President into fortune tellers who \nmust somehow predict and balance outlays and receipts exactly or find \nthe supermajority needed to waive the amendment.  This appears to be an \nimpossible task, because each year the CBO seems to revise its \nprojected deficit and revenue totals on a regular basis. We should not \ndelude ourselves into thinking we can accurately predict the future, \nand we should definitely not add this dubious proposition to the \nConstitution.\n\n  In addition to the fact that this amendment's success is predicated \non frail human predictions, there are other reasons to oppose this \namendment. While the majority claims that States have managed to \nsurvive balanced budget amendment requirements, they fail to \nacknowledge, as I previously indicated, that States do so rationally by \ncreating separate operating and capital budgets. I have supported a \nbalanced budget amendment which recognizes this rational policy. But \nthat proposal is not before us today and we are debating a proposal \nthat does not recognize--in fact some scholars have indicated it would \nconstitutionally preclude--the development of a capital budget by the \nFederal Government.\n  Time and time again, the advocates of the amendment have rejected the \nidea of a capital budget for the Federal Government. I believe, in a \nsense, not only are we rejecting sound constitutional policy and sound \nadministrative policy, but we are also undercutting this Nation's need \nto build up our capital infrastructure. So, this amendment, as \nproposed, is both bad economics and bad budgeting, and finally it is an \nabrupt departure from the constitutional balance that we have observed \nthrough the course of our history. It raises a number of fundamental \nquestions about our Constitution, our tradition of majority rule, and \nthe power of the judicial branch in the United States.\n  One of the lessons I learned in law school was, where there is a \nwrong, particularly a constitutional wrong, there must be a remedy. Yet \nthis constitutional amendment makes no mention of how it will be \nenforced and who has the legal standing to question those issues which \narise under the constitutional amendment. This is an invitation to \nlitigate rather than legislate on budgetary matters. If a future \nCongress finds it too difficult to take the painful steps needed to \neliminate the deficit, then we may expect any number of possible \nclaimants, from Governors upset about Medicaid payments to senior \ncitizens upset about their Social Security checks, all of them urging \nthe courts to step in and take action.\n  Moreover, by placing the requirements that receipts and outlays be \nreconciled in the Constitution itself, the amendment effectively calls \non the Supreme Court to ensure that this mandate is met. While the \namendment may leave open the question of how the legislature reaches \nits positions and what items will be considered outlays and revenues, \nthe Supreme Court will always have an obligation to uphold the \nConstitution. Once we declare constitutionally that revenues and \noutlays must be reconciled, the Court will have no inhibition, and, in \nfact an obligation, to step in and make this reconciliation if Congress \nfails.\n  Likewise, under this amendment the President could be forced to \nimpound funds, to cut off checks, to do many things because of a \nperceived constitutional mandate. I would think long and hard, and I \nurge my colleagues to think long and hard, whether or not we want to \nsurrender what is traditionally the authority of the Congress over both \nthe courts and the President to manage the public purse. These issues \nare all very difficult ones, raising profound questions of \nconstitutional law.\n  One other aspect of the proposal which is disturbing is the departure \nfrom a tradition in this country of majority rule. I have mentioned \nbefore the supermajorities which would be required to raise the debt \nlimit and to do other things which today only require a majority vote \nof the Members of the House and the Senate. Indeed, the balanced budget \namendment would create new supermajorities in many different areas. \nWhen the founders developed the Constitution, they recognized that only \nmajority rule would work for a nation founded on the principles of \nliberty and opportunity. James Madison argued in Federalist 58 that if \nmore than a majority were required for legislative decision, then:\n\n       . . . in all cases where justice or the general good might \n     require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued, the fundamental principles of free government would \n     be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would \n     rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  And, indeed, that is what this amendment would do inexorably.\n  There is a final and significant issue which must be discussed with \nrespect to this balanced budget amendment proposal. I believe it \njeopardizes the integrity of the Social Security system and raises the \nspecter of encroachments on the system, not to support seniors but to \npay for the reckless spending of the 1980's.\n  My State has the Nation's third highest percentage population of \nsenior citizens. These are the men and women who fought in World War II \nand who made our country an economic power. Their sacrifices have made \nour Nation what it is today. They deserve our support and they rightly \ndemand our assistance to maintain a dignified retirement.\n  The hallmark of our commitment to these seniors has been the Social \nSecurity system. However, this amendment makes no provision to protect \nthis essential program from the choices necessary to achieve a balanced \nbudget. The amendment fails to recognize that Social Security is not \njust like every other program. It is directly funded through a \ndedicated payroll tax, and numerous acts of Congress have sought to \nprotect it from improper manipulation or precipitous reductions in \nbenefits. Yet the majority refuses to protect Social Security and, \ninstead, wants to use the Social Security trust fund to mask the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, recently the Congressional Research Service produced a \nreport regarding the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social \nSecurity, which contained a shocking\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nrevelation. The report found that the Social Security Administration, \neven though it has accumulated a very healthy surplus, would not be \nable to pay benefits in certain years, due to the amendment's \nrequirements that total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \ntotal receipts for that fiscal year. In other words, Social Security \ncould only pay as much in benefits as it receives from payroll taxes in \nany given year, even if the trust fund was running a multibillion-\ndollar surplus from previous years. This is a grave matter that \ndeserves more analysis and could jeopardize the 1983 Social Security \nreform law as well as future reform efforts. But it would be a \nconsequence of this balanced budget amendment if adopted today or in \nthe future.\n  Some would argue that no legislator would touch the Social Security \nsystem, but a constitutional imperative may provide a shield which \nwould allow legislators to break that sacred commitment between \nourselves and those seniors who have contributed so much to this \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this balanced budget amendment. The \nConstitution establishes the durable rights and responsibilities which \nare the heritage of our past and the best guarantee of our future. We \nshould not let the Constitution fall prey to a proposal that reflects \ntransient economic policy at best, and would erode both majority rule \nand the principle that the people's representatives, not judges, must \nbe responsible for the public purse.\n  Mr. President, before I yield, I would like to thank Senator Feingold \nfor his graciousness in delaying consideration of his amendment in \norder to permit me to go forward with my statement.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and I yield my time.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs \non the Feingold amendment No. 13. Debate on the amendment is limited to \n30 minutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement I \nhave two amendments at the desk and I believe it is in order for me to \ncall up the first of the amendments, amendment No. 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). That is the pending question.\n  The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his kind remarks and for his excellent remarks in opposition to the \nbalanced budget amendment. The amendment I am offering today to the \nbalanced budget amendment will ensure that this Congress will meet its \nstated goal of reaching a balanced budget by the year 2002. Many people \ndo not realize that as currently drafted, Senate Joint Resolution 1 may \nwell forestall this goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002 well \ninto the next century. I believe reaching a balanced budget by 2002 or \nearlier should be our highest priority. Thus, I am offering an \namendment that will shorten the time for ratification of this \namendment.\n  As was noted on the floor by our colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan, a few weeks ago, even if this amendment were somehow ratified \nat 2:10 today, tomorrow this Nation's deficit would be no smaller than \nit was when the amendment was adopted. The fact that this amendment in \nand of itself does nothing to reduce the deficit highlights one of my \nprincipal concerns with Senate Joint Resolution 1. That concern is that \npursuing a constitutional amendment approach could, counter to what \neveryone suggests on this issue, actually delay action on the real work \nof achieving a balanced budget by providing what is, in effect, \npolitical cover for inaction while the States debate the question of \nratification.\n  Under the proposal before us, even if the Congress adopted the joint \nresolution this year, the implementation date, the date by which we \nwould actually be required to balance the budget, is potentially well \ninto the next decade. Conceivably, it could be as late as the year \n2006.\n  That is right within the terms of the balanced budget amendment that \nis being offered. This is evident on the face of the amendment itself. \nSection 8 of the amendment offered in Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nprovides that the balanced budget amendment will take effect beginning \nwith the fiscal year 2002, or within the second fiscal year beginning \nafter its ratification, whichever is later. So there is no certainty at \nall with regard to the year 2002.\n  The report accompanying Senate Joint Resolution 1 reiterates this \nuncertain timeframe. It states as follows:\n\n       An amendment to the Constitution forces the Government to \n     live within its means. S.J. Res. 1 requires a balanced budget \n     by the year 2002, or 2 years after the amendment is ratified \n     by the States, whichever is latest.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the proposal before us allows the States a full 7 \nyears to ratify this amendment. The practical effect of this is, \nassuming Congress approves Senate Joint Resolution 1 by June 1 of this \nyear, the States then have 7 years, or until the year 2004, just to \nratify the amendment. If they take the full 7 years, and I think they \nwill take more time when they begin to consider the full implications \nof this approach, the amendment would then not become effective--in \nother words, binding on Congress--until 2 years later, in the year \n2006. In other words, the ratification period envisioned by Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 forestalls making the truly hard choices until as \nlate as the year 2006, well, well beyond the current target of the year \n2002.\n  In fact, the only way this amendment can be effective and binding by \nthe year 2002 is if we pass it this year and the States then ratify it \nwithin only 3 years.\n  Because I believe, as I know do most of my colleagues, that we should \nbalance the budget no later than the year 2002, I am offering this \namendment to shorten the time for ratification from the allowed 7 years \nunder the current amendment to 3 years, thus keeping us on track to \nmeet the 2002 goal.\n  I want to be candid in stating that I disagree with many of my \ncolleagues who believe that this amendment will be promptly ratified by \nthe States. There is already talk that some of the States that might \nhave ratified this proposed amendment in the past may be having some \nsecond thoughts. Maybe they have been listening to the debate on the \nfloor, about some of the very serious flaws with the way this balanced \nbudget amendment was drafted, that has been brought forward. In fact, \nthe longer the States have to consider this amendment and its potential \nramifications and uncertainties, they will be less and less inclined to \nadopt it.\n  However, when I offered this amendment in the Judiciary Committee, \nthe proponents of the balanced budget argued against it. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, stated that he was quite confident that if \nthe timeframe were shortened, as I am proposing, that the underlying \namendment ``would still be ratified by an overwhelming number of States \nand probably within that 3-year time.''\n  That being the case, and the general agreement that the budget must \nbe balanced no later than the year 2002, I was somewhat surprised to \nsee my amendment defeated by the committee. If we are sincere about our \nefforts to achieve balance within 5 years, our actions on this \namendment should reflect that goal, a goal that has been stated by the \nPresident and by the majority leader and by the Speaker of the other \nbody.\n  The argument has also been made we should not abandon the custom of \nallowing a full 7 years for ratification. However, the 7-year period \nfor ratification has evolved as a matter of practice beginning with the \n18th amendment. On each successive occasion, except the 19th amendment, \nCongress has a set time for ratification, and they have set that time \neach time at 7 years. Doing so has been upheld as appropriate by the \nSupreme Court as an exercise of Congress' authority to adopt reasonable \ntimeframes for ratification of amendments.\n\n  There has, no doubt, been much debate over whether or not the time \nfor ratification may be extended. There is nothing, Mr. President, \nnothing, except adherence to tradition, that precludes the adoption of \na shorter period of ratification, of a period less than 7 years. I \nrespectfully suggest that the context in which the debate over the \nbalanced budget arises counsels that it would be entirely appropriate \nand reasonable to depart from the 7-year standard and\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nadopt, in this case, 3 years, as is proposed in my amendment.\n  There can be little doubt that balancing the budget is perhaps the \ntop priority of the Federal Government at this point. In fact, so \nimportant was the adoption of the 2002 target date that the Republican \nParty created and ran what was, in my opinion, a pretty effective TV ad \nthat showed President Clinton saying that a balanced budget could be \nattained in 7 years, then 8 years and then 10 years. That was a pretty \ngood ad. This ad was a dramatic portrayal of what many argued was a \ngeneral unwillingness to commit to attaining balance by a specific \ndate.\n  I agreed with my Republican colleagues that we should set about the \nbusiness of reaching balance by the year 2002, and that is why I think \nthe amendment I am offering is appropriate and should be adopted. It \nassures that the target date of 2002 will not be pushed back until \npossibly as late as 2006. If, as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee suggested, the States adopt this Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nvery quickly, then we should make it effective no later than 2002. If \nhowever, the States, upon learning about the uncertain consequences to \nthe American people of this proposal, reject it, Congress should not be \nallowed to sit on their hands for 7 years and let the gains of the past \n4 years of reducing the deficit languish or, even worse, be lost.\n  I am sure that many proponents of this constitutional amendment will \nargue that even if the States take the full 7 years, there is nothing \nto stop the Congress from continuing to work hard to get the balance \ndone by the 2002 date. I hope so. But I suggest that such an argument \nspeaks not to my amendment, but to the more threshold question of why, \nif that is the case, do we have to amend the Constitution anyway? If \nthe constitutional amendment is not going to require balance until the \nyear 2006, what will force this body to do the job by the year 2002? \nNothing. The heat will be off.\n  President Clinton was clear when he said that all we need to balance \nthe budget is our votes and his signature. I agree. We should make the \ntough choices sooner, not later. The report accompanying this measure \nargues that should this amendment be adopted and subsequently \ndisregarded by a Congress and a President and are stalled at an impasse \nin budget negotiations, that that would constitute nothing less than a \nbetrayal of public trust. In my opinion, if we allow this amendment to \npotentially delay balancing the budget or, in the interim, stray from \nthe course charted over the last 4 years, that would also be, in my \nview, a betrayal of the public trust. We should remain always and in \nall respects committed to the 2002 target date.\n  As I said before in the Judiciary Committee, this amendment is \nreally, to put it in very simple terms, the fish-or-cut-bait amendment. \nYou either support moving toward balance by the year 2002 or you don't. \nIf this Nation is going to take the constitutional approach, we should \nset about doing so and not let possible delays over ratification \nprovide an excuse, provide political cover for inaction and delay until \nas long as the year 2006.\n  I do not question the sincerity of my colleagues in their desire to \nbalance the budget. My amendment ensures that this will occur within \nthe timeframe we have all agreed upon. Therefore, Mr. President, I am \nhopeful that all of us who support balancing the budget, whether we \nsupport this amendment or not, will embrace my amendment that will \nlimit the ratification to 3 years and, therefore, Mr. President, keep \nus on track to balance by the year 2002, not the year 2006.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand my colleague. I understand the amendment \nbeing offered by Senator Feingold would reduce the period for the \nStates to ratify the balanced budget amendment from 7 to 3 years.\n  I have to say, that I do not see the wisdom in departing from the \nlongstanding 7-year standard that this resolution reflects. The 18th \namendment, ratified in 1921, was the first constitutional amendment to \ncontain a time limitation of any kind. Although there was heated debate \nat the time over Congress' authority to impose such a limitation on the \nStates' ratification of the constitutional amendment, the Supreme Court \nsubsequently upheld Congress' power to set a reasonable time limit on \nratification in the case of Dillon versus Gloss back in 1921. As a \nresult, we find 7-year time limitations within the actual text of the \n18th, 20th, 21st and 22d amendments.\n  Since approval of the 23d amendment in 1961, Congress has continued \nto include a 7-year time limitation. But such limitation has been \nremoved from the text of the amendment and incorporated instead in the \njoint resolution proposed in the amendment as we have done in Senate \nJoint Resolution 1.\n  Now, just to verify the continued adherence to the convention of a 7-\nyear time limitation, I did a quick review of the 107 Constitutional \namendments introduced in the last Congress. Indeed, of those 107 \nresolutions, only 1 contained a time limitation that varied from the \nconventional 7-year limitation.\n  I am quite confident, were we to adopt a shorter time limit, as my \ncolleague proposes, the amendment would still be ratified by an \noverwhelming number of the States. But I fail to see the need in this \ncase to alter what has been recognized as a reasonable time limitation \non ratification since the early part of this century or to prejudice \nthe consideration of the balanced budget amendment by reducing the time \nfor consideration.\n  Mr. President, I am not concerned about 3 years or 7 years. I am \nconcerned about 28 years, these 28 years of unbalanced budgets. You \nknow, the bottom line is, we can talk all we want to about \ntechnicalities like 3 or 7 years but it is the 28 years I am concerned \nabout. Really, if you get serious about it, it is 58 of the last 66 \nyears during which we have had unbalanced budgets. It does not take a \nrocket scientist to realize this outfit just does not have the will to \ndo what is right.\n  So to get all caught up in whether it is 3 or 7 years, I do not think \nserves the best interests of this amendment. Let me just say the bottom \nline is this. Congress cannot and will not stop spending more than it \nearns without the force of a constitutional requirement to balance the \nbudget.\n  I have 28 unbalanced budgets here just to prove the point. We stacked \nthem a little lower by doubling and tripling the smaller volumes, but \nit still is a pretty high stack. It is headed right to the ceiling if \nwe do not get a balanced budget amendment. We have run deficits in 58 \nof the last 66 years. And, Mr. President, that is plain fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject distractions such \nas this amendment. I do not mean to demean the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator or my colleague who serves well on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and with whom I have a very good, friendly and decent \nrelationship, but it is a distraction in the sense that really the 7-\nyear period really ought to be maintained since it has been over all \nthese years.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to find the \ncourage to change the face of this Nation by voting for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. This is a chance to do \nit. This is a chance to do something that will work. If we put the \nbalanced budget requisite into the Constitution, I have no doubt that \nit will be a very relative few who would not observe it. But I believe \nthe vast majority of Members of the Congress of the United States \nhenceforth and forever would do everything in their power to live up to \nthat constitutional requisite were we to put it in the Constitution.\n\n  I have no doubt about it. I think the vast majority of people who \nserve here are very honorable people who keep their word and will do \nwhat is right. I really believe that if we put this in the \nConstitution, that vast majority will really make sure that this \nbalanced budget amendment works. On the other hand, if we do not, my \ngosh, what hope do we have? I mean, I can just see where nobody could \nbe seen above this stack 6 or 4 years from now.\n  Frankly, I am absolutely solid in asserting, unless we have a \nbalanced constitutional amendment, these stacks are just going to \ncontinue to grow ad infinitum, something that must be horrifying our \nFounding Fathers, many of whom are undoubtedly in Heaven, although \nthere are a few I am sure who\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nhad a rough time getting there. But the vast majority of them probably \nare there with our Father in Heaven saying, ``Let's do that which we \nfailed to do when we had the chance, even though we thought about it.'' \nBut they, when they were here, never thought for a minute we would have \n28 straight years of unbalanced budgets.\n  So I suspect that the only way to solve this problem is to put some \nfiscal mechanism within the Constitution that makes sense. This \namendment is that mechanism. It is a bipartisan amendment.\n  I chatted with Charles Stenholm last night, our Democratic \ncounterpart over in the House. I have to say he has done a tremendous \njob over the years doing his best to try to enact this amendment. It \ntakes guts because he takes a lot of flak for it because people in his \nparty in particular want to keep spending and taxing and claiming that \nthey are doing a lot for people--they never say with their own money \nthat could be better utilized by them and I think in a better way. So I \nwant to praise him for the work he has done over there in the House, \nalong with other Democrats and Republicans who have worked so hard \nthrough the years on this amendment.\n  I want to praise everybody here who will vote for this amendment \nbecause it does--it does--hold hope for the future if we can pass this \namendment and enshrine it in the Constitution where I think the vast \nmajority of Members would honor it and do what is right. The spending \ngames would be over.\n  So I would hope that our colleagues will keep the language exactly \nthe same. I do not know how it would affect other people who are \ncurrently willing to vote for the amendment, but we would like not to \nchange it. In spite of the fact that my colleague is sincere and that \nthis is a sincere amendment, I would hope that our colleagues will vote \nto table it.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time. We \ncould move to the Senator's next amendment, unless he wants to discuss \nit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 3 minutes, 46 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to use that time. \nThere were interesting remarks made by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, my friend, Senator Hatch.\n  I will reiterate, this is really the fish-or-cut-bait amendment. I \nalways appreciate the eloquence of the Senator from Utah, but I notice \na sort of different tone when he speaks about this amendment as opposed \nto the balanced budget amendment. There is sort of a lack of urgency to \nhis tone about this. His tone suggests that whether we get this thing \ndone by 2002 or 2006, the important thing is that we just have this \nbalanced budget amendment on the books. That just does not seem to \nsquare with the rest of the comments I have heard from the Senator and \nmost of the other supporters of the balanced budget amendment.\n  There was no suggestion by the Senator from Utah that we could not \nlimit this to 3 years. I appreciate his candor on that. That is \nsomething that is available to the Congress. It has not been done \nbefore, but when the limitation was put in the first place on the 7 \nyears on the 18th amendment, it was my understanding that was not done \nbefore. So there is no literal constraint on that.\n  I was also struck, Mr. President, by the Senator from Utah's \nstatement that we really had no reason here not to adhere to \nconvention, there is no reason not to go to 3 years or we should stick \nwith the traditional 7 years. This entire process of balancing the \nbudget and having an amendment to the Constitution to do it could not \nbe more contrary to the notion of adhering to convention. We have tried \nto use the Constitution of this country as a very limited and narrow \ndocument for 200 years but now we are going to do accounting through \nthe Constitution. I suggest that that is a failure to adhere to \nconvention.\n  The Senator from Utah also tried to describe this amendment as sort \nof a technicality, saying that whether it is 2002 or 2006, that is not \nthe issue. We just need it in the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, it flies right in the face of his excellent \ndescription of that stack of documents in front of him. The Senator \nfrom Utah is one of the taller Members of this body, if I may say so. I \ndo not think that is in dispute. I agree that if we keep going down \nthis road that we will be unable to see the distinguished \nchairman, perhaps even by the year 2002, because of these books that \nare piling up. But if we wait not until the year 2002 but to the year \n2006, I think the former Senator from New Jersey may not be visible and \nwe may have to get Senators who would be able to start in a starting \nline up in the NBA just to be able to be seen over these documents. The \nfact is, there is a difference between the year 2006 and the year 2002.\n\n  All my amendment does, Mr. President, is guarantee that however this \nturns out, through a balanced budget amendment or through a bipartisan \nagreement to balance the budget by the year 2002, that is the date. \nEither way, it cannot be after that time. That is the effect of my \namendment, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say for the sake of this debate, if the \nSenator were willing to vote for the balanced budget amendment, I would \naccept his amendment because I think three-quarters of the States would \nratify this amendment within the 3-year time period. I know he will not \nvote for this balanced budget amendment, and, frankly, it is better \nfrom a constitutional standpoint to give the States enough time to \nfunction. Some States do not even meet this year in their legislatures; \nothers meet, but may not have time to consider this. It does take time \nto ratify a constitutional amendment, depending upon a lot of timing \nfactors.\n  So we prefer to have the 7-year period. But I will make that offer if \nthe Senator will vote for the balanced budget amendment. I would \nencourage all my colleagues to vote for his amendment, but until he \ndoes, I think we have to reject this amendment unless he is willing to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me say I, of course, am very candid on this point, \nthat I do not support the balanced budget amendment for a variety of \nreasons, but I do recognize that there are some very serious \nconsequences for this country if we do pass it.\n  My amendments today are relevant to the situation we would face if it \ndoes go through. I am sincere in my belief that if it does pass, the \nprocess is going to be slowed down here if it is not ratified quickly \nby the States. That is why I offer this amendment, because sometimes \nthings happen that you are not happy about in the Congress and the \nPresident signs it, but you would like the negative effects to be \nlimited.\n  That is the spirit in which the amendment is offered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know my colleague is sincere. I have \nnothing but respect for him as he serves on the committee. I have a lot \nof regard for the distinguished Senator, and he knows it, and I know \nit.\n  However long it takes, we need a balanced budget amendment, and I \nthink this is drafted correctly. It has Democrat prints all over it and \nRepublican prints all over it. It is the bipartisan amendment that has \nalways been in play, and I think should always be in play.\n  Frankly, I am hopeful we can pass it by next Tuesday. But however \nlong it takes, we need it. If we do not do it, we will continue the \nstatus quo, and that is a stack of unbalanced budgets, which my friend \nand colleague admits will continue if we do not do something about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of time, and I understand \nthese votes will be stacked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to move to table, with the \nunderstanding it will be able to come up at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The motion to \ntable has been made.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\non amendment No. 14, offered by the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. \nFeingold]. Debate on the amendment is limited to 40 minutes, equally \ndivided.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his \nkind remarks.\n  I now would like to speak about an amendment that is also in the \nspirit of trying to make sure this balanced budget amendment works \nproperly, in the event it goes through the Congress and is ratified by \nthe States.\n  Mr. President, regardless of our views on the balanced budget \namendment, many of us would like us not only to balance the budget, but \nmany of us would like us to establish a statutory balance that can act \nas a fiscal cushion against unexpected emergencies. In other words, we \nthink we should never project a deficit, but that on occasion we may \nwant to project something of a surplus to make sure there is money \nthere in case there is an emergency or some other urgent spending \npriority that has to be dealt with, but only on a surplus basis.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is not some idea I cooked up. This is what \nwe do in Wisconsin. It is done in some form in most States. I think it \nwould make good sense at the Federal level.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, in its current form, the proposed \nbalanced budget amendment discourages this fiscally responsible tool. \nIn effect, it does not really allow a surplus. It certainly does not \nallow a surplus to be used if one arises, except by a three-fifths vote \nin each house, which is a very high standard. Because outlays cannot \nexceed receipts in any year under the balanced budget amendment, any \nsurplus built up to address an unexpected need would be subject to the \nthree-fifths threshold and all the potential mischief that a \nsupermajority requirement employs.\n  Mr. President, many of us in this body have concerns with the way we \ncurrently address emergencies and other unexpected needs as they arise. \nI have seen a lot of that just in the 4 years I have been here dealing \nwith various disaster and emergency legislation. Under our present \nbudget structure, we are forced to choose between adding to the deficit \nand scrambling to find spending cuts or tax increases to offset the \nunexpected need.\n  I think, and we have certainly seen this in Wisconsin, a far more \nfiscally responsible approach would be to appropriate a dedicated \nemergency fund or require a positive ending balance on which we could \ndraw as the need arises. By budgeting for an emergency in advance, this \napproach would avoid deficit funding, but it would also decouple the \npotentially desperate need for emergency assistance from the hurried \napproach of emergency offsets. So a surplus fund or statutory ending \nbalance would also address some of the concerns that have been raised \nby Secretary Rubin and others who have spoken about the important role \nthat automatic economic stabilizers play in the health of the economy.\n  Our committee chairman has cited Fred Bergsten, a noted economist, \nduring the committee's markup. This is what our distinguished chairman \nsaid in citing Mr. Bergsten: ``* * * a better way to go is to shoot for \na yearly surplus and let that take care of truly automatic \nfluctuations, if there are any.''\n  Mr. President, I agree with our chairman. I think balancing the \nbudget and building up a reasonable surplus during good times to help \ncushion economic downturns is a better way to go. However, as I just \nnoted, Mr. President, under the present draft, we could not establish \nand use such a surplus fund without violating the constitutional \namendment mandate except through achieving a three-fifths majority in \neach house.\n  Mr. President, you know that threshold presents serious problems, as \nmany of our colleagues have noted during the course of this debate. The \nsupermajority requirement empowers a minority to hold up a must-pass \nmeasure unless their fiscal or policy demands have been met. As some \nhave noted, this perhaps mild form of extortion might even take the \nform of insisting on additional deficit spending, precisely the \nopposite direction intended by the supporters of the constitutional \namendment. Remember, this balanced budget amendment does not guarantee \nthat we have deficit spending, it just requires a supermajority to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, if allowing a surplus fund might be fiscally prudent \nto handle the unexpected natural disaster or military conflict, I think \nthis surplus opportunity becomes absolutely essential if we hope to \nfund the bulges in Social Security benefits that will occur when the \nbaby boomers retire.\n  In just a few years, we will begin to have to pay back the funds we \nhave borrowed from the Social Security trust fund. Before that happens, \nMr. President, we have to somehow rid ourselves of the addiction to \nthose trust fund surpluses. That is how we have been masking how great \nour deficit is in the past, and we have to begin to balance the budget \nwithout those surpluses. That means, Mr. President, that the unified \nbudget will have to be in surplus, but even then, if we build up a \ngenuine surplus in unified budget to pay future retirees, the \nrestrictions of the proposed balanced budget amendment will prevent us \nfrom using it unless we can muster a three-fifths vote of support in \nboth bodies.\n  Mr. President, right now, the Social Security trust fund is receiving \nmore than it is paying out. Those surpluses will continue to build \nuntil the baby boomers retire, and we need to tap into those savings at \nthat point to offset the bulge in Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, many have said this, but we have abused the Social \nSecurity surpluses by using them to mask part of our budget deficit. I \ndon't single out one party or one branch of Government, because it has \nsort of been standard operating procedure for nearly 30 years. Mr. \nPresident, many of us want to stop that abuse and to work to get the \nbudget off the Social Security surplus addiction so the funds are there \nfor retirees as promised.\n  Mr. President, again, the current balanced budget amendment draft \nwill not let us do that. When the baby boomer retirees begin to collect \nSocial Security and the surpluses turn negative, the balanced budget \namendment does not permit us to draw upon any savings we can build up \nbetween now and then.\n  Now, one approach is to explicitly exempt Social Security from the \nbalanced budget amendment by putting the Social Security trust fund out \nof reach. We could then be sure that they will be available to draw \ndown when needed.\n  Some who oppose this approach argue that we can do so by statute. \nThey note that nothing in the current draft would prevent us from \ntaking Social Security off budget by law, as we do now, and achieve \ngenuine balance outside of Social Security. Unfortunately, though, Mr. \nPresident, even if the rest of the budget is in true balance, the \ncurrent version of the amendment still prevents the use of the trust \nfund savings to pay Social Security benefits, unless the rest of the \nbudget is cut or taxes are increased.\n  Mr. President, the current balanced budget draft requires cash flow \nto be balanced. It expressly prohibits the kind of buildup in \nanticipation of need that is the underpinning of the Social Security \nsystem itself. To put it in more simple terms, it is exactly like \ntelling parents when the time comes to pay the cost of their child's \neducation, they will not be able to use any of the savings they have \nbuilt up, but will have to pay for the cost of their child's college \neducation out of whatever their income is at that time--not one dime \nmore. I can tell you, as a parent of four teenagers, that would be a \nvery troubling prospect indeed.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would allow us to use the savings we must \nbuild up in advance of the coming retirement bulge. Let me be clear \nabout this. Although this is the way it is done in my home State of \nWisconsin--by statute--my amendment does not require us to have a \nsurplus. My amendment does not require us to fulfill our commitment to \nfuture retirees. Yes, Congress could still duck that commitment. But at \nleast, Mr. President, if my amendment is adopted, Congress would be \nable to do the right thing by Social Security beneficiaries. Without \nit--if the Constitution is amended as it is currently drafted--Congress \nwill have to find a dollar in\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nbudget cuts or tax increases for every dollar Social Security outlays \nexceed receipts.\n  Mr. President, despite all the rhetoric about how Social Security \nwill do quite well in what I like to call the ``brave new world of the \nbalanced budget amendment,'' who can doubt that Social Security \nbenefits will quickly go on the chopping block, if we ever get to that \neventuality?\n  Mr. President, this is a fundamental inequity that is built into the \nproposed constitutional amendment. Programs like Social Security, which \nrequire a buildup of savings to work, have to muster a three-fifths \nmajority from both bodies. But the defense budget, special interest \nspending done through the Tax Code, and corporate welfare, all get a \nfree pass. They don't have to go through this.\n  So, Mr. President, to conclude, even if my amendment is adopted, it \nwill be difficult for Social Security to compete with these other \npowerful interests. But at least by allowing for a surplus, my \namendment gives it a fighting chance.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nKyl] is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Hatch was called away for a moment. I \nwould like to present some of the remarks he would make in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  Of course, nothing in Senate Joint Resolution 1 prevents us from \nrunning surpluses or saving those surpluses in a rainy day fund. But \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 does put a lock on savings to ensure that \nthey are not spent frivolously.\n  The proposal before us is based upon the argument that, under the \nbalanced budget amendment, previously accumulated surpluses cannot be \ndrawn upon in future years without a three-fifths vote. This is \nbecause, the argument goes, such funds would be spent as current \noutlays within the meaning of section 7, but would not count as current \nreceipts and would therefore cause outlays to exceed receipts and \ntrigger the three-fifths vote in section 1. Thus, this proposal seeks \nto prevent the use of previously accumulated surplus funds by a simple \nmajority vote.\n  While most of us are concerned with how to stop running deficits, \nthis proposal exhibits concern about accumulated surpluses. Protecting \naccumulated surpluses with a three-fifths vote is not necessarily a \nflaw in the amendment, however. On the contrary, I see it as a \nstrength. Requiring a supermajority to spend previously accumulated \nsurpluses could help us ensure that they are not frittered away on \nenticing, but fundamentally unimportant, spending projects.\n  Let us be realistic, Mr. President, we have had 28 straight years of \ndeficits, and we have run deficits for 58 of the last 66 years. If we \nadopt the balanced budget amendment, we all believe that deficits will \ncome to an end. I do not expect it will be easy to accumulate large \nsurpluses, even under the balanced budget amendment. Proper planning \nand discipline can yield positive results. But I think it's important \nthat we jealously guard the fruits of our budgetary labors and protect \nthe surpluses we have managed to acquire, if any.\n  This amendment seeks to make it easier to spend away any surpluses we \nmanage to acquire. It seems to me that this is an ill-advised policy. \nWe would be wiser to keep the surplus in the strongbox of subject it to \na supermajority requirement to be certain that it is not whisked away \nin yet another Washington spending frenzy. Can we safely assume that \nthe Congress would leave money sitting, unguarded, on the table?\n  The supermajority requirement will help us ensure that when a real \nemergency arises, the surplus will be there to meet truly pressing and \nworthy needs. Both common sense and political reality dictate that \nthere will be very little difficulty in getting the three-fifths \nnecessary because, after all, who would vote against emergency aid when \nthere would be no increase in the deficit?\n  I do have a concern that allowing Congress the option of spending a \nportion of the national savings by simple legislative fiat might erode \nthe effectiveness of the balanced budget amendment by relaxing the \nfiscal constraints on yearly spending. Congress might slip into a habit \nof spending accumulated surpluses with regularity and get used to \nspending beyond our annual income, just as we have gotten into the \nhabit of borrowing under the current system. Then having wasted our \nsavings, we would have much more work just to get back into annual \nbalance habits.\n  If we were fortunate enough to accumulate a sizable surplus, I expect \nwe could stop patting ourselves on the back for simply not increasing \nthe debt and actually start to repay some of the huge debt this country \nhas run up. This is probably the best use of surpluses, particularly \nfrom a cash management perspective, and is what is contemplated as the \nnormal use of surpluses under the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  That is why Senate Joint Resolution 1 does not count repayment of \ndebt principal as total outlays. As we pay down our debt, we will \ncontinue to free up capital, lower interest rates and our annual \ninterest payments, and strengthen the economy, helping us avoid \ndeficits and the need to draw on savings or to borrow. We would also be \nmoving ourselves away from the debt ceiling and building a cushion of \ndebt availability if we should have to borrow again.\n  One final point, Mr. President. We have not balanced the budget in \nalmost 30 years, as I have said before. It is perhaps a bit premature \nto start arguing about how we will spend surpluses. The first order of \nbusiness is to pass the balanced budget amendment and get the deficit \nat least to zero. Then I submit that we can work on surpluses and true \ndebt reduction.\n  This is an interesting proposal, but it ought to be defeated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of \nthe Senator from Arizona. I enjoy serving with him on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I appreciate his candor.\n  Basically, those folks who advocate the constitutional amendment have \nsaid it all here. They have now said formally that if you want to get \nmoney from the Social Security trust fund surplus in the coming years, \nthat in fact the only way to do it is by getting a \nsupermajority, three-fifths of both the Senate and the other body.\n\n  I hope the seniors of this country are listening and realize what we \nare talking about here. It is incredibly difficult to get three-fifths \nof either body on anything. It is hard enough to get over 50 votes on \nanything. And when you are talking about the competition with all the \nspecial interests that are represented in this community, even with a \nfully funded Social Security trust fund, requiring a three-fifths \nmajority of both Houses to fully fund Social Security benefits from the \ntrust fund has to be one of the greatest threats to Social Security \nthat can be imagined.\n  Let's be clear. I do not think anyone has successfully disputed the \nclaim that this constitutional amendment allows the use of Social \nSecurity dollars to balance the budget. That has become very clear in \nthis debate. What this new admission tells us is that if the Congress \nwants to do the right thing after we have a balanced budget amendment \nand wants to make sure that retirees and future retirees have the money \nsaved for them over the years, they will not be able to do it through a \nmajority vote. A minority in either House will be able to prevent every \nsenior citizen in this country from getting the payments they deserve \nand that they paid into the system for. That is what this thing does.\n  This isn't just about seniors. Yes, it is about my generation. It is \nabout baby boomers. Perhaps that will be the first group that will be \naffected by this. But it is also about future generations who certainly \nhope, if they are required to pay into the Social Security system, that \nthere would be a way for them to access their retirement benefits \nwithout having to persuade three-fifths of both Houses of Congress it \nis a good idea. You should not have to persuade three-fifths of the \nCongress that it is a good idea. That is your money. That is your \nretirement benefit.\n  So, basically, our argument has been conceded here. I thank the \nSenator for his candor.\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\n  Let me note that in States where they have a surplus fund, in most of \nthose States they do not require a supermajority in order to access the \nsurplus money. According to the National Conference of State \nLegislators, as of 1995, 45 States and Puerto Rico had created such \nfunds but only about a quarter of them required a supermajority to use \nthe fund.\n  Further, let's remember that States are not faced with having to fund \na program like Social Security that absolutely requires a substantial \nbuildup of savings in advance. As drafted, the balanced budget \namendment puts programs like Social Security at a tremendous \ndisadvantage by requiring a three-fifths vote to use net savings. So \nwhy don't we learn from the experience of the States?\n  The Presiding Officer was a distinguished Governor, and he and the \nother former Governors in this body know that it is very important \nsometimes to have a projected surplus for a rainy day. Apparently, the \nvast majority of the States have determined in their experience--which \nwe don't have here in Washington--that you should not require a \nsupermajority if you need to get at that money either for purposes of \nemergency, or here, in this case, for the very important purpose of \npaying retirement benefits to people who are promised those benefits \nfor their retirement.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nWisconsin and will respond briefly to them.\n  First of all, I think it is important to note that the Feingold \namendment, as I understand it, does not just apply to any potential \nsurplus in the Social Security trust fund but would apply to any \nsurplus. I think that is a correct interpretation.\n  I go back to the comments I made a moment ago to reiterate that it \nought to be more difficult to spend the surplus, first of all, because \nwe could easily get into the habit of saying, ``Well, we have a few \ndollars here in surplus. Let's quickly go out and spend it,'' and, \nsecond, because we are not going to eliminate the debt or even begin to \nrepay the debt if we do not apply surpluses to the debt.\n\n  But as to the argument that this would apply as well to the Social \nSecurity trust fund, I think several comments are in order to the \nextent, if that is true, that it is true. First of all, of course, one \ncould always run a surplus in the rest of the budget as a unified \nbudget to cover the cost that the Senator from Wisconsin is talking \nabout. In any event, this three-fifths vote requirement, so-called \nsupermajority, is necessary to protect the Social Security trust fund \nfrom being raided to ensure that it is used for its true purposes. We \nare running a surplus today. We ought not to make it easier for \nCongress to continue to raid that surplus and spend it on other things.\n  If there is any criticism that I get--and I get plenty when I visit \nwith seniors out in Arizona--it is the criticism of the Congress and \nthe President raiding the Social Security trust fund. They ask, ``Why \nare you spending that on other Government things when it is intended to \nbe spent on Social Security?'' And, of course, they are absolutely \nright. We should not be. We ought to make that as hard to do as \npossible. That is one of the reasons that we are supporting the \nbalanced budget amendment because we recognize that if we do not \nbalance the budget, if we do not begin to set priorities in other \nspending programs, the temptation is always there to continue to raid \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  So, ironically, the whole purpose here, or at least a significant \npart of the purpose, of the balanced budget amendment is to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund. We ought to make it harder to raid that \ntrust fund.\n  I suppose one could postulate the situation in which we are at a \npoint when we have to draw upon the IOU's that are in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, even for Social Security purposes. And I do not \nthink that there is anybody in the House or the Senate who would argue \nthat, in that circumstance, it would be very difficult to get the \nthree-fifths vote. I mean no politician, nobody here in Washington, DC, \nis going to say, ``No, we don't think we will fund Social Security this \nyear.'' That is the one obligation that all of us take as kind of our \nfirst rule. And, obviously, no one would be able to face the folks back \nhome if we didn't do that, and we should not. We have that obligation. \nWe owe that obligation, and it would be done.\n  We have provided a supermajority in here for other kinds of emergency \nsituations, and we have said those are clearly situations in which, if \nit is necessary, you could get 60 votes in the Senate, and three-fifths \nin the House, as well.\n  I daresay, if we ever got to that eventuality, even if this applied \nto that situation, it would not be difficult to get the 60 votes \nnecessary.\n  So it seems to me that, as I said before, we are really worried about \nsomething here that isn't going to happen. I would much rather focus \nour attention on getting the budget in balance than to worry about what \nis going to happen after we do that and we start to run surpluses. I \nthink that will be a wonderful day, if we ever get there. I do not \nthink we will have trouble figuring out how to spend the extra money, \nand I would rather make it difficult to spend it so we can make sure \nthat at least part of that begins to go to pay our national debt.\n  I would be happy to stop at this point, if the Senator from Wisconsin \nhas any other thoughts to engage in this debate further.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 4 minutes and \n15 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me respond to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. He \nreferred to the belief that we should worry about spending, what he has \nreferred to as the ``extra money'' when we get to the point of the \nsurplus. I guess the main thrust of my remarks is that I wasn't talking \nreally about extra money. I am sure that could happen. I will address \nan example of that in a moment.\n  What we are talking about here is a formula against money which is \notherwise known as the Social Security trust fund. Are we going to \nstart thinking about whether we are going to honor the obligations to \nour retirees only at the point that we have a surplus? That is what it \nsounds like. We get to that point, and say, ``Oh, there is a bunch of \nmoney in here for Social Security. Let's see if we can get 60 votes of \nthe Senate to hand that money out.''\n  That strikes me as very different than a discussion of what we are \ngoing to do about extra money. What we are talking about here is \nwhether we are going to basically pull the rug out from under people \nwho paid into a system for the express purpose of providing for their \nretirement. There are really very few things that are more important to \nworking people in this country.\n  I do not think there has been a real response to my concern that the \nbar is being set higher for Social Security under this amendment than \nit is for other programs. That is because Social Security by its nature \nrequires the buildup of a surplus in order to work. Such a program, in \norder to access those surplus funds, has to get three-fifths of both \nHouses, but other programs, the Defense Department, corporate welfare, \nand wasteful spending programs, need only obtain a simple majority as \nlong as it is within the balance of the balanced budget amendment.\n  This is very serious business. Let us finally just take the example \nof surplus funds that might be used for a different purpose. Let us say \nthere is a surplus that builds up--and I think the folks on the other \nside of the aisle might be attracted to this--and Congress decides they \nexpected and they would like to give the people in the country a tax \ncut. Maybe they decide it is not the Government's money; it is the \npeople's money, and there is enough money in surplus to give everybody \n$500 of tax relief.\n  Under this amendment as it is now drafted, that built up surplus \ncould not be used to cut taxes unless you had 60 votes. And as strong \nas the Republican majority is in this body, you do not have 60 votes. \nYou would need 60 votes to give the American people the benefits of \nthat surplus in the form of a tax\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\ncut. That does not strike me as similar to the arguments I have heard \nabout the urgency of tax cuts in the past, and I do believe that would \nbe the effect of the proposed balanced budget amendment if we do not \nadopt the amendment I have suggested to allow a surplus to be used for \nother purposes as long as a simple majority is achieved in both Houses.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nWisconsin, I am a little bit confused about the last point he made. \nPerhaps he could clarify this. Was the Senator from Wisconsin \nsuggesting that if we might want to cut taxes because we have a surplus \nof funds unassociated with Social Security, it would require a 60-vote \nmajority? Or was the Senator from Wisconsin assuming that the surplus \nthat he described was the IOU's in the Social Security trust fund?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This would relate, Mr. President, to the surplus that \nhas been built up over several years.\n  Mr. KYL. Would it be the surplus in the Social Security trust fund or \njust surpluses that would be accumulated over the years?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Surpluses we have accumulated.\n  Mr. KYL. In that event, Mr. President, I do not understand the \nargument of the Senator from Wisconsin, because we are not going to \nneed 60 votes simply to reduce taxes. If we have a surplus, then the \nrevenues that would be lost theoretically from a reduction in taxes \nwould have to be offset. But there is no requirement in that case that \nthere be a supermajority to cut taxes. The revenue that would result \nthat would show up in subsequent years would be required to be taken \ninto account in order to determine whether we had a balanced budget and \nwhether we needed to reduce expenditures in subsequent years. But at \nthe time that we would make the decision to cut taxes, there would not \nbe a requirement for a 60-vote majority.\n  To the other point that the Senator made, asking the question with \nregard to the Social Security trust fund, that I was somehow suggesting \nthat we only honor our obligation when we have a surplus, I do not \nunderstand that either because, of course, that was not my point. That \nis not the fact.\n  We have an obligation to our Social Security recipients, \nour retirees, that has to be satisfied regardless of whether the Social \nSecurity trust fund is in surplus or in deficit. That is a solemn \ncommitment that we all understand and we are prepared to meet.\n\n  Over the last several years, we have been building up a surplus \ntheoretically, so we are in the situation now where there is a surplus. \nWe are meeting the obligations. That is not at issue. We have to \nsatisfy our obligations to our seniors. In the event that we begin to \nrun a deficit, that obligation would have to be satisfied, as I \ndescribed before. Nobody in this body or the other body is going to \ncontend that somehow the balanced budget amendment is going to preclude \nus from doing that. It is an expenditure that is probably the first \nexpenditure we will want to make around here. My guess is that there \nmight be a bridge here or special subsidy there that might fall by the \nwayside, but Social Security payments are not going to fall by the \nwayside.\n  In fact, again, unless we balance the budget, Social Security, along \nwith everything else, is in jeopardy. Most of us, I think, would \nundoubtedly agree with the Senator from Wisconsin that Social Security \nis one of the very first obligations we are going to have to meet, and, \ntherefore, it is probably not in jeopardy. I think we would all contend \nunder no circumstances would we ever allow it to be in jeopardy. It is \ngoing to be other programs.\n  But I would rather be in a position to say we can fund all the things \nthat we would like to fund that are necessary to fund. If we do not get \nour budget in balance, we are not going to have that ability. There \nwill come a time when there is not enough money to spend on key things \nlike law enforcement and national defense and critical programs because \nour debt will have gotten so high that the interest payments on the \ndebt are eating up the largest part of our budget.\n  We have to get to the point where we are not running deficits \nanymore, our annual deficits are zero, but we can begin to pay down the \nnational debt. That is why we need a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  I think perhaps the best illustration of this is to look at the \nbudget that the President presented to us just a couple of weeks ago. \nIt is an amazing document because while the President purports to \ndemonstrate that we can reach a balanced budget in 5 years, and \ntherefore we do not need to pass the balanced budget amendment, his \nbudget demonstrates precisely the opposite. It proves that you cannot \nget here from there unless you are required to do so by the \nConstitution. How so? Apart from the fact that the Congressional Budget \nOffice says it is not in balance by somewhere between $50 and $70 \nbillion--leave that aside--the President proposes that most of the \nsavings that would be required to get into balance are in the last 2 \nyears of the 5-year period--incidentally, after he is no longer \nPresident. Seventy-five percent of the savings would have to be made in \nthe last 2 years, fully 47 percent in the last year--almost half of all \nthe savings over a 5-year period.\n  Now, what does that mean? Our budget deficit last year was $107.9 \nbillion. We are going to go up to something like, I don't know, $126 \nbillion this next year and $127 billion the year after that. We are \nsupposed to be getting to zero.\n  I had an old rancher friend tell me once if you are in a hole and you \nwant to get out, the first thing you do is stop digging. This President \nwould not stop digging until the very end and then magically, somehow \nor other, after he is long gone, we are going to ratchet up the courage \nto make all kinds of savings that we cannot decide to make in this year \nor the next year or the year after that. It is a little bit like the \nfellow who swears he is going to go on a diet; he has to lose 30 \npounds. So he says, all right, I am going to do it by July 4. I am \ngoing to lose 30 pounds. First, however, I am going to eat like heck \nand gain another 20 pounds. And then, by golly, on July 1 I am going to \nstart losing and by July 4 it will all be gone.\n  It is not going to happen. That is why you need the discipline of the \nbalanced budget amendment to force us to set the priorities so that we \ncan achieve a zero deficit within 5 years, stop the accumulation of \nadditional debt, which requires us to pay more interest on the debt, \nwhich eats up moneys that could be spent on education, on the \nenvironment, on defense, on law enforcement, on any number of things--\non Social Security. As I said, I mean all of us around here will agree \nSocial Security comes first. So we really do not have to worry about \nSocial Security. But we ought to be worrying about all of these other \nthings because many of them are important just like Social Security is. \nAnd there is not going to be enough money for them if we do not get \nthis budget in balance. That will not happen, as the President's own \nbudget illustrates very clearly, until we have the discipline of a \nmandatory requirement under the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  So, again, I think this is where we really ought to be focusing right \nnow. We can worry about how we are going to spend the surpluses if and \nwhen we ever get there. For now I would just be pleased to get to the \npoint of zero. That is what is going to be required if we are going to \nbe in balance, and that means we have to pass the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute two seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  I think the discussion of both the issue of tax cuts and the Social \nSecurity benefits points up how serious it is to amend the Constitution \nin order to balance the budget. In effect, we are not going to be able \nto use a surplus that has been built up to give a tax cut. If we do not \nworry about it now and we only worry about it when there is a surplus, \nthe problem is it is going to be in the Constitution. We are not going \nto be able to just fix it. We had one experience like that in this \ncountry in prohibition, and it took quite an effort to undo it.\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\n  So, again, there appears to be a major uncertainty with regard to \nthis. The important question is do we really want to be faced in the \nfuture years with a system set forth in the Constitution that gives us \nno flexibility, that requires a three-fifths majority of both Houses in \norder to simply access and use the Social Security trust funds?\n  The other side is not denying that is what is happening. In fact, \nthey say that is what should have to happen--and that is what our \nretirees of the future may face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a couple of the minutes we have \nremaining here. Let me reiterate. We are talking about two things here. \nOne, we are talking about accumulated surpluses that don't have \nanything to do with Social Security. The point I made on behalf of \nChairman Hatch is, if we ever get to that wonderful point, I don't \nthink we will have any trouble figuring out how to spend that money. In \nfact, a lot of us would like to make it a little harder to spend so we \ncan begin applying it to deficit reduction. So I am not concerned if it \nrequires us to get 60 votes here to do that.\n  Folks watching, of course, may appreciate that it takes 60 votes to \ndo most things here in the U.S. Senate because a 40-vote minority can \nalways filibuster. In order to break that filibuster and actually bring \nsomething to a vote here you have to have 60 votes. This is about the \nonly body that I know of where a Member cannot call the question and \nautomatically get a vote. We cannot get a vote in this body unless \nthere is unanimous consent or 60 Members agree. So there is a 60-vote \nrequirement to do a lot of things around here. Again, I am not too \nworried about getting a 60-vote requirement to spend surplus money in \nthe U.S. Treasury. I suspect that will be a pretty easy thing to do.\n  As to the matter of Social Security, again I think all of us are \nunited in our concern. I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his \nconcern about Social Security recipients, and I know Chairman Hatch and \nall the Members on this side have the same concern. Again, I am not at \nall concerned that Members here would somehow slight Social Security \nrecipients. They are going to be the first obligation that we satisfy.\n  But, as I said, there is not going to be enough money for any of \nthese things if we don't get the budget in balance.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield any additional time I have.\n  I move to table the Feingold amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs \non amendment No. 10, offered by the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy].\n  Debate on the amendment is limited to 2 hours equally divided.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope, depending upon the interest of \nour colleagues, we might be able to address this issue in a more \nlimited period of time and get back on schedule. But at this time, we \nwill move to the time agreement and then try to respond to the leader's \nrequest that we move as expeditiously as we can to the conclusion of \nsome of these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment to guarantee exclusive \ncongressional enforcement of the balanced budget constitutional \namendment and to avoid the serious problem of judicial enforcement \nunder the pending version of the amendment. The balanced budget \namendment would overturn the basic principle of separation of powers by \ngiving the courts and the President enforcement authority. We must take \nclear steps to avoid such a situation.\n  The proponents of this amendment apparently believe the old adage \nthat silence is golden. They say that because the amendment remains \nsilent with regard to judicial review and Presidential impoundment \npower, the Congress has not sanctioned either form of enforcement. \nUnfortunately, numerous constitutional scholars disagree. During the \nlast debate on this issue, 17 of our country's most well-respected \nscholars urged Congress to reject the proposed balanced budget \namendment. Conservative and liberal constitutional experts shared the \nconviction that the proposed balanced budget amendment was a mistake, \nand they specifically stated that the amendment would inappropriately \ninvolve the judiciary in intractable questions of fiscal and budget \npolicy.\n  The proposal before us today raises those same concerns. The \namendment I offer today addresses this problem by granting Congress \nexclusive authority to enforce the balanced budget constitutional \namendment unless Congress authorizes otherwise in the implementing \nlegislation. The courts could not become involved in the many complex \nbudgetary questions that would be raised by taxpayers, Members of \nCongress, or other citizens without specific authorization from \nCongress.\n  If the Senate does not adopt this amendment, Congress may not have \nanother opportunity to narrow the Court's enforcement authority. I know \nthat some balanced budget amendment proponents argue that the Congress \ncan step in at a later date to address this problem. But constitutional \nscholars disagree. Cass Sunstein, a well respected constitutional \nscholar at the University of Chicago, said:\n\n       It is by no means clear that Congress can forbid judicial \n     involvement by statute. Courts are quite reluctant to allow \n     Congress to preclude judicial review of constitutional \n     claims.\n\n  This amendment also protects against Presidential impoundment power, \nwhich was soundly rejected in the 1970's. At that time President Nixon \nunilaterally impounded funds for programs he did not like.\n  In 1974, we made those actions illegal, but unless we act again, the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment restores that authority to the \nPresident. The problem solved by this amendment is real.\n  Proponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment argue that \nthere are few, if any, risks that the courts will micromanage the \nFederal budget. They say that article III of the Constitution is a bar \nto judicial intrusion. But if that is the case, why did 92 Members of \nthe Senate support an amendment offered last year by Senator Nunn and \nSenator Conrad which limited judicial action unless specifically \nauthorized by legislation?\n  We all know that the risk of judicial intervention is very high, and \narticle III does not afford protection. As Stuart Gerson, a former \nJustice Department official who testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee in support of the balanced budget amendment, said:\n\n       The ``case or controversy'' requirement of article III is \n     the greatest bulwark against undue judicial intervention in \n     budgetary matters, but it is not an impregnable barrier.\n\n  The reality is that the balanced budget amendment is likely to \nproduce numerous lawsuits in Federal and State courts.\n  Neither article III doctrines, which are not applicable in State \ncourts, nor practices of judicial deference will operate as automatic \nprotections against the flood of litigation that could be brought by \ntaxpayers and others. Such cases will force courts to act to analyze \ncomplicated economic questions and prescribe remedies.\n  For example, can a State or Federal court enjoin Government spending \nif three-fifths of both Houses of Congress are unable to raise the debt \nlimit?\n  Could a court levy taxes to prevent an unauthorized deficit?\n  Can a Member of Congress file suit because he or she disagrees about \nwhat constitutes a revenue increase and then argue that such an \nincrease was not adopted by a constitutional majority?\n  Could a criminal defendant file suit because he or she was charged \nunder a law claimed to cost more to enforce than the Government can \nfinance through expected proceeds?\n  These questions and others regarding funding for Social Security, \nMedicare, education and the environment would rest in the hands of \nunelected judges and judicial intervention can easily disrupt Federal \nservices that all Americans depend on. Citizens could find ``closed'' \nsigns on Federal agencies, parks and museums because employees have \nbeen furloughed or hours opened\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\nto the public have been cut back. Our Republican friends in Congress \nclosed down the Government in 1995. Surely they don't want a repetition \nof that experience at the hands of judges.\n  Supporters of this amendment may believe these risks are unlikely, \nbut we all know that deficits and lawsuits are not rare, and we have an \nobligation to tell the American people what will happen if the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment is not obeyed.\n  The amendment also grants a great deal of power to the President. \nWhat is the President required to do if it becomes clear that outlays \nwill exceed receipts and Congress has not authorized the deficit?\n  Secretary Rubin, former Reagan Solicitor General Charles Fried, and \nformer Attorney General Nick Katzenbach agree that the President would \nhave the obligation to impound funds. Testifying before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in 1995, Solicitor General Walter Dellinger said \nthat if the command for a balanced budget were about to be violated, he \nwould advise the President that he not only had the right, but also the \nconstitutional obligation, to step in and prevent the violation by \nimpounding money before the budget became imbalanced.\n  What does that mean to American families? It means that across-the-\nboard cuts or specific cuts will reduce or eliminate Federal programs \nand that projects in particular States will be subject to cuts. This \nauthority makes the line-item veto look mild by comparison.\n\n  We all know that many Republicans want to slash Federal funds for \neducation or even eliminate the Department of Education entirely. If \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment is enacted, there is \nnothing to prevent a President from using the excuse to balance the \nbudget to unilaterally deny funds for education or even close the \nDepartment.\n  The balanced budget constitutional amendment unnecessarily places a \nhuge question mark in the Constitution. The deficit is going down, the \neconomy is improving, President Clinton has put us on the road to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. We don't need these serious \nenforcement problems under the balanced budget amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to avoid them by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the last time we \ndebated this amendment it was the judgment of this body to accept the \nNunn-Conrad amendment, which would have provided a limitation on \nFederal court enforcement. Similarly, the Congress before that accepted \na Danforth amendment that was related to the authority of the \njudiciary. On both of those occasions, it was the judgment of the U.S. \nSenate that this was a real issue, with the real potential of resulting \nin the kinds of situations that I have outlined briefly this afternoon.\n  This body either intends that we permit the courts to make judgments \nabout different programs, that we permit unelected judges to make \njudgments about matters dealing with the budget and dealing with the \nexpenditures of resources--judgments the Constitution authorizes \nCongress to make--or it doesn't. Courts are there to interpret the law; \nCongress to make budget and resource allocation decisions.\n  With this balanced budget constitutional amendment, we are providing \nan open door for courts not just to interpret the law, but use their \npower to preempt the power of the Congress of the United States in \nallocating resources.\n  We are also giving that additional power to the executive branch in \nterms of impoundment.\n  If it is the decision of the majority that that is not the case, then \nthis amendment should be acceptable. But I ask my colleagues to review \nwith me the statements of a number of those who have supported the \nbalanced budget amendment. Many of those proponents specifically say \nthey believe the courts will have enforcement authority, and it is one \nof their reasons for supporting the balanced budget amendment. We can \ngo back and review the report of the Judiciary Committee, which gets \ninto some considerable detail on that.\n  If we are seriously interested in protecting Congress' constitutional \nduty to make judgments regarding the budget, then we ought to support \nthis amendment and make it very, very clear.\n  Finally, for those who have said, ``We can address this issue at a \nlater time with a statute,'' we cannot rely on that because such a \nstatute may very well be unconstitutional.\n  So, if we are serious about ultimately preserving Congress' authority \nto make judgments regarding resource allocation, we ought to accept \nthis amendment.\n  If there is another intention, then it will be rejected. But the \nAmerican people ought to understand the vast enhancement of authority \nand responsibility that we are giving to the President of the United \nStates and to the courts of this country. They ought to understand that \nthe President and unelected judges will be making judgments about the \nbudget and taxes, not Congress.\n  That, I think, is an issue that should not be left to general \nstatements or comments on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In the past, \nthis body has been willing to define those powers, and we should not \nabdicate that responsibility today. I urge my colleagues to accept this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to just raise one of the \nquestions that rises under the Kennedy amendment, to ask the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts to respond to what I think is a real dilemma that is \ncreated. I presume it is an unintentional consequence, but it is the \nkind of thing that we have to be very careful of because, obviously, we \nare amending the Constitution here. We need to be very, very careful we \ndo not do something wrong or something that would have a consequence \nthat would be undesirable.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts referred to the Nunn amendment from \nlast year, which most Members of the Senate supported, and essentially \ncompared his amendment to the Nunn amendment. There are a couple of \nsubtle differences which makes a big difference between the Senator's \namendment and the Nunn amendment.\n  The Nunn amendment from last year provided that absent specific \nlegislative authority, judicial review by the courts would not be \npossible, that is to say, ``The courts would not have jurisdiction for \nclaims arising under the balanced budget amendment.'' And that was the \nlanguage, ``for claims arising under the balanced budget amendment.'' \nThe Senator's amendment, however, provides and adds specific \nlegislation and authorizes judicial review: ``Congress shall have \nexclusive authority to enforce the provisions'' under the balanced \nbudget amendment so that the courts would have no enforcement role.\n  Let me repeat that in a moment here. Then I will provide a \nhypothetical which illustrates why that is not a good thing.\n  The courts would have no enforcement role--that includes, of course, \nthe right to protect a citizen who is acting under the Constitution in \nconformance with his constitutional rights and, therefore, would be \ndenied the protection of the court. Could such a situation arise? Yes.\n  The Kennedy amendment allows Congress unconstitutionally to raise \ntaxes by use of a voice vote and no court can hold the tax \nunconstitutional. The balanced budget amendment requires raising taxes \nby rollcall vote. That, of course, means that we all have to cast our \nvote when our name is called. It is a written record, that each one go \non record. And that is for a reason, of course. But if the Congress \nwere to raise taxes by a voice vote, in violation of that \nconstitutional amendment, citizens would be in a quandary of whether or \nnot they could raise the question of the unconstitutionality of the \nimposition of a tax in defense when they are prosecuted for failure to \npay the tax.\n  The Nunn amendment did not have this draconian effect. Under the Nunn \namendment, any taxpayer could raise as a defense the argument that the \nCongress passed an unconstitutional tax. The Kennedy amendment \nforecloses that debate by precluding court action by providing that the \nexclusive\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\nenforcement is by the Congress. So Senator Kennedy's amendment would \nallow the Government effectively to imprison taxpayers for refusing to \npay an unconstitutional tax.\n  Of course, that is an unintended consequence of the Kennedy \namendment, but it is a consequence. And it is one of the reasons why we \nshould not adopt the Kennedy amendment.\n  One of the reasons why it is so hard to amend the Constitution is \nthat we want to be absolutely certain that everything we have done will \nwithstand the scrutiny of time and the Constitution. That is why we \nhave a lot of hearings and debates, and perhaps one of the reasons why \nan amendment which comes to the floor for the first time for debate has \nnot had the kind of hearings that would illustrate the problems with \nthe amendment. That is an important part of our process here.\n  The Nunn amendment went through that process. It was thoroughly \ndebated and was approved. The Kennedy amendment, by making a very \nslight change in the Nunn amendment, raises a very serious \nconstitutional question, and it is one of the reasons why I would not \nbe able to vote for the Kennedy amendment.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as the Senator might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment by my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts. I do so because it speaks directly to one \nof the most significant, yet still unanswered questions about this \nproposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue I want to speak \nabout today goes to the very heart and structure of our democratic \nsystem of Government, that being the role the courts will play if this \namendment is adopted.\n  As has often been the case during this debate on the issue of \njudicial enforcement, we have rarely moved the dialog beyond \ngeneralities and hypotheticals to resolve with any finality what role \nif any the courts will play if the balanced budget amendment becomes a \npart of our Constitution.\n  Unless the proposed amendment is modified to make clear that the \njudiciary shall not assume the responsibilities of managing the \nfinancial obligation and priorities of this Nation, it could well turn \nover to the courts decisionmaking authority on issues such as tax rates \nand spending priorities, decisions which I think we all agree should \nremain within the purview of the Congress and the executive branch.\n  As the President has said, all it takes to balance the budget is our \nvotes and his signature. Yet, this amendment potentially wrests from \nCongress our ability and, in my opinion, our responsibility to make the \ntough choices and lays them at the foot of the judiciary. We should \nmake it clear that unelected judges will not assume the role which is \nbetter left to those who are elected by the voters.\n  In raising my concern with the potential role of the judiciary \nenforcing the balanced budget amendment, I want to make it clear that I \ndo not do so out of disrespect or disregard for the courts and their \nvery significant role in our democracy. Nor do I rise to engage in the \nkind of assault on the integrity of the judiciary that has become all \ntoo commonplace in recent years when a contrary decision manifests \nitself into a full-scale assault on the judicial system of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, our system of justice is by no means foolproof. Nor \ndoes it always reach popular results. It is, however, the best system \nthat has been devised throughout history. And this is due in large \nmeasure to its independence, to the independence of the judiciary. The \nFederal judges are granted life tenure so that they may be free to \ninterpret the law without fear of retribution during the next election \ncycle. The independence of the judiciary is as important to our \ndemocracy as any other element, and I do not rise to question that \nindependence or to castigate members of the judiciary. Rather, I rise \nbecause the failure to address the role of the courts in this amendment \nstrikes at the very heart of our system of government. Our system of \nchecks and balances between our three branches has prevented any one \nbranch from becoming too powerful.\n  This body, the legislative branch, the branch closest to the people, \nwas given the responsibility of making the laws and controlling the \npurse. The executive is charged with the primary responsibility for \nexecution of the laws and the judiciary with interpretation and \nenforcement of them.\n  The premise that the courts shall interpret and enforce the laws has \nbeen a fundamental notion throughout our constitutional history. \nAlthough noted in the accompanying views of both the proponents and \nopponents in the report on this amendment, the words of Chief Justice \nJohn Marshall, in Marbury versus Madison, are worth reiteration here.\n\n       It is, emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial \n     department, to say what the law is.\n\n  Mr. President, there could be little doubt that the courts of this \nNation play a significant and vital role in our democracy. As was \npointed out by my colleague in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \nSenator Torricelli, the difference between our Constitution and those \nof other countries is not necessarily in the rights that it assures, \nbut that they will be enforced by an independent judiciary. It is this \nstructure which has served us so well for so long.\n  However, that structure is also based upon the assumption that the \ncourts will not be given the responsibility for actions which are \nintended to and have historically been reserved for elected officials \nin both the executive and legislative branches. In the context of this \namendment, that assumption simply cannot be made.\n  If the balanced budget amendment is added to this Nation's charter, \nwithout clarifying and limiting the role of the courts and establishing \nfiscal priorities for our Nation, it will constitute nothing less than \na radical restructuring of our democratic system of government. In \nfact, the history of this amendment illustrates the significance of \nthis issue.\n  On two previous occasions, in 1994 and 1995, the text of the balanced \nbudget amendment was modified in respect to the role of the courts: \nOnce to limit involvement to declaratory judgments and, most recently, \nto allow implementing legislation to define the role of the courts. \nYet, despite these facts, proponents of this amendment, the one we are \nto vote on next week, now argue that the best approach to this \nsignificant threshold issue is simply silence. They are not open to the \nkinds of changes that were added in the last two attempts to pass this \namendment to our Constitution.\n\n  The committee report states that it is the belief of the proponents \nthat:\n\n       S.J. Res. 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial \n     review. By remaining silent about judicial review in the \n     amendment itself, its authors have refused to establish \n     congressional sanction for the Federal courts to involve \n     themselves in fundamental macroeconomic and budgetary \n     questions, while not undermining their equally fundamental \n     obligation to ``say what the law is . . .''\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, it seems under a veil of silence the proponents \nare simply choosing not to address this issue.\n  I also note that I do not believe that the courts of this Nation have \nhistorically waited for congressional sanction before addressing issues \nraised by the U.S. Constitution. In short, the committee report seems \nto be saying that Congress will not explicitly give the courts their \napproval to do something which, in fact, the courts may already do on \ntheir own--interpret and enforce the Constitution. To me, Mr. \nPresident, this approach is the kind of classic sidestepping of \ncritical issues which has plagued this debate and that fosters public \ncynicism for this body and elected officials in general.\n  In response to this concern, one can anticipate that proponents will \nargue that we should set aside such issues and just address them within \nimplementing legislation. This has been standard throughout the \ndebate--much as the balanced budget amendment allows us to forestall \nthe tough votes needed to balance the budget, the distant promise of \nimplementing legislation allows us to forestall answering the tough \nquestions about this proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to ask the American people to amend \nthe Constitution in a manner as unprecedented\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nas this amendment, I believe they have a right to know exactly what the \namendment will mean to them. They should have a chance to know that \nnow, not after it has already been locked into the Constitution in a \nway that we cannot easily undo.\n  The hollow promise that all of these issues may be resolved at some \nunspecified point in the distant future should not be the basis on \nwhich we choose to amend the U.S. Constitution. It is more than a bit \nironic that many of the same Members of this Congress who support the \nbalanced budget amendment on the ground that Congress lacks the \ndiscipline and responsibility to balance the budget ourselves, have \nlittle trouble asking the American people to trust that same Congress \nto somehow properly address the myriad of uncertainties created by this \namendment through implementing legislation.\n  Mr. President, if the 105th Congress is intent on adding a balanced \nbudget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, then we better do it \ncorrectly. We should know what it means and we should address \nsituations like judicial review now, not later.\n  Furthermore, by placing the intent of the Congress into the \namendment, the potential result of the Presidential veto of \nimplementing legislation is avoided. There can be little doubt that the \ndebate over implementing legislation will be a very protracted and \ndifficult debate involving issues of separation of powers and \nenforcement, among others. What if the President vetoes implementing \nlegislation and Congress cannot muster the two-thirds necessary to \noverride?\n  At this point, does anyone truly believe that the courts will simply \nsit idly by and wait for Congress and the President to reach an accord \non implementing legislation? They must, Mr. President, have a duty to \nenforce constitutional requirements and the fact that Congress and the \nExecutive cannot agree on legislation does not simply and suddenly \nnegate that duty. While section 6 of the balanced budget amendment \nauthorizes the Congress to create implementing legislation, that \nauthority is not exclusive and does not preclude court action.\n  Quite simply, Mr. President, as currently configured, this amendment \ndoes nothing to stop the courts from fulfilling their historic role of \ninterpreting and enforcing the Constitution of this Nation.\n  While the committee report seeks to silently advocate the position \nthat the involvement of courts should be limited, many proponents of \nthe amendment have argued for significant judicial involvement. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce testified that there is in fact a legitimate \nand necessary role for the courts in maintaining the integrity of the \nbalanced budget requirement.\n  This position is not ahistorical as the courts have historically \nplayed a legitimate role in maintaining the protections embodied in our \nConstitution. As Alan B. Morrison of Public Citizen testified before \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n       Does anyone believe that the First, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth or \n     Fourteenth Amendments, to mention a few, would be respected \n     by our governments if the Federal Judiciary were not there to \n     back up the words with court orders?\n\n  The notion that the role of the courts would be limited because the \namendment will not spawn litigation is simply unfounded. Constitutional \nscholars, from Robert Bork to Kathleen Sullivan have agreed that this \namendment will force the issue before the courts in myriad lawsuits. \nFormer Judge Bork argued that the potential for thousands of cases, \nwith inconsistent results, would be before the courts.\n  Thus, what the American people are faced with is this: An amendment \nwhich is intentionally silent on the role of the courts, the looming \nspecter of thousands of lawsuits, and a Judiciary which has \nhistorically, and in my opinion properly, played a primary role in \nresolving constitutional conflicts. Given these factors, is there any \nquestion that in the absence of an express limitation the courts will \nbecome hopelessly immersed in the budgetary decisions which should be \nleft up to Congress?\n  When faced with such a scenario, proponents argue that the issue of \nstanding will preclude court intervention, despite the fact that doing \nso suggests that the constitutional amendment is virtually inoperative \nbecause no one would be able to go into court and have it enforced. \nWhile some argue that only a handful of parties may have standing, and \nstill others argue for a more broad interpretation, no one can argue or \nbe sure who, in fact, will be heard by the courts. Further, the \narguments on both sides of the issue must be viewed in the context of \nthe amendment being added to the Constitution.\n  For example, while the proponents argue that the amendment does not \nallow for Presidential impoundment, it is conceivable that the \nPresident, backed by the new amendment, could argue he or she not only \nhas the power to impound appropriated funds but also a constitutionally \nmandated obligation to do so. If such action would occur, individuals \nwhose retirement checks are withheld or Federal employees whose \nsalaries have been reduced by executive fiat would surely have standing \nto sue. What about a suit brought by Members of Congress challenging \nthe actions of the Executive?\n  Testimony received from Stuart Gerson, former Acting Attorney General \nand proponent of the notion that judicial intervention will be narrow, \nwho conceded some limited form of standing may exist and that judicial \nreview is not fully foreclosed. What about the potential for taxpayers \nbringing lawsuits--potentially in the State courts?\n  The simple and uncontroverted fact, Mr. President, is that we do not \nknow the answers to these questions.\n  In response, the proponents argue that the balanced budget amendment \nstrikes the proper response by remaining silent. We can continue to \nhave hypothetical debates ad infinitum, and we will never resolve, \nuntil the courts themselves do so, what will happen when these lawsuits \nare filed. Until such time, this is all speculation, speculation which \nprovides an insufficient foundation in my view on which to amend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Failure to address the issue in the context of this amendment will \nresult in three unfortunate and unnecessary results: First, unelected \njudges, potentially both State and Federal, will be inserted into \npolicymaking positions for which they have no experience. Second, such \na result will constitute a radical and unwise transformation of \nresponsibility of three branches of our democratic Government. Third, \nthis shift in power could do incalculable damage to our system of \njustice itself. Not only would the practical, policy driven demands \nburden the courts, but the potential backlash for unpopular judiciary \ndecisions would threaten to undermine the effectiveness of the courts \nand risk the independence of that important branch.\n  One can only assume that a court forced to make a tough if \nconstitutionally mandated budgetary decision would no doubt feel the \nsting not only of angry public sentiment, but also from Members of \nCongress, many of whom engage in this type of rhetoric even now. Mr. \nPresident, we should make the tough choices, not the courts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is no secret that I oppose this amendment \nto the Constitution for a number of reasons, many of which I have had \nthe chance to speak about today, and also because it is unnecessary to \namend the Constitution in order to balance the budget. Many have argued \nthis amendment will instill within the Congress the character necessary \nto balance the budget--I disagree. Character cannot be constitutionally \nmandated. It can only be revealed through accepting responsibility and \nmaking the tough choices and doing it now.\n  The amendment before this body potentially forestalls the enactment \nof the balanced budget well into the next century. In doing so, it \namends our fundamental charter, and it does so in a manner that creates \nmore questions than it resolves. This is not the way to balance the \nbudget, nor, in my opinion, is it the way to maintain the integrity of \nour great Constitution.\n  While we may disagree on the utility of amending the Constitution, I \nhope we can at least strike agreement on the particular issue of \njudicial review. For the reasons I and others have outlined, it is the \nheight of foolishness to leave something as important as this \nunresolved. For many of my colleagues who call themselves conservatives \nand\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\ncriticize what they believe to be judicial excess, explicitly \nforeclosing judicial intervention would seem to be a very simple, \nappropriate, and appealing solution to what is a legitimate and \npotentially catastrophic problem.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor back to the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, let me just say we should not leave important \nbudgetary decisions in the uncertain hands of unelected judges. We \nshould make them ourselves. We can ensure this result by clarifying the \nrole of the courts in this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I will respond briefly to my good friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, \nregarding the political will and courage for the Senate, House--the \nCongress--to simply balance the budget. We heard that in the State of \nthe Union Address: ``Pass a balanced budget and the President will sign \nit.'' We have heard that referred to repeatedly from the other side of \nthe aisle. I stand next to 28 years of budget books, over 50 volumes \nthat I think bears mute evidence to the lack of political will and \ncourage in Congress and the evidence that we simply won't do it without \nconstitutional discipline.\n  In 1986, my brother, who now serves in the House of Representatives, \nwas running for this body, the U.S. Senate. The balanced budget \namendment the previous year had been defeated in this body by one vote. \nSo that was a very big political issue in the campaign that year. Over \nand over again it was said, ``We don't need the balanced budget \namendment. We simply need the courage to do it.'' So now, 11 years \nlater, with over $1 trillion in additional debt, we hear those same \nrecycled arguments brought before the U.S. Senate again.\n  I want to comment a bit on the contention that the balanced budget \namendment is both unenforceable and that the courts will impermissibly \ninterfere with the budget process, or that a President may simply just \nimpound things to resolve a budget shortfall. I agree with Senator \nHatch's long-held position that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution ought to be silent as to judicial review. The long-\nexisting and well-recognized precepts of the standing separation of \npowers, as well as the political question doctrine, restrains courts \nfrom interfering with the budgetary process. After all, courts are \nloathe to intrude into areas that properly belong to other branches of \nGovernment. And the Constitution, in article I, solely delegates to \nCongress, not the courts, the power to raise taxes, borrow money, and \nincrease or reduce spending programs.\n  Courts simply do not have the authority to order Congress to raise \ntaxes. Furthermore, courts will not grant standing to litigants who \nclaim a generalized grievance similar to the complaints of all \ncitizens, such as the raising of taxes, so as not to impose broad-based \nrelief that interferes with congressional prerogatives.\n  Federal courts simply do not have the authority to usurp Congress' \nrole of the budgetary process. This is made clear by the time-honored \nprecept of standing and the political question in separation-of-powers \ndoctrines. These jurisprudential doctrines, together, stand as \nimpenetrable barriers to the courts' commandeering of the democratic \nprocess.\n\n  Additionally, I wish to respond to the impoundment argument. I want \nto emphasize that there is nothing in the balanced budget amendment \nthat allows for impoundment. It is not the intent of the amendment to \ngrant the President any impoundment authority. In fact, there is a \nripeness problem to any attempted impoundment. Indeed, up to the end of \nthe fiscal year, the President has nothing to impound because Congress, \nin the amendment, has the power to ameliorate any budget shortfalls or \nratify or specify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that \nfiscal year. Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress \nmust--and I emphasize must--mandate exactly what type of enforcement \nmechanism it wants, whether it be sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency fund. The President, as Chief Executive, \nis dutybound to enforce a congressionally crafted scheme to the \nexclusion of impoundment. The position that section 6 implementing \nlegislation would preclude Presidential impoundment was seconded by \nAttorney General Barr in 1995.\n  Finally, let me address the rock and a hard place argument that \nopponents of the balanced budget always dredge up. That is, they \ncontend, on the one hand, that there may be too much enforcement \nbecause of the courts, while, on the other hand, that the balanced \nbudget amendment is unenforceable because no one can force the \nPresident and Congress to abide by the amendment's terms. Well, you \ncan't have it both ways. The truth is that the President and Congress \nmust abide by their oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution. I seriously doubt that the basic terms of any \nconstitutional provision will be flouted. Also, each branch will keep a \nclose eye on the other, and the reality of political pressure and the \nelectoral wrath of the American people will assure compliance. \nRemember, the budget must be in balance at the end of the fiscal year, \nand I expect that a budget agreement will be worked out well before \nthat time. Instead, the contention against the balanced budget \namendment actually argues in favor of a balanced budget amendment. It \nis clear that, without a constitutional hammer, the political process \nlacks the discipline to agree to the terms.\n  Again, as we enter the final days of this debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, I think we need to step back on occasion from the \nvery technical arguments and some of the very arcane amendments that \nhave been proposed generally by those who oppose the underlying \nconstitutional amendment and look at the reason we have come to this \nimpasse, this situation. If, in fact, there are questions that cannot \nbe answered about all of the consequences of a balanced budget \namendment, and the one that is before this Senate, I believe, when you \nweigh those unanswered questions with the very clear evidence and the \nvery clear and present danger to the future, the economic future, of \nthe Republic that exists with massive debt and chronic deficits, that \nit is time we take whatever risk--and I think that risk would be \nminor--there might be in the passage of that constitutional amendment \nand submitting that to the States for ratification. We have a $5.3 \ntrillion national debt. We have heard the figures over and over--\n$20,000 per every man, woman, and child in America. The average child \nreared today, if he or she lives an average lifespan, makes an average \nincome, will spend over $200,000 of their income in Federal income \ntaxes to pay their portion of the interest on this ever-growing \nnational debt.\n  Let us view this massive debt in another way. In 1960, after the \nfirst 140 years of the Republic, John D. Rockefeller, who at that time \nwas the wealthiest man in America, could have singlehandedly paid off \nthe national debt. In 1997, if we combine the wealth of our richest \nfamilies--say, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, or from my home State, the \nWalton family--and we combine all of their net worth, all of their \nfamily wealth, they, together, could not even pay the interest on this \nmassive debt for a few short months. Such is the difference, and such \nis the massiveness of the debt that we have accumulated and that we are \nimparting to generations in the future.\n  Viewed from another perspective, if you laid out the debt in silver \ndollars, one right after another, it would be 120 million miles long. \nThe word ``trillion'' becomes meaningless, I think, to the average \nAmerican, as we hear millions, billions and trillions. But the national \ndebt--$5.3 trillion--in silver dollars would be 120 million miles long. \nThat is from the Earth to the Sun and well beyond--millions of miles \nbeyond.\n  If you could wrap it around the Earth you would wrap it around the \nEarth 5,000 times. Adam Smith in ``Wealth of Nations,'' published in \nthe very year we became a Republic, said, ``What is prudence in the \nconduct of a private family can scarcely be followed in that of a great \nkingdom.''\n  I have heard opponents of the balanced budget amendment say, ``Well, \nfamilies go into debt. Families routinely go into debt. Therefore, \ndeficit\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\nspending on the part of the National Government should not be anything \nthat we should greatly worry about or be greatly concerned about.'' \nYes. Families go into debt. They have a home mortgage. They have car \nloans. They have the college loan. But if they are to survive as a \nfamily economically the deficits must never be chronic. They should \nalways be short-termed. They should always be temporary. The debt must \nbe manageable. There must be a schedule to pay it off and pay it down, \nall of which contrasts vividly with the practice of this Congress over \nthe last 60 years. For in the last 60 years we have not paid down one \ndime on the growing national debt. No family could survive the habitual \nmismanagement that has characterized Congress for the past 28 years.\n  Opponents say, ``We don't need an amendment. We have the ability to \nbalance the budget.'' I say that we don't have the ability. We have the \nauthority but we obviously don't have the ability, as these 28 years of \nbudget books testify.\n  In 1963 the amount of the debt held by the public was $254 billion. \nIn 1996, it was $3.87 trillion, 15 times greater than in 1963. But \nsince 1963 the promises have not changed. Let me just give you a \nsample.\n  President Kennedy in the State of the Union Address in 1963 said, \n``My program is the surest and soundest way of achieving in time a \nbalanced budget.''\n  Or, the budget message of 1964 from President Johnson, ``My budget \ncuts the deficit in half and carries us a giant step toward the \nachievement of a balanced budget.''\n  Or, President Nixon in 1971 in his State of the Union Address, ``I \nshall recommend a balanced budget.''\n  Or, President Ford in 1976, ``The combination of tax and spending \nchanges I propose will set us on a course that not only will lead us to \na balanced budget in 3 years but also improves the prospects for the \neconomy to stay on a growth path that we can sustain.''\n  Or, President Carter in his message to Congress accompanying the \nEconomic Report of 1977, ``We have moved on the path necessary for \nachieving a balanced budget in the very near future.''\n  Or, President Bush in 1992 in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, \n``I will fight to reduce spending and spur growth so we can get this \nbudget in balance.''\n  And, President Clinton's address to the Nation in 1995, ``I present \nthe American people a plan for a balanced Federal budget.''\n  In fact, it is not balanced. Three-fourths of the cuts, savings, and \nspending occur after this President will leave office. And the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us that even with all of that it is \nstill very much out of balance.\n  But the opponents continue to mock the idea of amending the \nConstitution. The statutory solutions that Congress have proposed \nsimply have failed over and over and over again. They have failed from \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, and on and on. We found a way to \ncircumvent or undermine and some way to continue our spending habit. \nAnd our opponents say, ``Well, we are treating the Constitution as if \nit were a rough draft; that we have a raft full of amendments, a \npocketful of constitutional changes.'' Wrong. Our Founding Fathers I \nbelieve knew very, very well that changing circumstances in the life of \nour Nation would make it necessary to have a process for change and, \ntherefore, they included an amendment process that is both deliberate \nand very, very difficult, as we are learning once again this year. But \nour Founding Fathers never envisioned that there would be a Congress, \nor a series of Congresses that would go 28 years without balancing its \nbudget. Our Founding Fathers never envisioned that we would amass more \nthan $5 trillion in public debt. But they left us a procedure whereby \nwe can address even that kind of calamitous situation, a procedure of \namending the Constitution.\n\n  This isn't frivolous. This isn't like what we are about in attempting \nto amend the Constitution. It is as our Founding Fathers intended, a \ndeliberate process by which we can address those circumstances that \nwould threaten the very future of the Nation. And this massive debt \ndoes threaten.\n  How much does the debt and the growth of the debt and the chronic \ndeficits affect the average American? We have heard much talk about \ndeclining interest rates and how that will benefit the average American \nfamily. How things have changed. My mom and dad had only high school \neducations. They raised a family of six children. My father worked in a \nchicken plant, and my mother stayed at home. She didn't even go out and \nget a job. We lived in a nice home, a brick home. I thought we were \npoor. But we thought we were middle class. But all in all, we had a \ngreat quality of life. And I wonder how many times that could happen \ntoday? How many times today could you have parents without a college \neducation with one spouse working and one spouse at home, and providing \ntheir children a college education? I say that, even as we look at the \naverage middle-class family today, we see the erosion of our standard \nof living. And part of that is because the wealth of this Nation is \nconsumed more and more by the massive spending of the Federal \nGovernment and the absorption of that wealth by paying interest on an \nevergrowing national debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 26 minutes \nremaining, the Senator from Arkansas has 40 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin and Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the \nintroduction of legislation are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point I would like to address the \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I would like for those who are listening to this debate to consider a \npossible and likely scenario at some point in our Nation's future. Let \nus assume the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution passes and \nis ratified by the States and takes effect. In 1 year we find that the \nbudget for the coming year is out of balance. A group of 48 Senators \nproposes an across-the-board cut to balance the budget. Another group \nof 41 Senators favors deeper cuts in military spending to spare \neducation and safety net programs. And then a group of 11 Senators \ncomes forward and opposes those plans and says let us have significant \ncuts in the growth of Medicare. None of the groups will budge. The \nfiscal year begins with a budget that is clearly out of balance. The \ngroup of 11 Senators goes to court asking the courts to compel \ncompliance with the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nrequirements that outlays not exceed revenues for any fiscal year.\n  One day you turn on the television, and you find the Supreme Court \nhas listened to the briefs, has ordered Social Security, Medicare, \nhighway funding, and medical research funding to be cut, and the Court \nhas ordered an income tax increase of 1 percentage point for every \ngroup. The Court says the Constitution, as amended by the balanced \nbudget amendment, clearly requires a balanced budget, and since \nCongress cannot act, the Court is required to step in.\n  If this sounds farfetched, think of what has happened in our history \nin the last several decades where courts have said that Congress has \nfailed to meet its constitutional obligation and that the courts will \nstep in and order, for example, integration of school districts and the \nimposition of local property taxes to equalize educational opportunity \nwhich the courts have decided is not being offered and should be.\n  The President, in my hypothetical, responds to this court order and \nsays, I disagree with the Court requirement. I will assume the \nresponsibility to balance the budget. The President says, I will \nimpound funds. I will cut spending on certain programs so that the \nbudget is in balance.\n  If this sounds farfetched, I think those who have offered the \namendment\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\nhave not considered the very real likelihood that it could occur. Our \nConstitution now gives Congress the primary authority to raise and \nspend Federal funds. James Madison wrote in ``The Federalist Papers,'' \nNo. 48.\n\n       The legislative department alone has access to the pockets \n     of the people.\n\n  This proposed amendment would dramatically alter the balance of power \nin the Constitution, and this amendment is silent on the issue about \nwhether or not the courts can interpret and enforce the balanced budget \namendment. I daresay neither the courts nor the President will stand \nidly by if the budget is not in balance and this constitutional \namendment is in place. In fact, most of the supporters of the balanced \nbudget amendment readily concede this scenario.\n  A representative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified before my \nJudiciary Committee. He said:\n\n       There is a legitimate and necessary role for the courts in \n     ensuring compliance with the amendment.\n\n  Someone from the National Taxpayers Union said:\n\n       We oppose denying judicial review authority and believe it \n     would be more difficult to enforce the provisions of this \n     resolution if Congress were to add such language to the \n     balanced budget amendment.\n\n  The same basic testimony coming from the ultraconservative Family \nResearch Counsel.\n  It is not an unusual proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts that \nwe specify the limits of power in interpreting the constitutional \namendment and enforcing it. In fact, in 1994, Senator Danforth, a \nRepublican, of Missouri, successfully modified the same amendment in \nthe Chamber today including a proposal very similar to Senator \nKennedy's. In 1995, the following year, Senator Nunn, a Democrat of \nGeorgia, did the same. But the current version of this amendment \ncontains neither of those provisions. I stand in support of Senator \nKennedy's effort to once again include this sensible language.\n  The constitutional amendment eliminates the fundamental distinction \nwhich exists between the legislative branch, the executive branch and \njudicial branch. It invites unelected judges to exercise budgetary \npowers with no opportunity for the people through the ballot box to \naffect those decisions.\n  The President, of course, as I said, will not stand idly by either. \nHe has a constitutional responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution. Just as the courts are loathe to avoid their \nconstitutional mandate, mark well my words: No President will avoid it \neither. If this Congress is gridlocked, at an impasse with the budget \nnot in balance, a President will step in and the President will make \nhis decision as to where the cuts will be made. And that decision may \nnot be the will of the Congress.\n  Legal scholars agree that what I have just described is not \nfarfetched but likely to occur, and without Senator Kennedy's amendment \nit will occur. The President's powers of impoundment could include \nacross-the-board cuts, specific programs abolished, and targeted \nexpenditures intended for States or other agencies could be impounded. \nThis has been acknowledged by those who have worked on budgetary \nmatters in Washington for many years.\n  The Kennedy amendment acknowledges the fundamental ambiguities \ninherent in the balanced budget amendment's silence regarding \nenforcement powers of the courts and Presidents. It recognizes that \nbudgetary decisions should be made by the elected representatives of \nthe people, not by the unelected judges or single executive. It avoids \na fundamental shift in the allocation of power and authority among the \nFederal branches of Government and assures that Members of Congress \nwill remain responsible for spending and for balancing the budget. It \nachieves these important goals by specifying that Congress shall have \nexclusive authority to enforce the balanced budget amendment unless \nspecifically otherwise provided in implementing legislation.\n  I am new to the Senate. This is the first time I have been engaged in \nthis debate in the Senate. I find it incredible that the wisdom of this \namendment was recognized in 1994, when offered by a Republican Senator \nfrom Missouri, and in 1995, when offered by a Democratic Senator from \nGeorgia, and is not being included today as part of this amendment. The \nSenate today has an opportunity, through Senator Kennedy's initiative, \nto make a real difference and to correct this error, to make certain \nthat it is clear we are not ceding a grant of power to either the \nexecutive branch or the judicial branch; we are accepting our \nresponsibility to spell out with specificity the responsibility of \nCongress, the Senate and the House to balance the budget.\n  At this point, I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as pointed out by the Senators from \nIllinois and Wisconsin, those who are opposing the amendment on the \nfloor today and those who have opposed addressing this issue in the \nJudiciary Committee agree with what the principal sponsor, Senator \nHatch, has said--he wants silence on this issue--silence on the issue.\n  We have a great deal at risk by not accepting this amendment. So why \nnot accept it. The amendment is quite clear in its objective--if we are \ngoing to be required to enforce the amendment, it ought to be the \nCongress who enforces it, not the President of the United States or the \ncourts. They should not have the ability to raise or lower taxes or to \ncut various kinds of programs. That is what this issue is all about. \nThat is why, as the Senator from Illinois has pointed out, it was \naddressed by Republicans and Democrats previously.\n  All we are saying is we are not prepared to make that judgment here \nthis afternoon. But we are presenting an amendment which will permit \nthe Congress to make a judgment as to what those powers would be down \nthe road, in the future. It is amazing to me to hear resistance to that \nargument.\n  The idea that this is really a moot issue and moot question just \ndefies testimony by those who are both supportive of the balanced \nbudget amendment and those who are against the amendment. One of the \nmost compelling cases was made by one of our leading constitutional \nauthorities, Kathleen Sullivan, and supported by a broad range of \ndifferent constitutional scholars, both conservative and Democrat \nalike. I will refer to some parts of the letter. I will include the \nwhole letter in the Record.\n\n       First, taxpayers might claim that their rights to a \n     balanced budget are violated, for example, by projections \n     that outlays will exceed receipts. True, taxpayers are \n     generally barred from suing the government for the redress of \n     generalized grievances. But the Supreme Court a quarter of a \n     century ago held that there is an exception to the general \n     bar on taxpayer standing when the taxpayer claims that a \n     government action ``exceeds specific constitutional \n     limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional \n     taxing and spending power.''\n       Mr. Barr suggests that this exception may be limited to \n     Establishment Clause challenges, but there is nothing in the \n     principle stated in Flast that so confines it. If anything, \n     the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment more clearly limits \n     congressional taxing and spending power than does the \n     Establishment Clause.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Second, members of Congress might well have standing to \n     claim that congressional actions have diluted the vote they \n     were entitled to exercise under the Amendment.

This is arguably analagous to \n     other circumstances of vote dilution in which the lower \n     courts have held that Members of Congress have standing.\n       Third, persons aggrieved by actions taken by the government \n     in claimed violation of the Amendment might well have \n     standing to challenge the violation.\n\n  And it gives further examples of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Stanford Law School,\n\n                                  Stanford, CA, February 15, 1995.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re: Proposed Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I have reviewed the statement of \n     William P. Barr before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary \n     on January 5, 1995, in which former Attorney General Barr \n     argued that ``the courts' role in enforcing the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment will be quite limited.'' While I have great \n     respect for Mr. Barr, and while I found his testimony to be \n     considered and thoughtful, I must respectfully state that I \n     disagree with him. I continue to believe that, as I testified \n     before the Senate Appropriations Committee on February 16, \n     1994 the Balanced Budget Amendment in its current draft form \n     is likely to produce numerous lawsuits in the federal and \n     state courts, and that neither Article III justiciability \n     doctrines nor practices of judicial deference will operate as \n     automatic dams against that flood tide of litigation.\n       Let me begin with the doctrines of justiciability under \n     Article III of the Constitution. Mr. Barr argues that ``few \n     plaintiffs would be able to establish the requisite standing \n     to invoke federal court review.'' This is by no means clear. \n     There are at least three categories of litigants who might \n     well be able to establish standing to challenge violations of \n     the Amendment.\n       First, taxpayers might claim that their rights to a \n     balanced budget are violated, for example, by projections \n     that outlays will exceed receipts. True, taxpayers are \n     generally barred from suing the government for the redress of \n     generalized grievances. But the Supreme Court a quarter of a \n     century ago held that there is an exception to the general \n     bar on taxpayer standing when the taxpayer claims that a \n     government action ``exceeds specific constitutional \n     limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional \n     taxing and spending power.'' Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 \n     (1968). Mr. Barr suggests that this exception may be limited \n     to Establishment Clause challenges, but there is nothing in \n     the principle stated in Flast that so confines it. If \n     anything, the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment more clearly \n     limits congressional taxing and spending power than does the \n     Establishment Clause. The Amendment is not confined, as Mr. \n     Barr suggests, merely to the power of Congress to borrow. \n     Thus taxpayers would have an entirely plausible argument for \n     standing under existing law.\n       Second, members of Congress might well have standing to \n     claim that congressional actions have diluted the vote they \n     were entitled to exercise under the Amendment. For example, \n     suppose that the Congress declined to hold a three-fifths \n     vote required to approve deficit spending under section 1, or \n     a rollcall vote required to increase revenue under section 4. \n     This might occur, for example, because of a dispute over \n     whether outlays really exceeded receipts, or over whether \n     revenue was really being increased, because the meaning of \n     those terms might be controversial as a matter of fact. \n     Declining to implement the supermajority voting requirements \n     in such a context, however, might be plausibly claimed to \n     have diluted a Member's vote. This is arguably analogous to \n     other circumstances of vote dilution in which the lower \n     courts have held that Members of Congress have standing. See, \n     e.g., Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 F.2d 1166, 1168-71 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 823 (1983).\n       Third, persons aggrieved by actions taken by the government \n     in claimed violation of the Amendment might well have \n     standing to challenge the violation. For example, consider a \n     criminal defendant charged under a law claimed to cost more \n     to enforce than the government can finance through expected \n     receipts. Or suppose that the President, believing himself \n     bound by his Oath to support the Constitution, freezes \n     federal wages and salaries to stop the budget from going out \n     of balance. In that circumstance, a federal employee might \n     well challenge the President's action, which plainly causes \n     her pocketbook injury, as unauthorized by the Amendment, \n     which is silent on the question of executive enforcement.\n       Each of these circumstances poses plausible claims of \n     injury in fact, and none of them poses insurmountable \n     problems of redressability. In most of them, in fact, simple \n     injunctions can be imagined that would redress the \n     plaintiffs' claims. Thus, contrary to Mr. Barr's prediction, \n     the doctrine of standing is by no means certain to preclude \n     federal judicial efforts at enforcement of the Amendment. And \n     further, as Mr. Barr concedes, federal standing doctrine \n     will do nothing to constrain litigation of the proposed \n     Amendment in state courts, which are not bound by Article \n     III requirements at all.\n       Nor is the political question doctrine likely to eliminate \n     all such challenges from judicial review. True, the Supreme \n     Court has held that a question is nonjusticiable when there \n     is ``a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of \n     the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of \n     judicially discoverable and manageable standards for \n     resolving it.'' Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962). But the \n     proposed Amendment implicates neither of these kinds of \n     limitation. It does not reserve enforcement exclusively to \n     the discretion of the Congress, as, for example, the \n     Impeachment or Speech and Debate Clauses may be read to do. \n     And it presents no matters that lie beyond judicial \n     competence. Rather, here, as with apportionment, the question \n     whether deficit spending or revenue increases ``exceed \n     whatever authority has been committed, [would] itself [be] a \n     delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation,'' and \n     thus would fall well within the ordinary interpretive \n     responsibility of the courts. See Baker v. Carr, at 211.\n       Let me turn now from doctrines of justiciability to \n     practices of judicial deference. Mr. Barr argues that, as a \n     prudential matter, ``a reviewing court is likely to accord \n     the utmost deference to the choices made by Congress in \n     carrying out its responsibilities under the Amendment,'' \n     especially in light of the enforcement clause in section 6. \n     This is by no means clear. The Reconstruction Congress \n     expected that enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments would be undertaken primarily by the \n     Congress, and reflected that expectation in the Enforcement \n     Clauses specifically included in those Amendments. But we \n     have seen time and time again in our history that judicial \n     review has played a pivotal role in the enforcement of those \n     Amendments nonetheless. The proposed Amendment, as did those \n     Amendments, gives Congress authority to legislate, but it \n     does not oust the courts, who need not defer to Congress in \n     these matters. Courts rightly have not hesitated to intervene \n     in civil rights cases, even though those cases involved grave \n     structural questions as well as questions of individual \n     rights.\n       Finally, Mr. Barr argues that courts will, again as a \n     matter of prudence and practice rather than doctrine, \n     ``hesitate to impose remedies that could embroil [them] in \n     the supervision of the budget process.'' He is correct to \n     observe that a direct judicial order of a tax levy such as \n     that in Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), is highly \n     exceptional. But even if that is so, courts could issue a \n     host of other kinds of injunctions to enforce against \n     conceivable violations of the proposed Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. For example, a court could restrain expenditures \n     or order them stayed pending correction of procedural \n     defaults, or a court could enjoin Congress simply to put the \n     budget into balance while leaving to Congress the policy \n     choices over the means by which to reach that end. Thus there \n     is little reason to expect that prudential considerations \n     will keep enforcement lawsuits out of court, or keep judicial \n     remedies from intruding into political choices.\n       In sum, the draft Balanced Budget Amendment in its present \n     form has considerable potential to generate justiciable \n     lawsuits, which in turn would have considerable potential to \n     generate judicial remedies that would constrain political \n     choices. Thank you for considering these remarks in the \n     course of your current deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Kathleen M. Sullivan.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a very well-thought-out analysis \nabout the role of standing. It is very clear. And, I believe, to \ncavalierly dismiss the fact there would be standing for challenge by \noutside forces does not represent the vast majority of legal opinion, \nboth from those who support the amendment and those who are opposed to \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 4 more minutes.\n  Furthermore, the President is obligated to faithfully execute the \nlaws and defend the Constitution. That duty is not limited to the \nenforcement of acts of Congress. It includes obligations derived from \nthe Constitution. Thus, if the President believed the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment was about to be violated, he would be duty \nbound to prevent the violation. After all, what happens when it becomes \nclear that outlays will exceed receipts for the fiscal year and \nCongress has not specifically authorized the deficit? Many, including \nSecretary Rubin, former Reagan administration Solicitor General Charles \nFried, former Attorney General Nick Katzenbach, and Harvard Law School \nProf. Laurence Tribe, believe the President would be obligated to take \nthe dramatic step of impounding funds to comply with the Constitution. \nAs then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger suggested in 1995: \nIf it appears the requirement for a balanced budget was about to be \nviolated, he would advise the President not only that he had the right \nbut the obligation to step in and prevent the violation by impounding \nmoney before the budget became imbalanced.\n  Those are basically the facts. There is every indication there would \nbe standing, both by citizens and others who wanted to challenge this; \nthat the President would be required, after taking the oath of office, \nto uphold the Constitution, to impound funds. I do not want to see the \nseizing of Social Security checks by the Congress, duly elected, but at \nleast we are accountable to people. But to say we are going to leave \nthat to the courts or to the 50\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\ncourts--50 courts, as was talked about previously by the Senator from \nArizona--we are going to give that to the President of the United \nStates, or to the courts--I find enormously troublesome.\n  But, no, no, those who oppose this amendment say the amendment is \ngoing to be silent on this issue. I don't think it should be silent. I \nthink the ultimate decision, in terms of budget cutting, should \nultimately rest here, specifically in the Congress of the United States \nunless we are going to make a judgment that the courts should have some \nkind of a responsibility. That is all this amendment does.\n  It comes back to who is going to implement this. I do not believe we \nshould grant that authority to judges who are not accountable to the \nAmerican people, or to a President of the United States who may impound \nfunds, but it should rest here in the Congress of the United States. \nThat is all this amendment does. Those who support it say we ought to \nbe silent. We say, as other Congresses have said, that we ought to be \nable to make a conscious decision about the enforcement of this \namendment. I do not want unelected judges and the President making that \ndecision. I believe Congress should.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I certainly agree--and Congress will, \nshould we pass this amendment, and the States ratify this, and this \nbecome a part of the Constitution--Congress will, at long last, fulfill \nits constitutional oath of office and we will enforce a balanced \nbudget. Congress has not done that. We have not done that because we \nlack a constitutional hammer, a constitutional discipline requiring us \nto do so.\n  The courts will not be imposing taxes. The President will not be \nimpounding. But Congress will be doing what will be, then, our \nconstitutional obligation in balancing the books.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment is directed to the issue of judicial \nreview. I believe it is in fact unnecessary. The relevant limitations \non the powers of the courts, which are found in the doctrines such as \nripeness, standing, and political question, effectively prevent Federal \ncourts from raising Federal taxes or reallocating Federal budget \npriorities, which are the purview of Congress. Furthermore, as an \nadditional safeguard pursuant to both article 3 of the Constitution and \nsection 6 of the balanced budget amendment, Congress may limit the \njurisdiction of courts and the remedies that courts may provide.\n  No constitutional provision has ever contained a jurisdictional \nlimitation on courts, as this amendment by Senator Kennedy would. \nIncluding this amendment in the balanced budget amendment might \nestablish, I believe would establish, a troublesome precedent that \ncourts might use to get involved in other areas of the Constitution \nthat do not have such limitations.\n  I believe that these amendments, one after another, are being \nproposed by those who would, of course, like to see a balanced budget \namendment defeated. This is another scare tactic that is being thrown \nat the American people.\n  We see that in the issue of impoundment that Senator Kennedy referred \nto. President Clinton recently said, ``The way I read the amendment, it \nwould almost certainly require, after the budget is passed, if the \neconomic estimates turn out to be wrong, the executive branch, the \nPresident, the Treasury Department to impound Social Security checks or \nturn it over to courts to decide what is to be done.''\n  That, to my colleagues I say, is a blatant scare tactic to try to \ndefeat a much-needed amendment to the Constitution.\n  If Senator Kennedy's amendment on impoundment is addressed as he \nindicated, then it is, again, unnecessary. First, the President has, at \nmost, only limited authority to impound funds. The Supreme Court held \nthat in the case involving President Nixon.\n  Since the balanced budget amendment does not even mention the \nimpoundment authority of the President, there is very, very little \nsupport for the claim that the balanced budget amendment would give the \nPresident such abilities.\n  Second, Congress has plenary enforcement authority and, therefore, \ncan, through new legislation, prevent the President from impounding \nappropriated funds. The Constitution does not mention impoundment. The \npower of the President in this area is merely implied by the \nPresident's general Executive power. This is very important because the \nSupreme Court has held that Congress has the authority to limit the \nPresident's implied powers, so long as it does not prevent the \nPresident from discharging his specific duties.\n  Third, even in the absence of new legislation, the Line-Item Veto Act \nalready regulates this area, thereby indicating how the Congress has \nallocated power to the President. In that law, Congress established a \nspecific procedure for the President to follow. By so doing, Congress \nhas occupied the field, to borrow a term from the law of Federal \npreemption, thereby precluding the President from exercising a general \nExecutive power, like impoundment, in a different manner.\n  So, I say again, this amendment, though I have no doubt it is well \nintended and addresses what are perceived to be legitimate concerns, \nis, in fact, unnecessary, plays upon the fears of the American people, \nand should be rejected. While we carry on this somewhat detailed \ndebate, during this hour in which I have been on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, the national debt will increase another $29 million.\n  It is time, it is far past time, as these 28 years of budget books \nbear testimony, for this Senate to pass a balanced budget amendment, \nsend it to the States for quick ratification and to begin to put \nourselves under the same discipline that most of our States exist under \nand that every family in this country exists under: A requirement that \nwe live within our means.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment points to a problem \nthat doesn't exist and then solves it with a loophole.\n  Why are we debating the balanced budget amendment in the first place? \nBecause past Congresses have built up a national debt of more than $5.3 \ntrillion, in an abuse of their power of the purse.\n  So what does the Kennedy amendment prescribe? It says, let's put the \nfox in charge of the henhouse. It says Congress doesn't have to comply \nwith this amendment unless it wants to. It says, if Congress says it is \ncomplying with this amendment, then no one else can question that.\n  I do believe Members of Congress take their constitutional \nresponsibilities seriously. I do believe that most Members really would \nprefer balanced budgets to running up another $5 trillion in debt. But \nI don't believe that every particle of every possibility of independent \nreview should be removed from this amendment.\n  We will win the war against debt, the war for our economic future the \nsame way we won the cold war: Not by fighting, but by being strong \nenough to deter. We need to defeat the Kennedy amendment to keep the \nbalanced budget amendment strong enough to deter future fiscal abuse.\n  Senator Hatch has spoken eloquently about the legal precedents and \njudicial doctrines that demonstrate there will not be a problem with \njudicial activism under Senate Joint Resolution 1. I will only touch on \nthe broadest of those.\n  In our Constitution today, we have something called separation of \npowers among the three branches of government.\n  It already gives Congress exclusive power of the purse, saying, ``No \nMoney shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \nAppropriations made by Law. * * * '' Only the Congress can make law; \nonly the Congress can decide how to spend money.\n  It already gives Congress exclusive power to tax. It says, ``All \nbills to raise revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. \n* * *''\n  Only the Congress can tax, founded upon the Revolutionary War \nprinciple of ``No taxation without representation.''\n  It already gives Congress the power to limit the jurisdiction of the \nFederal courts, in article III of the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\n  It already gives Congress the power to limit, by law, what budgetary \nactions the President can take, as it did in the Impoundment Control \nand Budget Act of 1976, as it did in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and as it \ndid in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not in any way change the current \nbalance of power among the three branches of Government. It does not \ngrant the courts or the President any power they don't already have.\n  To clarify the matter, the amendment already says, in section 6, \n``The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation. * * *''\n  But, in some very limited cases, the possibility of outside review \nshould be left open. For example:\n  Under our Constitution, the courts have already addressed the issue \nof whether a bill that originated in the Senate, and had the incidental \neffect of increasing revenues, should have originated in the House.\n  Similarly, under Senate Joint Resolution 1, if the Congress passed a \nbill to increase taxes by voice vote, instead of a majority of the \nwhole number on a rollcall vote, and claimed the bill would not raise \ntaxes, it is fair and reasonable for the Supreme Court to say, no, that \nbill is unconstitutional, and it is struck down.\n  Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, let's say some future Congress set \nup a shell game to get around the 3/5 vote on the debt limit. Perhaps \nthey could set up a super Fannie Mae that borrows from the public, and \nthen lends to the Treasury. It is fair and reasonable for the Supreme \nCourt to say, no, that is an obvious attempt to subvert the \nConstitution, and it is struck down.\n  In no case, under this amendment, would--or could--the courts rewrite \nthe details of a budget or order a tax increase. They simply couldn't, \nperiod.\n  But the courts could do what they do today:\n  If a case is obvious, if a party has specific standing, if a \ncontroversy is justiciable, and if the political question doctrine does \nnot apply--\n\n       Then the Court could look at an act of Congress, or an \n     action of the Executive, and say, no, that violates the \n     Constitution. Stop. Do not pass ``Go''. Do not collect $200 \n     billion. Start over again.\n\n  In short, the rule has been, ought to be, that the Court can simply \nsay what the law is, not make new law.\n  Some may raise the specter of the Missouri versus Jenkins court case. \nBut that case, however dubious on its own merits, has nothing in common \nwith the arguments being raised here.\n  In that case, a Federal court ordered a local school district to \nraise revenues to pay for a federally mandated desegregation plan.\n  In other words, the Federal court was ordering someone else to comply \nwith Federal law.\n  That case had nothing to do with Congress, with Federal taxes or with \nconstitutional separation of powers.\n  Finally, the Kennedy amendment would only feed public cynicism.\n  When the Senate adopted a less sweeping limitation on judicial review \nin the last Congress, the Nunn amendment, I heard from Idahoans who \nfelt that that amendment had put the fox in charge of the henhouse.\n  People will realize that the Kennedy amendment says, the same branch \nof government that has run up $5.3 trillion in debt should be the sole \narbiter of what does, and what does not, comply with a rule against \nrunning up another $5 trillion.\n  The Kennedy amendment is being offered by opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment, not to improve it, but in an attempt to kill it. The \namendment should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 4 minutes remaining. \nI yield 2 of those minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I point out to my colleague on the other side of the aisle that if \nthis balanced budget amendment passes, is implemented, he would have \nexactly the same problem as represented by that stack of budget \ndocuments sitting on his desk today, because the debt would continue to \ngo up. We would not have a balanced budget at all, because this isn't a \nbalanced budget amendment, unfortunately. This is an amendment that \ndecides they are going to claim it's a balanced budget by looting every \npenny of Social Security surplus over the next 20 years and then claim \nbalance.\n  But on the question of the amendment before us, I think the amendment \nby the Senator from Massachusetts addresses one of the three principal \nconcerns of the so-called balanced budget amendment which is before \nthis Chamber. It goes to the question of the role of the courts.\n  Mr. President, what a difference a Congress makes--what a difference. \nThe last time we had this measure before the Senate, on a vote of 98 to \n2, we addressed the question of whether or not unelected judges would \nbe left writing the budget of the United States; 98 to 2 the Senators \ndecided we could not be silent, we could not be left with a \ncircumstance in which right through those doors in the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, we would have unelected judges sitting around a \ntable writing the budget for the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues, what do the Justices of the Supreme Court, as \nlearned as they are, know about the defense of the United States or the \nbudget for the defense of the United States? Nothing. They have had \nnone of the detailed briefings, none of the hearings on the question of \nwhat the defense systems are that are critical to maintaining the \nsecurity of the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from North \nDakota has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield another 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will just conclude by saying those Justices, as learned \nas they are, know nothing about what the defense systems are that are \nneeded to maintain the security of this Nation. They know nothing about \nagriculture programs which are critical to my State. They know nothing \nabout the budget disciplines that are fundamental to the writing of a \nbudget document that is critical to the future of this country.\n  This amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts ought to be adopted. \nThe same type of amendment was adopted overwhelmingly in the last \nCongress when people recognized it was central to the functioning of \nany balanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time? The Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in response to my friend, I will simply say that the \nlearned Justices may know little about budgeting, they may know little \nabout national defense, they may know little about budget priorities, \nthey may know little about exploding entitlements, but they have not \nbeen responsible, as we have been, for 28 successive years of deficits \nand the accumulation of $5.3 trillion in national debt. They have not \nbeen responsible for imposing upon my children and my grandchildren \n$20,000 of debt per person. They cannot be held accountable for our \nfailings, and I emphasize once again, it will not be the Justices of \nthe Supreme Court who will enforce this provision to the Constitution \nshould it be ratified, and it will not be the President, through the \nimpoundment process, that will enforce this; it will be Congress in \nobedience to and in fulfillment of their oath of office, an oath that \nrequires us to protect and preserve and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States, a Constitution that will, at that time, have enshrined \nwithin it a provision requiring us to balance our books. We will do the \njob. We will do it when we are required by the Constitution.\n  Is it a shame we have to have that? I think it is. Is it unfortunate \nwe have not had the courage, the political will to make the kind of \ntough decisions that would have allowed us to balance the budget and to \nhave avoided our current situation? It is a shame. But the evidence is \nclear that short of an amendment to the Constitution, Congress will \ncontinue to allow spending to grow out of control, we will continue to \nhave chronic deficits, and we will continue to amass enormous debts \nthat threaten the economic stability\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\nand the economic future of our country. That is why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment. And in order to have that amendment, we need to \nreject Senator Kennedy's I think unnecessary and ill-conceived \namendment to the underlying amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and \ncolleague, 92 Members of the U.S. Senate felt this was an issue that \nshould be addressed in the last Congress, and a Republican, Senator \nDanforth, thought it should have been addressed in the Congress before \nthat.\n  Now, if the Senator wants to say that under no circumstances are the \njudges going to be involved and under no circumstances will the \nPresident have impoundment, then accept the amendment. But you cannot \nhave it both ways.\n\n  Other Congresses--the previous Congress and the one before it, under \nRepublicans and Democrats--overwhelmingly understood this issue, as \nleading conservative constitutional authorities do, as the 128 \norganizations that represent working families, children's \norganizations, those that have Social Security and senior citizens do.\n  Mr. President, that is the issue. Who is going to make the ultimate \njudgment if this amendment is accepted? We believe it should be the \nCongress, not leave it to unelected judges to permit the President to \nimpound it. That is the simple and fundamental issue. I hope the \namendment is successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time except for 8 seconds to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has expired and there are 33 minutes 19 seconds \nremaining for the Senator from Utah.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time is left for the Senator from \nUtah?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-three minutes nineteen seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much is left for the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Eighty seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. That ought to be enough to make some fairly powerful \nstatements, but I will be happy to give him some more time after I make \na few remarks.\n  Let me make a point that my good friend and colleague, Senator Kyl, \nmade at the outset of this debate. Senator Kennedy's amendment would \nallow the Federal Government to imprison any taxpayer who declines to \npay an unconstitutional tax. His amendment is materially different from \nSenator Nunn's amendment 2 years ago. So I am very concerned about it. \nLet me just compare the two.\n  The Nunn amendment provided that absent specific legislation \nauthorizing judicial review, the courts would not have jurisdiction for \nclaims arising under the balanced budget amendment.\n  The Kennedy amendment provides that absent specific legislation \nauthorizing judicial review, Congress has exclusive enforcement \nauthority under the balanced budget amendment. Thus the courts would \nhave absolutely no enforcement role.\n  The difference is this. I know my colleague is trying to do what is \nright here, but the difference is this. The Kennedy amendment allows \nCongress unconstitutionally to raise taxes by a simple voice vote and \nno court in this land could hold that tax unconstitutional. The Nunn \namendment did not have that draconian affect.\n  Under the Nunn amendment, any taxpayer could raise as a defense the \nargument that the Congress passed an unconstitutional tax. The Kennedy \namendment forecloses that defense. I do not think we want to go that \nfar, even though I think I know what the distinguished Senator is \ntrying to do. The Kennedy amendment, Senator Kennedy's amendment, would \nallow the Government to imprison taxpayers for refusing to pay an \nunconstitutional tax.\n  I do not think we want to go that far. At least I do not. So I have \nto rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my good friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts.\n\n  Mr. President, in each year that the balanced budget amendment has \nbeen debated, I notice that various arguments are presented as scare \ntactics by the opponents of the amendment. The devil resurrected now in \nthe Kennedy amendment is the fear that under the balanced budget \namendment the courts will raise taxes or cut programs. Indeed, \nPresident Clinton even claimed that he could refuse to disburse Social \nSecurity checks to our retired senior citizens if the budget is not \nbalanced by the end of any particular fiscal year.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not produce any such evils. On the \ncontrary, the balanced budget amendment strikes a delicate balance \nbetween the reviewability by the courts and limitation on the courts' \nability to interfere with congressional budgetary authority. It has \nalways been my position that we should not foreclose all judicial \nreview. No. Some judicial review may be necessary and should be \npermitted.\n  What we should foreclose is any action by the courts that would \ninterfere with Congress' budgetary authority. Judicial review should be \navailable for the egregious, but unlikely, cases where Congress flouts \nthe express procedures dictated by Senate Joint Resolution 1, such as \nthe requirement that each House of Congress vote for a tax increase \nonly by rollcall vote, when in fact we provide for a constitutional \nmajority or a majority of the whole number of both Houses in order to \nhave a tax increase. Such review does not mean that the courts will be \nable to interfere with the budgetary process but does ensure that the \nConstitution is enforced and respected. Let me explain this balance in \ngreater detail.\n  There are several reasons why courts will not run the budget process \nif Senate Joint Resolution 1 becomes law. In part, that is because \nseveral well-settled constitutional principles ensure courts do not \nmake the budget decisions that we must make. In part, that is because \nsection 6 of Senate Joint Resolution 1 gives Congress the power to \ndecide how the balanced budget amendment should be enforced. Let us \nstart with the Constitution.\n  No. 1. Standing. The standing doctrine limits who may bring a lawsuit \nin Federal court. At bottom, to do so a party must show that it has \nsuffered an ``injury in fact.'' That term is a technical one in the \nlaw. It does not allow clients to simply claim he dislikes a law or \nmerely that the law is unconstitutional. No. A plaintiff must prove \nthree elements in order to establish standing or to show, as I have \nmentioned before, that that plaintiff has suffered ``injury in fact.''\n  First, a plaintiff must prove that he has suffered, or likely will \nsuffer, a concrete injury, not just a conjured up one or abstract one, \nbut a concrete injury.\n  Second, the plaintiff must show that the defendant has caused the \nspecific injury that he has shown. In this case it would be the \nGovernment.\n  And third, the plaintiff must show that the remedy he seeks will \nredress the specific injury that he has shown.\n  It would be very difficult for a plaintiff to establish or any \nplaintiff to establish all three elements in a lawsuit brought \nchallenging an action under Senate Joint Resolution 1 unless there was \nan actual violation of Senate Joint Resolution 1 such as I have \nmentioned--a refusal to follow the supermajority vote rule or a refusal \nto follow the actual vote rule. Dissatisfaction with Congress' policy \njudgment is not ``injury in fact.'' A plaintiff, therefore, cannot \nestablish the ability to sue if all that a plaintiff can show is that \nCongress has not adequately funded or has been unduly generous in \nfunding a particular program.\n  A plaintiff cannot establish standing based merely on the claim that \nan act of Congress is unconstitutional.\n  A plaintiff also cannot establish standing based simply on his or her \nstatus as a taxpayer.\n  The Supreme Court long ago held that a plaintiff cannot establish \nstanding based merely on his status as a taxpayer. The Court so ruled \nin the 1923 case of Frothingham versus Mellon. In 1982, the Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed its Frothingham decision in the case of Valley Forge \nChristian College versus Americans United for Separation of Church & \nState.\n  That is not all. Even if a party can prove he has suffered a \njudicially recognizable ``injury in fact,'' in all but\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\nthe most extraordinary cases that party still would not be able to \nestablish standing to sue. The reason why is that a plaintiff still \ncould not make out the remaining requirements to establish standing. In \nparticular, a party would not be able to establish either the \n``causation'' or ``redressability'' elements. In a case brought under \nthe balanced budget amendment, a plaintiff would not be able to show \nthat a specific law caused his injury or that a specific law should be \nheld invalid as the unconstitutionally necessary and appropriate \nremedy. After all, Congress appropriates money for numerous programs, \nso it would be impossible for a plaintiff to show, for example, that he \nis injured by any one specific program.\n  Now, that is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is justiciability and the political question doctrine.\n  There are two other doctrines that are relevant here: Justiciability \nand the political question doctrine.\n  Justiciability focuses not on the person who wishes to bring a \nlawsuit, but on the issue or claim that the plaintiff wishes to \nlitigate. Not every claim is one that Federal courts are going to \nadjudicate, and claims that cannot be adjudicated are deemed \n``nonjusticiable.''\n  In many ways, the political question doctrine is just the flipside of \nthe justiciability doctrine. The reason is that a political question is \nan issue that the Constitution has given to someone other than the \ncourts to decide.\n  The political question doctrine is relevant here because of the \norigination clause in article I, section 7, clause 1, of the \nConstitution that provides that ``All Bills for raising revenue shall \noriginate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose \nor concur with Amendments as on other Bills.'' Because that clause \ngives to the House of Representatives specifically the exclusive power \nto decide whether to raise taxes, the courts cannot do so, even in a \ncase that the courts otherwise may adjudicate.\n  Because this is an important issue, let me just address it in some \ndetail.\n  I will refer to the judicial taxation issue of Missouri versus \nJenkins. Can Federal courts order a tax increase? Some opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment have argued that the courts will use their \nremedial power to order that Congress raise taxes. In making that \nargument, some balanced budget amendment opponents rely on the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Missouri versus Jenkins, a decision decided in \n1990. There the Supreme Court held that a Federal district court has \nthe remedial authority to order a local school district to raise taxes \nin order to ensure that a court-ordered school desegregation plan is \ncarried into effect. The Jenkins case, however, supplies no authority \nfor a Federal court to order Congress to raise taxes.\n  The short and simple answer is that the text of the Constitution \ntreats the Federal Government and the States differently in that \nregard. The Supreme Court did not discuss the effect of the origination \nclause of the Constitution in the Jenkins case, and that clause is \ncritical to any discussion of this issue. The origination clause of the \nConstitution provides that ``All bills for raising revenue shall \noriginate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose \nor concur with amendments, as on other bills.'' That provision is not a \nmere matter of etiquette. No, the Supreme Court has said that it is a \nsubstantive, judicially enforceable constitutional requirement. And we, \nin the Senate, are very diligent in making sure that we do not tread on \nthe House's authority to do that. All of us understand that, and we are \nvery, very concerned about observing it.\n  In United States versus Munoz-Flores, in 1990, the Supreme Court \nruled that the courts can enforce the requirements of the origination \nclause. In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that \nissues arising under the origination clause pose what are known as \n``political questions,'' questions that are for the political branches, \nnot the courts, to resolve.\n  The upshot of the Munoz-Flores decision is twofold. First, all bills \nfor raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives, or \nelse they are unconstitutional. Second, and more importantly, the House \nof Representatives has plenary authority for the ``origination of \nrevenue bills.'' No entity created by the Constitution other than the \nHouse of Representatives can originate a revenue bill or order that a \nrevenue bill originate in the House. That includes the Federal courts. \nSince the Supreme Court is created by the Constitution and since the \nlower Federal courts are authorized by the Constitution, neither the \nSupreme Court nor any lower Federal court has the power to order the \nHouse to raise taxes or, in any other way, to order Federal taxes \nraised.\n  The same point can be made in another way. Under the political \nquestion doctrine, the Federal courts lack authority to adjudicate \ncertain types of issues. The classic formulation of a ``political \nquestion'' case is set forth in Baker versus Carr in 1962. That \nformulation makes clear that a political question is an issue in part \nwhose resolution is textually committed to a branch other than the \ncourts. The issue whether taxes should be raised easily satisfies that \nstandard, because the origination clause expressly vests that authority \nin the House of Representatives.\n  At the end of the day, the question whether taxes should be raised is \nquintessentially a political question, because the Constitution \nexpressly vests in the House of Representatives the authority over that \nissue. Since the resolution and political question is beyond the demand \nof the courts, no Federal court could order Federal taxes to be raised \nas a remedy in any case. Accordingly, the Supreme Court's decision in \nthe Jenkins case is irrelevant in this contest.\n  The principle that Federal courts cannot order taxes to be raised is \nconsistent with the Framers of our Constitution. Let me quote from \n``The Federalist Papers'' to make my point. James Madison wrote in \nFederalist No. 48: ``The legislative department alone has access to the \npockets of the people.'' Similarly, Alexander Hamilton wrote the \nfollowing about the courts in Federalist No. 78: ``The Judiciary has no \ninfluence over the sword or the purse, no direction either of the \nstrength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active \nresolution whatever.''\n  Those are important Founding Fathers' definable terms with regard to \nthis particular issue. It is very important that we make this case, \nbecause there is a lot of misunderstanding on this constitutional \nissue.\n  Now, No. 3, an additional safeguard against judicial activism lies in \narticle III of the Constitution and section 6 of Senate Joint \nResolution 1. Both provisions give Congress power to limit the \njurisdiction of the courts and the remedies courts may provide. The \nSupreme Court has made clear on numerous occasions under article III \nthat Congress can limit the jurisdiction and remedial powers of the \nFederal court. Under section 6 of the balanced budget amendment, \nCongress may adopt statutory remedies and mechanisms for any purported \nbudgetary shortfall such as sequestration, rescission, or the \nestablishment of a contingency fund.\n  Pursuant to section 6, it is clear that Congress, if it finds it \nnecessary, could limit the type of remedies a court may grant or limit \na court's jurisdiction to prevent judicial overreaching. If the \nbalanced budget amendment becomes law, and I hope it does, Congress \nwill have the authority of both article III and section 6 of the \nbalanced budget amendment in order to protect against unwarranted \njudicial action. Those two provisions help to ensure that Congress will \nretain the ultimate power to decide how Senate Joint Resolution 1 will \nbe enforced and thereby prevents courts, whether Federal or State, from \nexpanding their power beyond the limited role Congress assigns. These \nare issues that are important and have to be covered in the context of \nthis debate.\n  Some opponents have argued it would force the President to impound \nfunds; that is, to withhold from spending already appropriated funds \nsuch as Social Security payments in order to balance the books. \nPresident Clinton has made that argument on several occasions recently. \nHe made it in his State of the Union Address and he made in his \nSaturday radio broadcast. Shame on him, having taught constitutional \nlaw. I shall now explain that argument is a canard.\n  Constitutional analysis, like all legal analysis, begins with the \ntext of the\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\nrelevant law. Here we need to look to the text of Senate Joint \nResolution 1. That part of the analysis is conclusive. Nothing in the \ntext of Senate Joint Resolution 1 authorizes, or otherwise allows, for \nthe impoundment of any appropriated funds. On the contrary, it imposes \na duty on the President, the duty to transmit to Congress a proposed \nbudget for each fiscal year in which total outlays do not exceed total \nreceipts. The text of Senate Joint Resolution 1 is clear: It does not \nauthorize the President to impound appropriated funds of any type.\n  We should now move on to the intent of the drafters of Senate Joint \nResolution 1. Here, too, the answer is compelling. Neither I nor anyone \nelse who supports Senate Joint Resolution 1 in this Chamber construes \nthe balanced budget amendment as granting the President any authority \nto impound funds. That should end the debate.\n  Now, under section 6 of Senate Joint Resolution 1, Congress must \nmandate exactly what enforcement mechanism it wants, whether it be \nsequestration, rescission, the establishment of a contingency, or rainy \nday fund, or some other mechanism. The President must enforce whatever \nmechanism the Congress enacts so Congress has the power to prevent the \nPresident from impounding funds.\n  Indeed, even if Congress took no preventive action in that regard, \nthe President could not impound funds if Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nbecame law. The reason why is that the Line Item Veto Act prevents the \nPresident from doing so. Let me explain why in three steps.\n  First, unlike Gaul, all Presidential powers can be divided into two \nparts. Expressed powers such as the pardon power, or implied powers, \nwhich consist of every constitutional power that the President can \ninvoke, that is not expressly granted to him. That is the complete \nuniverse of Presidential powers according to the Constitution. So any \npower to impound funds must fit into one of these two categories.\n  Second, the Constitution grants the President the power to issue a \npardon, but it does not grant him the power to impound funds. As a \nresult, if the President has any impoundment power, that power can only \ncome from the President's general executive power in article II, \nsection 1, or in his duty in article II, section 3, to ``take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed.''\n  Third, how the President's impoundment power is classified is \nimportant, because Congress has greater authority to regulate the \nPresident's implied powers than his expressed powers. Congress has only \nvery limited authority to regulate the President's exercise of an \nexpress power such as the pardon power of article I, section 2, clause \n1. But Congress has greater room to regulate the President's general \nexecutive power. In fact, Congress may do so as long as Congress does \nnot prevent the President from discharging his assigned \nresponsibilities.\n\n  Indeed, Congress already has regulated in the area of the President's \nimplied powers by giving the President a line-item veto power. We gave \nthe President such authority last Congress. As a result, even if \nCongress does nothing more to enforce the balanced budget amendment, \nCongress already has limited the President's ability to impound funds. \nWhy is that so? Well, it is because Congress told the President that \nthe only budget authority that he can exercise is the line-item veto \npower. The Congress gave the President that power, rather than the \nimpoundment power, only last year, and that judgment by the Congress is \nnaturally entitled to respect. By so granting the line-item veto power, \nCongress impliedly denied to the President the power claimed by \nPresident Clinton to impound funds. The one power implies that the \nother does not exist.\n  Now, these are important issues, and I have to say they are issues \nthat literally, I think, must be stated against the amendment of my \nfriend from Massachusetts in this particular case.\n  Mr. President, let me just end where I began. There are only two ways \nto assert constitutional claims. One, you can sue the Government; two, \nyou can raise constitutional claims as a defense. Simply put, the \nKennedy amendment would not allow the latter. You could not raise a \nconstitutional defense. Imagine, the Leviathan IRS can prosecute an \ninnocent taxpayer and the taxpayer can't tell the court that the IRS is \nacting unconstitutionally. Can you imagine that? We just could not put \nthat in the Constitution. It would be awful. The Kennedy amendment does \nexactly that. This, alone, is a good reason to table Senator Kennedy's \namendment.\n  Taxpayers have rights, too and, frankly, the current amendment, \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment, protects \nthose rights, whereby, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts does not.\n  Now, my friend from Massachusetts may not worry so much about some of \nthe excessive powers of the IRS. I suspect he doesn't have too many \nworries there, compared to people who are scraping for a living every \nday of their lives. Be that as it may, that doesn't mean we should \njustifiably put this into the Constitution by amending the balanced \nbudget amendment with this amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time do the proponents of the amendment have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 8 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator like me to yield him some time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. Would the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield the distinguished Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his customary courtesy. Mr. \nPresident, someday somebody will sit down and write scholarly articles \nabout this debate. I commend my friend from Utah, who has spent more \ntime on the floor, I believe, than any other Senator. As the amendments \nhave come from this side, it has been easier for me, as the Democratic \nfloor manager, to leave and allow those proposing them to speak. He has \nstayed here throughout.\n  Mr. President, even though my friend from Utah and I have been on \nopposite sides on this issue, there have been extremely important \narguments. Senators can disagree over the question of the three-fifths \nvote requirement, whether that changes our normal idea of how a \nlegislative body should work, and on the issues of Social Security. \nThose arguments have been important. Capital budgets have been \nimportant. No matter how the final vote comes out--and I suspect it \nwill be voted down--I think that the American public has had the \nopportunity to hear some aspects of a constitutional amendment debated \nthat, as I have gone back and read various debates, have not come out \npreviously with the same strength and clarity.\n  We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of constitutional \namendments proposed every decade. We have, however, amended the \nConstitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We are the most \npowerful democracy history has ever known--in fact, the most powerful \ncountry. To be able to be powerful and to be a democracy is an \ninteresting juggling act, especially in a country as diverse and as \nlarge as the United States. I think one of the reasons is our \nConstitution. We have kept it simple, short, and very clear.\n  The genius of the Founders of this country is in our Constitution, in \nour Bill of Rights. But also the genius of it is that Congress, for \nover 200 years, has, for the most part, resisted the temptation to \namend the Constitution. Now, we can, with courage, the men and women in \nthis body and the other body, bring down deficits and balance the \nbudget--with courage. We do not need a constitutional amendment to do \nit. I urge that we reject this constitutional amendment, having \nlistened and considered the arguments made by both sides. Then we must \nsettle down and dedicate ourselves as Members of the Senate, not as \nRepublicans or Democrats, but as Members of the Senate, to get rid of \nunnecessary expenditures, to make sure that we have a tax code that is \nfair to all, to bring down the deficits and allow the world's largest \nand strongest economy to operate as it should.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back whatever time I have, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, is this vote set for a time certain?\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it is not.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the balance of my time.\n  I move to table the amendment, reluctantly, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 1 minute of debate on this motion. \nThat minute cannot start until the Senate is in order.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment simply reduces from 7 to 3 \nthe number of years the States have to ratify the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. Will the Senators \nto my left remove their conversations from the floor. Will the Senators \nin the aisle take their conversations elsewhere.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin will start his 30 seconds over.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment simply reduces from 7 to 3 \nthe number of years that States have to ratify the balanced budget \namendment, thereby ensuring that it will take effect no later than the \nyear 2002. Under the current version of the balanced budget amendment, \nthe balancing requirement could be delayed in its effectiveness until \nthe year 2006.\n  I like to call this the fish-or-cut-bait amendment. This will ensure, \nwhether we go with a balanced budget amendment or whether we simply do \nour job now as we should, that we get the job done by the year 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my friend has said, I move to table this \namendment. It unnecessarily reduces the time for ratification from 7 \nyears to 3 years, even though that 7 years has been the proper form of \nratification for many amendments since 1921.\n  However long it takes, we need the balanced budget amendment and \nthere is no reason to reduce the time for the consideration by the \nStates.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment allows Congress to \nestablish a surplus fund, a tool used in many States, in a far more \nresponsible way to address emergencies than simply deficit spending or \nscrambling for offsets.\n  My amendment allows Congress to build up and use the savings needed \nto fund the bulge in Social Security benefits that will occur when the \nbaby boomers retire. Without this amendment, there would be a three-\nfifths vote required in each House in order to access the Social \nSecurity fund. This is terribly important to current and future \nretirees, and my amendment does not require Congress to do the right \nthing, but at least allows Congress to live up to its commitment to the \nSocial Security beneficiary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor. The \nSenate will please come to order so he may be heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank both my colleagues. Mr. President, I believe we\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\nshould reject this amendment. Senate Joint Resolution 1 will not only \nhelp us to stop borrowing, but will help us to protect any savings we \nmay build up. So, I do not believe it is necessary to make it easier to \nspend our hard-earned savings.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 gives us appropriate flexibility with the \nappropriate protections.\n  Mr. President, have we moved to table this amendment yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion made by the Senator from Arkansas, [Mr. Bumpers] \nto refer the resolution to the Senate Budget Committee with \ninstructions. Debate on the motion is limited to 2 hours equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States was \nadopted in 1789. It will be 208 years old this coming summer. In that \nperiod of time, there have been more than 11,000 efforts to amend the \nConstitution. And to the eternal credit of this body and the American \npeople, only 18 times out of the 11,000 efforts have we amended the \nConstitution. Of those 11,000 efforts, I consider the amendment pending \nbefore this body to be the most unworkable, unenforceable, totally \npolitical amendment ever to be foisted off on an unsuspecting public.\n  I have never heard as many questions answered with ``I don't know.'' \nWho will enforce this amendment? ``I don't know.'' What will be the \ncourts' role, if any, in enforcing this amendment? ``I don't know.'' \nAnd I am speaking for the authors of this amendment when I say, ``I \ndon't know,'' because they don't know. Who has standing to sue? ``I \ndon't know.''\n  Who has standing to challenge the assumptions that we make that we \nhave a balanced budget? ``I don't know.'' It reminds me of Abbott and \nCostello and ``Who's on First?'' And if we have a crisis--a crisis that \nis not yet a military conflict, but may become one, such as previous to \nWorld War II, such as previous to Desert Storm, the constitutional \namendment says you have to have 60 votes to unbalance the budget, even \nthough you are headed, almost certainly, toward war with another \nnation.\n  There are no provisions in here to take care of a national emergency \nthat is not yet a military conflict or a declared war. It has been said \ntime and time again, but it bears repeating, that we have had 5 \ndeclared wars in the history of this country and about 200 military \nconflicts.\n  Can the courts raise taxes? ``I don't know.'' Can the courts demand a \ncut in spending? ``I don't know.'' If a court orders Congress to raise \ntaxes or cut spending and we don't do it and can't get the 60 votes to \ndo it, what happens then? ``I don't know.'' Can the Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court go to the White House and say to the President, ``Mr. \nPresident, you are charged with executing and enforcing the laws of \nthis Nation. We have ordered Congress to do a number of things in order \nto come into compliance with this constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, and they have refused to do it. Now, do your duty, Mr. \nPresident, send the troops over that Hill and hold bayonets to the \nbacks of the Members until they do it.'' Now, that is farfetched, of \ncourse. But how many times have I heard the lamentation on this floor \nabout the courts being intrusive and intervening where they have no \nright to intervene?\n  Yet, Mr. President, this is a popular amendment. It is popular in my \nState and across the country. But it is not as popular as it was 2 \nyears ago. It has gone from about 74 percent to 57 percent approval. If \nyou ask about Social Security it only has a 27 percent approval rating. \nI don't like casting unpopular votes. I have cast my share of them.\n  I think one of the reasons the polls have consistently showed this to \nbe popular is twofold. First, when you ask people whether you favor a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, all they hear is \n``balance the budget,'' and everybody is for that. Perhaps, there is \nanother group who, like most of us, revere the majesty of the words in \nthe Constitution and they think because of our reverence for the \nConstitution throughout history, if you just put it in the \nConstitution, it will be self-fulfilling. It would never occur to them \nhow sloppily crafted this constitutional amendment is. It would never \noccur to them that it isn't even constitutional language. It would \nnever occur to them that nobody can tell you how it's going to work.\n  This amendment makes a mockery of that great, revered document. Now, \nsome people who find this to be very popular and highly desirable may \ntake umbrage at some of the things I say. But I have voted against it \nevery time I ever had a chance. But do you know something else? I think \none of the things that has stood me in pretty good stead with the \npeople of Arkansas is that I have always trusted them. When I voted for \nthe Panama Canal treaties--and I can tell you, nothing even comes close \nto that as far as unpopular votes are concerned--I survived it, and it \nwas a correct vote. Very few people in this body would reverse that \nvote.\n  Put your trust in the people, vote against this constitutional \namendment, and don't have any fear of going home and talking sense to \nyour people. They understand it. Not one person on that side of the \naisle is going to vote against this nonsense--not one. How I miss the \ntowering courage of Mark Hatfield in this body.\n  Let me tell you what the Bumpers-Feingold amendment does, Mr. \nPresident. It is simple, ingenious in its simplicity, and it does the \nsame thing the constitutional amendment would do but it takes Social \nSecurity off budget. We commit the constitutional amendment, Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, to the Budget Committee, with instructions to come \nback here with amendments to the Budget Act almost identical to this \namendment.\n  Did you know, Mr. President, that you can't raise taxes and you can't \nraise spending, and you can't appropriate money until the budget \nresolution has passed this body? If you want to change the Budget Act, \nif you amend the Budget Act, do you know what you have to do? You have \nto get 60 votes. We passed that with 51 votes. Strangely enough, you \ncan pass something with 51 votes that later requires 61 votes to undo. \nWhat does our amendment do? As I say, it refers Senate Joint Resolution \n1 to the Budget Committee and instructs them to amend the Budget Act \nwith language almost identical to the constitutional amendment \nrequiring that outlays shall not exceed receipts by 2002.\n  The constitutional amendment says you may or may not enforce the \namendment. I just got through covering that. The Bumpers/Feingold\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\namendment would prohibit Congress from passing a budget resolution if \nit isn't balanced. As I just said, there is a prohibition on the \npassage of appropriations bills and tax bills without 60 votes.\n  The constitutional amendment says there is no requirement for action \nuntil 2002 at the earliest. Do you know what that means? The drafters \nof this amendment put a provision in there saying 2002. So we have 5 \nfree years. We don't have to do anything for 5 years. Those are \nfreebies. Most people here will have left or will have been reelected \nin 5 years.\n  Our amendment says you have to do it now. Face the music now, not 5 \nyears from now. Come up with a budget that puts us on a glidepath to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. If the States have not ratified this \nconstitutional amendment by the year 2002, you have maybe 2 more free \nyears where you don't have to do anything.\n  Our amendment says start now and balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Do you know what else it does? It leaves our precious Constitution \nintact. The best part of this is that it does not trivialize the \nConstitution. The mandate for a balanced budget is just as tough under \nthis amendment as it is in the constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, in 1993 every single Republican voted against a \nproposal to reduce the deficit dramatically. The Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation bill of 1993 required the Vice President's vote because \nthe vote was tied 50-50. And among the 50 who opposed it, every \nRepublican and about 6 Democrats. At the time we voted the deficit for \n1996 was projected to be $290 billion. As a result of that bill, and \nthe economic growth that came from the confidence that gave, the people \nof this country knew that we were serious about deficit reduction, \ninstead of a $290 billion deficit it was $107 billion.\n  Mr. President, what is going on now? The President submitted a budget \nto us which I am not very fond of. I do not like to say that. He is a \ngood friend and has been for 20 years. But I would not have come with a \nsingle tax cut, not one. And I would have submitted a budget that took \nthe deficit from $107 billion in 1996 to well under $100 billion in \n1997 to show the American people that we were on a glidepath to a \nbalanced budget and we were not going to back off.\n  The President's tax cuts are not nearly, though, as big as the \nRepublicans. The Republican tax proposal will cost $193 billion. Think \nof that, $193 billion over the next 5 years. And $508 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Do you know where they get $100 billion to offset that? Medicare. Do \nyou think that I am going to go home and tell the people in my State \nthat I voted to cut Medicare $100 billion so we could have a $193 \nbillion tax cut the next 5 years? I would need a saliva test to do \nthat. I am not going to do it, and I am not going to vote for these tax \ncuts. It is the height of irresponsibility to come in here and talk \nabout cutting taxes $193 billion taking $100 billion out of the hides \nof people on Medicare. They say, ``Oh. We are not going to raise the \nMedicare premiums.'' No. But if you think you can cut Medicare $100 \nbillion and not cut services to the elderly, go talk to the HMO's and \ntell them how they are going to make up for the $100 billion we are \ngoing to cut. They are going to cut services. That is how they are \ngoing to do it, while we have a capital gains tax that cost $33 billion \nover the next 5 years and $130 billion over the next 10 years. Where \ndoes it go?--67 percent of it to the richest 1 percent of the people in \nthis country. ``Oh, yes. We are going to cut taxes and balance the \nbudget.''\n  Mr. President, it is so cynical to get a serious, somber look on \none's face and talk about deficits and propose cutting taxes by such \nmassive amounts. We tried that in 1981.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know how many books there are on that stack \ndown there. I have been looking at that for the last week ever since we \nstarted debating this constitutional amendment. Do you know what I \nwould recommend? I wish the distinguished floor manager would take that \nstack of books and weigh them, put them on a scale and weigh them. And \nthen take the national debt of $5.2 trillion, and divide those books up \naccording to how much deficit by poundage came under Ronald Reagan and \nGeorge Bush administrations. That would make an interesting thing for \nthe film companies to film. I promise you that when you take Ronald \nReagan's and George Bush's deficit over the 12-year period that they \nserved this country and you are going to get about 1 foot for all the \nDemocrats and about 6 feet just for that 12-year period. Do you know \nwhy? Because we had the massive tax cut in 1981. And I say once again. \nI was one of the 11 Senators that said, ``You pass that and you are \ngoing to create deficits big enough to choke a mule.'' Eleven out of \n100 stood up and called that 1981 bill what it was, the most \nirresponsible thing we have ever done in the history of the U.S. \nSenate. You talk about mortgaging the future of our children. That is \nwhen we went from $1 trillion in debt that we had accumulated over 200 \nyears to $4 trillion in 12 years; a little over $4 trillion. Think of \nit. Talk about irresponsibility.\n  So I have spent an inordinate amount of my time since I have been in \nthe Senate trying to do sensible things to balance the budget. I keep \ngetting run over by a Mack truck called ``tax cuts'' and ``spending \nincreases,'' particularly in defense. You just do not get a somber look \non your face while you are voting for the biggest spending increases of \nthe year called tax cuts.\n  Just yesterday the Center for Budget Priorities came out and strongly \nrecommended that the U.S. Congress forget tax cuts until we balance the \nbudget. There is all the time in the world to cut taxes. Republicans \nsay, ``Well, that is a liberal organization.'' Warren Rudman, with whom \nwe all served 12 years in the U.S. Senate, is no liberal. He heads up \nthe Concord Coalition, and the Concord Coalition jumped on that study \nyesterday like a chicken after a June bug, and said, ``We agree with \nevery word of it.'' All you have to have is a little common sense to \nagree with it. You have to understand. You can't cut taxes and balance \nthe budget.\n  I have only voted for one constitutional amendment during my tenure \nin the Senate. And sometimes that is unpopular back home. But do you \nknow something else? I talk about trusting the people. Do you know what \nthe people want more than anything else today? Like Coca-Cola says, \nthey want ``The real thing.'' They want to know how you really feel. \nStand up for what you believe. Harry Truman told me one time, ``Just \ntell them the truth.'' So that is what I did.\n  There is not even anything in the constitutional amendment that would \nallow Congress to raise spending with less than 60 votes for a \ndepression. I am a Depression child, one of the few left in the Senate. \nI am telling you we did not have anything. We did not have paved \nstreets; we did not have gas; we did not have electricity; we did not \nhave health care. As I said, we had a two-holer out back when most \npeople just had a one-holer. We did not have anything.\n  As I have said before in this Chamber, I had pneumonia twice before I \nwas 6 years old and all my parents could do was pray. Today that hardly \nrequires much more than a visit to the doctor's office. And people tell \nme how they hate Government. They do not hate antibiotics. They do not \nhate measles and mumps serums and vaccines.\n  They do not hate the fact that we live a lot longer than we used to \nbecause we pour a lot of money into NIH to do medical research for us. \nThey do not hate being able to go on an airplane anyplace in the United \nStates in 4 hours. They do not mind driving down a highway with six \nlanes on it going 60 to 80 miles an hour. They do not hate REA that \ngave electricity to rural America. They do not hate the Department of \nAgriculture for water and sewer systems for rural people. And I could \nstand here for another hour listing things Government has done, and not \na person in this body would vote to undo a single one, although they \nwere highly controversial at the time. Don't you remember how doctors \nhated Medicare? I can remember how Social Security was a socialist \nprogram and TVA was a Communist-inspired program.\n  Under the constitutional amendment if we face another depression--it \nis certainly not out of the realm of reason--you have to get 60 votes \nhere to start putting people back to work like Franklin Roosevelt did. \nAll of the rich people in the country said Franklin Roosevelt was the \nworst thing that\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\never happened in this country because he was borrowing money to help \npeople. Do you know what he said? ``It is an unfortunate human failing \nthat a full pocketbook often groans more loudly than an empty \nstomach.''\n  Hurricane Hugo, where we spent $5 billion in South Carolina alone; \nthe earthquake in California, for which the cost is incalculable and \nwill continue to be, it would take 60 votes--41 obstreperous, really \nfundamentally conservative people could say, no, we are not going to \nunbalance the budget because there are a bunch of people living and \ndying who should not have been living over a fault anyway.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has the potential for creating more \nmischief, more chaos in this country than anything we have ever \nconsidered. And even though it looks as though my side has the \nnecessary 34 votes to keep this thing from going into our precious \nConstitution, I want to keep talking about it until the American people \nunderstand what is at stake.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers].\n  Over the years, Senator Bumpers has been the Senate's most consistent \nvoice for deficit reduction, and I am pleased to join him in this \neffort.\n  As has been described, this amendment provides a statutory \nalternative to the constitutional approach, and as such, it has \nsignificant advantages.\n  First and foremost, the Bumpers alternative would require immediate \naction.\n  As I have noted on several occasions, the lengthy and uncertain \nratification process allows Congress to hide behind years and years of \ndelay.\n  The only enforcement mechanism explicitly provided in the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, the supermajority voting requirements, would \nnot kick in for years.\n  If Congress acted today to pass the proposed constitutional \namendment, slow ratification could delay enforcement for another 9 \nyears--until 2006.\n  Even without delays in ratification--even if the States ratified the \namendment tomorrow--the constitutional amendment would have no effect \nuntil 2002 at the very earliest.\n  By contrast, this alternative would require action this year.\n  We would face the supermajority thresholds as part of this year's \nbudget resolution, every year before 2002 and thereafter.\n  This approach makes good sense.\n  It removes the excuse for inaction by implementing budget discipline \nright away.\n  It also does so without the troubling potential for unintended \nconsequences inherent in the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  There have been lengthy debates over the precise powers the proposed \nconstitutional language confers on the President and the courts.\n  To any disinterested observer, these issues are clearly open to \ndifferent interpretation, and at the very least there is doubt as to \nthe precise role the courts and the President will have in the brave \nnew world of the balanced budget amendment.\n  The statutory approach contains none of these risks.\n  There is no unintended domino effect on the constitutional powers of \nthe executive and judicial branches.\n  In this regard, I strongly urge my colleagues who support a \nconstitutional approach to consider the statutory alternative as a \nprudent first step, and I invite them to consider the Line-Item Veto \nAct that we passed last session as a model.\n  Wisely, Congress opted to pursue a statutory approach instead of a \nconstitutional path in that case.\n  Although I would have opposed changing our Constitution to provide \nline-item veto authority, I supported the statutory Line-Item Veto Act \ncrafted here by my good friend the Senator from Arizona and others.\n  Opting for a statutory approach allows Congress to evaluate the new \nline-item veto authority carefully and to offer refinements when \nappropriate.\n  In fact, I am pleased to have established a line-item veto watchdog \ngroup for just this purpose, and look forward to taking an active role \nin watching the development of this new statutory authority.\n  I have also offered legislation to strengthen the Line-Item Veto Act \nwith regard to wasteful special interest spending in the tax code.\n  As we know, changes to our Constitution are not so easily refined.\n  As the supporters of prohibition discovered, we can only react to the \nunintended consequences of a constitutional amendment by amending the \nConstitution again.\n  Of course, supporters of the constitutional amendment are unwilling \nto admit there may be unintended consequences, especially with regard \nto the role of the courts and the President.\n  They generally remain silent about those issues.\n  While they are unwilling to confer specific enforcement powers \nexplicitly to the executive or judicial branches, they also refuse to \nacknowledge the implied presence of enforcement powers in the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The amendment offered by my good friend from Arkansas adopts the same \nsupermajority threshold approach used in the proposed constitutional \namendment; it would take effect right away, not 9 years from now; and, \nit avoids the monumental uncertainties inherent in any constitutional \nchange.\n  I congratulate my good friend Senator Bumpers for offering this \nsensible alternative, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not intend to take much time on this \namendment. My colleague deserves certainly some response.\n  This motion would alter the constitutional amendment and make it into \na statute. I do not know if we need to say anything more because we are \ndebating a constitutional amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is very ingenious. He is a \ngreat friend of mine; I appreciate him, but this motion very simply \nsays, ``We do not need a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.''\n  Now, I insist that we do when you look at these 28 years of \nunbalanced budgets. I hate it when people come in here and say, ``Let's \njust do it.'' I have heard that throughout this debate. ``Let's just do \nit''--the very same people who basically have never done it the whole \ntime they have been in the Senate. That is not quite true because \nSenator Byrd was here, I suspect Senator Kennedy was here and maybe \nsome others. Frankly, many of these people, I have never heard them \nask: Where is the money coming from to pay for these spending programs?\n  This motion says we can guarantee the fiscal discipline necessary to \nmake balanced budgets the rule rather than the exception simply by \nenacting statutory changes to the Budget Act.\n  As I said, I do not doubt that my colleague believes this and that he \nis sincere in offering this motion, but I must say that the proponents \nof this motion are dead wrong.\n  The problem with this motion is that it puts us back to square one, \nforcing us to rely, as we have done time and time again, on statutory \nfixes to ensure fiscal responsibility. We have been down this road \nbefore, Mr. President, and the result is right here in front of me--28 \nunbalanced budgets in a row; 58 of the last 66 are unbalanced budgets. \nJust think about it. In the last 66 years, 58 years we have had an \nunbalanced budget. In every one of those years we have had people say, \n``Let's just do it. Let's do it statutorily.''\n  Well, the time has come for a solution strong enough that it cannot \nbe evaded for short-term gain. We need a constitutional requirement to \nbalance the budget.\n  The sad history of legislative attempts to balance the budget shows \nthe need for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. \nSince 1978, we have adopted, as I have said many times on this floor, \nno fewer than five major statutory balanced budget mechanisms such as \nthe distinguished Senator is putting forth here sincerely, none of \nwhich have worked. We have 28 straight years of unbalanced budgets. We \nhave had statutory regimes for each of those 28 years, none of which \nhas worked. Since 1978, we have adopted those five statutory regimes \nwhich\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\npromised faithfully to bring about balanced budgets. Every one of those \nfailed and they failed miserably. Time after time, statutory fixes have \nmet with increased deficits. Here it is. It does not take any brains, \nyou do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize we do not have the \nguts to do what is right under the status quo, without the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Some people do not think we even have the guts to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment. Well, in fact, nearly 85 percent of our current \nnational debt has accumulated while Congress has operated within \nstatutory budget frameworks designed to assure balanced budgets. The \nfact is we can never solve these problems through the enactment of mere \nstatutes because statutes do not purport to correct the structural bias \nin favor of deficit spending. Statutes are only able to deal with \ntemporary crises.\n  Let's take a look at just a few of those statutes.\n  In 1978, my first year here in the U.S. Senate, we passed the Revenue \nAct of 1978, P.L. 95-600. Section 3 of that act was straightforward. It \nstated: ``As a matter of national policy * * * the Federal budget \nshould be balanced in fiscal years 1982 and 1983.'' But, if you look \ncarefully, Mr. President, you will find the Federal budgets for each of \nthose years in this stack here in front of me. In 1982 we ran a budget \ndeficit of $128 billion. In 1983, our deficit was even higher at $208 \nbillion. This while it was our national policy--as declared in statute \nenacted by Congress and agreed to by the President--that our budget \nshould be balanced in each of those years.\n  Now that is not to say that Congress was not serious about reaching \nbalance. I was here and I can tell you that we were. In fact, later in \nthat same year, 1978, we adopted an amendment offered by our former \ncolleague Harry Byrd, Jr., from Virginia, which stated that \n``[b]eginning with fiscal year 1981, the total budget outlays of the \nFederal Government shall not exceed its receipts.'' Two years later, in \n1980, we modified the Byrd amendment to state that ``[t]he Congress \nreaffirms its commitment that beginning with fiscal year 1981, the \ntotal outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its \nreceipts.'' You will notice that in reaffirming our commitment to a \nbalanced budget we changed the language from saying that Congress \n``should'' balance the budget to say that Congress ``shall'' balance \nthe budget in 1981. And yet, Mr. President, the Federal budget for 1981 \nis also one of the 28 unbalanced budgets in this stack here in front of \nme.\n  This again, is not to say that Congress' commitment to balancing the \nbudget was in any way diminished. In 1982 we revised the Byrd amendment \nonce again to say that ``Congress reaffirms its commitment that budget \noutlays of the United States Government for a fiscal year may be not \nmore than the receipts of the Government for that year.'' And yet, Mr. \nPresident, the budget for every year since that commitment was enacted \ninto statute is in this stack of unbalanced budgets.\n  Perhaps the most well-known statute designed to ensure a balanced \nFederal budget was the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985. Many of my \ncolleagues remember this act well. It was touted as the deficit \nreduction package to end all deficit reduction packages. I supported \nthat legislation, and I held out great hope that it would actually \nbring us into balance for what then would have been the first time in \n22 years.\n  Much like the motion before us, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act amended \nthe Budget Act to provide for a point of order in the House or Senate \nagainst any budget resolution that exceeded certain deficit reduction \ntargets. These declining deficit targets were to put us on the so-\ncalled glidepath to balance in fiscal year 1991. A point of order under \nthis legislation could only be waived by a supermajority vote. The \nsingular exception was for circumstances in which a declaration of war \nwas in effect.\n  That's pretty tough language, Mr. President. And it was backed up by \nan automatic sequestration mechanism to ensure that the deficit \nreduction targets were met. That's why so many of my colleagues and I \nsupported the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. And yet that law, Mr. \nPresident--the deficit reduction package to end all deficit reduction \npackages--was slowly amended, circumvented, and the requirement for a \nbalanced budget finally eliminated altogether just one year prior to \nthe year in which we were to achieve balance under the original act. As \na result, we have now amassed an additional $1.3 trillion in debt since \n1991.\n  Mr. President, the Bumpers motion offers no better promises than the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. Ultimately, as experience has shown, no \nCongress can bind a succeeding Congress by simple statute. Any balanced \nbudget statute can be repealed, in whole or in part, by the simple \nexpedient of adopting a new statute. Statutory limitations remain \neffective only as long as no majority coalition forms to overcome such \nstatutory constraints.\n  Now I know my colleagues have argued that things are different now \nthan they were under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. They cite too the fact that \nwe have experienced four consecutive years of deficit reduction and \nthat Congress and the President agree that the budget must be balanced. \nBut the American people have plenty of reasons to be skeptical of this \nargument.\n  Under the budget the President has proposed, we will have deficits \nlarger than last year's budget deficit until the year 2000. Only in the \nlast 2 years of his budget do we see the dramatic cuts necessary to \nbring us into balance. In other words, a full 75 percent of the deficit \nreduction planned in President Clinton's budget comes in the 2 years \nafter he leaves office. Is this the sort of glide path to a balanced \nbudget that is envisioned by section 1 of the Bumpers motion?\n  This to me, Mr. President, is not the sort of commitment to balancing \nthe budget that would support the argument that we can rely on yet \nanother statutory fix to bring about long-term fiscal restraint. The \nreliability of this commitment is only undercut by the Bumpers \namendment, which would remove Social Security receipts and outlays from \nthe balanced budget calculation--something the President himself has \nsaid cannot be done while still bringing the budget into balance in the \nyear 2002, as is promised by the Bumpers amendment. The truth is that \nthe Bumpers amendment promises only more of the same--year after year \nof machinations and evasion of responsibility to those of the future \ngenerations who must pay for our lack of budgetary discipline.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not wish to lay blame on Democrats or \nRepublicans for the fiscal indiscretions of the past. The simple fact \nis that the problems in our current budget are not the fault of any \npolitical party, they are inherent in our political system. As our late \ncolleague Paul Tsongas once said:\n\n       [I]f you ask yourself why are these deficits always voted, \n     the answer is very simple; that is, there are a lot of votes \n     in deficit spending. . . . []The balanced-budget amendment is \n     simply a recognition of that human behavior. It is not so \n     much an indictment of the people who are here now as it is \n     simply a reflection this is how people act in a democracy. \n     They act to maximize their votes, and in this particular \n     case, the addiction to deficit spending takes them in a \n     particular direction.''\n\n  The fact is that we can never solve these problems through the \nenactment of mere statutes because statutes do not purport to correct \nthis structural bias in favor of deficit spending. Statutes are only \nintended to deal with a temporary crisis. The deficit spending bias is \nnot a problem that has lasted, nor will last, only a short number of \nyears. It is a long-term problem that is deeply ingrained in our budget \nprocess. It demands a permanent constitutional solution.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 is such a solution. It is a balanced, \ncarefully crafted measure that has been developed in a bicameral, \nbipartisan fashion. I hope my colleagues will join with me in opposing \nthe maintenance of the status quo and that they will vote to table the \nBumpers motion.\n  Having said that, I do get just a little uptight about people coming \nin here and blaming everything on Reagan and Bush. Yesterday, I had a \ndebate with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia who tried to \nblame all of these deficits on Ronald Reagan and George Bush because \nduring their tenure the deficits went up, and blame them on the tax \ncuts.\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n  I put into the Record yesterday evidence that those tax cuts, those \nmarginal tax rate reductions actually resulted in a 40-percent, \napproximately 40-percent, increase in revenues because they stimulated \nthe economy for 8 years, they contributed more jobs, more opportunity; \n21 million jobs were created. They stimulated opportunity. They did a \nlot of things to get this country going again. But let me point out \nthat during that whole time Reagan was in the Presidency, the Democrats \ncontrolled the House of Representatives. Tip O'Neil was in charge \nduring the first part of that. And they kept spending.\n  Now, I am not just blaming Democrats. There were liberal Republicans \nwho helped them to do that as well. And there is no question that the \nincrease in military spending did put pressures on the budget and that \nPresident Reagan was the one who did that. There is no question about \nthat.\n\n  But, on the other hand, if you think of the trillions of dollars that \nwere saved because the Iron Curtain now has fallen and freedom has been \nrestored to the East bloc countries, it probably was worth it.\n  The blame should be on everybody. I don't think people should demagog \nthis issue and stand up and say, ``It is Reagan and Bush who did this \nthing to us and created this $5.3 trillion debt.'' No, it is a \ncontinual, 58-out-of-66-year unbalanced spending process, during which \ntime the Congress was controlled by liberals--let me put it that way, \nrather than Democrats and Republicans--liberals who spent us into \nbankruptcy. And during all of the Reagan years, the liberals did the \nsame thing.\n  Had we not continued to spend, those marginal tax cuts would have \nbrought us out of the difficulties, except with the possible exception, \nat least as I view it, of the increases in the defense budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. A lot of people \nwant to catch airplanes, and I do not want to discommode anybody. But \nlet me close by saying the Senator from Utah has suggested that the \nconstitutional amendment would be so much more effective than my \namendment.\n  But I ask the Senator from Utah, what provision in the constitutional \namendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is more effective than mine? We \ncannot ignore the Budget Act; 60 votes is 60 votes, whether you are \ntrying to get 60 votes to comply with the constitutional amendment or \nwhether you are trying to get 60 votes to comply with the Budget Act, \nas my amendment will provide.\n  Let me tell you what one of the differences is. Under my amendment, \nif you cannot get 60 votes, you shut the Government down and you wait \nfor the people here to come to their senses and get the Government \nopen, as we did the year before last. Under the constitutional \namendment, if you cannot get the 60 votes, you shut the Government down \nand go down to the Supreme Court and wait for them to act. Not only is \nthat time-consuming and outrageous, but you are also cutting the three \nbranches of the Government of the United States to two.\n  One of the reasons we have this big deficit, which everybody \nlaments--let me say it once more--is because we talk one way and act \nanother. We talk about how we are going to get the budget balanced, and \nhow terrible it is that we cannot get our spending under control, and \nthen we turn around and cut taxes by massive amounts. It is the worst \nform of snake oil I have ever seen in my life, yet we keep buying into \nit. We bought into it in 1981, and now we are getting ready to buy into \nit again.\n  All I am saying is, under my amendment, you have everything you have \nunder the constitutional amendment. It is just as tough to comply \nwith--really, tougher--and we exclude Social Security.\n  I guess everything is said that needs to be said, so I will close and \nlet the Senator from Utah move to table my amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Utah has 47 \nminutes, and the Senator from Arkansas has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues' \nattention to an opinion piece by Senator Bob Dole entitled ``Medicare: \nLet's Fix It'' that was in last Sunday's Washington Post.\n  It is my hope that all my Senate colleagues will read this compelling \nop-ed. Senator Dole has worked on and observed the Medicare Program for \nmany years, and there is much wisdom to be gleaned from his commentary. \nHe is right--we must address Medicare's problems with real solutions \nwhile giving seniors more choices.\n  On a personal note, I want to thank my friend for his praise of \nlegislation, S. 341, recently introduced by Senator Moynihan and \nmyself, to establish a bipartisan commission on the long-term solvency \nproblems in the Medicare Program.\n  As Senator Dole notes, ``a bipartisan commission can recommend sound \nlong-term solutions,'' as evidenced by the 1983 Social Security \nCommission.\n  Mr. President, the proposed national bipartisan commission on the \nFuture of Medicare would be this type of commission.\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\n  Currently, the Medicare Program is not in the best of health--its \nshort- and long-term fiscal problems make it increasingly vulnerable. \nIn January, the Congressional Budget Office projected the Medicare \ntrust fund is headed for the emergency room; it will go bankrupt in \n2001 with a $4.5 billion shortfall. The trust fund is spending more \nthan it is taking in from revenues; this trend will continue, creating \na trust fund deficit of over one-half trillion dollars just 10 years \nfrom now. And that's still before the baby-boomers begin to retire in \n2010.\n  The prognosis is not good. The Medicare trust fund is limping--and \nsoon will be staggering--into the 21st century.\n  This national bipartisan commission is the medicine needed to restore \nMedicare's good health. Its recommendations will help the President and \nCongress build the consensus needed to enact effective policies to \npreserve and strengthen Medicare.\n  Senator Dole is correct in stating, ``Creating a commission won't \nlet--the President and Congress--off the hook to enact needed Medicare \nchanges now to avoid bankruptcy in 2001.'' I believe the President and \nCongress must act immediately to extend the short-term solvency of the \nprogram.\n  I am encouraged by President Clinton's willingness in his budget \npackage to address the growth of Medicare spending over the next 5 \nyears. However, I'm troubled by the administration's use of gimmicks \nlike the home health transfer and an over reliance on cutting provider \npayments--such policies are just plastic surgery, masking deeper \nproblems with a pretty face. Senator Dole says he has ``never seen a \nbudget gimmick that solved a real public policy problem''--and neither \nhave I.\n  In the long-term, Medicare must fight another potentially crippling \nproblem. Retiring baby boomers will challenge our ability to maintain \nour promises to beneficiaries. Today, there are less than 40 million \nAmericans who qualify to receive Medicare. By the year 2010, the number \nwill be approaching 50 million, and by 2020, it will be over 60 \nmillion. Today, there are almost four workers supporting each retiree, \nbut in 2030, there will be only about two per retiree.\n  The demographic progression of the Medicare population will not come \nas a surprise. We know today what is to be expected.\n  To be healthy, the Medicare Program is in need of structural reform. \nSince Medicare's enactment in 1965, there has been a great deal of \nchange in the private health care system in the United States--but \nMedicare remains fundamentally unchanged. Medicare is too rigid and \nunable to offer the improvements in delivery of care and technological \nadvances that have been made in the private sector. Medicare is the \nModel T Ford of health care programs competing in a race car world.\n  These are some of the problems the National Bipartisan Commission \nwill address. I believe it will prove to be the intensive treatment \nneeded to cure Medicare's growing symptoms. There is agreement over the \ndiagnosis, but no consensus over the course of treatment. Meanwhile, \nMedicare's time runs short.\n  It is my hope that by working together in a bipartisan effort, we can \nseriously and responsibly address the Medicare issue. Again, I hope my \ncolleagues will read Senator Dole's essay, and consider the issues he \nraises.\n  The answers to the Medicare problem are not easy and they are not \npolitically popular. The consequences of delaying treatment are much \nworse, though. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend \nfor future generations to inherit a robust Medicare Program with a \nclean bill of health. The Commission proposed by Senator Moynihan and \nmyself is just what the doctor ordered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Senator Dole's \nop-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1997]\n\n                         Medicare: Let's Fix It\n\n                             (By Bob Dole)\n\n       Some politicians make Medicare decisions with one eye on \n     the next election--something I learned in 1996. Enough \n     already. It's time to focus on present beneficiaries and the \n     next generation.\n       Rhetoric won't get the job done. Neither will budget \n     gimmicks nor shell games such as the administration's \n     proposal to move home health costs from Part A of Medicare \n     over to Part B. Such accounting gimmicks have been around for \n     at least as long as the budget deficit. I've seen plenty of \n     them, even tried some, but I have never seen a budget gimmick \n     yet that solved a real public policy problem.\n       The fact is, to survive, Medicare will have to look much \n     different in 10 years from what it looks like today. The \n     program obviously requires structural changes, not just \n     tinkering around the edges. In his State of the Union \n     address, President Clinton said: `The enemy of our time is \n     inaction.'' Well, it's time to do what's right for our \n     nation's elderly before the president's words become an \n     epitaph for the Medicare program.\n       Doing what's right means doing things differently in \n     several ways. Remember, we face two major problems with \n     Medicare: a short-term problem with bankruptcy in 2001 and an \n     even larger long-term financing problem when the baby boomers \n     start retiring in 2010. Any Medicare ``fix'' has to be \n     mindful of both. I do not have all the answers, but I would \n     advance a few ideas for consideration.\n       Affluence-test the Part B premium. Yes, I'll say it: Senior \n     citizens who can afford to pay more should pay more for Part \n     B of Medicare. Unlike Part A of Medicare, Part B is not \n     financed by payroll taxes. Right now, Medicare beneficiaries \n     pay premiums that cover only 25 percent of the cost of Part B \n     of Medicare. General revenues pick up the tab for the \n     remaining 75 percent. If only the well-to-do beneficiaries, \n     those with incomes greater than $60,000 for a single \n     individual and $90,000 for a couple, paid a higher premium \n     (say, 50 percent instead of 25 percent--as was originally \n     intended in the program), we could save $9 billion over five \n     years.\n       It's just plain old-fashioned fairness for affluent \n     beneficiaries to pay a little more (still way below the \n     actual cost of the care), and our elected leaders should say \n     so. No more of this strange, silent dance between president \n     and Congress where each partner says to the other, ``You go \n     first!'' The president should propose and a bipartisan \n     majority in Congress should support appropriate increases in \n     the Part B premium.\n       Keep the link between Medicare and Social Security. \n     Throughout the history of the Medicare program, the age at \n     which a senior citizen becomes eligible for Medicare has \n     always been the same as the age at which he or she becomes \n     eligible for Social Security. That's as it should be. It \n     makes perfect sense for these two programs to go hand-in-\n     hand.\n       In 1983 the bipartisan Social Security Commission, on which \n     I served, recommended several fixes to save the Social \n     Security program that were enacted into law. One fix was \n     slowly to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security to \n     67. After all, people will live longer and retire later than \n     they did earlier in the century when the program was created. \n     So, the age of eligibility for Social Security will start to \n     rise a couple of months each year beginning in 2003. We \n     should keep the historical link between Medicare and Social \n     Security, and let Medicare eligibility rise with Social \n     Security.\n       Give senior citizens choice. Medicare beneficiaries should \n     be able to choose the kind of coverage they want. Innovative \n     ideas such as medical savings account should be available, as \n     should managed-care plans and traditional fee-for-service \n     plans. The critical word here is choice. No one should be \n     forced into any particular health care model.\n       Let's let seniors make their own decisions. It's wrong when \n     some people argue that seniors simply are not capable of \n     deciding their own health care coverage and that the \n     government always knows best. Given the right kind of \n     information, seniors can decide what's best for themselves. \n     The should be given the same kind of choices that federal \n     employees have been offered for years. The federal employee \n     health benefits program is one broad-scale model that shows \n     choice works.\n       Giving seniors choice could also help hold down costs. Last \n     year health care costs in the private sector grew only 2.9 \n     percent while health care costs in the public sector rose. \n     8.7 percent--three times as fast. Why is the private sector \n     doing a much better job holding down costs? One reason is \n     free-market competition. And choice will spur competition, \n     efficiency and lower costs in the public sector just as it \n     already has in the private sector. What's more, structural \n     changes that help lower overall costs are the only way to \n     address Medicare's long-term problem.\n       Cutting providers alone is not the answer. It seems every \n     time the president and Congress address Medicare, payments to \n     doctors and hospitals get cut. Politically, this is a ``no \n     brainer,'' since there are millions more beneficiaries than \n     doctors and hospitals. The president's FY 1998 budget \n     proposal is more of the same: cuts for doctors and \n     hospitals--and now cuts for HMOs, too, reducing their \n     reimbursement rate from 95 percent to 90 percent of average \n     per capita costs.\n       Some reductions in some areas are no doubt justified, but \n     you cannot fix the program by hitting providers alone. You \n     can buy a few months or a few years on the short-term \n     problem, but it will not solve the long-term problem. In \n     fact, it may exacerbate it. The reductions must be \n     accompanied by true reimbursement reform. Let's move more of \n     the program into a prospective payment system so the \n     incentives for the wise use of services are in place. Let's \n     pay managed-care plans a fair amount and be certain\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\n     the care provided is of the highest quality and that funds \n     meant for teaching and indigent care are spent correctly. The \n     real problems faced by rural plans as well as by urban \n     providers must be addressed as should Medicare's role in \n     paying to train our nation's physicians.\n       Form a Medicare commission. It may turn out that no matter \n     how much is done, it still will not be enough to offset the \n     long-term challenge we face with the retirement of the huge \n     baby-boomer generation. If the president and Congress cannot \n     agree on how to preserve Medicare long term, as a last \n     resort, a bipartisan commission should be authorized. Sen. \n     William Roth and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan should be \n     applauded for recently proposing legislation to establish \n     such a commission. As the 1983 Social Security Commission \n     demonstrated, a bipartisan commission can recommend sound \n     long-term solutions. But if some politicians hope they can \n     dodge the tough choices by creating a commission, I have news \n     for you: It won't work. Creating a commission won't let you \n     off the hook to enact needed Medicare changes now to avoid \n     bankruptcy in 2001, and even the commission's recommendations \n     to address the long-term problem will require members of \n     Congress to vote on sticky issues and the president to sign \n     or veto the legislation.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \npending unanimous-consent request on the tax measure. I do so because \nof my concern about a matter which is pressing for my State, in a \nnumber of particulars, most specifically the Wilkes-Barre arena, where \nfinancing is being held up because legislation has been introduced by \nSenator Moynihan, which has an effective date on the date of committee \naction, and bond counsel have, as I understand it, given an opinion \nthat industrial development bonds cannot be issued from the State.\n  After discussing the matter with Senator Moynihan, it is my \nunderstanding that he is concerned about the statutory limits on other \ntax-exempt bonds, which would affect hospitals and universities. It is \na relative rarity that a tax bill comes through the Senate. This is an \noccasion where I would have an opportunity to introduce an amendment to \ntry to move this process along. I am well aware of the fact that this \nis an important measure which needs to be cleared through the Senate. \nBut I wanted to take this opportunity--and I have so advised our \ndistinguished majority leader of my intention--when the unanimous-\nconsent request is propounded, to reserve the right to object to see if \nwe might get some sort of a schedule for consideration of the \nunderlying issues here.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished majority leader on the \nfloor. I await his action on propounding the unanimous-consent request. \nI take advantage of this break in the action to state my position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with my apologies to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, was there anything I needed to respond to at this \njuncture, or would you like to go ahead with the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SPECTER.

This agreement would allow the Senate to conclude the matter \non Tuesday, March 4. Having said that, I now will propound a unanimous \nconsent for final disposition of the constitutional amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday \nand 12:30 be equally divided between the two managers for closing \nremarks on Senate Joint Resolution 1. I further ask that, at 2:15 on \nTuesday, there be 1 hour under the control of the manager on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, with the first 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Byrd, to be followed by the next hour under the \ncontrol of Senator Hatch, to be followed by the next 30 minutes under \ncontrol of Senator Daschle, or his designee, with the final 30 minutes \nunder the control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, \na vote occur on the passage of S.J. Res. 1 at 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday, and \nthat paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived and all occur without \nintervening action.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had the \nopportunity to discuss this matter, and I concur with the unanimous-\nconsent request, with the understanding--which we have discussed--that \nif there is a family emergency or an illness that would preclude a \nMember from having the opportunity to vote on such an important issue \nas this, that we would revisit the issue. I don't anticipate that. I \nexpect 100-percent attendance. And, as I say, we have had that \nunderstanding in our discussion also. So I do not object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just comment on the Democratic \nleader's comments of a moment ago. First of all, I think we have had a \ngood and full debate on this issue. I said from the beginning that I \nhoped we would do that, and that it would be a thoughtful and \nprovocative debate that would cause Members to think seriously about \nthis issue. I think that has happened.\n  There has been some suggestion that we put it off, and I thought \nabout that. If there were some reason to do that, I would be willing to \ndelay it further. But I think we should be ready to vote. We have had \namendments and the debate, and we would be prepared to do that, then, \non Tuesday under this agreement. But, as always is the case, we need to \nbe aware of and respectful of extenuating circumstances beyond our \ncontrol. I will join the Democratic leader in moving the vote to the \nnext morning, or whatever, if we have that need, based on a genuine \nillness or family problem that could not be avoided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1728-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today on the front page of the Washington \nPost there is a story that I think should not simply slide by the \nconcern and consideration of all our colleagues in the Senate. The \nheadline is, ``GOP Senators Seek To Curb Panel's Fund-Raising Probe.''\n  The heart of the story is a basic expression, on behalf of some \nSenators, that they only want to focus on President Clinton. They do \nnot want an investigation that somehow looks into the activities of the \nCongress itself.\n  I know the Congress is plenty good at taking care of itself. Through \nhistory it has proven that. But the American people will not be \nsatisfied with such\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\nan extraordinary, brazen, overt statement of unwillingness to heed the \ninterests of the American people and to get to the bottom of any \nallegations of wrongdoing in any kind of fundraising. Anyone who \nsuggests we can just sweep this under the rug because people are \nnervous up here, or somehow they think that looking at congressional \ninquiries might become the instigator of reform, and therefore, because \nthey don't want reform, they are not going to investigate, is one of \nthe most extraordinary efforts of turning your back on the interests of \nwhat we are supposed to be doing here and of the American people.\n  I will signal for myself, and I think there are other Senators who \nfeel this way--no one is looking for some no-holds-barred embarrassment \nhere. No one is looking for some fishing expedition. But where there \nare legitimate examples and legitimate allegations with respect to \ncongressional abuses, it would simply be inappropriate for the Congress \nof the United States to sweep it under the rug and walk away because we \nfear whatever that might tell us. It would be even more inappropriate \nto do so because we fear reform.\n  I can think of nothing that would invite a storm of protest from the \nAmerican people over a period of time more than that kind of front page \nstatement about the congressional willingness to sweep something under \nthe rug.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1728-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REINSTATEMENT OF OREGON LAW RELATING TO PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there are developments in a matter that \nI think command our attention. I would like to bring them to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  Recently, Senator Dorgan and I, joined by 28 of our colleagues, \nintroduced S. 304, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. It is \nsimply a law that says no Federal tax dollars shall be used to promote \nor pay for assisted suicide.\n  There had been a threat that we might be asked to pay for assisted \nsuicide with Federal Medicaid funds in the State of Oregon. Oregon \nenacted what was called Measure 16, which allowed for physician-\nassisted suicide for terminally ill patients in that State. Oregon \nofficials stated that they would be submitting Medicaid bills to the \nFederal Government to pay for assisted suicide under the category of \n``comfort care,'' a euphemism which is particularly troubling to me.\n  After Oregon passed Measure 16, its implementation was suspended by \nU.S. District Judge Michael Hogan, in Eugene, OR. While the law was not \nin effect, we would not be asked to pay Federal dollars, tax dollars of \nAmerican citizens, to end the lives of individuals rather than to \nsustain their lives.\n  Throughout the history of the Medicaid and Medicare Programs, there \nhas been the presumption that funds for those programs would be used to \nelevate, encourage, enrich and extend the lives of American citizens. \nIt turns out now that with this one law in one State, we will be asked \nfor Federal resources for medical reimbursements under the health care \nprovided by Oregon's Medicaid program, to end the lives of individuals, \nto help physicians help patients commit suicide.\n  Senator Dorgan and I, and 28 of our colleagues, have sponsored \nlegislation to prevent such a practice--to prohibit Federal tax dollars \nfrom being expended for assisted suicide. Our legislation had an \nimperative quality because the decision of an appeals court was \npending. But today the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the \naction which had suspended the implementation of the Oregon law. The \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, in so doing, potentially clears the way \nfor the State of Oregon to begin calling upon the resources of U.S. \ntaxpayers to assist people in their suicides.\n  I have to tell you, this is against the values of many of the people \nwith whom I speak and many of those I represent in the State of \nMissouri. Key groups and organizations, including the U.S. Catholic \nBishops, the National Right to Life, and the American Medical \nAssociation, oppose assisted suicide, and oppose the use of Federal \nfunds for such a practice, as it is an inappropriate expenditure of tax \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, 87 percent of the American public does not want tax \ndollars spent on dispensing toxic drugs to end the lives of Americans \ninstead of focusing our resources on therapeutic drugs and other \ntherapies to extend and improve the life of American citizens. It is \ntime for us to understand the urgency of this issue, given the fact the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the challenge to Measure 16.\n  Now, the dismissal of the action is appealable by the parties there. \nThey can appeal back to the Ninth Circuit for a hearing en banc, or to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. But I raise this in the consciousness of the \nU.S. Senate to say we do not have a significant amount of time, and I \nbelieve the vast majority of citizens in this country never anticipated \nthat their tax resources would be consumed in poisoning fellow citizens \nunder the guise of comfort care in the State of Oregon.\n  We would be derelict in our duty were we to ignore this problem and \nallow a few officials in one State to decide that taxpayers all across \nAmerica must help subsidize a practice that has never been authorized \nin most of America, is considered to be morally abhorrent by many \nAmericans, and is considered to be medically inappropriate by the \nAmerican Medical Association. Because of today's decision, I implore my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate to act swiftly to pass the Assisted \nSuicide Funding Restriction Act before our tax dollars begin to go for \nending, and not saving, the lives of our fellow Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as part of the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care \nlegislation, passed in the 104th Congress, we provided for a pilot \nprogram to explore the potential of medical savings accounts.\n  These MSA's represent a significant step forward in our objective to \npromote an environment where Americans can receive quality and \naffordable health care in market-based programs. MSA's would allow \nfamilies to participate in higher deductible, lower premium plans.\n  The money saved on premiums would be placed in tax-sheltered MSA \naccounts. Families could then use this money to pay for health care \ncosts. They would have a greater stake in the health care delivery \nsystem. Their vigilance--as they use their own money--would encourage \nhealth care providers to keep costs competitive and quality high.\n  MSA's would also go a long way toward cutting the high costs \nassociated with health care administration.\n  It's projected that as families play a more active role in paying for \ntheir health care, because of the high deductible nature of MSA's, that \nless than 10 percent of those using MSA's would send a bill to their \ninsurance. Insurance company involvement would come only after the \ndeductible has been met, or in the case of a catastrophic illness.\n  As we look for innovative and workable programs to help Americans \nmeet the costs associated with health care, MSA's offer a viable and \nattractive possibility. I anxiously await the results from the pilot \nprogram we initiated, as well as response from our health care \ncommunity.\n  Recently, I received a letter and an article from two academics \nassociated with the allied health profession field. Amy B. Hecht, \nformer dean of the Temple University College of Allied Health \nProfessions and James L. Hecht, professor in the political science \ndepartment at Temple, authored an impressive overview of MSA's.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Rx for Health Reform--Medical Savings Accounts Give Consumers a Stake \n                            in Cutting Costs\n\n              (By James L. Hecht and Amy Blatchford Hecht)\n\n       Horror stories constantly are being reported by the media \n     about how America's rapidly changing health care system has \n     caused disastrous results for some and suffering for many. \n     That is not surprising since tens of millions of people are \n     being forced into managed care, where they have far less \n     control than under the previous fee-for-service system.\n       Unfortunately, little has been said about an alternative: \n     having people pay for normal\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n     health care expenses directly from tax-sheltered Medical \n     Savings Accounts. Much of what has been said has been \n     directed at MSAs' one disadvantage as opposed to their many \n     advantages.\n       Employers are the vector for the rapid transition to \n     managed care. The cost of medical care in the United States \n     has been more than 30 percent more per capita than anywhere \n     else in the world. Thus American companies are under enormous \n     pressure to cut health costs since they have become a major \n     expense and a disadvantage against foreign competitors. \n     Moreover, large expenditures have not produced better health \n     as measured by criteria such as life expectancy and infant \n     mortality rates.\n       Some of the America's high costs results from its \n     leadership in using technology to provide the best care in \n     the world for those who are able to take advantage of it. \n     That is desirable. But there is another reason why health \n     costs in the United States have gotten out of control: an \n     enormous government subsidy which encourages payment by \n     insurance.\n       Providing most health care payments through insurance makes \n     as little sense as having homeowners' insurance cover \n     maintenance. The purpose of insurance is to protect against \n     expensive catastrophes. Home maintenance costs are \n     significant, but can be handled more economically and \n     satisfactorily without a third party involved.\n       But in the case of health care, insurance paid by employers \n     became the standard following World War II because employers \n     were able to shelter part of their employee compensation from \n     taxes by providing health insurance that covered normal \n     expenses. Thus the U.S. government subsidized a health care \n     system financed unlike any other in the world. As costs of \n     new treatments increased and options for care expanded, costs \n     skyrocketed but were not matched by improved results.\n       That is why tax-sheltered contributions to Medical Saving \n     Accounts, whether made by an employer or individual, make \n     sense. Consumers should have the option of administering \n     their own medical bills, barring catastrophic costs, while \n     receiving the same government subsidy given to employer-paid \n     insurance and managed care.\n       People with MSAs would have insurance, but it would only \n     cover expenses after a deductible of at least $2,000. Thus, \n     less than 10 percent of those with MSAs would send a single \n     bill to their insurance company in a single year. That's one \n     huge advantage of MSAs: a big decrease in the costs of health \n     care administration. Studies indicate that administration of \n     third-party payments accounts for well over 20 percent of \n     health costs. Billions of dollars spent on paperwork would be \n     saved. And that does not include the time and aggravation \n     consumers spend to get reimbursement.\n       MSAs might cause some people to skimp on preventive care. \n     But insurance policies for catastrophic care could cover \n     periodic physical exams, Pap tests and prenatal care because \n     they effectively prevent expensive medical problems.\n       Meanwhile, people paying their own bills are more likely to \n     compare prices when a physician orders tests. Some will \n     question the necessity of recommended tests. Nurse \n     practitioners and physician assistants would be used more \n     since their fees are far lower than physicians'. Savings of \n     tens of billions more would result from giving consumers a \n     stake in reducing costs.\n       Plus, having people pay directly for much of their health \n     care will be a powerful force for choosing healthier \n     lifestyles.\n       Many of these same advantages can be achieved by managed \n     care, which is why employers are shifting health benefits in \n     this direction. In fact, a good HMO usually will be the best \n     option for people who are not careful consumers. However, \n     people who value control over their health decisions, or who \n     do not have access to a good HMO, usually would be better off \n     with an MSA and fee-for-service.\n       Competition between managed care and MSAs is another \n     important reason to shelter MSAs from taxes. Competition \n     solely between HMOs and other managed care plans will not \n     necessarily result in good, cost-effective health care. There \n     was fierce competition between General Motors, Ford and \n     Chrysler, but until Japanese automakers captured a \n     significant share of the market, American manufacturers \n     produced inferior cars and did not control costs as \n     efficiently. Today, doctors are being offered financial \n     incentives to decrease patient care. Tax-sheltered NSAs and \n     fee-for-service could shift incentives where they belong: \n     bonuses for better patient outcomes.\n       While tax-sheltered MSAs will provide better care at \n     greatly reduced costs for most Americans, they would not be \n     good for those with chronic illnesses requiring costly, long-\n     term treatments. This is why they were opposed by Senate \n     Democrats and President Clinton. The chronically ill would \n     lose money with MSAs (although some might still choose one in \n     order to exercise greater control), and their alternatives \n     would cost more than at present because health care plans \n     would serve sicker populations with higher than average \n     expenses.\n       So in fairness, legislation creating tax-sheltered MSAs \n     should include a benefit for the chronically ill to offset \n     their higher costs. It might be a credit for families who had \n     out-of-pocket health expenses greater than some percentage of \n     gross income in the previous two years. The credit might be \n     for expenses greater than 7.5 percent of gross income, which \n     is the current medical and dental deduction on the federal \n     income tax.

Mr. President, on February 11, in his capacity as \nchairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, the senior Senator from \nVirginia testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Legislative \nBranch Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The purpose of that testimony was to provide justification for the \nJoint Committee's Fiscal Year 1998 appropriations request, and to \noutline the priorities of the Joint Committee in the current and future \nfiscal years.\n  Chief among the Joint Committee's priorities are reform of Title 44 \nU.S.C., and the implementation of means to assure that the American \npublic continues to retain access to information created by the Federal \nGovernment at taxpayer expense.\n  Currently, the Government Printing Office is charged under title 44 \nwith the management of the Federal Government's procurement of \ninformation products and with the maintenance of the public's access to \nthese products--through the Federal Depository Library System, through \nthe GPO Bookstore Program, and through GPO access, the on-line service \nof the Government Printing Office.\n  In recent years, however, various Federal agencies have taken to \nignoring title 44. Some are procuring their information products \ndirectly from the private sector without going through the GPO's \nprivate sector procurement program. Others are setting up in-house \nfacilities to create their own information products. In addition, a few \nagencies, in an effort to be entrepreneurial, have taken to making \narrangements with organizations outside the Federal Government for the \ndissemination of taxpayer-funded information. In doing so, this \ninformation has become copyrighted, or had copyright-like restrictions \nimposed upon it. The net result is that the public's access to \ntaxpayer-funded information has been greatly restricted.\n  Mr. President, the Government Printing Office's Superintendent of \nDocuments, Mr. Wayne Kelley recently delivered a speech on this issue. \nIn his remarks, Mr. Kelley provided specific details and raised a \nnumber of important questions about these activities and their \ndetrimental effect on the American public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kelley's speech before the \nGovernment Documents Roundtable, Federal Documents Task Force, of \nFebruary 15, 1997, be printed in full at the conclusion of this \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, which also is chaired by the senior Senator from \nVirginia, will hold 2 days of hearings later this spring on legislation \nto correct this situation and to reform other areas of title 44.\n  It is this Senator's intention that this legislation will be \nsupported on a bicameral and bipartisan basis, and that the \nadministration will fully support it as well.\n  Mr. President, the strength of America's system of government lies \nwith an informed public. Free and open access to information created at \ntaxpayer expense is the principle which has enabled the United States \nto endure and prosper for over 200 years, making this Nation the \noldest, continuous, constitutional democratic republic in the world.\n  Members of Congress have a responsibility to our Founding Fathers, to \nour citizenry, and to future generations to ensure that this principle \nis maintained.\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          Remarks of Wayne Kelley, Superintendent of Documents\n\n       I'd like to take a few minutes this morning to discuss a \n     growing trend to transfer Federal Government information from \n     the public domain to private ownership.\n       This is happening in a number of ways. One is for agencies \n     to establish exclusive or restrictive distribution \n     arrangements that limit public access to information. Another \n     is to charge fees or royalties for reuse or redissemination \n     of public information. In some recent cases government \n     publishers have actually assisted in transferring copyright \n     to the new owner.\n       Let me give you an example. For many years, the National \n     Cancer Institute procured the printing of its Journal of the \n     National Cancer Institute through the Government Printing \n     Office. The Superintendent of Documents Sales Program sold \n     subscriptions to the Journal and it was distributed to \n     Federal Depository Libraries at GPO expense.\n       In 1987, NCI made the semimonthly Journal a more current, \n     higher-quality cancer research publication. It was heavily \n     promoted by our Office of Marketing in coordination with the \n     NCI staff. By 1992, the Journal was selling 6,240 copies at \n     an annual subscription of $51, and was distributed free to \n     more than 800 selecting depository libraries throughout the \n     nation. It had achieved recognition as ``the number one \n     journal'' in its field, publishing the best original research \n     papers in oncology from around the world.\n       In 1993, the National Cancer Institute notified us that \n     they were developing a ``Consolidated Services'' concept \n     making all print and electronic data information available \n     only through an ``Information Associates Program.'' GPO could \n     no longer sell subscriptions at $51. The only way to get a \n     subscription was to buy an Associates Program membership from \n     NCI for $100. NCI agreed to supply depository copies at the \n     agency's expense. GPO continued to sell individual copies in \n     bookstores at $7 each. In December 1994, the International \n     Cancer Information Center, publisher of the Journal, received \n     a Federal ``Hammer'' award for its new Information Associate \n     Program.\n       Then, a disturbing development. Just a few week ago, in a \n     letter dated January 2, our Library Program Service was \n     notified that the Journal had been ``privatized.'' Ownership \n     was transferred from the National Cancer Institute to Oxford \n     University Press--USA, Inc. The letter said: ``Under the \n     terms of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement \n     signed by the two organizations, the name of the publication \n     will be retained, and Oxford will assume all responsibility \n     for printing the Journal and will hold copyright to the \n     Journal's content.''\n       The letter went on to explain that ``because the Journal is \n     no longer a publication of the U.S. Government, copies of the \n     Journal and JNCI Monographs will not be provided to the \n     Depository Library Program nor will sale copies be available \n     at the GPO bookstore.'' The new price, from Oxford, is $120 \n     for an individual and $150 for an institution.\n       The last paragraph in this brief letter said: ``We \n     appreciate the service the Depository Library Program has \n     provided in disseminating the Journal and JNCI Monographs for \n     many years.''\n       Looking back, I do not regret that we at GPO invested our \n     resources in promoting the Cancer Journal in the late 1980s. \n     Nor do I regret assisting in the transfer of subscribers to \n     the Information Associates Program in 1993. But I do regret \n     the loss of this valuable resource to American citizens \n     through the depository library program in 1997.\n       I have here the November 20 issue of the Journal which I \n     purchased from the main GPO Bookstore. Maybe this last, \n     public domain issue has some historical value.\n       Looking through the Journal, a number of questions come to \n     mind. I note that the masthead lists some 26 staff members.\n       I wonder if the editorial and news staff is still being \n     paid by the American taxpayer, but working for the Oxford \n     University Press? I wonder if the Oxford Press is sharing \n     revenues from the new, higher subscription rate with the \n     National Cancer Institute? I wonder if copyright will prevent \n     a librarian from sending a copy of an article to another \n     librarian?\n       I have no way of knowing the answers to these questions--\n     because the details of the Cooperative Research and \n     Development Agreement are not public information, according \n     to NCI legal counsel.\n       Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. There are \n     other recent examples of information gathered by government \n     employees disappearing from the public domain--for a price. I \n     worry that these cases will become precedents and the \n     precedents will set an irreversible trend.\n       I want to make it clear that I do not question the motives \n     or goals of the agency publishers who take this course. They \n     are doing what they feel is right in a new environment which \n     calls for cutting costs and generating revenues. They are \n     seeking to preserve valuable information.\n       But what if this new trend drives future Federal Government \n     Information Policy? Since the founding of our nation, the \n     cornerstone of information policy in the United States has \n     been the principle of universal access to Federal \n     information. This principle is being set aside without \n     many of the usual checks and balances in our democratic \n     society: Without any high level policy debate, without \n     clear rules, without thought to unintended consequences, \n     and often without full public disclosure of the \n     negotiations and agreements.\n       Is all Federal information with sufficient demand going to \n     be sent to market? If so, we should think about what that \n     means.\n       Does it mean that a Government agency may sell its name as \n     well as its information?\n       Does it mean that a wide array of private sector publishers \n     will no longer have access to the information to add value \n     and redistribute it to many different markets in different \n     products?\n       Does it mean the public consumer must pay two or three \n     times as much, or more, for the same information?\n       Does it mean that agency publishers will focus their \n     attention on more popular, marketable information and \n     eliminate other, perhaps more significant but less marketable \n     information?\n       Does it mean that programs authorized by Congress will \n     begin to move away from public needs, to focus instead on \n     market needs never contemplated by our elected \n     representatives?\n       Does it mean Government employees working at taxpayer \n     expense to support the information requirements of private \n     firms? And isn't that corporate welfare?\n       And what if the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, \n     now owned by the Oxford University Press, does not meet the \n     profit goals of the new owner? Does it mean that instead of a \n     ``Hammer'' award, there will be the ``axe'' usually awarded \n     sub-par performers in the market place?\n       Who represents the public in a Bottom-line Information Era? \n     What is to prevent our nation's bridge to the 21st Century \n     from turning into a toll bridge for Government information?\n       In 1989, the late Office of Technology Assessment, may it \n     rest in peace, declared that ``congressional action is \n     urgently needed to resolve Federal information issues and to \n     set the direction of Federal activities for years to come.'' \n     Now, eight years later, there is some talk of legislation to \n     update Federal Information Policy to the Electronic Era.\n       The critical issues at stake today are preservation of \n     official information, public access, Government \n     accountability, and an informed electorate. Americans should \n     not pass up this opportunity to define their own information \n     future.\n       Those best positioned to know the value and power of \n     information should take the lead. It is not an easy issue for \n     the media because it lacks the essential elements of hot \n     news. It is more significant than sensational.\n       It is not an easy issue for politicians because there is no \n     visible crisis and framing sound policy seldom delivers \n     votes.\n       So it may be up to those among us who by nature are \n     reluctant to get out front. Remember those riveting lines of \n     Yeats: ``The best lack all conviction, While the worst are \n     full of passionate intensity.'' Let's not let that happen.\n       Before it is too late, let the debate begin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Journal of the\n\n\n                                    National Cancer Institute,\n\n                                                  January 2, 1997.\n     Ms. Robin Haun-Mohamed,\n     Chief, Library Program Service,\n     U.S. Government Printing Office (SLLA), Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Haun-Mohamed: As you know, the Journal of the \n     National Cancer Institute has been privatized, and effective \n     January 1, 1997, ownership of the Journal will be transferred \n     from the National Cancer Institute to Oxford University \n     Press-USA, Inc.

HEELEY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with mixed \nemotions. I'm glad because a colleague is moving on to new \nopportunities, but I'm also saddened by the fact that the Senate, and \nin particular the Committee on Indian Affairs, is losing a great \nfriend, Steven Heeley.\n  Steve's work on native American issues goes back many years, to when \nhe started with Senator McCain as the deputy minority staff director \nand Counsel for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1989. He moved \nacross the Hill to the House of Representatives, where I first had the \npleasure of\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\nworking with him, when Steve served as the deputy counsel on Indian \naffairs for the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs under \nChairman George Miller. Later he became the counsel to the Subcommittee \non Native American Affairs of the Natural Resources Committee of the \nHouse. Steve returned to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 1995 \nto become Chairman McCain's staff director and chief counsel.\n  His lengthy list of accomplishments represents the kind of man Steve \nis: hard working and committed to Indian Country. Steve's work on \nenvironmental issues in Indian country includes the Clean Water and \nClean Air Act amendments, solid waste disposal, leaking underground \nstorage tanks and the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program \nAct. His broad range of knowledge was crucial in passing the Self-\nDetermination Act amendments, as well as self-governance legislation, \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act.\n  Steve's work to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, \nhis work with tribal courts and the Native American Graves Protection \nand Repatriation Act show his concern for native Americans and most \nimportant, our mutual heritage. The work that has been important to \nSteve was the work that was important to Indian people across this \ncountry. Much of his work, including reorganizing the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is not yet \ncomplete, but his mark will certainly be on the changes when they do \noccur.\n  Steve's work on behalf of Indian people goes back before his time \nhere in Washington. He served as the assistant general counsel for the \nGila River community in Arizona and was a staff attorney for the Four \nRivers Indian Legal Services Program at Gila River. Now, Steve is going \nback to Arizona, where I'm sure he's been missed, as we're going to \nmiss him here.\n  I would like to offer my personal thanks to Steve for the invaluable \nservice he has provided to me as I took over as Chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee. His wise counsel to both me and my staff has made a \ndifficult job more easy and has helped to make sure that the leadership \nSenator McCain brought to this committee will continue.\n  Steve has been an outstanding advocate, leader, and friend to Indian \ncountry. On behalf of all of us who have been lucky enough to work him, \nwe thank him, we wish him good luck, and we look forward to working \ntogether again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1731-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SALUTE TO THE BIG TEN CHAMPIONS MINNESOTA GOLDEN GOPHERS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today and I want to pay tribute to \nthe University of Minnesota basketball team, who last night clinched \ntheir first Big Ten title in 15 years.\n  As you know, the Golden Gophers defeated the Michigan Wolverines 55 \nto 54, in a hard-fought, come-from-behind victory. Down by four with \nunder a minute to play, the Gophers' confidence, determination, and \nfaith led them to victory. This is truly an accomplishment that all \nMinnesotans can be proud of. Under the leadership of coach Clem \nHaskins, the Gophers have shot, rebounded, and passed their way into \nthe national spotlight as a team to be taken seriously in the upcoming \nNCAA tournament.\n  With the great play of senior guard Bobby Jackson, junior guard Eric \nHarris, junior forward Sam Jacobson, and senior co-captain centers John \nThomas and Trevor Winter, along with the rest of the Big Ten \nchampionship team, the Golden Gophers have set a school record 25 \nvictories in a single season, with three regular season games to play. \nAmong the notable accomplishments this team has achieved have been \ntheir two victories over Michigan, an overtime victory over Indiana, \nand a season sweep over our border rival Iowa Hawkeyes. This team has \nbeen on a mission all year to gain respect, not only from the Big Ten \nbut also from the Nation, after having all its starters returning from \nlast year from a team that was not invited to play in the NCAA \ntournament. As you can see, these Golden Gophers took matters into \ntheir own hands and earned the qualifying bid from the NCAA by winning \nthe Big Ten title outright.\n  From the land of 10,000 frozen lakes, this Minnesota Golden Gopher \nbasketball team has provided warmth and excitement to fans statewide in \nan otherwise very cold and long Minnesota winter. Again, Mr. President, \nI want to congratulate Clem Haskins and his Big Ten championship team \nfrom the University of Minnesota, and wish them all the best in their \nfinal regular season games and when they go for it all in the upcoming \nNCAA tournament.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Does the Senator know where Clem Haskins got his training? \nWestern Kentucky University. He was also a coach at Western Kentucky \nUniversity. I am tickled to death that he gave such improvement to the \ngreat State of Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. So are we.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

and\n       Whereas, the commission thoroughly reviewed data and input \n     from all interested parties, including the Department of \n     Defense, which recommended Tobyhanna Army Depot for increased \n     mission responsibility; and\n       Whereas, in its final deliberations, the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Commission concurred with the \n     efficiency and productivity analyses of the Tobyhanna Army \n     Depot work force; and\n       Whereas, the commission issued a report to the President of \n     the United States on July 1, 1995, which recommended the \n     transfer of the ground communications-electronics workload \n     from the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, California, to the \n     Tobyhanna Army Depot; and\n       Whereas, in recommending that the McClellan Air Force Base, \n     Sacramento, California, should be closed, the commission \n     directed that its ground communications-electronics workload \n     transfer to Tobyhanna Army Depot; and\n       Whereas, this recommendation and others included in the \n     commission's 1995 report were accepted by the President, \n     submitted to the Congress of the United States and signed as \n     the Base Closure and Realignment Report of 1995 on July 13, \n     1995; and\n       Whereas, the commission's report indicated that the \n     Tobyhanna Army Depot can perform the ground communications-\n     electronics workload just as efficiently and more cost \n     effective than the Sacramento Air Logistics Center; and\n       Whereas, the Tobyhanna Army Depot has proven to be one of \n     the United States' most cost-effective installations; and\n       Whereas, the transfer of the ground communications-\n     electronics workload to the Tobyhanna Army Depot would \n     involve the movement of approximately 900 positions to the \n     Tobyhanna Army Depot; and\n       Whereas, these 900 positions constitute a significant staff \n     complement for the Tobyhanna Army Depot, although these 900 \n     positions represent less than 10% of the total complement \n     based at the Sacramento Air Logistics Center; and\n       Whereas, the Tobyhanna Army Depot is northeastern \n     Pennsylvania's largest employer, and the transfer of these \n     900 positions would represent an important influx to the \n     regional economy; and\n       Whereas, the Tobyhanna Army Depot has the capacity, \n     capability and skills necessary to immediately perform a \n     significant portion of the Sacramento Air Logistics Center's \n     ground communications-electronics workload; and\n       Whereas, the Base Closure and Realignment Report of 1995 \n     required that the President of the United States initiative \n     workload transfers no later than July 13, 1997, and complete \n     those transfers no later than July 13, 2001; and\n       Whereas, at the recommendation of the Secretary of Defense, \n     the President of the United States of America accepted these \n     decisions; and\n       Whereas, the transfer of the 900 ground communications-\n     electronics positions to Tobyhanna Army Depot has not been \n     initiated, even though this transfer was approved by the \n     President of the United States and shown to be in the \n     interests of cost-effectiveness and military efficiency; and\n       Whereas, it is apparent that leaders in the state of \n     California seek to delay or prevent the movement of the \n     ground communications-electronics workload to Tobyhanna; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been severely \n     impacted by the Department of Defense base closure process in \n     each round from 1988 to 1996 and has not sought special \n     protection from these impacts; and\n       Whereas, these efforts by the elected officials of \n     California will violate the intention of the 1995 Defense \n     Base Closure and Realignment Commission, negate annual \n     savings of $160 million and impact the readiness of the \n     nation's armed forces; Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania memorialize the President of the United States \n     to effect the immediate transfer of the ground \n     communications-electronics workload from the Sacramento Air \n     Logistics Center to the Tobyhanna Army Depot; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-35.

A bill to prohibit the use of Federal funds for human cloning \nresearch; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                          RESEARCH LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a measure on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Byrd which would \nprohibit permanently the use of Federal funds for human cloning \nresearch. I am sure most Americans by now have heard about the \nsuccessful cloning of Dolly, the sheep, by Scottish scientists. Many \npeople are now asking can similar techniques be used to clone a human \nbeing? Something that was once thought to be only science fiction is \nnow close to being a reality.\n  With the legislation I introduce today, I intend to make sure that \nhuman cloning stays within the realm of science fiction and does not \nbecome a reality. The bill that I am introducing with my colleagues \ntoday will place a permanent ban on Federal funding for human cloning \nor human cloning research. We must send a clear signal: Human cloning \nis something we cannot and should not tolerate. This type of research \non humans is morally reprehensible. We should not be creating human \nbeings for spare parts or as replacements. Moreover, a National \nInstitutes of Health human embryo panel noted, ``allowing society to \ncreate genetically identical persons would devalue human life by \nundermining the individuality of human beings.''\n  In a September 1994 report of the Human Embryo Research Panel, the \nheading is, ``Research Considered Unacceptable for Federal Funding.'' \nIt said:\n\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\n\n       Four ethical considerations entered into the deliberations \n     of the panel as it determined what types of research were \n     unacceptable for Federal funding: The potential adverse \n     consequences of the research for children, women and men; the \n     respect due the reimplantation embryo; concern for public \n     sensitivities in highly controversial research proposals, and \n     concern for the meaning of humanness, parenthood, and the \n     successions of generations.\n\n  The President has said we should study the issue. President Clinton \nhas asked a Federal bioethicist board to consider the implications of \nthis research and report back to him within 90 days. I do not think we \nneed to study this. I think we can save the board some effort because \nthe President's own administration has concluded that human cloning was \n``research considered unacceptable for Federal funding.'' There are \nsome aspects of life which simply ought to be off limits to science.\n  I think it will be helpful to go through some of the ethical \nconsiderations the board looked at. First, they asked: Is it ethical to \ncreate genetically identical individuals who can be born at different \ntimes? Is it ethical to store a frozen human embryo that is genetically \nidentical to a born child in order to serve as a later source for organ \nand tissue transplantation; thus treating humans as spare parts? Is it \nethical to create a genetically identical child as a replacement in \ncase the first child dies?\n  Again, these are just a sample of the ethical questions the issue \nposes.\n  The board concluded the analysis by stating:\n\n       There are broad moral concerns about the deliberate \n     duplication of an individual genome. The notion of cloning an \n     existing human being or of making ``carbon copies'' of an \n     existing embryo appears repugnant to members of the public. \n     Many Members of the panel share this view and see no \n     justification for Federal funding of such research.\n\n  I also should point out an important distinction with this bill. It \nis narrowly drafted so that it only affects human cloning research.

But we can draw a \nclear line here. For plants and animals, it makes sense to clone your \nspecimens to improve human health and human well-being. But when we are \ntalking about creating an entire human being, identical to another, we \nare talking about playing God, and that is where we must draw the line.\n  I note, the Vatican and leading ethicists throughout the country have \ncalled for a ban on human cloning and human cloning research.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of those ethicists and \nscientists be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dr. Ted Cicero, Vice Chancellor for Research at Washington \n     University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n       Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a Jesuit priest and a geneticist at \n     Loyola University in Illinois.\n       Arthur Caplan, head of the Center for Bioethics at the \n     University of Pennsylvania.\n       Dr. Harmon Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at Duke \n     University.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Glenn and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 369. A bill to amend section 1128B of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the criminal penalty for fraudulent disposition of assets in \norder to obtain medicaid benefits added by section 217 of the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n     HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to introduce \nlegislation that will repeal section 217 of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]. As enacted last year, this \nprovision for the first time creates Federal criminal penalties for \nelders who transfer their assets and who subsequently apply for \nMedicaid but are deemed ineligible for nursing home benefits.\n  I believe the goal to stop fraud and abuse in the Medicaid Program is \nlaudable and must be pursued. However, there is a growing consensus \nthat section 217 is a vague, unenforceable, criminal sanction \nmisdirected at the elderly. It is unduly threatening to the Nation's \nsenior citizens. We are sending the wrong message by implying there is \nsomething wrong or illegal with obtaining sound financial advice and \nestate planning to legitimately protect the assets that senior citizens \nhave spent a lifetime accruing.\n  During a recent hearing before the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, on the implementation of HIPAA, several concerns were raised \nabout this issue. Ms. Gail Shearer, the director of health policy \nanalysis of the Consumers Union, testified that section 217 was \n``leading to considerable alarm among seniors'' and that she was \n``deeply troubled by the prospect of HIPAA leading to the transfer of \nelderly nursing home residents from their nursing home to prison.''\n  At that same hearing, Mr. Bruce Vladek, the administrator of the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, pointed out that there is no \nevidence that large numbers of the elderly are impoverishing themselves \nto become Medicaid eligible. He expressed his belief that a few people \ndoing something egregious can create the perception of a widespread \nproblem. It is especially unclear how pervasive this practice is, \nparticularly in light of actions already taken by Congress to curb \nthese asset transfers.\n  Repeal of section 217 would not affect several other restrictions now \non the books designed to close loopholes and stop the inappropriate \ntransfer of assets. People found to have transferred nonexempt assets \nwithin a look-back period are determined ineligible and denied Medicaid \nnursing home assistance for the period over which their assets would \nhave paid. The look-back period for asset transfers is 36 months, with \na 60-month period for trusts. States are also required to establish \nestate recovery programs to compensate for nursing home services paid \nfor by the Medicaid Program.\n  There is no systematic study that has determined or recommended that \nthe addition of criminal sanctions to the penalties which already exist \nare necessary to address inappropriate asset transfers by the elderly. \nIn the absence of a demonstrated need for criminal penalties, we \nbelieve that section 217 holds the potential to do more harm than good.\n  No one really wants to send Granny to jail. In fact, it has been \nreported that the intended targets of section 217 are those who have \ncreated a cottage industry, and made substantial sums of money, from \nadvising the elderly on how to transfer their assets to become Medicaid \neligible. Ironically, section 217 has had the opposite effect. Recent \nnewspaper ads placed by these advisers from Portland, ME, to Phoenix, \nAZ, now use this very law to drum up business. The bold-print headlines \nof these ads read:\n\n       Sneaky New Law Buried in the Health Insurance Bill Can Put \n     Unsuspecting Seniors and Retirees Behind Bars!, and You Only \n     Have Until December 31st, 1996, To Avoid Making the Mistake \n     That Could Toss You in Jail . . . Congress' Sneaky New Law Is \n     the Most Vicious Attack on Retirees Yet!\n\n  Mr. President, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid Program must not be \ntolerated, and taxpayers should not have to pay nursing home bills for \npersons who have the wherewithal to pay for their own care. But neither \nshould confusing, unenforceable laws be in place that impose Federal \ncriminal penalties on elderly individuals where there is no clear \nunderstanding of what does and what does not constitute a criminal \nactivity.\n  Organizations urging repeal of the provision include: the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, the Alzheimer's Association, the \nLeadership Council on Aging--a group of more than 40 national \norganizations in the field of aging--and the American Bar Association.\n  I believe that we in the Congress owe it to our senior citizens to \nstop their needless anxiety over this misdirected, confusing law. We \nneed to repeal section 217. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nrepealing this unnecessary and unworkable law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR FRAUDULENT \n                   DISPOSITION OF ASSETS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN \n                   MEDICAID BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Section 1128B(a) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(a)), as amended by section 217 of the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-191; 110 Stat. 2008), is amended--\n       (1) by adding ``or'' at the end of paragraph (4);\n       (2) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (5) and \n     inserting a comma; and\n       (3) by striking paragraph (6).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     take effect as if included in the enactment of the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-191; 110 Stat. 1936).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this legislation and I am honored to join him on it. Our \nbill repeals the criminal penalties enacted last year for disposing of \nassets in order to obtain Medicaid benefits.\n  We all agree that Medicaid must be free of fraud and abuse. No one \nshould be able to game the system by giving away their assets just to \nqualify for Medicaid, a program intended to help the truly needy.\n  The criminal penalties enacted last year was a mistake and should \nnever have been enacted. They are poorly drafted, and will have \nunintended consequences that penalize senior citizens unfairly. Indeed, \nthis provision could frighten the most needy elderly away from seeking \nthe care they need, while doing little to deter and punish those who \ndefraud the system.\n  No serious study has defined abusive transfers of assets as a \nsignificant problem, or recommended criminalizing an action that is \nalready prohibited and penalized in other ways. If middle and upper \nincome families are transferring assets to qualify for Medicaid, it \nshould be the topic of congressional hearings and investigation, so \nthat we can evaluate the scope of the problem and develop an \nappropriate response. In the meantime, seniors should not be terrorized \nwith threats of jail merely for seeking nursing home care.\n  The current debate over this issue reveals a much larger problem--the \nneed for better coverage of long-term care, so that those requiring \nlong nursing home stays don't have to sacrifice their life savings to \npay for their care.\n  There is broad bipartisan support in Congress for repeal of this \nprovision. The White House supports repeal. Advocacy groups for the \nelderly support repeal. I urge Congress to act quickly on this \nlegislation, and provide peace of mind to senior citizens across the \ncountry who feel unfairly threatened by current law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 370. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increased Medicare reimbursement for nurse practitioners \nand clinical nurse specialists to increase the delivery of health \nservices in health professional shortage areas, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       THE PRIMARY CARE HEALTH PRACTITIONER INCENTIVE ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Hollings, I am introducing \ntwo bills. If enacted, these bills would increase access to primary \ncare for Medicare beneficiaries in rural and inner-city communities. \nThe Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act of 1997 would reform \nMedicare reimbursement to nurse practitioners [NP's] and clinical nurse \nspecialists [CNS's]. The Physician Assistant Incentive Act of 1997 \nwould reform Medicare reimbursement for physician assistants. We \nintroduced these bills in the last three Congresses. We are \nreintroducing them today to improve access to primary care services for \nMedicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural and underserved areas. \nThis legislation would reform Medicare policies which, under certain \ncircumstances, restrict reimbursement for services delivered by these \nproviders. Similar measures are included in the President's Medicare \nproposal and were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  The Medicare Program currently covers the services of these \npractitioners. However, payment levels vary depending on treatment \nsettings and geographic area. In most cases, reimbursement may not be \nmade directly to the nonphysician provider. Rather, it must be made to \nthe employer of the provider, often a physician. The legislation \nauthorizing these different reimbursement arrangements was passed in an \nincremental fashion over the years.\n  The Medicare law, which authorizes reimbursement of these providers, \nis also inconsistent with State law in many cases. For instance, in \nIowa, State law requires nonphysicians to practice with either a \nsupervising physician or a collaborating physician. However, under Iowa \nlaw, the supervising physician need not be physically present in the \nsame facility as the nonphysician practitioner and, in many instances, \ncan be located in a different site from that of the nonphysician \npractitioner he or she is supervising.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare policy will not recognize such relationships. \nInstead, the law requires that the physician be present in the same \nbuilding as the nonphysician practitioner in order for the services of \nthese nonphysician providers to be reimbursed. This is known as the \nincident to provision, referring to services that are provided incident \nto a physician's services.\n  This has created a problem in Iowa, Mr. President. In many parts of \nmy State, clinics have been established using nonphysician \npractitioners, particularly physician assistants, to provide primary \nhealth care services in communities that are unable to recruit a \nphysician. The presence of these practitioners insures that primary \nhealth care services will be available to the community. Iowa's \nMedicare carrier has strictly interpreted the incident to requirement \nof Medicare law as requiring the physical presence of a supervising \nphysician in places where physician assistants practice. This has \ncaused many of the clinics using physician assistants to close, and \nthus has deprived the community of primary health care services.\n  Mr. President, in 1995 the Iowa Hospital Association suggested a \nnumber of ways to improve access and cost effectiveness in the Medicare \nProgram. One of their suggestions was that this incident to restriction \nbe relaxed. They said:\n\n       In rural Iowa, most physicians are organized in solo or \n     small group practices. Physician assistants are used to \n     augment these practices. With emergency room coverage \n     requirements, absences due to vacation, continuing education \n     or illness and office hours in satellite clinics, there are \n     instances on a monthly basis where the physician assistant is \n     providing care to patients without a physician in the clinic. \n     Medicare patients in the physician clinic where the physician \n     assistant is located have to either wait for the physician to \n     return from the emergency room or care is provided without \n     this provision.\n\n  If enacted, this legislation would establish a more uniform payment \npolicy for these providers. It would authorize reimbursement of their \nservices as long as they were practicing within State law and their \nprofessional scope of practice. It calls for reimbursement of these \nprovider groups at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule for \nservices they provide in all treatment settings and in all geographic \nareas. Where it is permitted under State law, reimbursement would be \nauthorized even if these nonphysician providers are not under the \ndirect, physical supervision of a physician.\n  Currently, the services of these nonphysician practitioners are paid \nat 100 percent of the physician's rate when provided ``incident to'' a \nphysician's services. If enacted, this legislation would discontinue \nthis ``incident to'' policy. Medicare reimbursement would now be \nprovided directly to the nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists and it would be provided to the employer of the physician \nassistant. These bills also call for a 10-percent bonus payment when \nthese practitioners work in health professional shortage areas \n[HPSA's]. Senator Conrad and I believe these provisions will encourage \nnonphysician practitioners to relocate in areas in need of health care \nservices.\n  Mr. President, legislation closely paralleling these bills we are \nintroducing today is being introduced this week in the House by \nRepresentatives Nancy\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\nJohnson and Ed Towns. In addition, these provisions are included in the \nPresident's Medicare proposal. Historically, this legislation has \nreceived bipartisan support in both Houses. Comparable legislation was \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, as well as several other \nhealth care measures in previous Congresses. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Conrad and \nGrassley in introducing the Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive \nAct of 1997. Today I specifically want to address the provision that \nwould allow for direct Medicare reimbursement for services provided by \nnurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists regardless of \ngeographic location. For many years we have been trying to pass \nlegislation that would allow these health care providers in urban \nsettings the same direct Medicare reimbursement as those in a rural \nsetting, and I am hopeful that this is the year it will actually be \nenacted.\n  Currently, nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists may \ntreat Medicare patients without a physician present if they practice in \na rural setting or in a long-term care facility. I believe that it is \ntime for this antiquated restraint to practice to be removed so that \nhealth care choices may be improved and increased for all Medicare \npatients. If we are to have any hope of providing adequate care with \nhuge reductions in both Medicare and Medicaid, it is essential that \nservice be provided by the least costly provider of quality care. We \nsimply cannot afford to ignore the quality care of which nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists have proven they are \ncapable.\n  I would also like to point out that many times there is a discrepancy \nin the designation of rural and urban areas. In my home State of South \nCarolina, as in other States, a number of the areas listed as urban \nare, in reality, rural areas. Medicare patients in these areas are \nunable to receive home visits or utilize local community satellite \noffices staffed with nurse practitioners. Rather, they are required to \ntravel miles to see a physician. As a result, many patients forgo \npreventive health care and wait to seek care until they become so ill \nthat they must be hospitalized or they are forced to seek care in more \nexpensive emergency rooms. Not only is access to physicians more \nlimited, but their fees for services are usually higher as well. Recent \nfigures published by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners \nestimate a cost savings of greater than $54 million per year if nurse \npractitioners were utilized appropriately in the provision of Medicare \nservices in ambulatory care settings.\n  The primary objective of nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists is to provide routine care, manage chronic conditions, \npromote preventive health care, and make medical care more accessible \nand less expensive. Nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists \nhave proven that they are able to provide high-quality, cost-effective \nprimary care in all settings in which they provide services. It is \nfoolish to restrict their ability to provide primary care services to \nthe elderly based on setting or geographic location, and I urge your \nconsideration and the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 371. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for increased medicare reimbursement for physician assistants, \nto increase the delivery of health services in health professional \nshortage areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT INCENTIVE ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I are again \nintroducing legislation to improve Medicare reimbursement policy for \nnurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician \nassistants. The Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act and the \nPhysician Assistant Incentive Act of 1997 are very similar to S. 864 \nand S. 863, which we introduced in the 104th Congress. This legislation \npassed both Houses as part of reconciliation in 1995. I am very hopeful \nthat this bipartisan legislation will garner widespread support and be \nsigned into law as part of a Medicare reform bill this year.\n  We believe our legislation will help all Americans by making the best \npossible use of primary care providers who play a vital role in our \nhealth care delivery infrastructure. Throughout the country, nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants have \nthe skills to provide needed primary care services. This is \nparticularly important in rural and underserved areas that have \nshortages of physicians.\n  In recent years, our Nation's health care system has put a renewed \nemphasis on the use of primary care and wellness. Nurse practitioners, \nphysician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists are uniquely \npositioned to provide this care. Nurse practitioners are registered \nnurses with advanced education and clinical training, often in a \nspecialty area such as geriatrics or women's health. Nearly half of the \nNation's 25,000 nurse practitioners have master's degrees. Clinical \nnurse specialists are required to have master's degrees and usually \nwork in teritary care settings such as cardiac care. Many, however, \nalso work in primary care. Physician assistants receive an average of 2 \nyears of physician-supervised clinical training and classroom \ninstruction and work in all setting providing diagnostic, therapeutic, \nand preventive care services. Each of these providers work with \nphysicians in varying degrees usually in consultation.\n  Within their areas of competence, these health care providers deliver \ncare of exceptional quality. These practitioners play a vital role in \ncommunities that cannot support a physician but can afford a nurse \npractitioner or physician assistant; historically, these providers have \nbeen willing to move to both rural and inner-city areas that are \nunderserved by health care providers. In fact, there are 50 communities \nin North Dakota that are taking advantage of the services provided by \nthese care givers. Unfortunately, unless we make changes in our Federal \nreimbursement scheme, many areas of the country will not be able to \nbenefit from these needed services.\n  Current Medicare reimbursement rules were developed in an ad hoc \nfashion; as a result, they are inconsistent, incoherent, and nearly \ninexplicable. Current law provides reimbursement for advanced practice \nnurses in rural settings. But if the same patient sees the same nurse \npractitioner in a satellite clinic in an equally rural community that \nhappens to be within an MSA county, reimbursement becomes subject to \nthe ``incident to'' rule that HCFA has interpreted to require the \nphysical presence of a physician in the building.\n  In rural North Dakota and in rural communities throughout the \ncountry, that scenario is often inconsistent with the realities of \nhealth care delivery. Doctors in these areas often rotate between \nseveral clinics in a region that is staffed on a full-time basis by a \nphysician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other provider. This allows \nphysicians to cover a wider area and affords more rural residents \naccess to basic primary care services. Current Medicare rules work \nagainst this, however. If a Medicare patient requires care when a \nphysician is away at another clinic or out on an emergency call, the \nphysician assistant or other provider will not be reimbursed by \nMedicare for the same care that would have been paid for if a physician \nwas in the next room.\n  Moreover, if the nurse practitioner crosses the street from a free-\nstanding clinic to a hospital-affiliated outpatient clinic, the \nreimbursement rules change once again. Physician assistants are subject \nto an equally bewildering set of reimbursement rules that serve to \nprevent their effective use by the Medicare Program.\n  Other complications also cause problems. State laws are often \ninconsistent with the Medicare requirements. In North Dakota, care \nprovided by a physician assistant is reimbursed even if a physician is \nnot present. Across the country, there also are a wide variety of \npayment mechanisms that result in reimbursement variations in different \nsettings and among different providers. The Office of Technology \nAssessment, the Physician Payment Review Commission, and these \nproviders themselves have all expressed the need for consistency and \nsensibility in a reimbursement system that acknowledges\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nthe reality of today's medical marketplace. Our colleagues shared those \nsentiments in 1995 by passing this legislation in both Houses.\n  The legislation Senator Grassley and I are introducing today will \nprovide each of these groups with reimbursement at 85 percent of the \nphysician fee schedule. They will also provide a bonus payment to those \nproviders who choose to practice in areas designated as Health \nProfessional Shortage Areas [HPSA's]. The health care access problems \nfaced by residents of these communities could be dramatically improved \nthrough the use of this special class of primary care providers. \nFinally, our legislation will ensure that a nurse practitioner who \ncares for a patient will get paid directly for that service.\n  This legislation offers an example how Medicare can and should \nincrease access to care by promoting the use of cost-effective \nproviders to a much higher degree without compromising the quality of \ncare that older Americans receive. There was a clear agreement on these \nissues in the 104th Congress, and we urge our Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues to continue to support this legislation in the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 372. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a 5-year reinstatement of the Medicare-dependent, small, \nrural hospital payment provisions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       THE MEDICARE DEPENDENT HOSPITALS PROGRAM REINSTATEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which would \nreinstate the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program.\n  This program expired in October 1994. As its title implied, the \nhospitals it helped were those which were very dependent on Medicare \nreimbursement. These were small--100 beds or less--rural hospitals with \nnot less than 60 percent of total discharges or with 60 percent of \ntotal inpatient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. The \nprogram enabled the hospitals in question to choose the most favorable \nof three reimbursement methods.\n  The program was extended, and phased out down to October 1994, in the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That act retained the choice \nof the three original reimbursement methods. But it reduced the \nreimbursement available from those original computation methods by 50 \npercent.\n  My legislation would not extend the program as it was originally \nenacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Rather, it \nwould reinstate for 5 years the provisions contained in the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993. It would not have retroactive \neffect, however. The program would be revived for fiscal year 1998, and \nwould terminate at the end of fiscal year 2002.\n  As I noted above, the hospitals which would benefit from this program \nare small, rural hospitals providing an essential point of access to \nhospital and hospital-based services in rural areas and small towns. \nObviously, if we lose these hospitals, we will also have a hard time \nkeeping physicians in those communities.\n  Mr. President, 44, or 36 percent, of Iowa's 122 community hospitals \nqualified to participate in this program in 1994, and 29, or 24 \npercent, chose to participate. I believe that this was the largest \nnumber of such hospitals of any State.\n  For these hospitals, the percentage of all inpatient days \nattributable to Medicare patients was 77.4 percent in 1994, and \nMedicare discharges represented 65.5 percent of total discharges. \nAcross all Iowa hospitals, the Association of Iowa Hospitals and Health \nSystems indicates that the Medicare share of inpatient days and \ndischarges has increased in recent years, as non-Medicare admissions \nhave dropped. As a result, it is likely that the program will provide a \nlifeline for even more Iowa hospitals now than in 1994.\n  The expiration of the program has had a devastating effect on many of \nthese hospitals, including a number with negative operating margins. \nThe bottom line is that many of these hospitals have had, and will \nhave, a very difficult time continuing to exist without the Medicare-\nDependent Hospital Program.\n  Mr. President, I am also going to continue to work for a limited \nservice rural hospital bill. This bill will essentially extend the \nEACH/RPCH Program--the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural \nPrimary Care Hospital Program--to all the States.\n  Taken together, these two pieces of legislation will allow the \nsmaller hospitals in Iowa--and throughout America--to modify their \nmissions in a deliberate and nondisruptive way, and to continue to \nprovide the health care services essential to their \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 373.

Mr. President, I introduce the Combat Veterans \nMedical Equity Act of 1997, legislation which will serve to codify \nAmerica's obligation to provide for the medical needs of our combat-\nwounded veterans.\n  Although we have long recognized the combat-wounded vet to be among \nour most deserving veterans, and although we have long distinguished \nthe sacrifices of these veterans by awarding the Purple Heart Medal, \nremarkably, there is nothing in current law that stipulates an \nentitlement to health care based upon this physical sacrifice. In fact, \nI believe most Americans would be surprised to learn that a combat-\nwounded Purple Heart recipient could be denied services for which a \nnoncombat veteran, with a non-service-connected disability, would be \neligible. This legislation would seek to remedy that situation.\n  Specifically, this bill establishes eligibility for VA hospital care \nand medical services based upon the award of the Purple Heart Medal. It \nalso gives Purple Heart recipients an enrollment priority on par with \nformer prisoners of war and veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities rated between 10 and 20 percent.\n  Mr. President, as a Vietnam veteran who has been privileged to lead \nmarines in combat, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices made by all of \nour men and women in uniform. At the same time, in the face of tighter \nbudgets and greater competition for services, I believe strongly that \nCongress should ensure equity in the disbursing of medical services for \nour most deserving of veterans--the combat wounded. These veterans, who \nhave shed their blood to keep our country safe and free, deserve no \nless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrestore the link between the maximum amount of earnings by blind \nindividuals permitted without demonstrating ability to engage in \nsubstantial gainful activity and the exempt amount permitted in \ndetermining excess earnings under the earnings test; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                 THE BLIND PERSONS EARNINGS EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nDodd, to introduce an important piece of legislation which would have a \ntremendous impact on the lives of many blind people. Our bill restores \nthe 20-year link between blind people and senior citizens in regard to \nthe Social Security earnings limit which has helped many blind people \nbecome self-sufficient and productive.\n  Unfortunately, by passing the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act \nlast year, Congress broke the longstanding linkage in the treatment of \nblind people and seniors under Social Security, which resulted in \nallowing the earnings limit to be raised for seniors only and did not \ngive blind people the same opportunity to increase their earnings \nwithout penalizing their Social Security benefits.\n  My intent when I sponsored the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act \nwas not to permanently break the link between blind people and the \nsenior population. Last year, time constraints and fiscal \nconsiderations forced me to focus solely on raising the unfair and \nburdensome earnings limit for seniors. I am happy to say that the \nSenior Citizens Freedom to Work Act became law last year, and the \nearnings exemption for seniors is being raised in annual increments \nuntil it reaches $30,000 in the year 2002. This law is allowing \nmillions of seniors to make their lives better and continue \ncontributing to society as productive workers.\n  We now should work in the spirit of fairness to ensure that this same \nopportunity is given to the blind population. We should provide blind \npeople the opportunity to be productive and make it on their own. We \nshould not continue policies which discourage these individuals from \nworking and contributing to society.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Dodd, will \nrestore the traditional linkage between seniors and blind people and \nallow them the same consideration as seniors in regard to the Social \nSecurity earnings test. This bill would reunite the earnings exemption \namount for blind people with the exemption amount for senior citizens. \nIf we do not reinstate this link, blind people will be restricted to \nearning $14,400 in the year 2002 in order to protect their Social \nSecurity benefits, compared to the $30,000 which seniors will be \npermitted to earn.\n  There are very strong and convincing arguments in favor of \nreestablishing the link between these two groups and increasing the \nearnings limit for blind people.\n\n  First, the earnings test treatment of our blind and senior \npopulations has historically been identical. Since 1977, blind people \nand senior citizens have\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nshared the identical earnings exemption threshold under title II of the \nSocial Security Act. Now, senior citizens will be given greater \nopportunity to increase their earnings without having their Social \nSecurity benefits being penalized; the blind, however, will not have \nthe same opportunity.\n  The Social Security earnings test imposes as great a work \ndisincentive for blind people as it does for senior citizens. In fact, \nthe earnings test probably provides a greater aggregate disincentive \nfor blind individuals since many blind beneficiaries are of working \nage--18-65--and are capable of productive work.\n  Blindness is often associated with adverse social and economic \nconsequences. It is often tremendously difficult for blind individuals \nto find sustained employment or any employment at all, but they do want \nto work. They take great pride in being able to work and becoming \nproductive members of society. By linking the blind with seniors in \n1977, Congress provided a great deal of hope and incentive for blind \npeople in this country to enter the work force. Now, we are taking that \nhope away from them by not allowing them the same opportunity to \nincrease their earnings as senior citizens.\n  Blind people are likely to respond favorably to an increase in the \nearnings test by working more, which will increase their tax payments \nand their purchasing power and allow the blind to make a greater \ncontribution to the general economy. In addition, encouraging the blind \nto work and allowing them to work more without being penalized would \nbring additional revenue into the Social Security trust funds. In \nshort, restoring the link between blind people and senior citizens for \ntreatment of Social Security benefits would help many blind people \nbecome self sufficient, productive members of society.\n  I want to stress that it was always my intent that the link between \nblind and senior populations would only be temporarily broken. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important measure to \nrestore fair and equitable treatment for our blind citizens and to give \nthe blind community increased financial independence. Our Nation would \nbe better served if we restore the work incentive equality provision \nfor the blind and provide them with the same freedom, opportunities and \nfairness as our Nation's seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that numerous letters of support from various \ncommunity groups and state organizations be included as a part of the \nRecord. In addition, I would like to thank the many chapters of the \nNational Federation of the Blind from throughout the country who have \nsent letters of support for this important piece of legislation \nincluding the Arizona Chapter, Idaho Western Chapter, Minnesota, \nAlabama, South Carolina, Shoreline Chapter of Connecticut, Iowa, Idaho, \nMinnesota's Metro Chapter, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, New York, \nUtah, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Idaho s Elmore \nCounty, and the Pend Oreille Chapter of Idaho.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            National Industries for the Blind,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 21, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     241 Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of National Industries for \n     the Blind and our 119 associated industries in 38 states, \n     that employ over 5,300 people who are blind, I vigorously \n     endorse your proposed legislation to amend title II of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       This legislation to re-institute the linkage, between \n     people who are blind and senior citizens, if passed, will \n     allow people who are blind to strive for full employment.\n       Please let us know how NIB can be of further assistance to \n     you as you seek support of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judith D.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Rehabilitation \n     Advisory Council for the Blind in Minnesota, I wish to \n     express our strong support for the restoration of the \n     earnings limits linkage under the Social Security Act between \n     the blind and age 65 retirees. It is my understanding that \n     you will be introducing a bill to achieve this restoration. \n     We commend you for your willingness to exercise leadership on \n     behalf of blind people who want to work and participate \n     actively and productively in society. We support your bill.\n       The Social Security earnings limit for the blind is \n     presently set at $12,000 per year. As I am sure you are \n     aware, this is a powerful disincentive for blind people to \n     leave the Social Security rolls and become self-supporting \n     citizens. This barrier to self-support will become even more \n     insurmountable as the gap between the blind and senior \n     citizens widens. It is vital, therefore, that the blind \n     achieve parity with age 65 retirees insofar as earnings \n     limits under the Social Security Act are concerned. Using the \n     figures that apply to senior citizens, this means raising the \n     earnings limit for the blind to $30,000 per year by the year \n     2002.\n       Thank you for recognizing the problem and taking forthright \n     action to deal with it.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                                 Curtis Chong,\n\n                              Chairperson, Rehabilitation Advisory\n     Council for the Blind.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Louisiana Center for the Blind,\n\n                                    Ruston, LA, February 21, 1997.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Since 1985, the Louisiana Center for \n     the Blind has provided training and job placement services \n     for hundreds of blind adults throughout the country. One of \n     our primary goals is to help blind persons become employed so \n     that they can become productive, tax-paying citizens. Over \n     the past twelve years, we have observed that one of the main \n     disincentives for employment is the earnings limit under \n     Social Security Disability Insurance.\n       As the director of the Louisiana Center for the Blind, I \n     want to express my strong support for your bill which would \n     restore the linkage between the blind and retirees for the \n     earnings limit under the Social Security Act. Since the \n     unemployment rate among the blind is a staggering 70%, I \n     firmly believe that your bill will decrease this statistic by \n     helping blind Americans enter the workforce.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the nation's blind.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joanne Wilson,\n                                                         Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                         National Council of State\n\n\n                                 Agencies for the Blind, Inc.,\n\n                                    Boston, MA, February 25, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Please accept this letter of support \n     and applause from the National Council of State Agencies for \n     the Blind as a testimony to the reality that your effort to \n     reestablish the link for Blind SSDI recipients to the \n     earnings limits of persons who are elderly is both timely and \n     well grounded as a benefit to the national economy.\n       There is no question in the view of this organization which \n     has a primary role of assisting blind persons to return to \n     work, that reestablishment of the linkage would positively \n     impact the decision of many persons to do so. Removing the \n     disincentive of lower earnings before a total cut-off of \n     benefits and reestablishing the linkage of a higher earnings \n     limit would afford those persons capable of rejoining the \n     national work force with the powerful personal reason to do \n     so through sustained economic security.\n       Please be assured of the support and any assistance you may \n     require of this organization as you take on this progressive \n     and needed challenge to restore the earnings linkage. I may \n     be reached at the above address or by phoning (617)-727-5550 \n     extension 4503 in the event you wish to communicate further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles H.

This bill \n     will go a long way to improving employment opportunities for \n     blind people, who struggle to enter and remain in the work \n     force. In the words of Jim Olsen, a member of the American \n     Council of the Blind of Minnesota, ``restoring the linkage \n     will enable blind people to continue to work, pay taxes, and \n     believe in the American spirit of the work ethic.''\n       Our members are urging their Senators to support your bill \n     to restore linkage, and we are keeping them informed of your \n     efforts on their behalf. Please let me know how I can be of \n     assistance in this matter.\n       Thank you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Julie H.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to express our strong \n     support for your bill to restore the linkage of earnings \n     limits under the Social Security Act which apply to age 65 \n     retirees and blind people of any age. The\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\n     position of the National Federation of the Blind on this \n     matter is best expressed in a resolution (copy attached) \n     which was unanimously adopted at our 1996 National \n     Convention.\n       Your leadership on behalf of beneficiaries who want to \n     contribute to society by working has earned our utmost \n     respect. The Social Security earnings limit, presently at \n     $12,000 annually, is the greatest barrier to self-support for \n     blind people. In fact, I would say that the single factor of \n     the earnings limit is more destructive to the self-support \n     efforts of blind people than any other social condition.\n       By raising the earnings exemption threshold for blind \n     people to $30,000 beginning in 2002, your bill would \n     substantially remove any disincentive to work for blind \n     people. For that reason, we applaud your efforts and pledge \n     our full support.\n       Although I think that restoring the linkage is all right \n     for the present, I believe that congress should totally \n     eliminate the earnings limit and place us in the same \n     classification as those 70 and over, this would not only \n     provide a significant work incentive, but would also \n     eliminate the cumbersome process of reporting both our \n     earnings and impairment related work related expenses now \n     required under the law. This has caused problems because of \n     the confusion among Social Security Administration employees \n     some of whom are unaware of the special provisions for blind \n     persons.\n       I personally have had my earnings continuously started and \n     stopped since 1991 not because of anything I have done that \n     disqualifies me from receiving them, but due to the confusion \n     of S.S.A. personnel. I feel that classifying blind persons \n     the same as those 70 and over would ultimately provide an \n     even better work incentive than the restoration of the \n     linkage.\n       Thank you for responding to the need.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Harvey Heagy.\n         Connecticut Community Advocates, Specialized Educational \n           Services,\n                                 Westbrook, CT, February 21, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Attention: Sonya Sotak\n       Dear Senator McCain: As a member of the CT. C.A.S.E.S., I \n     have counseled many blind individuals who want to work. I \n     have compared their potential entry level salary to their \n     Social Security benefits. Too often, these work-bound blind \n     citizens realize that after taxes and work expenses, their \n     new job will not replace or equal their lost disability \n     benefits. Few blind people can afford to sacrifice income, \n     and they must remain idle in order to receive a guaranteed \n     monthly check. The chance to work, earn, pay taxes, and \n     become a contributing member of our society is a valid goal \n     for all Americans; but with the existing law under title II \n     of the Social Security Act, it is an unobtainable goal for \n     blind people.\n       However, Senator McCain, your leadership and foresight in \n     introducing a bill to restore the linkage of earnings limits \n     under the Social Security Act for seniors and the blind will \n     enable both groups to work. In addition, they will be able to \n     join the work-force without fear. Your bill will restore \n     fairness, equity, and hope for the working age blind person. \n     The blind want to work and with your bill they will work. The \n     staff of CT. C.A.S.E.S. and clients would like to convey our \n     strong support and appreciation for your bill to restore the \n     linkage of earnings limit under the Social Security Act which \n     applies to retirees and blind people of any age.\n       I know from personal experience, just how strict the \n     earnings limit is for blind people who attempt to work. My \n     earnings exceeded the exempt amount and the entire sum paid \n     to the primary beneficiary, myself, and my dependents was \n     abruptly withdrawn. After subtracting the travel expenses \n     etcetera, from the salary I obtained from being employed, it \n     was quite evident that my real earnings were much less than \n     my monthly disability benefits. At present many blind people \n     will lose financially by going to work but with the enactment \n     of your bill, restoring the linkage, they will not lose. \n     These blind people will become part of the working force. \n     They will pay taxes. They will become fully integrated and \n     truly achieve first class status as working Americans.\n                                                  Paula A. Krauss,\n     Director CT.

The Social Security earnings limit, presently at \n     $12,000 annually, is the greatest barrier to self-support for \n     blind people. In fact, I would say that the single factor of \n     the earnings limit is more destructive to the self-support \n     efforts of blind people than any other social condition.\n       By raising the earnings exemption threshold for blind \n     people to $30,000 beginning in 2002, your bill would \n     substantially remove any disincentive to work for blind \n     people. For that reason, we applaud your efforts and pledge \n     our full support.\n       Thank you for responding to the need.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                                 James Gashel,\n\n                                Director of Governmental Affairs, \n                                 National Federation of the Blind.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my dear friend and colleague, \nSenator McCain, to introduce legislation of vital importance to \nAmericans who happen to be blind. Its purpose is simply to restore the \nSocial Security earnings limitation for the blind to the same level as \nthat for America's senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, the English poet John Milton once said that ``To be \nblind is not miserable; not to be able to bear blindness, that is \nmiserable.''\n  Over the past 20 years, blind Americans have made amazing progress in \nshouldering those difficult burdens. Today, millions of blind Americans \nhave achieved more independent and rewarding lives for themselves.\n  The legislation that we introduce today will ensure that this \nprogress continues by restoring an important work incentive for close \nto 150,000 blind Americans. This bill would reestablish the identical \nearnings exemption threshold for blind and senior citizen beneficiaries \nunder the Social Security Act, which had been the law from 1977 until \njust last year.\n  Prior to 1977, blind people were overwhelmingly dependent on \ndisability benefits. What's worse, many of them could not afford to \nwork without risking the loss of the basic security that these benefits \nprovided.\n  However, in that year, we raised the earnings exemption for the blind \nto the same level as retirees--from $500 to $940 a month. That modest \nstep encouraged millions of blind Americans to work by allowing them to \nkeep more of what they earned.\n  Unfortunately, last year, when the Congress raised the earnings limit \nfor seniors, it failed to extend the same benefits to the blind.\n  The impact of this unfortunate step has been significant. As the law \nnow stands, a senior citizen may earn $13,500 in 1997 and $30,000 by \nthe year 2002 without any reduction of benefits. A blind person, on the \nother hand, may only earn $12,000 today, and only $14,400 in 2002. \nWhile this provides terrific encouragement for seniors to work, it \nreenshrines into law the disincentive for blind people that existed \nbefore 1977.\n  There are approximately 1.1 million people in the United States who \nare blind under the Social Security definition. Of those, 713,000 of \nthe 1.1 million are 65 or older, and they are considered retirees, not \nblind people.\n  But there are roughly 387,000 people who are blind, and under \nretirement age, who have been adversely affected by the severed link \nbetween retirees and the blind. Of the 332,000 blind people who are 20 \nor older, more than 70 percent are unemployed. We must not make their \nefforts to find meaningful and rewarding work more difficult. Rather, \nwe should encourage blind Americans in their noble endeavors. Our \nlegislation would do just that by raising the earnings limit and \nlinking it once again to the senior citizens exempt account.\n  In closing, Mr. President, allow me to commend Senator McCain for his \nleadership here. He has once again demonstrated his commitment to \nensuring that all Americans have a fair and equal opportunity to enjoy \nthe fruits of their labors and the blessings of our great Nation. I \nurge our colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 376. A bill to affirm the rights of Americans to use and sell \nencryption products, to establish privacy standards for voluntary key \nrecovery encryption systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATION PRIVACY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the 104th Congress, a bipartisan group \nof Senators came together to overhaul our country's outdated export \nrules and bring some sense to our country's encryption policy. We are \nback at it again in this Congress. I am pleased to\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\nintroduce with Senator Burns, and others, two encryption bills, the \nEncrypted Communications Privacy Act [ECPA] and Promotion of Commerce \nOn-Line in the Digital Era [PRO-CODE] Act.\n  This legislation bars government-mandated key recovery, or key escrow \nencryption, and ensures that all computer users are free to choose any \nencryption method to protect the privacy of their online communications \nand computer files. These bills also roll back current restrictions on \nthe export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free \nto compete in the global marketplace and meet the demands of \ncustomers--both foreign and domestic--for strong encryption.\n  As an avid Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting \nindividual privacy and encouraging the development of the Internet as a \nsecure and trusted communications medium. As more Americans every year \nuse the Internet and other computer networks to obtain critical medical \nservices, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with \ntheir friends, maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our \ncomputer communications both here and abroad has only grown in \nimportance.\n  Strong encryption also has an important use as a crime prevention \nshield, to stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping \ninto private computer files and stealing valuable proprietary \ninformation. We should be encouraging the use of strong encryption to \nprevent certain types of computer and online crime.\n  We made progress in the last Congress on encryption. The attention we \ngave to this issue in classified briefings and public hearings helped \nthe administration recognize the need for reform. In fact, in the \nwaning days of the last Congress, the administration took steps to \nadopt one element proposed in these bills by transferring export \ncontrol authority for certain encryption products from the State \nDepartment to the Commerce Department. The administration also loosened \nexport controls on 56-bit key length encryption--at least for 2 years. \nAlthough the administration is moving in the right direction by \nloosening some export controls, its unilateral regulatory reforms are \nnot enough.\n\n  Even under the current regime, popular browser software, such as \nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, may not be \nexported in the form generally available here, since both software \npackages use 128-bit encryption. Lotus Notes shareware, which uses 64-\nbit encryption, cannot be exported in the same version sold \ndomestically.\n  We need to loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that \nAmerican companies are able to export any generally available or mass \nmarket encryption products without obtaining Government approval. ECPA \nwould allow our companies to do that.\n  We are mindful of the national security and law enforcement concerns \nthat have dictated the administration's policy choices on encryption. \nBoth bills contain important exceptions to restrict encryption exports \nfor military end-uses, or to terrorist designated or embargoed \ncountries, such as Cuba or North Korea. This is not enough to satisfy \nour national security and law enforcement agencies, who fear that the \nwidespread use of strong encryption will undercut their ability to \neavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals, or decipher computer files \ncontaining material evidence of a crime.\n  Administration officials have made clear that they seek nothing less \nthan a world-wide key recovery encryption scheme in which the U.S. \nGovernment is able to obtain decryption assistance to decipher \nencrypted communications and stored electronic files. I have \nsignificant concerns about the administration conditioning the export \nof 56-bit key encryption on companies moving forward with key recovery \nencryption systems. In aggressively promoting a global key recovery \nscheme the administration is ignoring the conclusion of the National \nResearch Council in its thorough CRISIS report issued last year. \nSpecifically, the report warned that ``Aggressive government promotion \nof escrowed encryption is not appropriate at this time.''\n  The administration is putting the proverbial cart-before-the-horse by \npromoting key recovery without having in place privacy safeguards \ndefining how and under what circumstances law enforcement and others \nmay get access to decryption keys. Many users have legitimate concerns \nabout investing in and using key recovery products without clear \nanswers on how the law enforcement here, let alone other countries, \nincluding those with bad human rights records or a history of economic \nespionage, will get access to their keys.\n  ECPA provides those answers with clear guidelines on how and when law \nenforcement and foreign countries may obtain decryption assistance from \nkey holders, who are voluntarily entrusted with decryption keys or have \nthe capability to provide decryption assistance.\n  It is time for Congress to take steps to put our national encryption \npolicy on the right course. Both the PRO-CODE bill and the Encrypted \nCommunications Privacy Act reflect a bipartisan effort to reform our \nnation's cryptography policy in a constructive and positive manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act \nand a section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Encrypted Communications \n     Privacy Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that Americans have the maximum possible \n     choice in encryption methods to protect the security, \n     confidentiality, and privacy of their lawful wire and \n     electronic communications and stored electronic information; \n     and\n       (2) to establish privacy standards for key holders who are \n     voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt such \n     communications and information, and procedures by which \n     investigative or law enforcement officers may obtain \n     assistance in decrypting such communications and information.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the digitization of information and the explosion in \n     the growth of computing and electronic networking offers \n     tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, \n     work, and are entertained, but also raises new threats to the \n     privacy of American citizens and the competitiveness of \n     American businesses;\n       (2) a secure, private, and trusted national and global \n     information infrastructure is essential to promote economic \n     growth, protect privacy, and meet the needs of American \n     citizens and businesses;\n       (3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of \n     their communications and in the conducting of personal and \n     business affairs should be preserved and protected;\n       (4) the authority and ability of investigative and law \n     enforcement officers to access and decipher, in a timely \n     manner and as provided by law, wire and electronic \n     communications and stored electronic information necessary to \n     provide for public safety and national security should also \n     be preserved;\n       (5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal, \n     medical, financial, and other information to computers and \n     computer networks unless the security and privacy of that \n     information is assured;\n       (6) business will not entrust their proprietary and \n     sensitive corporate information, including information about \n     products, processes, customers, finances, and employees, to \n     computers and computer networks unless the security and \n     privacy of that information is assured;\n       (7) encryption technology can enhance the privacy, \n     security, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of \n     wire and electronic communications and stored electronic \n     information;\n       (8) encryption techniques, technology, programs, and \n     products are widely available worldwide;\n       (9) Americans should be free to use lawfully whatever \n     particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or \n     products developed in the marketplace they desire to use in \n     order to interact electronically worldwide in a secure, \n     private, and confidential manner;\n       (10) American companies should be free--\n       (A) to compete and to sell encryption technology, programs, \n     and products; and\n       (B) to exchange encryption technology, programs, and \n     products through the use of the Internet, as the Internet is \n     rapidly emerging as the preferred method of distribution of \n     computer software and related information;\n       (11) there is a need to develop a national encryption \n     policy that advances the development of the national and \n     global information infrastructure, and preserves the right to \n     privacy of Americans and the public safety and national \n     security of the United States;\n       (12) there is a need to clarify the legal rights and \n     responsibilities of key holders who are voluntarily entrusted \n     with the\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\n     means to decrypt wire and electronic communications and \n     stored electronic information;\n       (13) Congress and the American people have recognized the \n     need to balance the right to privacy and the protection of \n     the public safety with national security;\n       (14) the Constitution permits lawful electronic \n     surveillance by investigative or law enforcement officers and \n     the seizure of stored electronic information only upon \n     compliance with stringent standards and procedures; and\n       (15) there is a need to clarify the standards and \n     procedures by which investigative or law enforcement officers \n     obtain assistance from key holders who--\n       (A) are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt \n     wire and electronic communications and stored electronic \n     information; or\n       (B) have information that enables the decryption of such \n     communications and information.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Short Title. The Act may be cited as the \n     ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1997.''\n       Sec. 2. Purpose. The Act would ensure that Americans have \n     the maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect \n     the security, confidentiality and privacy of their lawful \n     wire and electronic communications and stored electronic \n     information. Americans are free to choose an encryption \n     method with a key recovery feature, in which another person, \n     called a ``key holder,'' is voluntarily entrusted with a \n     decryption key or with the means to decrypt, or has \n     information that would enable the decryption of, encrypted \n     communications or information. The Act would establish \n     privacy standards for the key holder, and procedures for law \n     enforcement officers and foreign countries to follow to \n     obtain assistance from the key holder in decrypting encrypted \n     communications and information.\n       Sec. 3. Findings. The Act enumerates fifteen congressional \n     findings, including that a secure, private and trusted \n     national and global information infrastructure is essential \n     to promote citizens' privacy and meet the needs of both \n     American citizens and businesses, that encryption technology \n     widely available worldwide can help meet those needs, that \n     Americans should be free to use, and American businesses free \n     to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and \n     products, and that there is a need to develop a national \n     encryption policy to advance the global information \n     infrastructure and preserve Americans' right to privacy and \n     the Nation's public safety and national security.\n       Sec. 4. Definitions. The terms ``decryption key'', \n     ``encryption'', ``key holder'', and ``State'' as used in the \n     Act are defined in section 6 of the Act.\n       Sec. 5. Freedom to Use Encryption.\n       (a) Lawful Use of Encryption. The Act legislatively \n     confirms current practice in the United States that any \n     person in this country may lawfully use any encryption \n     method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length or \n     implementation selected.\n       The Act further makes clear that it is lawful under U.S. \n     law for by any United States persons in a foreign country to \n     use any encryption method. This provision is consistent with, \n     though broader than, the Commerce Department's license \n     exceptions published in the Federal Register on December 30, \n     1996, for temporary encryption exports that effectively \n     replace the Department of State's personal use exemption. \n     This personal use exemption that permits the export of \n     cryptographic products by U.S. citizens and permanent \n     residents who have the need to temporarily export the \n     cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief \n     periods of time. For example, under this exemption, U.S. \n     citizens traveling abroad are able to take their laptop \n     computers containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many \n     versions of which contain an encryption program otherwise \n     not exportable.\n       (b) Prohibition on Mandatory Key Recovery or Key Escrow \n     Encryption. The Act expressly bars the government from \n     mandating that encryption technology or products be sold in \n     interstate commerce with a key recovery feature.\n       (c) General Construction. Nothing in the Act is to be \n     construed to require the use of encryption, the use of \n     encryption with or without a key recovery feature, or the use \n     of a key holder if a person chooses to use encryption with a \n     key recovery feature.\n       Sec. 6. Encrypted Wire or Electronic Communications and \n     Stored Electronic Information. This section of the act adds a \n     new chapter 125, entitled ``Encrypted Wire or Electronic \n     Communications and Stored Electronic Information,'' to title \n     18 of the United States Code to establish privacy standards \n     for key holders and to set forth procedures that law \n     enforcement officers, governmental entities and foreign \n     countries must follow to obtain release of decryption keys or \n     decryption assistance from key holders.\n       (a) In General. New chapter 125 has six sections.\n       Sec. 2801.  Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the \n     new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. 2510. Definitions are provided for \n     ``decryption key'', ``decryption assistance'', ``encryption'' \n     and ``key holder''. A ``key holder'' is a person located \n     within the United States who is voluntarily entrusted by \n     another independent person with the means to decrypt, or who \n     has information that would enable the decryption of, that \n     person's encrypted wire or electronic communications or \n     stored electronic information. A key holder may, but is not \n     required to be, a Federal agency.\n       This chapter applies to wire or electronic communications \n     and communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 \n     U.S.C. 2510, and to stored electronic data. Thus, this \n     chapter describes procedures for law enforcement to obtain \n     assistance in decrypting encrypted electronic mail messages, \n     encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile \n     transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted \n     file transfers over the Internet that are lawfully \n     intercepted pursuant to a wiretap order, under 18 U.S.C. \n     2518, or obtained pursuant to lawful process, under 18 U.S.C. \n     2703, and encrypted information stored on computers that is \n     seized pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful process.\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\n       Sec. 2802.  Prohibited acts by key holders\n       (a) Unauthorized Release of Key.--Key holders will be \n     subject to both criminal and civil liability for the \n     unauthorized release of decryption keys or providing \n     unauthorized decryption assistance.\n       (b) Authorized Release of Key.--Key holders are authorized \n     to release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance \n     (1) with the consent of the key owner, (2) as may be \n     necessarily incident to the provision of the key holder's \n     service in possessing or controlling the key, or (3) to \n     investigative or law enforcement officers authorized to \n     conduct wiretaps and intercept wire or electronic \n     communications, governmental entities authorized to access \n     stored wire or electronic communications and transactional \n     records, and governmental entities authorized to seize or \n     compel production of stored electronic records, and upon \n     compliance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c).\n       (c) Requirements for Release of Decryption Key or Provision \n     of Decryption Assistance.--Generally decryption keys may be \n     released and decryption assistance provided only pursuant to \n     a court order issued upon a finding that the key or \n     assistance is necessary to decrypt communications or stored \n     data lawfully intercepted or seized. The standard for release \n     of the key or provision of decryption assistance is tied \n     directly to the problem at hand: the need to decrypt a \n     message or information that the government is otherwise \n     authorized to intercept or obtain. This will ensure that key \n     holders need respond to only one type of compulsory process--\n     a court order. Moreover, this Act will set a single standard \n     for law enforcement, removing any extra burden on law \n     enforcement to demonstrate, for example, probable cause for \n     two separate orders (i.e., for the encrypted communications \n     or information and for decryption assistance) and possibly \n     before two different judges (i.e., the judge issuing the \n     order for the encrypted communications or information and the \n     judge issuing the order to the key holder).\n       (1) Wire and electronic communications.--To obtain access \n     to a decryption key or decryption assistance from a key \n     holder, an investigative or law enforcement officer must \n     present to the key holder a court order (or a certification \n     issued under the emergency situation procedures in 18 U.S.C. \n     2518(7)) issued upon a finding that the decryption key or \n     decryption assistance is necessary for the decryption of a \n     communication that the officer is authorized to intercept. \n     The order or certification shall specify the key or \n     assistance being sought and identify the termination date of \n     the period for which the release or assistance is authorized. \n     Released keys or other decryption assistance may only be \n     used in the manner and for the purpose and duration \n     expressly provided by the court order.\n       The Act reinforces the principle of minimization. A key \n     holder may only provide the minimal key release or decryption \n     assistance needed to access the particular communications or \n     information specified by court order. Under some key recovery \n     schemes, release of a key holder's private key--rather than \n     an individual session key--might provide the ability to \n     decrypt every communication or stored file ever encrypted by \n     a particular key owner, or by every user in an entire \n     corporation, or by every user who was ever a customer of the \n     key holder. The Act protects against such over broad releases \n     of keys by requiring the court issuing the order to find the \n     keys or decryption assistance being sought are necessary.\n       A key holder who fails to comply with the court order to \n     provide a decryption key or decryption assistance may be \n     penalized under current contempt or obstruction laws.\n       (2) Stored wire and electronic communications and stored \n     electronic information.--\n       (A) A key holder is authorized to release a decryption key \n     or provide decryption assistance to a governmental entity \n     when directed to do so by a court order issued upon a finding \n     that the key or assistance sought is necessary for the \n     decryption of stored wire and electronic communications and \n     transactional records, which a governmental entity is \n     authorized to obtain under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703. The notice \n     required to be given to subscribers or customers, under 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2703(b), shall include notice of the receipt of \n     the key or assistance, as the case may be, by the \n     governmental entity.\n       (B) A key holder is authorized to release a decryption key \n     or provide decryption assistance to a governmental entity \n     when directed to do so by a court order issued upon a finding \n     that the key or assistance sought is necessary for the \n     decryption of stored electronic information, which a \n     governmental entity is authorized to seize or for which the \n     governmental entity is authorized to compel production.\n       (C) A court order issued under either (A) or (B) must \n     specify the decryption key or decryption assistance being \n     sought, and the key holder may provide only such release or \n     assistance as is necessary for access to the communications, \n     records or information covered by the court order.\n       (3) Use of key.--An investigative or law enforcement \n     officer or governmental entity to which a decryption key has \n     been released may use the key only in the manner, for the \n     purpose and for the period expressly provided for in the \n     court order or certification authorizing the release and \n     use. At the end of the period for authorized release of \n     the decryption key, the investigative or law enforcement \n     officer or governmental entity must destroy and not retain \n     the key and certify this has been done to the issuing \n     court, if any.\n       (4) Nondisclosure of Release.--A key holder may not \n     disclose the release of a decryption key or provision of \n     decryption assistance unless otherwise ordered to do so by \n     law or legal process and then only after prior notification \n     to the Attorney General or principal prosecuting attorney of \n     a State or of a political subdivision of a State, as \n     appropriate.\n       (d) Records or Other Information Held by Key Holders.--Key \n     holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other \n     information (not including decryption keys or the contents of \n     communications) pertaining to key owners, except with the \n     owner's consent or to an investigative or law enforcement \n     officer, pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other lawful \n     process. Investigative or law enforcement officers receiving \n     such information are not required to notify the person to \n     whom such information pertains. Key holders who violate this \n     section are liable for civil damages as provided in \n     subsection (f).\n       (e) Criminal Penalties.--Key holders who violate this \n     section for a tortuous, malicious or an illegal purpose, or \n     for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private \n     commercial gain, will be subject to a fine and up to 1 year \n     imprisonment for a first offense, and fine and up to 2 years' \n     imprisonment for a second offense. Other reckless and \n     intentional violations would subject the key holder to a fine \n     of not more than $5,000 and not more than 6 months' \n     imprisonment.\n       (f) Civil Damages.--Persons aggrieved by key holder \n     violations may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages \n     or statutory damages of $5,000, whichever is greater. A civil \n     action must be commenced not later than 2 years after the \n     date on which the plaintiff first knew or should have known \n     of the offense.\n       (g) Defense.--A complete defense against any civil or \n     criminal action is provided if the defendant acted in good \n     faith reliance upon a court order, warrant, grand jury or \n     trial subpoena or other statutory authorization.\n       Sec. 2803.  Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is \n     required to include in his or her report to the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2519(2), the number of orders and extensions served on \n     key holders to obtain access to decryption keys or decryption \n     assistance. The Director of the Administrative Office of the \n     U.S. Courts is required to include this information, and the \n     offenses for which the orders were obtained, in the report to \n     Congress under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3).\n       Sec. 2804.  Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice\n       Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for \n     the purpose of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the \n     communication of information in furtherance of a federal \n     felony crime to a law enforcement officer, would be subject \n     to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first \n     offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or \n     subsequent offense.\n       Sec. 2805.  Freedom to sell encryption products\n       (a) In General.--The Act legislatively confirms that it is \n     lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption \n     algorithm, key length or implementation used, domestically in \n     the United States or its territories.\n       (b) Control of Exports by Secretary of Commerce.--\n     Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of \n     Commerce with control of exports of hardware, software and \n     technology for information security, including encryption for \n     both communications and other stored data, except when the \n     hardware, software or technology is specifically designed or \n     modified for military use. Under the Act, the Secretary must \n     grant export license exceptions to computer software, \n     computer hardware and technology with encryption capabilities \n     if the Secretary determines that a product with comparable \n     security is commercially available from a foreign supplier \n     without effective restrictions, is generally available in a \n     foreign country, or if the product employs encryption from a \n     foreign source that otherwise would be the sole basis for \n     restriction.\n       The Secretary of Commerce would be required to grant a \n     license exception for the export of computer software with \n     encryption capabilities that is generally available, \n     including mass market products (i.e., those generally \n     available, sold ``as is'', and designed for installation by \n     the purchaser) or in the public domain and generally \n     accessible. For example, no license would be required for \n     encryption products commercially available without \n     restriction and sold ``as is'', such as Netscape's \n     commercially available World Wide Web Browser with strong \n     encryption, which can not be exported. Similarly, a license \n     exception would be granted to export encryption software \n     placed in the public domain and generally accessible, such as \n     Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy program, which has been \n     distributed to the public free of charge via the Internet.\n       The Secretary of Commerce would also be required to grant a \n     license exception for the export of computer hardware that \n     would otherwise be restricted solely on the basis that it \n     incorporates computer software with encryption capabilities \n     described above, or so-called ``crypto-ready'' computer \n     software or hardware incorporating an interface mechanism for \n     interaction with encryption hardware or software. Finally, \n     the Secretary\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\n     of Commerce would be required to grant a license exception \n     for the export of encryption technology related or \n     ancillary to the items described above, to enable American \n     companies to license their technology for production, use \n     and sale abroad.\n       Significantly, the government is authorized to continue \n     export controls on countries that pose terrorism concerns, \n     such as Libya, Syria and Iran, or other embargoed countries, \n     such as Cuba and North Korea, pursuant to the Trading With \n     the Enemy Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers \n     Act.\n     Sec. 2806.  Requirements for release of decryption key or \n         provision of decryption assistance to a foreign country\n       The Act bars investigative or law enforcement officers and \n     key holders from releasing a decryption key or providing \n     decryption assistance to a foreign country except when \n     certain conditions are satisfied. First, the foreign country \n     must have entered into a treaty or convention to provide \n     mutual assistance with respect to decryption. Second, the \n     foreign country must make a formal request to the United \n     States for such assistance. Third, the Attorney General or \n     the Attorney General's designee must obtain an order from the \n     district court in which the key holder resides directing the \n     key holder to release the decryption key or provide \n     decryption assistance. Finally, the order may only be issued \n     if the judge finds that (1) the decryption key or decryption \n     assistance being sought is necessary for the decryption of a \n     communication or information that the foreign country is \n     authorized to intercept or seize pursuant to its own domestic \n     law; (2) the law of the foreign country provides adequate \n     protection against the arbitrary interference of privacy \n     rights; and (3) the decryption key or decryption assistance \n     being sought is in connection with a criminal investigation \n     for conduct that would constitute a violation of a criminal \n     law of the United States if committed within the jurisdiction \n     of the United States.\n       The grounds for issuance of the court order ensure that a \n     U.S. court will examine the quality of legal protections in \n     place in the foreign country on whose behalf of request for \n     decryption assistance is made and that the United States does \n     not facilitate the provision of decryption assistance to \n     legal system that do not meet minimum international human \n     rights standards or in cases that would violate American \n     constitutional standards.\n       (b) Technical Amendment.--The Act adds new chapter 125 and \n     the new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the \n     United States Code.\n       Sec. 6. Intelligence Activities.--The Act does not \n     authorize the conduct of intelligence activities, nor affect \n     the conduct by Federal government officers or employees in \n     intercepting (1) encrypted or other official communications \n     of Federal executive branch or Federal contractors for \n     communications security purposes; (2) radio communications \n     between or among foreign powers or agents, as defined by the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or (3) \n     electronic communication systems used exclusively by foreign \n     powers or agents, as defined by FISA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Craig, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Campbell, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Grams, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 377. A bill to promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use \nof strong encryption, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\nTHE PROMOTION OF COMMERCE ON-LINE IN THE DIGITAL ERA [PRO-CODE] ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, when I want to communicate, sometimes I \nsend a postcard. In that case, I know not to say anything that I don't \nwant printed on the front page of the newspaper. Somebody, anybody, can \nread it. When I buy an envelope and put a stamp on it, I am taking a \nstep toward securing that information. I have a reasonable expectation \nthat people will not open my mail.\n\n  When I talk on the telephone--at least on a landline telephone--I \nhave a reasonable expectation that nobody is listening in. Today, we \nare in a world that is characterized by the fact that nearly everyone \nhas a computer and that those computers are, for the most part, \nconnected to one another. In light of that fact, it is becoming more \nand more important to ensure that our communications over these \ncomputer networks are conducted in a secure way. It is no longer \npossible to say that when we move into the information age, we'll \nsecure these networks, because we are already there. We use computers \nin our homes and businesses in a way that couldn't have been imagined \n10 years ago, and these computers are connected through networks, \nmaking it easier to communicate than ever before. This phenomenon holds \nthe promise of transforming life in States like Montana, where health \ncare and state-of-the-art education can be delivered over networks to \npeople located away from population centers. These new technologies can \nimprove the lives of real people, but only if the security of \ninformation that moves over these networks is safe and reliable.\n  The problem today is that our computer networks are not as secure as \nthey could be; it is fairly easy for amateur hackers to break into our \nnetworks. They can intercept information; they can steal trade secrets \nand intellectual property; they can alter medical records; the list is \nendless. Last Congress, FBI Director Freeh stated his profound concerns \nabout the threat of economic espionage on a global basis. One solution \nto this, of course, is to let individuals and businesses alike to take \nsteps to secure that information. Encryption is one technology that \naccomplishes that. Domestically, Americans are free to use strong \nencryption to secure their information--we are determined to make sure \nthat that guarantee prevails.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill, similar to one I introduced during \nthe 104th Congress, which designed to promote electronic commerce, both \ndomestically and globally, by facilitating the use of strong \nencryption. Last Congress, my bill was criticized for not acknowledging \nthe legitimate law enforcement and national security interests raised \nby the widespread use of strong, or unbreakable encryption. In response \nto those criticisms, this Congress, working with Senator Leahy, Senator \nDorgan, and Senator Lott, has modified this bill to address those \nconcerns. Our approach, though, encourages Government officials to \nabandon the head-in-the-sand approach that they've taken for the past 7 \nyears, hoping that strong encryption would not become available \nglobally, and take a proactive approach to addressing this technology. \nBecause everyone agrees that this technology will eventually be widely \navailable globally--many of us believe that the technology is already \nwidely available globally--now is the time to get industry working with \nGovernment officials to teach them how to execute their duties in a \nglobal communications network where strong encryption is ubiquitous.\n  We believe that this bill lays the most responsible course for \naddressing this technology, and I am pleased to announce that the \nfollowing Senators have signed onto this bill as original cosponsors: \nMajority Leader Lott, Assistant Majority Leader Nickles, Senator \nDorgan, Senator Wyden, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator Craig, \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Domenici, Senator Murray, Senator Brownback, \nSenator Kempthorne, Senator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, Senator Faircloth, \nSenator Thomas, Senator Grams, and Senator Allard. With such impressive \nbipartisan support, I am extremely optimistic that the bill will be \nreported out of the Commerce Committee quickly and will pass the Senate \nduring this Congress.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this legislation was drafted to not only \naddress the concerns raised by industry but also to encourage law \nenforcement and national security officials to prepare themselves to do \ntheir job in an environment where strong, unbreakable encryption is \neverywhere. To date, the FBI/NSA/CIA have devoted their efforts in this \narea to maintaining the status quo and hoping that strong encryption \ndoes not become common worldwide. The evidence from a Commerce \nDepartment study conducted over a year ago, indicates that this has \nalready taken place--the study identified 497 foreign-made products \nthat were capable of offering encryption at a level in excess of that \nwhich domestic companies could export under the present export \nrestrictions in 28 foreign countries. Therefore, this legislation \nencourages these officials to address this technology proactively. \nEssentially the bill was designed to accomplish the following:\n  Ending the imposition of U.S. Government-designed encryption \nstandards. This is accomplished by restricting the Department of \nCommerce [NIST] from imposing Government encryption standards intended \nfor use by the private sector, and by prohibiting the Department of \nCommerce from setting de facto encryption standards through use of \nexport controls.\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\n  Promoting the use of commercial encryption. This is accomplished by \nprohibiting the restrictions on the sale of commercial encryption \nprograms and products in interstate commerce; by prohibiting \ngovernmental imposition, expressly or in practice, of mandatory key \nescrow; and by permitting the export of, first, generally available \nsoftware with encryption capabilities, and second, other software and \nhardware with encryption capabilities if exports of products with \nsimilar security have been exported for use by foreign financial \ninstitutions.\n  Protecting the national security and public safety. This is \naccomplished by, first, imposing industry reporting requirements upon \ncompanies wishing to export products with strong encryption; second, \ncreating an Information Security Board whose purpose is to get industry \nexperts and law enforcement/national security officers to work \ntogether--both publicly and privately--to address the execution of law \nenforcement/national security functions in an environment where strong \nencryption has widely proliferated; and third, by prohibiting exports \nof particular encryption software and hardware to identified \nindividuals or organizations in specific foreign countries if there is \nsubstantial evidence that it will be diverted to, or modified for, \nmilitary or terrorist end-use.\n  We believe that getting law enforcement and national security \nofficials to address this technology proactively is a more responsible \nand defensible position than mandating a key escrow or other key \nrecovery system upon industry.\n  This legislation is vitally important to a wide range of domestic \nindustries. The export restriction poses serious commercial threats to \nthree distinct classes of industry: first, the industry that \nmanufacturers and sells encryption software and hardware; second, \nindustries that purchase encryption hardware and software and \nincorporate that technology into their products; and third, all \nindustries that communicate with subsidiaries or customers over the \nglobal communications network.\n\n\n                 The Encryption Manufacturing Industry\n\n  While domestic companies presently hold a position of global \nleadership in the manufacture of products that provide strong \nencryption, this leadership is threatened by the provisions restricting \nthe export of this technology. Because there are no import restrictions \non the sale of this technology and because there are no domestic \nrestrictions on the sale of this technology, foreign manufacturers of \nencryption technology have seized the opportunity provided by the \ncontinued application of these export restrictions to steal market \nshare from domestic companies. Because we are already seeing hundreds \nof different foreign-made products offering strong encryption in the \nglobal marketplace, the foreign companies who manufacture these \nproducts are not only cornering the foreign market for this technology, \nthey are beginning to compete for the U.S. market--as the global export \nof their product increases, their per-unit cost decreases; thus, \ndomestic companies may soon find themselves competing for the U.S. \nmarket against a foreign product which offers comparable security but \nat a lower cost. In effect, these export restrictions are effectively \nexporting the entire encryption manufacturing industry.\n\n\n industries that incorporate encryption technology into their products\n\n  The export restrictions apply not only to companies who are in the \nbusiness of the manufacture and sale of encryption technology, but also \nto entire industries that purchase this technology and incorporate it \ninto their products. The restrictions even apply to domestic industries \nwho import encryption technology and incorporate it into their \nproducts. Furthermore, the restrictions prohibit export of products \nthat are encryption-ready, that is, are designed to have the encryption \npackage installed elsewhere. These industries suffer the same \ncompetition disadvantage in the global marketplace that our domestic \nencryption manufacturing companies face. Likewise, it will not be long \nbefore these industries find themselves (having already conceded all \nforeign markets to foreign competitors) competing for the U.S. market \nwith foreign competitors offering similar products but at a lower \nprice. Thus, continued application of the export restrictions on \nencryption technology could result in the export of a wide range of \nindustries.\n  As information security becomes an increasingly important \nconsideration, we are seeing a broad range of products that are \nincorporating encryption technology. For example, the entire \ntelecommunications manufacturing industry--from cellular telephones to \nswitches--has a direct stake in this debate. Likewise, virtually all \nmanufacturing concerns are impacted. I am in the process of collecting \nstatements from 23 separate industries who see the speedy resolution of \nthis problem as critical to their survival in the global marketplace.\n\n\n                           nightmare scenario\n\n  During the first hearing on Pro-Code last Congress, one of the \nwitnesses, Jim Bidzos, the founder and owner of RSA Data Security, a \nprominent domestic encryption manufacturing company, pointed out that \nthe United States is presently on the verge of exporting, industry by \nindustry, the lion's share of our country's industry base. At that \nhearing, he pointed out that Nippon Telephone & Telegraph [NTT], the \nlargest company on the planet with $600 billion in annual revenues and \n$300 million in annual subsidies from the Japanese Government has just \nannounced the production--and intention to export globally--of a \ncomputer chip that provided unbreakable encryption, with a key of 1,024 \nbit length. Thus, NTT is now in the position of cornering--quite \neasily, I might add--the global market on this technology and will soon \nbe competing directly with RSA for the U.S. market with similar chips \nwhich, due to economies of scale, cost less to consumers. Once NTT has \nrun all of its U.S. competitors out of business, it will be uniquely \npoised to take over every industry that incorporates the NTT chip into \na product, in the exact same way as they took over the chips \nmanufacturing industry.\n\n\n    companies who transmit proprietary information over the global \n                         communications network\n\n  Not only do the export restrictions pose commercial problems for \nindustries that manufacture or incorporate encryption technology into \ntheir products, they also raise serious economic threats to any \nindustry that transmits proprietary information over the global \ncommunications network. Because the public communications network is \nglobal, the export restrictions effectively prohibit companies who wish \nto communicate with subsidiaries, partners, or customers outside the \nUnited States in a secure way; transmitting the hardware or software to \ninternational associates to provide communications security in excess \nof that allowable under the export restrictions violate those \nrestrictions. The economic implications arising from this application \nof the export restrictions is staggering: petroleum companies can't \nsend exploration data to overseas subsidiaries; automotive companies \ncan't send design information to factories abroad; Walt Disney can't \nsend the digital package of the movie the Lion King to its distributor \nin England; the list is endless. Thus, all intellectual property or \nother proprietary information that travels over the public network is \nput at risk of economic espionage as a result of this application of \nthese export restrictions.\n  Finally, the controversy over this technology raises serious fourth \namendment constitutional issues. In a new era where one's personal and \neconomic information is increasingly rendered in digital form, the \nability of the Government to peer into such data at will raises serious \nfourth amendment concerns.\n  Further, it raises first amendment constitutional issues as well. \nLast month, a California Appellate Court affirmed a favorable ruling in \nthe first amendment challenge to the Arms Export Control Act [AECA] and \nthe International Traffic in Arms Regulations [ITAR] in Bernstein \nversus U.S. Department of State. Bernstein involved a graduate student, \nDaniel J. Bernstein, who developed an encryption algorithm called \nSnuffle. He had articulated his mathematical ideas in two ways: in an \nacademic paper and in a source code. The State Department denied \nBernstein's request to export his cryptographic product for the \npurposes\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\nof teaching the Snuffle algorithm, to disclose it at academic \nconferences, or to publish it in journals or online discussion groups. \nBernstein alleged that the restrictions were: an unconstitutional prior \nrestraint on speech; an infringement on his free speech; and infringed \nthe rights of association and equal protection. The State Department \nmoved to dismiss the case of the grounds that these issues were \nnonjusticible, and the Court denied the motion finding that source code \nwas considered to be speech for the purposes of the first amendment \nanalysis.\n  In light of the pressing commercial and constitutional impact of \nrestricting the sale of this technology, both domestically and abroad, \nI believe that we must act now, before we effectively export entire \nindustries. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting Pro-\nCode.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Promotion of Commerce On-\n     Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The ability to digitize information makes carrying out \n     tremendous amounts of commerce and personal communication \n     electronically possible.\n       (2) Miniaturization, distributed computing, and reduced \n     transmission costs make communication via electronic networks \n     a reality.\n       (3) The explosive growth in the internet and other computer \n     networks reflects the potential growth of electronic commerce \n     and personal communication.\n       (4) The internet and the global information infrastructure \n     have the potential to revolutionize the way individuals and \n     businesses conduct business.\n       (5) The full potential of the internet for the conduct of \n     business cannot be realized as long as it is an insecure \n     medium in which confidential business information and \n     sensitive personal information remain at risk of unauthorized \n     viewing, alteration, and use.\n       (6) Encryption of information enables businesses and \n     individuals to protect themselves against the unauthorized \n     viewing, alteration, and use of information by employing \n     widely understood and readily available science and \n     technology to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, and \n     integrity of information.\n       (7) In order to promote economic growth and meet the needs \n     of businesses and individuals in the United States, a variety \n     of encryption products and programs should be available to \n     promote strong, flexible, and commercially acceptable \n     encryption capabilities.\n       (8) United States computer, computer software and hardware, \n     communications, and electronics businesses are leading the \n     world technology revolution, as those businesses have \n     developed and are prepared to offer immediately to computer \n     users worldwide a variety of communications and computer \n     hardware and computer software that provide strong, robust, \n     and easy-to-use encryption.\n       (9) United States businesses seek to market the products \n     described in paragraph (8) in competition with scores of \n     foreign businesses in many countries that offer similar, and \n     frequently stronger, encryption products and programs.\n       (10) The regulatory efforts by the Secretary of Commerce, \n     acting through the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, and other entities to promulgate standards and \n     guidelines in support of government-designed solutions to \n     encryption problems that--\n       (A) were not developed in the private sector; and\n       (B) have not received widespread commercial support,\n\n     have had a negative impact on the development and marketing \n     of products with encryption capabilities by United States \n     businesses.\n       (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United States \n     businesses have been prohibited from exporting strong \n     encryption products and programs.\n       (12) In response to the desire of United States businesses \n     to sell commercial products to the United States Government \n     and to sell a single product worldwide, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, acting through the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology, has sought to require them to include \n     features in products sold both in the United States and \n     foreign countries that will allow the Federal Government easy \n     access to the plain text of all electronic information and \n     communications.\n       (13) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, has proposed that \n     United States businesses be allowed to sell products and \n     programs offering strong encryption to the United States \n     Government and in foreign countries only if the products and \n     programs include a feature guaranteeing the Federal \n     Government access to a key that decrypts information \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as ``key escrow \n     encryption'').\n       (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating \n     encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology of a Federal \n     information processing standard for a standard of escrowed \n     encryption, known as the ``clipper chip'', that was flawed \n     and controversial.\n       (15) The current policy of the Federal Government to \n     require that keys to decrypt information be made available to \n     the Federal Government as a condition of exporting strong \n     encryption technology has had the effect of prohibiting the \n     exportation of strong encryption technology.\n       (16) The Federal Government has legitimate law enforcement \n     and national security objectives which necessitate the \n     disclosure to the Federal Government of general information \n     that is neither proprietary nor confidential by experts in \n     information security industries, including cryptographers, \n     engineers, and others designated in the design and \n     development of information security products. By relaxing \n     export controls on encryption products and programs, this Act \n     creates an obligation on the part of representatives of \n     companies involved in the export of information security \n     products to share information about those products to \n     designated representatives of the Federal Government.\n       (17) In order to promote electronic commerce in the twenty-\n     first century and to realize the full potential of the \n     internet and other computer networks--\n       (A) United States businesses should be encouraged to \n     develop and market products and programs offering encryption \n     capabilities; and\n       (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited from \n     promulgating regulations and adopting policies that \n     discourage the use and sale of encryption.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote \n     electronic commerce through the use of strong encryption by--\n       (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States that \n     offer computer hardware and computer software made in the \n     United States that incorporate encryption technology are \n     ready and immediately able, with respect to electronic \n     information that will be essential to conducting business in \n     the twenty-first century to provide products that are \n     designed to--\n       (A) protect the confidentiality of that information; and\n       (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity of that \n     information;\n       (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with respect to \n     the promulgation or enforcement of regulations, or the \n     application of policies, that impose government-designed \n     encryption standards; and\n       (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses to \n     sell to computer users worldwide computer software and \n     computer hardware that provide the strong encryption demanded \n     by such users by--\n       (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the sale of \n     such products and programs in interstate commerce;\n       (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption systems; \n     and\n       (C) establishing conditions for the sale of encryption \n     products and programs in foreign commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Board shall meet at such times and in such \n     places as the Secretary may prescribe, but not less \n     frequently than quarterly. The Federal Advisory Committee Act \n     (5 U.S.C. App.) does not apply to the Board or to meetings \n     held by the Board under subsection (d).\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Board are--\n       (1) to provide a forum to foster communication and \n     coordination between industry and the Federal government; and\n       (2) to foster the aggregation and dissemination of general, \n     nonproprietary, and nonconfidential developments in important \n     information security technologies, including encryption.\n       (c) Requirements.--\n       (1) Reports to agencies.--The Board shall regularly report \n     general, nonproprietary, and nonconfidential information to \n     appropriate Federal agencies to keep law enforcement and \n     national security agencies abreast of emerging technologies \n     so they are able effectively to execute their \n     responsibilities.\n       (2) Publications.--The Board shall cause such information \n     (other than classified, proprietary, or confidential \n     information) as it deems appropriate, consistent with its \n     purposes, to be published from time to time through any \n     appropriate medium and to be made available to the public.\n       (d) Meetings.--The Secretary shall establish a process for \n     quarterly meetings between the Board and representatives from \n     the private sector with interest or expertise in information \n     security, including cryptographers, engineers, and product \n     managers. The Board may meet at anytime with one or more \n     representatives of any person involved in the development, \n     production, or distribution of encryption technology or of \n     computing devices that contain encryption technology.\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\n     SEC. 7. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act may be construed to affect any law \n     intended to prevent the--\n       (1) distribution of descramblers or any other equipment for \n     illegal interceptions of cable and satellite television \n     signals;\n       (2) illegal or unauthorized distribution or release of \n     classified, confidential, or proprietary information; or\n       (3) enforcement of Federal or State criminal law.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Burns' \nlegislation, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-\nCODE) Act of 1997 and am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the \nbill.\n  This is important legislation which will create the proper balance \nbetween encryption technology export interests as well as national \nsecurity interests. The administration's encryption policy was \ndisappointing to me, since it tipped the balance too far in the \ndirection of security and law enforcement concerns, risking important \nprivacy rights of producers and users of cncryption technology.\n  Again our Government has found itself in the position of creating \nunilateral export controls that will do only one thing--essentially \nterminate export opportunities for U.S. companies. To limit U.S. \ncompanies from exporting encyrption technology at 56 bits without a \ncostly key recovery system will simply price us out of the market. Many \nof our allies are ready to sell far more sophisticated technology \nwithout a key recovery system. It's not hard to see who will pick up \nmost of a growing encryption technology global market.\n  Also, key recovery is not needed for encryption technology sold \ndomestically or imported. If U.S. companies are forced to sell only the \ntechnology including the key recovery for cost savings reasons, it's \nalso not hard to see how quickly the domestic market will dry up in \nfavor of imports. The solution is not import controls. The Burns bill \nis the solution that 18 Senators of both parties have supported today.\n  Senator Burns' bill protects national security interests. It would \nnot allow exports over what is available from our allies. It also \nallows Commerce to prohibit specific exports where there is substantial \nevidence the technology will be diverted or used by terrorists, drug \ndealers and other criminals. Further, it creates an Information \nSecurity Board designed to get industry and law enforcement interests \ntogether to address this important issue.\n  I am sensitive to law enforcement and national security concerns, but \nthe holes in the administration's policy are enormous and smack of \npolitics more than sound policy. Criminals and terrorists will simply \nnot use U.S. technology, or they will find a way to circumvent the key \nrecovery system. Also, they can use encryption technology within the \nU.S. without the same scrutiny.\n  Senator Burns has described the many problems and questions raised by \na key recovery system held by a third party, so I won't belabor them. \nBut the privacy concerns are real. I can't imagine why users would want \nto buy a product that simply puts at risk unwarranted release of the \nencrypted material. No matter how many protections can be built into \nthe key escrow system, there is no way to avoid some misuse or abuse of \nthe system.\n  Senator Burns should be congratulated for his effort to correct this \npolicy. I applaud his efforts and strongly support them as chairman of \nthe International Finance Subcommittee of the Banking Committee which \nhas jurisdiction over many export control issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 379. A bill entitled the ``Native Alaskan Subsistance Whaling \nProvision''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 alaska subsistence whaling legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nStevens to introduce legislation that would resolve a dispute that has \nexisted for several years between the IRS and native whaling captains \nin my State. Our legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to \nensure that a charitable donation tax deduction would be allowed for \nnative whaling captains who organize and support subsistence whaling \nactivities in their communities.\n  Subsistence whaling is a necessity to the Alaska Native community. In \nmany of our remote village communities, the whale hunt is a tradition \nthat has been carried on for generations over many millennia. It is the \ncustom that the captain of the hunt make all provisions for the meals, \nwages, and equipment costs associated with this important activity.\n  In most instances, the captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuck, \nwhich is blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the \ncaptain is required to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his \nvillage in order to help the community survive.\n  The proposed deduction would allow the captain to deduct up to $7,500 \nto help defray the costs associated with providing this community \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that if the captain incurred all \nof these expenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable \norganization, the captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the \ncosts he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. \nHowever, the cultural significance of the captain's sharing the whale \nwith the community would be lost.\n  This is a very modest effort to allow the Congress to recognize the \nimportance of this part of our Native Alaskan tradition. Last year, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimated that this provision would cost a \nmere $3 million over a 10-year period.

A bill to prohibit foreign nationals admitted to the United \nStates under a nonimmigrant visa from possessing a firearm; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               Empire State Building Counterterrorism Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senators \nKennedy and Kohl the ``Durbin-Kennedy Empire State Building Counter-\nTerrorism Act of 1997.''\n  This legislation is spurred by the recent tragedy at the Empire State \nBuilding where a man in this country on a tourist visa shot and killed \nChris Burmeister, a young Danish tourist, wounded six and then turned \nthe gun on himself.\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\n  But this bill is about much more than that one tragedy. It is an \neffort to address a real problem and to pass a sensible measure to deal \nwith it. The shooting at the Empire State Building has sadly served to \nreveal a glaring gap in our laws--a gap that any would-be terrorist \ncould walk through.\n  The fact is that any foreign national who is coming into the United \nStates on a tourist visa will probably pass through several airport \nsecurity checks to determine whether or not he is carrying a firearm. \nBut as we have learned in the tragedy at the Empire State Building, \nthat foreign tourist can slip through our Nation's laws and can \nprobably buy a gun once here in the United States more easily than you \nor I could.\n  The motivation for the killing in New York is not clearly terrorist \nin nature. But I do not want to wait until a terrorist exploits these \nloopholes in order to act. Let us close the gap now.\n  Let me briefly explain the problem. Currently, more than 20 million \npeople a year come into the United States on nonimmigrant visas. Nearly \n1 million of them came in via Chicago last year. And by the way, that \nnumber does not include people from Mexico and Canada. There are more \nthan 50 types of nonimmigrant visas, including tourist visas, work \nvisas, student visas, and diplomatic visas. These visas are issued to \npeople who do not intend to reside permanently in the United States and \nthey are issued without any kind of criminal background check of the \napplicant.\n  Under the Brady law, anyone who wants to buy a gun in this country \nhas to undergo a criminal background check. In the last 28 months, this \nrequirement has stopped more than 186,000 illegal gun purchases. \nSeventy percent of those denied were felons.\n  But what the Empire State Building shooting reveals is a gap in this \nlaw. Someone who just came to the United States on a tourist visa \nclearly does not have a criminal record in this country. Yet he or she \nmay have such a record in their country of origin. The Brady bill \ncannot catch them since we do not search criminal records in foreign \ncountries. So the tourist with a criminal record can easily get a gun.\n  It is frightening to anticipate the damage that a foreign terrorist \ncould wreak by exploiting this gap. But closing this loophole is easy. \nAnd we should do it now. Not later.\n  The measure I propose is straightforward. It bars people who have \ncome to this country on nonimmigrant visas from being able to purchase \nor possess a gun.\n  Let me emphasize that the vast majority of the people who come to \nthis country on nonimmigrant visas do not have any kind of criminal \nbackground and do not intend to buy guns or harm anyone. And that is \nwhy the legislation has two important and sensible exceptions.\n  First, foreign nationals who enter this country on nonimmigrant visas \nand who are here for legitimate sporting purposes, law enforcement \npurposes or diplomatic purposes will be exempt. It only makes sense \nthat someone who is here to take part in a shooting competition should \nbe able to bring in their gun.\n  The second exception allows people here on nonimmigrant visas to buy \na firearm if they have been in this country for 6 months and if they \ncan prove that they do not have a criminal record in their country of \norigin.\n  Mr. President, this is a rational piece of legislation. We are all \nconcerned with the growing terrorist threat in our country. No one who \nhas followed the news in the last decade can be unaware of the fact \nthat our Nation is a terrorist target. Well, we should not be putting \nguns in the hands of terrorists. This bill will stop that from \nhappening.\n  I hope all of us can work quickly to pass this measure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the killings at the Empire State Building \nlast Sunday were the shots heard 'round the country. The entire Nation \nwas horrified to learn of the senseless assault on seven tourists, and \nhopefully we will be shocked into action to close the flagrant loophole \nin the gun laws that allowed the attack to happen. It's preposterous \nthat a deranged alien could arrive in this country, set up temporary \nresidence in a motel, buy a semiautomatic handgun, and start blasting \naway in a crowded tourist site. The gunman at the Empire State Building \nkilled himself. One other person died, six were injured, and countless \nothers on the observation deck at the time bear the psychological scars \nfrom this senseless atrocity. Most of the victims were visitors from \nother countries--France, Switzerland, and Argentina--and were there \nseeing one of the most famous symbols of America.\n  Imagine the nightmare for a 16-year-old French tourist who saw both \nher parents shot, or the 10-year-old girl from the Bronx whose father \nwas wounded. The thoughts and prayers of all Americans are with the \nvictims and their families.\n  The shock and disbelief turned to anger as we learned more about the \ncircumstances of the shooting. The gunman, Abu Kamal, was in the United \nStates on a tourist visa, and was easily able to purchase a Berreta \nsemiautomatic handgun in Florida, even though there is a 90-day \nresidency requirement under Federal law before aliens can purchase a \nhandgun.\n  The current gaps in Federal law are appalling. A foreign national \ncan come to the United States on a tourist visa, or a work visa, and \nthen obtain a handgun legally with ease. There is virtually nothing to \nstop a terrorist from entering the United States on a tourist visa, and \nthen purchasing a supply of weapons legally in the United States for \nuse in a terrorist activity. There is no legitimate reason why someone \nwho is in the United States temporarily should be able to purchase or \ncarry a firearm here.\n\n  Senator Durbin and I are introducing a bill today to close this \ngaping loophole. Our bill will prohibit foreign nationals who are in \nthe United States on a nonimmigrant visa from possessing a firearm. \nForeign nationals here on a tourist visa, or a temporary work visa, \nwould be prohibited from carrying a firearm, and dealers would be \nprohibited from knowingly selling them a firearm. The INS already \nprovides immigration information to law enforcement authorities \nconducting background checks on gun purchasers, so they are well-\npositioned to provide this additional information to firearms dealers.\n  The bill does not apply to permanent residents. In addition, a series \nof sensible exceptions will permit certain foreign nationals who are in \nthe United States temporarily to carry a firearm. For example, foreign \nnationals performing official State functions, such as bodyguards and \nother Embassy personnel, would be exempted. Foreign nationals who are \ncoming to the United States to go hunting would also be exempted. The \nJustice Department would have the discretion to grant additional \nexemptions to qualified applicants.\n  We intend to address in future legislation another major aspect of \nthe gun violence problem in America--which is the widespread disparity \nbetween gun control laws in various States. It will be impossible to \nstop guns from coming into New York or Massachusetts, or elsewhere, if \nwe don't solve this problem. Fifteen percent of the gun crimes \ncommitted in New York City in 1995 involved guns traced to Florida. \nGun-running will always be a profitable business, as long as some \nStates make it as easy to buy guns as to buy groceries. We must address \nthis larger problem, or we will continue to suffer these senseless acts \nof violence.\n  This bill cannot undo the tragedy last Sunday at the Empire State \nBuilding. But we can prevent future similar tragedies by closing the \nloopholes that exist in current Federal law that enable foreign \nnationals to obtain firearms too easily. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this sensible and needed proposal.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois for his forceful \nstatement in support of this legislation which will address a gaping \nloophole that exists in the gun laws and which he has ably explained on \nthe floor of the Senate this afternoon where individuals would be able \nto come into the United States on a temporary visa and be able to \npurchase not just perhaps one weapon but a whole series of weapons and \nbe able to use them for whatever purposes they might want here in the \nUnited States or perhaps take them outside of the United States. This \nis a gaping loophole. With the information that is being acquired by \nthe INS, there is no reason it cannot be made available to gun dealers \naround the\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\ncountry with a minimum amount of interference in their ability to sell \nguns in conformance with other provisions of the law.\n  I think this is a really important piece of legislation, and I \nwelcome the opportunity to work with the Senator. Hopefully, we will \nhave it acted on as well as the other provisions that are before the \nSenate dealing with the massive movement of weapons from State to \nState. In my own State of Massachusetts, about 80 percent of the \nweapons that are used in crimes of violence are imported. As good as we \nhave, in terms of the local and State control, we are not able to \ncontrol it and deal with the issues of providing security to our people \nin our State.\n  But I thank the Senator and welcome the chance to join with him and \nlook forward to working with him on the legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Faircloth, and \n        Mr. Bingaman.\n  S. 381. A bill to establish a demonstration project to study and \nprovide coverage of routine patient care costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries with cancer who are enrolled in an approved clinical \ntrail program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the medicare cancer clinical trial coverage act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be reintroducing \na modest but important bill that would establish a demonstration \nproject to assure Medicare beneficiaries with cancer that Medicare will \ncover their routine patient costs when part of a clinical research \ntrial. I am especially proud to have Senator Mack joining me again as \nmy key cosponsor. It is a privilege to work with Senator Mack, who \nknows the anguish of fighting cancer only too well. And, we are \nespecially glad to be joined by so many of our colleagues, including \nSenators Frist, Moynihan, Kennedy, Abraham, Kerrey, Craig, Wellstone, \nCochran, Mikulski, Campbell, Leahy, Jeffords, Hutchison, Hollings, and \nFaircloth.\n  Mr. President, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the \nUnited States. Medicare beneficiaries account for more than half of all \ncancer diagnoses, and 60 percent of all cancer deaths. Over 12,000 new \ncases of cancer will be diagnosed this year in my own State of West \nVirginia.\n  Access to clinical trials is especially important in the field of \ncancer. With today's rapid discoveries of new cancer therapies and the \nlack of effective treatments for some cancers, peer-reviewed clinical \ntrials often provide cancer patients the best available care. Given \ndifferences in biological responses according to age, research is \nneeded on the particular effects of cancer and cancer treatments on \nthose age 65 and older. Our legislation will promote that vital \nresearch. At the same time, it will provide the Health Care Financing \nAdministration with the information it needs on whether coverage for \nexperimental therapies and treatments should be eventually extended to \nthe entire Medicare population. In the long run, the coverage of \npatient care costs in clinical trials will save the health care \ndelivery system millions of dollars by telling us at the earliest \npossible time which medical interventions work and which do not.\n  Our legislation is an effort to give Medicare beneficiaries the \nsecurity and decency of knowing that if they are diagnosed with cancer, \ntheir treatment options will be determined by whatever therapy they and \ntheir doctor decide will give them the best shot of beating the \ndisease. These life and death decisions should not be guided by what \nmay or may not be paid for by the Medicare Program.\n  Currently, Medicare's payment policies are unclear and, as a result, \nunpredictable. There is anecdotal evidence that Medicare, in fact, \nusually pays for the routine patient care costs associated with \nclinical research trials. But when denials do happen, they tend to be \narbitrary and random. This unpredictability discourages Medicare \npatients from enrolling in a clinical trial, even when it may medically \nbe their best treatment option.\n\n  Three winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology have \nwritten me and Senator Mack in support of our legislation. They wrote, \n``clinical trials represent the standard of care and are often the best \nhope for a successful treatment outcome. Only by supporting clinical \nresearch will we be able to advance the state of medical knowledge and \nlearn more quickly which medical interventions are effective and which \nare not.''\n  Mr. President, our legislation is very targeted to give older \nAmericans their best shot at fighting cancer. This bill does not create \na new benefit. It merely ensures that patients enrolled in clinical \nstudies receive Medicare coverage for the same type of routine patient \ncare costs, such as hospital and physician fees, that would be covered \noutside of a trial setting. We are not asking Medicare to pay for the \ncost of research. These expenses will still be covered by trial \nsponsors, including pharmaceutical companies.\n  In establishing a demonstration project, this bill will also provide \nvaluable information about the costs and benefits of providing coverage \nfor clinical trials for other life threatening diseases. We started \nwith cancer first because cancer is a major affliction of Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In addition, there is a well-established national cancer \nclinical trial system to deliver this patient care.\n  Mr. President, this is the year to enact this bill into law. This \nproposal is a key Medicare reform to include in the action expected in \nthe upcoming budget process that will deal with Medicare spending and \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STUDY, REPORT, AND TERMINATION.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary shall study the impact on the \n     medicare program under title\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\n     XVIII of the Social Security Act of covering routine patient \n     care costs for individuals with a diagnosis of cancer and \n     other diagnoses, who are entitled to benefits under such \n     title and who are enrolled in an approved clinical trial \n     program.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than January 1, 2002, \n     the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that contains \n     a statement regarding--\n       (1) any incremental cost to the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act resulting from the \n     provisions of this Act; and\n       (2) a projection of expenditures under the medicare program \n     if coverage of routine patient care costs in an approved \n     clinical trial program were extended to individuals entitled \n     to benefits under the medicare program who have a diagnosis \n     other than cancer.\n       (c) Termination.--The provisions of this Act shall not \n     apply after December 31, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Medicare Cancer Clinical Trial Coverage Act of 1997\n\n\n                              current Law\n\n       Medicare's policy regarding coverage of clinical trials is \n     unclear. Medicare carriers occasionally deny coverage of \n     physician services or hospital charges on the grounds that \n     they have been provided in the context of a clinical trial. \n     Patients or physicians may be at risk for the cost of items \n     or services that are normally covered by Medicare if they \n     choose to enroll in a clinical trial, even though such trials \n     are regarded as the standard of care for treatment of cancer.\n\n\n                            proposed change\n\n       The Secretary of HHS would be required to conduct a \n     demonstration project, beginning no later than January 1, \n     1998, which would study the feasibility of covering patient \n     costs for beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer and enrolled in \n     certain approved clinical trials. Eligibility for coverage \n     would be dependent on approval of the trial design by one of \n     several high quality peer-review organizations, including the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug \n     Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs. No later than January 1, 2002, the \n     Secretary would be required to report to Congress concerning \n     any incremental costs of such coverage and the advisability \n     of covering other diagnoses under the same circumstances. The \n     demonstration project would sunset on December 31, 2002.\n       Supported by: National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship; \n     Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation; Cancer Care, \n     Inc.; National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations \n     (NABCO); US TOO International; Y-ME National Breast Cancer \n     Organization; American Cancer Society; American Society of \n     Clinical Oncology; American Society of Pediatric Hematology/\n     Oncology; Association of American Cancer Institutes; \n     Association of Community Cancer Centers; Cancer Research \n     Foundation of America; North American Brain Tumor Coalition; \n     Leukemia Society of America; National Breast Cancer \n     Coalition; National Childhood Cancer Foundation; National \n     Coalition for Cancer Research; Oncology Nursing Society; \n     Prostate Cancer Support-group Network; and Society of \n     Surgical Oncology.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Rockefeller \ntoday as we introduce legislation to provide Medicare patients fighting \ncancer with coverage of benefits when they participate in approved \nclinical trials.\n  Under current law, Medicare will not generally pay for the costs of \npatient care if they are participating in clinical trials. \nBeneficiaries are denied access to clinical trials of promising new \ntherapies because Medicare deems these therapies experimental, and \ntherefore not qualified for coverage. This means cancer patients who \nare Medicare beneficiaries essentially have two choices when they have \nexhausted all traditional cancer therapies--either pay the costs of \nparticipating in a clinical trial themselves, or go without additional \ntreatment. For all but the most wealthy beneficiaries, it is too cost-\nprohibitive to take part in a clinical trial.\n  Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways the Federal \nGovernment has of determining which treatments are most effective. Yet, \nresearchers have told me they have difficulty accruing the required \nnumber of patients to participate in the trials they are conducting. \nResearchers have identified noncoverage by Medicare and private \ninsurers as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate \nin clinical trials. At a time when American researchers are making such \ntremendous progress in cancer genetics and cancer biology, it is \nessential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through \nwell-designed clinical trials. This legislation will help enhance our \nresearch efforts by facilitating broad patient participation in \nimportant cancer clinical trials.\n  Our legislation is limited to only the highest-quality clinical \ntrials. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-\nreview will be considered. These include trials approved by the \nNational Institutes of Health [NIH], the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, or \norganizations which are approved by the NIH, such as the American \nCancer Society.\n  Like most of my colleagues, I am very reluctant to introduce \nlegislation to expand Medicare at a time when the report of the Board \nof Trustees of Social Security and Medicare clearly shows that Medicare \nis going broke. My support of such legislation is conditional upon the \nadded benefit providing a clear and needed service at no significant \ncost to taxpayers.\n  The legislation we introduce today does not add to Medicare's basic \nbenefit package, but merely provides coverage for routine patient costs \nwhich Medicare is already obligated to reimburse when provided outside \na clinical trial. Medicare will not be responsible for paying for \nresearch or new pharmaceutical products. In addition, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will still be responsible for meeting deductibles and \ncopayment requirements traditionally required by Medicare. Because \nthese beneficiaries are cancer patients, they are already receiving, or \nwill receive in the future, many of the medical services covered by \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, this is a true demonstration program. In 2002, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress detailing \nany cost increases to the Medicare program and provide projects for \nfuture expenditures, if the program continues. Congress can then \ndecide, based upon these data and any hearings which may take place, \nwhether to enact legislation to make coverage of cancer clinical trials \npermanent.\n  Therefore, I am convinced this legislation meets my two criteria for \nexpanding Medicare. First, there is an indisputable urgent need for \nthis benefit and, second, I believe it will not add significantly to \nthe costs of the Medicare system. In fact, the information we learn \nfrom these clinical trials may provide us with more cost-effective \nmeans of treating cancer patients.\n  As I have mentioned to my colleagues before, many members of my \nfamily have battled cancer. As a family, we have worked extensively \nwith numerous cancer organizations. As a Senator, I have met with \nthousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the \nUnited States. They have told me how important it is that patients \nthemselves, not the Government, be responsible for making treatment \ndecisions with their physicians. Patients desperately want to \nparticipate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer \nbeneficial. The legislation which Senator Rockefeller and I introduce \ntoday, which has the enthusiastic support of cancer patient, physician, \nnurse, and research organizations, will empower cancer patients with \nmore treatment choices in a cost-effective manner.\n  I want to commend Senator John Rockefeller for his leadership in \nbringing this issue to the forefront. Senator Rockefeller has always \nbeen there for cancer patients, as evidenced by his landmark 1993 \nlegislation which provided Medicare coverage of anticancer drugs. We've \nworked together on cancer issues on several occasions over the years, \nand it's always a pleasure to work with him.\n  Mr. President, our legislation would provide cancer patients who are \nMedicare participants with an additional choice at a time when a \nclinical trial may be their best, or only, hope for survival. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Medicare Cancer Clinical \nTrial Program Coverage Act of 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, on February 27, 1997, the Macon \nRidge enterprise community, consisting of portions of Catahoula, \nConcordia, Franklin, Morehouse, and Tensas Parishes in Louisiana, is to \nbe awarded the Community Empowerment Award by the American Association \nof Enterprise Zones.\n  I am very proud to have Louisiana's own Macon Ridge recognized as the \nbest enterprise community in the Nation. The Macon Ridge Enterprise \nCommunity is an example to the Nation of the success that can be \nderived from community-based economic development.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture designated the Macon Ridge \nenterprise community as 1 of the 30 rural enterprise communities across \nthe United States, from some 227 applicants, on December 21, 1994. The \nenterprise community is administered by the Macon Ridge Development \nRegion, Inc., which is a multifaceted economic development organization \nserving 11 parishes in northeast Louisiana.\n  The Macon Ridge enterprise community has, in the first 12 months of \noperation, created or retained 523 jobs, started 3 business incubators, \nhad over 523 residents in job training or literacy programs, and \nleveraged some $3.316 million in additional funding.\n  The executive director of the Macon Ridge enterprise community, Mr. \nBuddy Spillers, as well as the Macon Ridge Enterprise Community \nAdvisory Council and the Macon Ridge Board of Directors, are to be \ncommended for their tireless efforts to create the opportunities and \npartnerships in Macon Ridge which have brought about this progress.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I take this occasion to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to the Macon Ridge enterprise community, not only for \nmeriting this award, but for the vast economic development \nopportunities which it has created in Louisiana and for the outstanding \nmodel which it provides to the State and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1764-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TERRY KOEHLER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Involved in a very serious \nskiing accident in mid-February, Mr. Koehler is currently convalescing \nin Reno, NV.\n  In the meanwhile, the entire Bloomfield Hills community eagerly looks \nforward to Mr. Koehler's return. A quick glance at his extensive \ninvolvement throughout the school district and it is readily apparent \nwhy, at present, he is so sorely missed. In addition to his duties \nteaching math, Mr. Koehler is a coach with Lahser's championship \nwinning boy's and girl's swim teams. He serves in the multiple roles of \ncommissioner, coach, and player in the school's intramural basketball \nprogram. He runs the school chess club. And, as a major in the U.S. \nArmy Reserves, Mr. Koehler's civic commitments are hardly limited to \njust Lahser High School.\n  Exceptional teachers are assets to any community, as are dedicated \npublic servants. When someone exemplifies the finest qualities of both, \ntheir presence is all the more valued. Indeed, Terry Koehler is such an \nindividual. I join his countless friends, colleagues, and students in \nwishing Terry, his wife Diane and the rest of his family strength and \ncourage during this difficult time; and I look forward to the news of \nhis return to good health, to the profession he so honorably serves and \nto the students whose lives he touches every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1764-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEW ENGLAND COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and \ncommend the efforts of over 250 community residents from all over New \nEngland who are meeting next weekend in Boston at the First New England \nCommunity Leadership Institute. The 3-day conference of 34 classes, 16 \nroundtable discussions, and 4 networking group sessions is designed to \neducate, rejuvenate, empower, and excite the core constituents of the \nNeighborWorks Network of over 50 New England low- and-moderate-income \ncommunities. These new and emerging leaders are concerned about events \ntaking place in their communities, willing to take on these challenges, \nand eager to become part of the solution. At this event, they will be \nable to share experiences and solutions, motivate and encourage each \nother, and lead their neighborhoods into the 21st century.\n  I would like to commend the tremendous leadership potential of the \nparticipants and their remarkable commitment to improving their \nneighborhoods. Without their support and hard work, the programs, \ninitiatives, and collaborations being formed at the State and Federal \nlevel cannot succeed. In the neighborhoods in which these citizens \nwork, we can already begin to see change taking place in the rising \nhome ownership rates, decreasing crime rates, and growing community \npride. These residents represent the best hope of the future in our \nneighborhoods and Massachusetts is proud to welcome them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1764-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO BRIG. GEN. CASIMIR PULASKI\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Casimir \nPulaski, as we commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth, and \nacknowledge his exemplary service to our country.\n  Casimir Pulaski was born in Warka, Poland on March 4, 1747. Before \ncoming to America in 1777, he distinguished himself in Poland's battle \nfor independence from Russia. Forced to flee his native country because \nof his activities on behalf of Polish freedom, he became an exile.\n  When Pulaski first arrived in America to aid the colonists in the \nAmerican Revolution, he led a valiant counterattack at the Battle of \nBrandywine which saved the retreating American army from being cut off \nby the British.\n  At the insistence of Gen. George Washington, the Continental Congress \nappointed Pulaski brigadier general and the first commander of the \nAmerican cavalry. His services in the field justly won him the title of \n``Father of the American Cavalry.''\n  On October 9, 1779, at the Battle of Savannah, GA, Pulaski led a \ndaring, but fatal, charge against the heavily fortified British forces \noccupying the city.\n  Today, the people of Illinois proudly remember General Pulaski's \ncourageous sacrifice fighting for our Nation's independence, and his \ndefense of the freedoms that we cherish in America.\n  The anniversary of Casimir Pulaski's birth will be celebrated on \nMarch 2, 1997, at a special dinner ceremony in Chicago. I want to take \nthis opportunity to congratulate the Chicago Society of the Polish \nNational Alliance for hosting this commemorative dinner, and commend \nits efforts to help restore the Pulaski Monument in Savannah, GA.\n  The Pulaski Monument, whose cornerstone was laid by the Marquis \nLafayette in 1825, is currently in a state of disrepair. With the hard \nwork and dedication of the Chicago Society and donations from the \npeople of Savannah, this 55-foot-tall historic monument will soon stand \nwith renewed glory as a symbol of patriotism for all future generations \nof Americans.\n  Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Brig. Gen. \nCasimir Pulaski on behalf of my home State of Illinois. I invite my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating this heroic \npatriot and in honoring the many accomplishments Polish-Americans have \nmade throughout history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1764-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1764-S1765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT SANFORD, OWNER OF THE MASON VALLEY NEWS\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nnewspaper publisher Robert Sanford, who is celebrating his 40th \nanniversary as owner of the Mason Valley News. Mr. Sanford's tireless \nstewardship has helped make the Mason Valley News one of the finest \nnewspapers of its kind and a model for journalistic integrity.\n  The Mason Valley News is a weekly newspaper that serves northern \nNevada. Since Mr. Sanford became owner\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nof the newspaper in 1957, the paper has quadrupled its circulation and \ntripled its size--all while remaining true to its roots.\n  Mr. Sanford's newspaper career started as a printer's devil when he \nwas just 14 years old. After World War II, where he proudly served his \ncountry for 3 years in the Army, Mr. Sanford returned home to northern \nNevada and gained experience working in virtually every aspect of the \nnewspaper business. He came to own the Mason Valley News at the age of \n35. Mr. Sanford's two sons, David and James, also work for the paper.\n  It is with great pride and pleasure that I congratulate Robert \nSanford and the Mason Valley News on 40 years of dependability and \naccomplishment and I wish them the best of luck for another successful \n40 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1764-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MILWAUKEE'S MORSE MIDDLE SCHOOL ENGINEERING TEAM WINS NATIONAL \n           ENGINEER'S WEEK REGIONAL FUTURE CITIES COMPETITION\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe achievement of three young women from the Milwaukee Morse Middle \nSchool. Together, Kayla Tepps, Alex Yale, and Carrie Schaffner, formed \nthe winning team in the Regional Future Cities Competition sponsored by \nNational Engineer's Week. They created a city plan using sophisticated \ncomputer simulation software that allowed them to analyze and measure \neffects of their designs on a living, changing city. The students then \ncreated a 3-dimensional model of their city to present in the \ncompetition along with their data. I commend the team's members on the \nquality and character of their hard work.\n  I am impressed with the active role these students have taken in \ntheir education. This sort of initiative leads to citizens who take an \nactive role in their communities. Whether that role be in the \npolitical, social, or economic arena, these young women are an example \nof the potential that our country's youth hold to come up with new \nways, better ways, to solve our problems. These three Wisconsinites are \na example to their peers that women can and do succeed in pursuing \nsubjects and careers currently dominated by men. For this I also \ncommend their teacher, Dave Mongin, for taking an active role in his \nstudent's careers, and their engineer-mentor, Eyad Mizian, for taking \nan active role in his community. They truly represent the kind of \nleadership we need more of in today's schools. I offer these students \nmy sincere congratulations, I am proud that they represent the State of \nWisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1765-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        YOUNG ISRAEL OF FLATBUSH\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nYoung Israel of Flatbush, a major modern Orthodox synagogue in \nBrooklyn, NY, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary on March 2, \n1997.\n  Young Israel of Flatbush has been intensely involved, and provided \nextraordinary leadership, on the local, national, and international \nscenes. It has anchored the enormous development of the Flatbush \ncommunity in which it is located, which is well noted for its \ncommitment to communal service. The Young Israel has long stood for the \nclassic Jewish religious values which are among the shared principles \nof American democracy. In particular, the Young Israel has emphasized \nthrough the years aid and assistance to the needy, both at home and \nabroad.\n  During most of its 75-year history, Young Israel has been served by \ntwo outstanding spiritual leaders, Rabbi Solomon J. Sharfman who \nretired in 1984 after 45 years of service, and Rabbi Kenneth Auman, who \ncurrently occupies the pulpit. Through their distinguished leadership, \nin collaboration with a succession of lay partners, the Young Israel of \nFlatbush has been a source of strength in all aspects of civic and \nJewish life, and at age 75, retains the vigor and optimism of a young \ncongregation.\n  I am certain the Members of the Senate join me in saluting the \nrabbis, members, and officers of the Young Israel of Flatbush on this \nauspicious occasion and wish them continued success in every endeavor, \nsacred and temporal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1765-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1765-S1766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff may \n     tend to affect adversely his or her reputation, may request \n     to appear personally before the Committee to testify on his \n     or her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts \n     relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may \n     submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the \n     cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9 Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the \n     Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all \n     its members, met and considered the alleged contempt, \n     afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in \n     person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and \n     agreed by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such \n     recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10.

All documents or materials removed from \n     the Committee offices for such authorized purposes must be \n     returned to the Committee's secure storage area for overnight \n     storage.\n       9.3. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     registry which will number and identify all classified papers \n     and other classified materials in the possession of the \n     Committee, and such registry shall be available to any member \n     of the Committee.\n       9.4. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other Committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such material pursuant to section 8 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.

No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, to \n     any person not a member of the Committee or the Committee \n     staff for any purpose or in connection with any proceeding, \n     judicial or otherwise, any testimony given before the \n     committee in executive session including the name of any \n     witness who appeared or was called to appear before the \n     Committee in executive session, or the contents of any papers \n     or materials or other information received by the Committee \n     except as authorized herein, or otherwise as authorized by \n     the Committee in accordance with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of \n     the 94th Congress and the provisions of these rules, or in \n     the event of the termination of the Committee, in such a \n     manner as may be determined by the Senate. For purposes of \n     this paragraph, members and staff of the Committee may \n     disclose classified information in the possession of the \n     Committee only to persons with appropriate security \n     clearances who have a need to know such information for an \n     official governmental purpose related to the work of the \n     Committee. Information discussed in executive sessions of \n     the Committee and information contained in papers and \n     materials which are not classified but which are \n     controlled by the Committee may be disclosed only to \n     persons outside the Committee who have a need to know such \n     information for an official governmental purpose related \n     to the work of the Committee and only if such disclosure \n     has been authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of \n     the Committee, or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff \n     Director, acting on their behalf.

Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.8.

An unclassified version of each report may be made \n     available to the public at the discretion of the select \n     committee. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the \n     public disclosure in such reports of the names of individuals \n     engaged in intelligence activities for the United States or \n     the divulging of intelligence methods employed or the sources \n     of information on which such reports are based or the amount \n     of funds authorized to be appropriated for intelligence \n     activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters within \n     the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5. (a) For the purpose of this resolution, the select \n     committee is authorized in its discretion (1) to make \n     investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (2) \n     to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, \n     (3) to employ personnel, (4) to hold hearings, (5) to sit and \n     act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and \n     adjourned periods of the Senate, (6) to require, by subpena \n     or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, and documents, (7) to take \n     depositions and other testimony, (8) to procure the service \n     of individual consultants or organizations thereof, in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 202(i) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, and (9) with the \n     prior consent of the government department or agency \n     concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to \n     use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any \n     such department or agency.\n       (b) The chairman of the select committee or any member \n     thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.\n       (c) Subpenas authorized by the select committee may be \n     issued over the signature of the chairman, the vice chairman \n     or any member of the select committee designated by the \n     chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     chairman or any member signing the subpenas.\n       Sec. 6.

The type of security clearance to be required \n     in the case of any such employee or person shall, within the \n     determination of such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, be commensurate with the \n     sensitivity of the classified information to which such \n     employee or person will be given access by such committee.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Name changed to the Select Committee on Ethics by S. Res. \n     4, 95-1, Feb. 4, 1977.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in \n     which such committee determines the national interest in \n     the disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the \n     executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall notify the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such \n     five-day period, the President, personally in writing, \n     notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of \n     such information, provides his reasons therefor, and \n     certifies that the threat to national interest of the United \n     States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it \n     outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may, \n     by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration. The \n     committee shall not publicly disclose such information \n     without leave of the Senate.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n\n     Upon conclusion of the information of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A),\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\n     (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. Any \n     vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant to \n     this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member of \n     the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within the \n     time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule XIII of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure of such \n     information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which the committee or which Members of the Senate received \n     such information under this subsection, shall disclose such \n     information except in a closed session of the Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on \n     Standards and Conduct \\1\\ to investigate any unauthorized \n     disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer \n     or employee of the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and \n     to report to the Senate concerning any allegation which it \n     finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct \\1\\ shall release to such individual at the \n     conclusion of its investigation a summary of its \n     investigation together with its findings.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 19, H.R. 668.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, by the \nnumber, I am not certain that this is the tax bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is the airline ticket tax issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nhad this discussion with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan. We have worked out an arrangement where Senator Moynihan is \nprepared to have as the effective date the enactment date of this \nlegislation--perhaps I should yield to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Moynihan, for him to speak for himself.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. I would like to say, first of all, that I very \nmuch appreciate the judgment of the Senator from Pennsylvania that the \nbill will be enacted, and that I propose to amend it such that it takes \neffect upon enactment as against the day it is actually passed, which \nis the precedent. But with that agreement, that it will be enacted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is satisfactory. Enactment, after it \nis passed by both Houses and signed by the President, is the effective \ndate that it becomes law.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is correct. I also agree, hearing now that it will \nbecome law.\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may just finish the comment, I have \ngreat admiration for Senator Moynihan. I don't know whether it will \nbecome law or not. If it does, so be it. I just want to be sure that \nenactment is not the day we pass it, but the enactment of the statute \nis the day which it becomes law after passage by the Congress and \nsigned by the President.\n  With that understanding, I do not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the leadership of \nthe Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nNew York. I thank them very much for their leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to make a statement for the Record prior to final disposition of \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Florida that he be allowed to make a statement?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto inquire. Is the Senator from Florida suggesting that he would like \nto make a statement at this point in the Record?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to make a statement at this point in the \nRecord prior to the disposition of this matter.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire how long this might take?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nstatement of the Senator from Florida, my unanimous-consent request \nagain recur with H.R. 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what concerns me--and why I want to make \nthis statement before we vote it--is the irony of what we are doing at \nthis hour of the night. We have spent the past several days, the past \nseveral weeks, debating an amendment of the U.S. Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget. I support that amendment and look forward to \nvoting for it on Tuesday.\n\n  In the midst of that debate, we now at this hour are going to take up \nlegislation to extend the airline ticket tax, which has been expired \nfor 10 of the past 14 months. I support that. We should reenact the \nairline ticket tax. In my opinion, we should not have allowed it to \nexpire as we have.\n  But what is significant about what we are about to do is that we are \nextending the airline ticket tax to September 30, 1997. Why are we \ndoing that? Is it because we do not need the resources of this revenue \nsource beyond September 30, 1997? Clearly not.\n  There are extensive needs in the national aviation system. There are \nextensive needs in virtually every community which has an airport--a \ncommercial airport or a general aviation airport--which benefits by the \nresources derived from this tax.\n  In light of that, why are we enacting this extension from now until \nSeptember 30, 1997? We paid a heavy price because of the fact that this \ntax has been allowed to lapse twice in the past 14 months. This tax \nexpired on January 1, 1996. It was nearly 8 months later, August 27, \n1996, that it was reenacted. That reenactment, however, was only until \nthe end of the calendar year 1996, December 31. It has lapsed since \nthat date until today.\n  So since January 1, 1996 until today, the tax has been in effect \napproximately 4 months. It has been in a lapse status for 10 months. \nEvery day that this tax is not in effect reduces the revenue to the \naviation trust fund by over $15 million; approximately $500 million a \nmonth is lost to the support of safety in the air because of our \nfailure to keep this tax consistently, stably in place.\n  In light of that history, I ask again, why today are we only enacting \nthis until September 30, 1997? Why are we not making this a permanent \ntax today as it has been for most of its history?\n  Well, Mr. President, I must sadly report that we are doing this for \nexactly the reason that we have gotten into a $5.4 trillion national \ndebt. Here tonight, in the middle of the debate on a\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we \nare about to engage in what I consider to be one of the more \nhypocritical actions in terms of our real commitment to a balanced \nbudget.\n  What is the significance of having this tax lapse on the 30th of \nSeptember? The significance is that we are going to count in our budget \nfor the period that will begin October 1, 1997, $6 billion of revenue \nfor the next 10 years, or $60 billion of additional revenue based on \nthe way in which the U.S. Senate scores its legislation. The House, \nwhich uses a 5-year rule, is going to score $30 billion of additional \nrevenue because we are allowing this tax to lapse on the 30th of \nSeptember.\n  Mr. President, I know you are a prominent business person and deal \nwith complex financial matters. You say, how can this be? What has \nactually happened in the last 14 months is, we have lost $5 billion of \nreal revenue. Four percent of the Federal deficit for fiscal year 1997 \nwill be the loss of revenue by allowing this ticket tax to lapse for 10 \nof the past 14 months. Yet, Mr. President, we are about to set up a \nprocess where it is almost guaranteed to lapse again.\n  The reason we are doing it is because under our arcane budget rules, \nif the tax is not in place as of the beginning of the fiscal year, we \ncan assume that it is all fresh, new revenue and therefore we have \nfound $60 billion in order to support other spending or to finance tax \nreductions. It is no real additional money. In fact, every expectation \nis there will be less real money because there will be a hiatus in this \ntax after September 30.\n  Why do I feel relatively confident, although sadly so, that there \nwill be a hiatus in this tax after September 30, 1997? The answer is \nbecause we have virtually ordained that it shall be. Why have we done \nso? Because last year we passed an aviation reform bill, and in that \nbill we provided that the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary \nof the Treasury would report to the Congress on their collective \nrecommendations as to what kind of permanent method of taxation we \nshould use for commercial aviation.\n  There is a dispute that has broken out between various segments of \nthe commercial aviation industry as to how the tax should be \nstructured. The interesting thing is that we are about to pass a bill \nin which the tax will expire on September 30. When do you think the \nreport that we have already requested will be submitted to Congress? \nThe answer is in October 1997. So we are not even going to get the \nreport upon which we are supposed to make a judgment until after this \ntax has expired.\n  I suggest we are virtually guaranteeing that we will have yet another \nlapse in this tax, yet another hole in the trust fund that millions of \nAmericans look to, albeit in a distant, obscure way, but they look to \nit with hopes that that trust fund will help make their period in the \nskies above America a safer experience.\n  The fact is that we have removed $5 billion of that safety over the \nlast 14 months, and we are about to pass a bill that is virtually \nguaranteeing that we will remove more of it. And we are doing it \nsolely, in my judgment, in order to be able to create a fictitious $60 \nbillion that we can then use in order to justify other spending--not \nspending in aviation but spending in any area that we choose to do so, \nor reduction of taxes. If you want to know why in the last 20 years we \nhave added almost $4.5 trillion to the national debt, you are looking \nhere tonight at an example of the very kind of accounting gamesmanship \nthat has gotten us into our current posture.\n  It had been my original intention to offer an amendment to this bill, \nas I did in the Finance Committee, to extend this bill at least to the \nend of the calendar year so that we would have an opportunity to \nconsider the October report, make a reasoned judgment, and enact \nwhatever permanent reforms we want to enact without suffering another \nlapse in revenue.\n  However, I recognize at this late hour the chances of such an \namendment being successfully considered are nil. I also recognize the \nimportance of getting this tax back in place as rapidly as possible so \nthat we can stop the loss of the $5 billion.\n  Now, some might say, isn't it a good idea to have this tax lapse for \n10 of the last 14 months. Has that not resulted in a bonanza of savings \nto American commercial aviation users? The fact is there has been some \nof that. Some airlines have, in fact, reduced their ticket price by the \namount that was represented by the 10-percent tax which is embedded in \nthat price. Others have not done so. So in some instances the American \nflying consumer has paid the same amount for the ticket but has not \nreceived the benefit of investment in the safety of our airways.\n  It will be my intention as soon as possible to introduce legislation \nthat will make this tax permanent and will eliminate the ``Perils of \nPauline'' that we have experienced first in August 1996 and now again \nin February 1997.\n  One of the reasons that we are rushing to enact this now is that the \ntrain is almost at the ``damsel in distress.'' The FAA has said that \nthey are in a position now that within the next few weeks, if not days, \nthey will be in a position of having to send out notices to aviation \nfacilities across the country that they cannot meet their obligations \nbecause the trust fund will have been depleted.\n  For that reason, I do not believe it is prudent to add one additional \nabsurdity on top of the pile of absurdities that are represented by our \nactions relative to this aviation tax over the last 14 months. I regret \nthat we are taking this action. I am afraid that it casts a pall on our \nseriousness of commitment to a balanced budget amendment when we have \noften used the analogy with a balanced budget that it is like a serial \nkiller who has written on the wall, ``Stop me before I kill again,'' \nthat we need the balanced budget amendment to say, ``Stop us before we \ncommit deficit again.''\n  Well, this is a good example of why we will need that constitutional \namendment because clearly we are not showing that kind of discipline in \nadopting this legislation tonight. This is not a proud day for the \nSenate. It is not a happy day for the U.S. taxpayers. I hope that we \ncan indicate to them that they will do better at some future date.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous-consent request to \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 19, H.R. 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 668) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to reinstate the Airport and Airway Trust Fund excise \n     taxes, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is the first bill passed by the \nCommittee on Finance in the 105th Congress, and characteristically, it \nwas adopted by unanimous vote. I would point out that 6 of the 10 major \npieces of legislation reported by the Senate Finance Committee during \nthe 104th Congress also were passed unanimously. We are off to a good \nstart in the Finance Committee this year, and I hope we maintain this \nfine tradition under the able leadership of Senator Roth.\n  We are here today because the taxes levied to finance the airport and \nairway trust fund have expired. These taxes largely support the \noperations of our Federal Aviation Administration, including our \nNation's air traffic control system. They also finance our airport \nimprovement program, providing grant money for important airport \nequipment and infrastructure improvements. Collection of these taxes is \ncritical to maintaining and improving our national air transportation \nsystem and continuing to fund airport modernization projects, aviation \nsafety enhancements, and airport security efforts.\n  On February 4, the Finance Committee held a hearing on the status of \nthe trust fund, which we found to be critical. There is an unexpected \nshortfall in the trust fund. The Treasury Department had transferred \nestimated trust fund excise tax receipts to the trust fund based upon \nan assumption--now known to be inaccurate--regarding the timing of tax \nreceipts. The Treasury Department was required to reverse this \ntransfer, and we are informed that a correcting transfer of almost $1.2 \nbillion has been made.\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\n  The trust fund will be depleted much sooner than expected, which has \nconsequences. FAA informs us that while the air traffic control system \nwill be funded through the end of the fiscal year, funds for FAA \ncapital programs will be depleted in March. If we do not act promptly, \nFAA will be forced to halt new airport improvement grants, and to \ncancel contracts that are designed to improve airports and airway \nsystems in every part of the country. These programs could include \nbetter bomb detection equipment, improvements for better communication \nbetween pilots and controllers, and safety and security studies.\n  The Finance Committee under Chairman Roth's leadership moved quickly. \nOne day after our hearing, we unanimously reported out a bill to extend \nthe trust fund taxes through the end of the fiscal year, or September \n30, 1997, and to allow Treasury to transfer trust fund tax receipts to \nthe trust fund, no matter when the taxes are collected.\n  The House has now passed identical legislation. It therefore falls to \nus in the Senate to pass this bill, promptly and without amendment, and \nto send it to the White House for the President's signature.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 668 \nwhich extends the aviation ticket tax through the end of fiscal year \n1997. This tax is essential to the day-to-day operation of our Nation's \naviation system. Money to improve, maintain, and run our airports is \nwholly supported by fees paid by the users of the air transportation \nsystem. It is not paid for by the taxes we all pay on April 15. Air \ntravelers paid for our airports in the form of a 10 percent ticket tax \nevery time they flew prior to December 31, 1996. That money has been \ngoing into the airport and airway trust fund, and the money is then \ndisbursed through the appropriations process.\n  We have told people to pay this tax, and we have told them we will \nthen spend it on airports and making improvements to the air \ntransportation system. I know that there is a great need to refurbish \nour Nation's airports. In South Carolina, I visit small airports and \nsee the condition of the runways. Small airports cannot generate the \nfunds needed without the assistance of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, which provides the necessary money from the trust fund.\n  Our problem now is that the ticket tax expired at the end of 1996. \nDue to budget games, the money that we thought would be in the trust \nfund is not there. Originally we were advised that the trust fund would \nbe broke in July, but it will be depleted as early as March. If this \nsituation is not corrected, millions of dollars in airport \nmodernization projects, aviation safety enhancements, and airport \nsecurity efforts will have to be delayed or terminated. The obvious \nanswer to this untenable situation is to reinstate the aviation ticket \ntax, and that is why I am supporting H.R. 668. I urge my fellow \ncolleagues to quit playing budget games and start fulfilling one of \ngovernment's primary functions--preserving the safety of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us to reinstate the aviation excise taxes, which \nsupport important aviation safety and security improvements, as well as \nsystem capacity enhancements. It is our duty to take action now to \nrestore this vital revenue stream. I commend the Finance Committee for \nrecognizing the urgency of this situation and moving the legislation \nforward on a fast track.\n  The aviation excise taxes lapsed on December 31, 1996. Current \nestimates show that if we do not restore the aviation trust fund taxes \nimmediately, the trust fund balance will be insufficient to pay for the \nsafety and security programs we approved last year as part of the \nFederal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration predicts, and budget officials confirm, that under \ncurrent circumstances capital spending on aviation will come to a halt \nin March. We are clearly doing the right thing by approving this \nlegislation in these emergency circumstances.\n  I am disappointed, however, that we could only agree to extend the \ncurrent tax structure for aviation improvements until the end of \nSeptember. I fear we will face another tax lapse at that time, and risk \njeopardizing the trust fund sponsored programs again. The taxes for \naviation safety and security should remain in place until we are ready \nto offer a suitable alternative to the current structure. Congress last \nyear established the National Civil Aviation Review Commission to study \nand make recommendations along these lines. The term of the tax \nextension should coincide with this process.\n  Nevertheless, I endorse this legislation because my foremost priority \nright now is restoring the viability of the trust fund. I realize that \nif the Senate successfully extended the term of the reinstatement \nbeyond September, the House would object. We would have to take the \nissue up in conference, and thus delay resolution of a situation that \nhas already reached critical mass. Realistically, we would probably end \nup in a position no better than the one we are in today.\n  That said, we should be clear about one of the main reasons we are \nsetting ourselves up for another lapse. The dedicated aviation trust \nfund taxes have fallen victim to congressional budget games. The excise \ntaxes that support our aviation system expired late last year and late \nthe year before, following years of uninterrupted renewal. Congress \nfigured out that if it allows the aviation taxes to lapse, it can \nreinstate the taxes later, and use the revenues to offset tax cuts or \nincreased spending elsewhere in the budget.\n  This is budget chicanery, pure and simple. We should use the taxes \npaid by air travelers and shippers exclusively for aviation safety, \nsecurity and capacity improvements. When we use these aviation revenues \nto offset spending elsewhere in the budget, the American people \nrightfully question how we intend to use their dedicated aviation \ntaxes.\n  More important, we should not play with this dedicated aviation \nrevenue stream, simply to take advantage of convoluted congressional \nbudget procedures. The need for budget process reform is clear. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to impress upon them \nthe reality that it does not matter if revenues and appropriations are \naccounted for on different sides of the ledger. Even if the excise tax \nrevenues are deposited in the trust fund, deficit pressures will reduce \nincentives to spend these funds for their dedicated purpose--aviation \nsafety and capacity improvements.\n  Budget process reform is a debate for a later date. Today, I rise in \nfull support of this legislation to reinstate the aviation excise taxes \non a short term basis to support critical aviation safety and security \nimprovements. We must remain vigilant in seeing this legislation \nthrough to enactment. Any further lapse in the taxes that support the \ntrust fund would jeopardize safety-related capital improvements, and \nshake the public confidence in the Government's ability to safeguard \nthe Nation's air travelers.\n  We should all be held accountable for not letting the excise taxes \nthat support our aviation system lapse in the future. It would be wrong \nand irresponsible for us to let the aviation trust fund get caught up \nin our budget games again.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to first thank Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan, the entire Finance Committee, and its staff, for \nacting quickly on reinstating, for a short term, the taxes that fund \nthe Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]. Many of you may not be aware \nof how the FAA is funded, or how critical its mission is to our \neconomy.\n  The FAA receives its funds from two sources--the general fund and the \nairport and airway trust fund. The trust fund, up until December 31, of \nlast year, was supported by a series of excise taxes--a 10 percent \nticket tax, a 6.25 percent freight waybill tax, a $6 international \ndeparture tax, and two noncommercial aviation fuel taxes. For Fiscal \nYear 1997, the appropriation for the FAA was $8.563 billion. A total of \n$3.1 billion comes from the general fund, and $5.3 billion from the \ntrust fund.\n  One thing many of us fail to really comprehend is how important \naviation is to our economy. We know that a safe and efficient air \ntraffic control system, and a well functioning FAA, are key components \nto our economy. The President recently recognized the importance of \naviation to our country by stepping in to stop a strike at American \nAirlines.\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\n  Let me put some numbers out to explain how critical aviation is--the \ntotal annual impact of aviation to our economy is $771 billion. That is \na staggering figure, but we all know that travel for business and \ntravel for tourism are key components of our local economies.\n  Failure to reinstate this tax will bring the FAA effectively to a \nhalt. Yes, the air traffic controllers would be paid, as would the \nother FAA staff. But, my colleagues should understand that no money--\nabsolutely no money, would be available to buy new air traffic control \nequipment and to fund airport development.\n  This is not a simple problem. The FAA has under contract billions of \ndollars for new equipment. If the FAA is not able to pay its \ncontractors, it will have to give them adequate notice to shut down the \nprograms. This means more than not buying a piece of equipment next \nweek, but shutting down existing programs underway. The lawyers will be \nsuing each other for years.\n  I want to also state that last year, this body worked hard to pass an \nauthorization bill for the FAA. As those of you that were here will \nrecall, we stayed in session an extra week to get that bill through. \nThat bill was and is important because it set a course for doing \nsomething different for the FAA--fundamentally changing the way it does \nbusiness and how we fund that agency.\n  The long-term funding question remains unanswered. To answer that \nquestion, this body voted to establish a 21-member Commission. The work \nof the Commission must move forward, and it must be done expeditiously. \nWith reconciliation looming, any change in the current system--a new \ntax system or a new user fee system--must be worked out now. The entire \naviation industry must agree to how much money the FAA needs, and who, \nand how to pay for it.\n  I know that many of my colleagues share this view, and look forward \nto working this matter out with them.\n  The lapse in the ticket tax and the uncertainty over funding, is \nsomething our high technology, safety organization--the FAA--cannot \nafford. Our constituents and families cannot afford it either.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important issue \nrelated to reinstatement of the aviation excise taxes. Financing for \nthe Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], and for the aviation safety \nand security initiatives it supports, is an issue of critical \nimportance in both the short and the long term. That is why the last \nCongress established a process for achieving a long-term solution.\n  The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 created the National \nCivil Aviation Review Commission, and tasked it with developing \nspecific legislative proposals for long-term FAA funding. \nUnfortunately, the administration has failed to appoint any of the 13 \nmembers it is responsible for appointing to the Commission despite the \nfact that the reauthorization act was signed into law nearly 5 months \nago. This Commission has very important responsibilities and it needs \nto begin its work soon. The exercise we are engaged in today clearly \ndemonstrates that need.\n  The Commission has a limited time in which to complete its tasks and \nmust begin its work immediately. In fact, an independent assessment of \nthe funding needs of the FAA should be completed this week. The \nassessment was prepared specifically for the Commission s use. However, \nbecause the administration has failed to make any appointments, there \nprobably will not be a Commission to receive the assessment.\n  The aviation leadership of the Commerce Committee wrote to the \nPresident on January 28 to request that he take action to ensure that \nthe commissioners are appointed immediately. I have also made \nTransportation Secretary Slater aware on numerous occasions of the \nurgency of the Commission appointments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President \non this subject from Senators Gorton, Hollings, Ford, and myself be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, the Federal Aviation \n     Reauthorization Act of 1996, Public Law 104-264, established \n     the National Civil Aviation Review Commission to address the \n     two very important issues of aviation safety and long-term \n     funding of the national air transportation system, \n     particularly the Federal Aviation Administration. We worked \n     closely with the Administration to craft this legislation, \n     and we appreciate the Administration's support. However, the \n     act set down a firm time line for the Commission to follow in \n     accomplishing its many tasks, including important issues \n     related to aviation safety. It is time now to move forward \n     and enable the Commission to do its work.\n       Thirteen members of the Commission are to be appointed by \n     the Secretary of Transportation. Given the time constraints \n     of the act and the critical nature of the Commission's \n     duties, we hope that you will act swiftly to ensure the \n     appointment of these commissioners. We expect that the \n     Congressional leadership will move forward in concert with \n     the Administration in making its own appointments. However, \n     the leadership has waited for the Administration to make a \n     move before it completes its appointments so that \n     Congressional appointees can provide any needed balance in \n     the composition of the Commission.\n       We urge you to take action to ensure that these \n     commissioners are appointed as soon as possible. The \n     Commission has a great deal to accomplish and time is running \n     short. In February, an independent assessment of the funding \n     needs of the FAA should be completed and the work of the \n     Commission must begin in earnest. Knowing of your commitment \n     to a safe and secure aviation system, we look forward to your \n     swift action on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     John McCain,\n       Chairman.\n     Slade Gorton,\n       Chairman, Aviation Subcommittee.\n     Ernest F. Hollings,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Wendell H. Ford,\n       Ranking Member, Aviation Subcommittee.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee will yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. As the chairman knows, the \ncongressional leadership also has responsibility for appointing eight \nof the members of the commission. I wanted to confirm my understanding \nof the congressional leadership's responsibility for making \nappointments to the commission. Am I correct in believing that the \ncongressional appointees were designed to ensure that the commission is \nnot composed simply of people representing just the views of the \nadministration?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The majority leader is absolutely correct. As mentioned \nin our letter to the President, the chief sponsors of the FAA \nreauthorization bill wanted to be sure that the commission was a \nbalanced group. We fully expected the administration to act very \nquickly to appoint commissioners, so that then the congressional \nleadership would have an opportunity to address any perceived biases or \nomissions.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate your confirming my understanding of the intent \nof the reauthorization act. Also, I join you in urging the \nadministration to make its appointments without delay. The commission \nmust begin working on a long-term funding solution so that we can avoid \nsuch problems as we are addressing today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the majority leader for providing \nme this opportunity to clarify the matter of appointments to the \nNational Civil Aviation Review Commission. His support and leadership \nhave been instrumental in the efforts of the Commerce Committee to \naddress the needs of the National Aviation Transportation System.\n  At this point, I once again urge the administration to assume \nresponsibility for making appointments to the National Civil Aviation \nReview Commission, so that the long-term funding needs of the FAA can \nbe addressed.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on H.R. 668, had this been a rollcall \nvote, I would like for the Record to reflect that I would have voted \n``no.''\n  No one is more supportive of aviation safety than myself. I have \npointed out\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\non the Senate floor that I have actually been in a plane crash.\n  But, I oppose this measure because I believe that the American people \nare taxed too much. Why is it that general revenues, collected through \nincome taxes, are not enough to cover such basic government services as \nsafe skies.\n  Further, even if we were to impose such a fee, we should find \noffsetting spending and tax cuts so that we do not increase the tax \nburden on the American people. Regrettably, this effort failed in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Finally, this tax could be restructured so that it does not punish \ntraveling Americans, but such a report on restructuring is not due \nuntil October of this year.\n  For all of these reasons I oppose the ticket tax.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 668) was passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman from \nDelaware for his efforts in this matter. I think it is clearly the \nright thing to do. The alternative would have been a catastrophe with \nour aviation programs in this country. We did not really have any \nalternative, and I think we have taken the right step. The proof that \nit is the right thing to do is that it passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse, I think close to 370 votes perhaps, and in the Senate, while \nthere are some reservations about it, we are able to move it with \nunanimous consent.\n  So I thank the leadership of the committee.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the majority leader yield for a comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, this is the first measure to be \nreported from the Committee on Finance, and once again it was reported \nunanimously. In the last Congress, of the 10 major measures that came \nout under the leadership of Senator Roth, 6 were unanimous, which \nspeaks of his chairmanship and prudence and desire to enhance revenues.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad the Senator put it so delicately, Madam \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I would just like to say to the \ndistinguished majority leader, it would not have been possible to have \ngotten this through unanimously without the active support of the \nranking member, and I publicly thank him for his contribution.\n  I should also like to point out that what we did is exactly what was \nrequested by the administration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. ROTH. To carry it out until September 30. And that is exactly \nwhat we did. I think this is a wise move. It protects the safety of our \nair passengers. I thank the leader for his help in this matter.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I just concur in those remarks. \nMay I also report that the trust fund began in the administration of \nPresident Nixon, and our distinguished Senator from Utah was the person \nwho managed the representation up on Capitol Hill, from the Department \nof Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1771-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 378\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to draw the Senate's \nattention to a statement that was made yesterday by an individual \nheavily involved in the debate on partial-birth abortions. Like most \nAmericans, I oppose partial-birth abortions. These latest facts which \nhave now come to light show that the defense of this indefensible \nprocedure has been built on some outright lies.\n  Yesterday, Wednesday, February 26, in the New York Times, there was a \nstory that ran on page A-11, detailing the admissions of Ron \nFitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers. In the course of that article, and in another \npublished in the American Medical News dated March 3, Mr. Fitzsimmons \nadmits to lying, ``through [his] teeth,'' during his defense of \npartial-birth abortions, when he said that the procedure was used \nrarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses \nwere damaged.\n  ``It made me physically ill'' to make these statements, he said. ``I \ntold my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' ''\n  The lies he admitted to focus on three major issues about partial-\nbirth abortion, which is a terrible procedure, a late-term child being \npulled out, mostly delivered, turned over, and then the abortion \nperformed.\n  The lies he admitted to focus on three major issues: No. 1, the \nnumber of these abortions performed annually in the United States; No. \n2, the physical health of the mother and child involved; and, No. 3, \nthe timing of the majority of partial-birth abortions.\n  In an April 10, 1992, news conference announcing his veto of a ban on \nthis procedure, H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the \nPresident said, ``This terrible problem affects a few hundred Americans \nevery year.'' And that has been continued to be claimed by a number of \nothers. Yet, Mr. Fitzsimmons' admission is different. In the New York \nTimes he now says the ``procedure is performed far more often than his \ncolleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy \nfetuses.''\n  The Medical News story reports on an investigation done by the \nRecord, a Bergen County, NJ, newspaper, and they stated this:\n\n       The New Jersey paper reported last fall that physicians at \n     one facility performed an estimated 3,000 abortions a year on \n     fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks of which at least half are by \n     intact D [dilation and evacuation]. One of the doctors was \n     quoted as saying, ``We have an occasional amnio abnormality, \n     but it's a minuscule amount . . . most are for elective, not \n     medical reasons; people who did not realize, or didn't care, \n     how far along they were.''\n\n  The Washington Post investigation turned up similar findings.\n  I report that and put that forward here to the Senate, as this is an \nissue that is one of the front 10 Senate bills to face this body. It is \na bill I hope we can act on. It is a bill, passed last year by both the \nHouse and Senate and vetoed by the President, to ban this late-term-\nabortion procedure, a procedure that is an abhorrent procedure, opposed \nby virtually all American people. Now we are finding out from some of \nthe leading people advocating on the other side that they \nmisrepresented--indeed, he said, ``outright lied'' about the number and \nthe timeframe as to when these were performed.\n  I hope we can move forward aggressively and quickly on banning this \nprocedure in America. And I hope the President will reconsider, in \nlight of these factual statements, in light of this information that is \ncoming forward from particular people involved directly in the \nindustry, and that he will sign the bill this year, when we pass this, \nto ban this horrendous procedure that has continued to be allowed in \nour civilized country.\n  I commend all Senators to read this article that appeared yesterday \nin the New York Times, and the article I cited that is going to be \nappearing in the Medical News. I think it will add new light to this \nsituation, and, hopefully, we can move forward, united, to take away \nthis terrible situation that continues to happen in our country.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/27/senate-section/article/S1775-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
