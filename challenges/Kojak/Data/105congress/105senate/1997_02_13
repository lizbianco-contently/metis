The able majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil the hour of 3 p.m. this afternoon. This will accommodate a number \nof Senators who have requested time to speak on various matters.\n  Following morning business today, there will be a number of items \nthat are possible for Senate consideration. Due to several scheduling \nconflicts, I am uncertain at this time exactly whether or not we will \nbe able to make further progress on Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. But it is my hope \nthat at some time today the Democratic leader and I will reach an \nunderstanding as to the number of amendments that are expected to \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 as well as an indication as to when we might \nbe able to complete action on this important constitutional amendment.\n  We have worked very hard at trying to accommodate all Senators' \nschedules, and, of course, this morning we have a funeral service for \nAmbassador Harriman and other problems in that area we tried to \naccommodate. We have taken up a few amendments and voted, but earlier \nmy conversations with the Democratic leader were that he did not see--I \nbelieve this is a fair statement--any reason why we could not complete \nthis work by the end of this month. So we have today and then 5 days \nwhen we come back after the Presidents' Day recess. I hope we can get a \nlist that would have a reasonable amount of serious amendments and then \nget an agreement on a time to complete that action.\n  We want to make sure we have a full debate, everybody feels that they \nhave been treated fairly, but there needs to be a limit on how long \nthis goes on. We have been acting so far this year in good faith. We \nhave been trying to accommodate each other's schedules, but when we \ncome back we are going to have to move these amendments through the \nprocess and get a final vote because we do have other work we would \nlike to bring to the floor.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have scheduled a rollcall vote on the \npending amendment offered by Senator Byrd. That vote will occur at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, February 24, the day we come back. It is also possible \nthe Senate will vote today on a resolution submitted by Senator Specter \nregarding milk prices. If an agreement can be reached, we will have a \nshort period of debate on that resolution followed by a rollcall vote.\n  We are also still attempting to clear consideration of a resolution \nrelating to the American Airlines strike which was submitted by Senator \nHutchison. This is timely, obviously. We are looking at the possibility \nof a strike which could cripple that airline and impact jobs in the \nthousands all over the country. So I am hoping that we could pass a \nresolution expressing our concern and urging the President to use his \npowers to find a way to avoid this threatened strike.\n  Finally, there are a couple of nominations that were reported from \ncommittee yesterday. We may be able to clear those nominations for \naction. I am not sure that they would even require a vote, but we will \nhave to work through it here in the next 3 or 4 hours. This is the last \nday of the session prior to the Presidents' Day recess, so I thank my \ncolleagues for their cooperation as we try to finish business at a \nreasonable hour today. We will notify all the Senators when we may have \nactual rollcall votes. And, again, we have had good cooperation, but we \nhave not had a lot of pressure in terms of schedule, and when we come \nback we really have to begin to make some progress on these amendments, \nand I hope we will be able to do that.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1339-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, we will have several more of my colleagues \nhere to discuss how the balanced budget amendment benefits children.\n  I will begin by saying that as a new Senator, I am in awe of these \nsurroundings. Every day I reflect on the history that has taken place \nin this Chamber. I think of the people who have been here before me and \nhear them referred to in speeches on a daily basis.\n  Much of the history of this great Nation has been shaped in this \nChamber. Every day we are in session history is being made. Right now \nwe are debating the balanced budget constitutional amendment. That may \nbe the most important piece of legislation to be debated during my \nlifetime because of the implications it has for the future of our \ncountry.\n  A new revolution may be taking place in this country. A few years \nago, I was given a book by my pastor to read. It was a scholarly review \nof social cycles in the history of the United States. The baby boomers \nwere one of those cycles. I am part of that. They were concerned \nprimarily for themselves but also for others as long as there was \nsomething in it for them. It revealed how in the history of the United \nStates there have been three recurring cycles. But following each \nperiod when we tried to be sure we took care of ourselves and \ninstituted programs to make sure others were taken care of, provided we \nwere included, that generation was followed by a reactionary \ngeneration, and the reactionary generation took away the ``gifts'' of \nthe previous generation.\n  In last week's balanced budget debate, we heard a lot of comments \nabout Social Security. I am mentioning this reactionary generation \nbecause I want to make sure we protect Social Security not just today \nbut for the time to come. All of us here are concerned about Social \nSecurity, and to say otherwise is just political hogwash. But the only \nway to protect Social Security is to include it in the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. That is why the President's budget proposal \nand every budget prior to that included Social Security in the budget. \nWe cannot continue to ignore the interests of our children and \ngrandchildren--members of that reactionary agenda.\n  What does the incredible debt that we have built up have to do with \nfuture generations? The Federal debt is $5.3 trillion. None of us \nunderstand how much $5.3 trillion is. But the reactionary generation \nthat follows will learn, and they will learn all too soon. As they \nbecome saddled with tremendous debt, they will realize what the \nmagnitude of how much $5.3 trillion really is.\n  Already this reactionary generation says that they have a better \nchance of seeing an unidentified flying object than they have of seeing \n$1 of their Social Security money when they retire. They see no hope \nfor the future, and they look forward to a lifetime of putting in 7.45 \npercent or more of their paycheck and having that matched by their \nemployer with another 7.45 percent. That is 15 percent that could have \nbeen their earnings, that could have been money in their pockets or in \ntheir own retirement accounts. When they realize that they will not \nreceive a dollar of that money, what do you suppose their reaction will \nbe? Will they protect Social Security for those already in the program? \nWill they care? Will there be a legislative revolution?\n  As an accountant, I am fascinated with the budget discussion because \nwe are talking about numbers, and that is exciting. We are talking \nabout balancing budgets. We are talking about formats that will provide \nus with the most information possible, and we are doing it in the \ncontext of a real budget dealing with real people. We are doing it in \nthe context of a history where we have only balanced the budget once in \n40 years--and that was 28 years ago.\n\n  Some very valid accounting concerns have been raised here in debate \nby opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I have \nheard reference to the need for capital budgeting. I have heard \nreference to a need for Social Security to be off budget. I have heard \nreference to the need to take care of accounting problems that happen \nduring recessions. As an accountant, I applaud this insight into the \nneed for new accounting methods.\n  Not only am I an accountant but I used to be the mayor of Gillette, \nWY, as it went through a boom and increased in population about two and \na half times. I know from having been through both kinds of economic \ncycles that growth presents many of the same problems that recession \ncauses. Under both situations a capital budget is required. We really \ndo need Federal capital budgets and cash-flow management budgets. We \nneed to list all of the capital purchases, vehicles, buildings, etc., \nthat this Government needs to buy for the next 1 year, 2 years, 5 \nyears, 10 years, 50 years. I have found out that many agencies or \ndepartments have no idea how much capital they have. We need to have \ncash-flow budgets so that as the cash arrives the purchases can be made \nwithout extensive deficits. That is good business.\n  When I heard the Democratic leader speaking about capital budgets \nlast week, I got excited. That is the kind of accounting that we should \nhave already had. But, this kind of accounting has nothing to do with \npassing the balanced budget constitutional amendment. It is just good \nbusiness. Whether we have a capital budget or not, we need a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Last week I heard a lot of debate about the need to take Social \nSecurity off budget. Off budget is a fascinating accounting term. In \nfact in my accounting references I could not even find that term. And I \nhave to say from listening to the discussions that there does not seem \nto be a lot of consensus as to what off budget really means.\n  It looks like we found a catch word that scares senior citizens and \nmakes everyone think this will save Social Security. As one who daily \napproaches being a senior, I want to see us get the rhetoric out of \nthat term. We give the impression that Social Security has enough money \nat the moment. We talk about the surpluses going into Social Security \nand being used in the budget.\n  Accountants frown at the word ``surplus'' revenue. Surplus implies \nmore than what is needed. That is not the case with the Social Security \ntrust fund. We give the impression that money is being put aside in a \nspecial account for our seniors so that when they retire there will be \nmoney to be drawn out in their names. That is not even close to what \nactually happens.\n  In order for the money that people are paying into Social Security \ntoday to be available for them when they retire, the system must be \nactuarially sound. That means that the money going in now at the rate \nof investment allowed on that fund has to generate enough revenue so \nthere will be a payout for the period of time promised. We have \npromised to pay out money for the remainder of a person's life at not \nonly the rate that he or she is entitled to at the time they retire, \nbut also with cost-of-living allowances.\n  We have already passed laws in this country that force businesses \ndoing pension funds to make their funds actuarially sound. They have to \nbuild a fund that at the time of retirement will have enough money in \nit that can pay the benefits for that person for the promised amount of \ntime which is usually the balance of his lifetime. That is the law. \nBusinesses are in the process of meeting that at an extreme cost to \nthemselves. If we force businesses to keep their promises, then why do \nwe not fulfill our promise to the same people and keep our accounts \nsound?\n  At the present time Social Security is at least $9.3 trillion away \nfrom being actuarially sound. Do we have a way to generate that money? \nNo. We have to perpetuate the current system. That is why we cannot \nprivatize the system. We would bankrupt the system immediately if we \nallowed younger generations to take their money and put it in their own \nfund instead of putting it in to be paid out to our seniors \nimmediately.\n  We need to have a system where we can see how far in debt we are. And \nwe need to do that not just for Social Security but for every single \ntrust fund that we have. We either have to change the accounting system \nto account for the funds honestly and show how much of a deficit there \nis, or rename them so that they are not trust funds. Perhaps we should \ndo both.\n  OK, we agreed to do a system of pay in and pay out trying to build up \nsome surpluses to take care of the coming influx of people going into \nretirement.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n But, when the baby boomers reach full retirement, the Social Security \nsurplus will decline at a dramatic rate, eventually going broke by the \nyear 2012.\n  Yes, we need a new accounting system for Social Security. Yes, we \nneed that system now. No, it is not a part of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. It is a part of a good government proposition \nand we need to grapple with it and get it under control. The issue of \nwhat accounting system to use should not determine if we vote for or \nagainst a balanced budget amendment. A new accounting system is needed, \nbut the balanced budget amendment is essential.\n  The only hope for Social Security is a balanced budget, then switch \nto an accounting system that will realistically deal with the actuarial \nneeds of Social Security so that we can protect it for future \ngenerations. Otherwise we will have a revolution that will take away \nseniors' Social Security.\n  Last week I also saw many copies of the pocket Constitution of the \nUnited States being held up and explained. I too, carry my own copy of \nthe Constitution of the United States. It was given to me some years \nago by a district judge when I was in the State legislature.\n  When I was mayor, on Constitution Day, I used to give all members of \nthe city council a copy of the Constitution and encourage them to read \nit. Sometimes we read it as a part of the proceedings of the city \ncouncil meeting. This document is an astonishing document. The insight \nby our forefathers was incredible. But this debate has also raised some \nconstitutional issues.\n  I have heard discussion that some people in this body consider this \nto be a draft. It fascinates me, that, with the exception of one single \nprovision, the Founders of this Constitution considered it to be a \ndraft. In article 5, instructions are given on how a change in the \nConstitution can be made. They made it difficult, but possible to \nchange. The balanced budget constitutional amendment has to pass by a \ntwo-thirds vote in each House and then it must be ratified by three-\nfourths of the States.\n  I think those people who are opposing a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment know in their hearts that this time it will \npass and will also have swift ratification by the States. If we did not \nbelieve it would be ratified by the States, this would be an easy \ndebate. But we know the people of the States want it and the States \nwill respond. If just those States with one or more Senators opposing \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment did not ratify the \nconstitutional amendment, it would never become a constitutional \namendment.\n  Why will there be swift ratification? First, most of the States \nalready have a balanced budget requirement in their Constitution. They \nwork under the requirement and know the requirement works. They know \ntheir limitations and the types of challenges that develop from it. \nThey understand that the challenges are not a detriment to the United \nStates having a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  People understand from their own experience that you cannot spend \nmore than you take in. Almost every school child above the third grade \nis able to explain to me that if you spend more money than you take in \nyou go broke. It has been said that we can learn much from children. \nChildren focus on problems in more simple terms. Congress has not yet \nlearned what the children know. The voters want us to stop spending \ntheir money they have not even earned yet. Our children and \ngrandchildren plead with us to balance the budget and quit cosigning on \ntheir behalf for this mountain of debt.\n  Another argument that I have heard in this debate is the need to \nadjust changes or, using a new term, glitches in the economy. $5.3 \ntrillion worth of debt has turned people into unbelievers about the \npaternal role of Government in our lives. We have already wrestled with \nthe $5.3 trillion worth of experiments that wound up with these \nglitches in the economy. Where has it taken us? What do we have to show \nfor it? The people know the Government has little control over the \neconomy.\n  I have heard the argument that families do not balance their budgets \nbecause they borrow for future such situations, and they do not pay the \ndebt off each year. I agree, they do not. But I do hasten to point out \nthat they at least pay off a little bit of the debt every year. Right \nnow we should not only balance the budget, we should include in that \nbalanced budget an enabling legislation provision to pay off the \nnational debt.\n  If you went to your banker and said, ``I want to borrow money to buy \na house, but I don't want to have to pay anything but the interest for \nthe rest of my life,'' would you get the loan? No, you would not. But \nthat is what Government is doing. The Government is saying, we want \nyou, the American people, to be our bankers, but all we want to do is \npay the interest. I can foresee a time when the interest may amount to \nmore than all of the other spending programs, so it will be tough to \neven pay the interest, and we still will not be paying a nickel on the \nnational debt. Will the next generation be reactionary if they pay \nexorbitant taxes and cannot buy anything but interest?\n  This does not begin to mention who finances our debts. We are \nfiscally controlled to a limited degree by foreign interests because of \nthe large increase in their securities holdings. This weakens our \neconomy and independence because the money is taken out of the United \nStates. The interest on the Federal debt increased from 9 percent of \ntotal outlays in fiscal year 1980 to 15 percent in fiscal year 1995.\n  The Federal Government has not been good about limiting or \ndisciplining itself in any way. We understand how happy constituents \nget when we throw money at them and their wants. We also understand how \ndisappointed and a little bit angry they sometimes get when they are \nnot given things.\n  I was in the Wyoming Legislature for 10 years. Halfway through that \ntime, I moved from the house to the senate. At that time the State \nsenate imposed a new rule on itself. We have a very limited time for \nmeeting in Wyoming. We meet for 20 days in a budget session, which is \nevery other year, and 40 days in a regular session. Now we save 2 of \nthose days each time in case the Governor were to veto something, we \ncould call ourselves back into session and override it. So we spend 18 \ndays one year and 38 days the next, and we avoid all special sessions.\n  In recent years one thing has happened that has helped, and that is a \nrule that we imposed on ourselves to limit the number of bills that any \none Senator can introduce in a session. We said that in a budget year, \na Senator could only introduce three bills, and in a regular session a \nSenator could only introduce seven bills. We spent a lot of hours \ntalking about limiting our own right to submit bills. Those who spoke \nmost vehemently against it were the ones who turned in the most bills. \nIt was not unusual for anybody to turn in 30 bills in a regular \nsession. We passed a rule in spite of the opposition. Today the biggest \nsupporters of that rule are the ones who before the rule turned in the \nmost bills.\n  Why the change? The ones who turned in the most bills discovered two \nthings. First, their constituents were more pleased with the bill that \npassed than one that was merely introduced. Introducing and working a \nfew bills resulted in a higher percentage of bills that passed. Second, \nmaybe most importantly, it was much easier to say no to a constituent \nfor a new bill if there was a prohibition against the number of bills \nallowed to be introduced.\n  How does that relate to a constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget? I am suggesting that, if we limit ourselves by a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, we will concentrate more on what we \nreally do well, and the things that we choose to do we will do well. We \ncan have the America of our dreams. We will have more people \nparticipating, we will have less people expecting Government to do \nthings for them, we will have more care and concern for our elders, and \nwe will have more concentration on our children's and our \ngrandchildren's welfare.\n  We have an opportunity now to show that we can care for our parents \nand our grandparents and will provide for our children and our \ngrandchildren. We can move to an honest system of accounting so we can \nend the deficits and pay down the debt to show that we really believe \nthat the future of America is upon us now. We can preserve this as a \nland of opportunity for future\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\ngenerations. The challenge is now. Do we have the courage or do we need \na revolt from the reactionary generation? Please help me to pass the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I will urge all \nAmericans to write and call your Representatives and Senators and tell \nthem to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Passing it 5 \nyears from now will not suffice. We need action now.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, after listening to the Chaplain's prayer this morning, \nI was reminded of the old saying, ``Everybody wants to go to Heaven, \nbut not everybody wants to do what is necessary to get there.''\n  In his State of the Union Message, the President said he wanted to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, but he then went on to express \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment. Without the discipline of \na constitutional balanced budget amendment, neither Congress nor the \nPresident will ever have the courage to pass one.\n  The President has submitted a budget that is technically in balance \nby the year 2002. But let us look at it. If you check the fine print, \nyou will find that 75 percent of the savings proposed by the President \nare postponed until the last 2 years of the 5-year plan, the years \nafter President Clinton's term has ended. That is the problem.\n  Just to cite the statistics, Mr. President, the budget deficit this \nyear is about $107 billion. You would think if you are going to zero in \nthe year 2002, and we are at $107 billion this year, we would reduce it \na little each year until we got to zero. But actually the budget \ndeficit goes up in fiscal year 1997, and the President's policies would \nboost it another $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1998 from where it would \notherwise have been. In fact, in the last year--the year that we are \nsupposed to be at zero--the savings required to achieve balance will be \n$117 billion. So the Congress will have to do more in savings in the \nvery last year of this 5-year plan than we would have had to do to wipe \nout the deficit in its entirety this year. So $107 billion this year; \nwe are going down to zero in the last year, and that last increment of \nsavings is $117 billion.\n  This is like the person who says, ``I'm going to go on a diet. I've \ngot to lose 30 pounds. And I'm going to give myself 6 months to do it. \nBut I think I'll eat real high off the hog for the first 5 months and 2 \nweeks, maybe gain another 25 pounds or so, so that in the last 2 weeks \nI'll lose 55 pounds.'' That is what the President's budget is \nsuggesting. It is precisely why we need a constitutional amendment, to \nforce the President and the Congress to make the tough choices to \nbalance the budget; otherwise, it is the same old thing, just put it \noff until later. We all want to lose the weight, but we do not want to \nmake the tough choices to lose it.\n  Putting off tough choices for as long as possible is typical of just \nabout every budget plan that we have had in the last several years, \nincluding the plan that Congress approved l\\1/2\\ years ago. It is why \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law failed in the 1980's.\n  After all the easy choices have been made in the first few years, \nprogress toward a balanced budget stops dead in its tracks. No one \nwants to make the tough choices needed to achieve the larger savings \nscheduled down the road. So the deadline for the balance is always \npushed off just a few more years.\n  President Clinton's budget postpones most of the savings, as I said.\n  Congress will no doubt come up with a budget that will do the same. \nThat is what always happens. That is why the national debt continues to \ngrow.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago when the balanced budget amendment lost by \none vote, the national debt was approaching $4.9 trillion. Today, the \ndebt is over $5.3 trillion--an increase of about $400 billion. That \namounts to about $1,600--$1,600--for every man, woman and child in \nAmerica. With that increase, each American's share of the national debt \nnow totals about $20,000. That is about what the average Arizonan earns \nin a year.\n  Two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment said a \nconstitutional amendment is not necessary. All we need to do is muster \nthe courage to do it ourselves. That is what our constituents sent us \nhere to do, make these tough choices. But we do not make the tough \nchoices. That is the way it always happens.\n  We actually did pass a balanced budget in the Congress of the United \nStates in 1995. In that year it was the President who vetoed the \nbalanced budget. So, Mr. President, it demonstrates that it is both the \nCongress and the President. When we muster the courage, the President \nis the one who apparently lacks it.\n  Since that time, 2 years ago, Congress has had to add tens of \nbillions of dollars to the budget just to get the President to sign the \nfunding bills into law and keep the Government operating. Just last \nSeptember, Congress had to add $6.5 billion that it would not have \notherwise spent. And that is on top of an increase of about $25 billion \nthe Congress had already built into the year's spending legislation.\n  Desire and good intentions are not enough to ensure that balance will \never be achieved. Unless we are bound by the Constitution, Members of \nCongress and the President will always find some reason to spend more \nor to put off for another year the savings that are needed.\n  The former Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, the late Paul \nTsongas, explained it this way in testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee 2 years ago: ``There are a lot of votes in deficit spending. \nThere are no votes in fiscal discipline. What you have here is a sad \ncase of pursuit of self as opposed to pursuit of what is in the \nnational interest.''\n  Senator Tsongas went on to say this: ``The fact that our generation \ncould have conceived of having a consumptive lifestyle in leaving all \nthat debt behind can only happen if we do not go home at night and look \nat our kids and grandkids and feel something.''\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that our departed colleague really hit \nthe nail on the head. The balanced budget amendment is about our \nchildren and our grandchildren and what kind of country we are going to \nleave them.\n  For most of our Nation's history, each generation has worked hard and \nsaved and invested so the next generation would be a little better off. \nOnly in the last 40 years has that changed. Now Government cannot seem \nto live within its means no matter how much it collects in taxes. It \nhas, quite literally, mortgaged the homes and businesses our children \nwill not buy or build for decades to come.\n  My second granddaughter was born just about a year ago and she \nalready owes, as her share of the national debt, $20,000. In fact, she \ncan expect to pay more than $187,000 in taxes during her lifetime just \nto pay the interest on the debt. What will be left from her income to \ncare for her children? How will the Government care for the needy of \ntomorrow when almost every dollar in individual income tax revenue is \ndevoted just to interest on the national debt?\n  Mr. President, a balance budgeted offers hope. Yes, it will require \nthe Congress to prioritize spending so the most important programs are \nnot jeopardized, and wasteful programs will have to be eliminated. Some \nof the luxuries will have to be postponed. A balanced budget will \nrequire heavy lifting, but offers hope and opportunity to Americans \ntoday and our children tomorrow.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that a balanced budget would \nfacilitate a reduction in long-term real interest rates of between 1 \nand 2 percent. That means that more Americans will have a chance to \nlive the American dream--to own their own home. A 2-percent reduction \non a typical 30-year mortgage of $80,000 would save homeowners $107 \nevery month. That is $1,284 a year, or over $38,000 over the life of \nthe mortgage. That is money in their pockets. A 2-percent reduction in \ninterest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan would save buyers $676. \nThe savings would accrue on student loans, and credit cards, and loans \nto businesses that want to expand or create new jobs. Reducing interest \nrates is probably one of the most important things that we can do to \nhelp people across this country.\n  I know there are those who have doubts. Some will say that balancing \nthe budget may make sense in good economic times, but it is too rigid \nand will prevent us from responding to economic emergencies or other \nhardship when that occurs.\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n  I think it is important first to point out that deficit spending is \nso ingrained in the Federal Government that we have been running \ndeficits in good economic times as well as bad during the last 40 \nyears. Deficits have not been run solely to rescue the economy from \nhardship. If they were, we would not be having this debate today.\n  Second, it is important to remember that the balanced budget \namendment could be waived in times of true emergency. To ensure such \nwaivers were not invoked routinely or without good cause, three-fifths \nof the House and Senate would have to agree. That should not be \ndifficult in the case of real emergency.\n  For example, when Congress extended unemployment compensation in \nresponse to economic problems in 1975, 1980, 1982, and 1991, it usually \ndid so by a three-fifths majority. So the amendment leaves enough \nflexibility to respond to real emergencies.\n  Mr. President, there is now general consensus that balancing the \nbudget is the right thing to do. The President says he is for it, and \nthe Republican majority in Congress says it is for it. We may be able \nto reach an agreement with the President and pass a plan this year to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. But without a balanced budget \namendment, Congress or the President will no doubt find some reason to \nbacktrack from the plan, if not next year, then in the year 2000 or \n2001, whenever the going gets tough.\n  If we are serious about balancing the budget, we must support the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. For our children's sake, we \nmust do it now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment being considered before us \ntoday. In the House of Representatives, I was fortunate enough to have \nbeen involved with the passage of this amendment during the 104th \nCongress and I am honored to be active once again in our efforts to \npass this important amendment, and to help secure the American dream \nfor future generations.\n  Now, proposing an amendment to our national charter is not something \nto be taken lightly. It should be undertaken only for the most \nimportant of causes. The Constitution has guaranteed and protected the \nfreedom of the American people. But it can only continue to defend \nthose freedoms if we give it the ability to defend them. An amendment \nto balance the budget will give our Constitution the strength it needs \nto continue protecting and defending the freedoms that so many \nAmericans enjoy.\n  A balanced budget promises hope for the future, not fear as the \nnaysayers will tell you. It promises to draw down interest rates, spur \nnew investment decisions and increase our gross domestic product. It \npromises lower unemployment and more take home pay. And very \nimportantly it promises to help protect our Social Security system.\n  Without it our economic security is threatened. One of the most \ninsidious aspects of our budget deficit is that it amounts to a hidden \ntax on our income, and on our children's future income. This hidden tax \nis felt by everyone who has taken a loan to pay for school, buy a car, \nor purchase a home. Higher interest rates are the taxes levied by a \ngovernment that has not the courage to live responsibly or even \nhonestly. We must balance the budget and thereby eliminate this hidden \ntax.\n  The Joint Economic Committee estimates, and you have heard the \nestimates before, but I think they bear repeating, that yearly savings \non an $80,000 home mortgage would amount to $1,272 by balancing the \nbudget and that a student fresh out of school paying back a student \nloan would save about $180 per year because of the lower interest \nrates. These are not illusory effects or empty promises; they are \nrather the assurances of a responsible Government that balances its \nbudget year after year and pays down the debt.\n  But the Keynesian apostles will tell you the economy will collapse in \ntough times with a balanced budget amendment because it could force \nCongress to take actions that could exacerbate a recession. They are \nwrong.\n  Opponents of the amendment before us argue that deficit spending is \nsometimes necessary to offset the negative effects of a recession, \nnatural disaster, or war and to ease the flow of the business cycle. \nNow, they would argue that during tough times the Government should \ndeficit spend and borrow against future prosperity. But this is simply \nthe wrong approach. Future prosperity is our children's prosperity, and \nit should never be leveraged to provide for the consumptive desires of \nbig Government.\n  This amendment would not force Congress to raise taxes during a \nrecession.\n  Our fiscal policy over the last 40 years has hinged on the desire to \ndeficit spend during times of both recession and expansion. So those \nwho claim this amendment would place a straitjacket on our Nation's \nfiscal policies are correct. It would place a straitjacket on bad \nfiscal policies by placing emphasis on less Government spending rather \nthan more.\n  Deficit spending exacerbates the Federal debt, crowds out private \ninvestment decisions that bolster the economy, and leverages the \ncountry out of future economic growth and prosperity.\n  We must balance the budget by cutting taxes, the right taxes, and \nGovernment spending, cutting that.\n  So why are the opponents of this measure trying to stop the balanced \nbudget amendment?\n  Because, as a matter of economic policy this amendment means an end \nto the tax and spend economics that has given us our bloated, \ncentralized Federal Government. What it boils down to is this: This \namendment will help us put our fiscal house in order by ending faulty \nKeynesian policy and freeing up private enterprise and encouraging \nentrepreneurship. What works in America is the individual creativity \nand ingenuity of our people. This amendment will give us the tool to \nhelp realize that truth.\n  Unfortunately, the fear-mongering attempts by the administration have \nbeen focused on transforming this debate from a debate about hope and \nfuture prosperity to a debate about an imagined fiscal doomsday. They \nwant to continue following the failed Keynesian policies that have \nproduced the most massive peacetime debt in our Nation's history and \nthey know that this amendment will not allow them to do that.\n  Now, I have a chart of what has happened to our Nation's debt over \nthe course of our country's short history. I think it is pretty \ninteresting and telling. You can tell that in earlier times we would \nhold a major debt during times of war, such as during the Revolutionary \nWar, when we had a high debt in this country. During the Civil War, we \nhad a high debt. Certainly, during World War I and World War II, we had \na high debt in this country. But then when you look at between the \ntimes of war, we virtually didn't have any debt at all, or we pushed it \ndown--up until the past 30 years. Instead, during this period of time, \nwe have increased our debt into the massive debt that we have today.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason for this debt that exists today. It \nhas been fiscally irresponsible, morally irresponsible. It is a debt, a \nburden, a mortgage on America that our children will have to pay off. \nIt is morally wrong of us to do that. This balanced budget amendment \nwill keep this from happening in the future, so that future \ngenerations, future children coming into this country, won't be \nburdened with this tax on them, a tax which they never even voted on.\n  Yesterday morning, when I walked into my office, the national debt \nwas $5,325,298,771,668.63. This morning, when I walked into the office, \nthe national debt was calculated at $5,325,967,417,901.67. Now, that \nmeans that, while America worked yesterday, its commitment to paying \noff the debt increased by almost $670 million.\n  Mr. President, that was actually a cheap day for what we are running \nhere lately. Every day that the Senate debates this issue, the average \nincrease in our debt has been a $694 million. So we actually had a good \nday yesterday. But it's still a $694 million increase per day. Every \nday we debate this issue, the debt of our Federal Government grows.\n  Wait, let's talk about it in real terms, per person. Statistics \ncompiled by the Tax Foundation indicate that the median dual-income \nfamily pays a\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nlittle over $15,000 in Federal taxes each year. That means that over \n46,000 families will have to work the entire year just to pay for the \ntime we spend debating this amendment today alone. That is money that \ncould have been spent to send a child to college, or to make a \ndownpayment on a home.\n  I want to talk about it in more personal terms, about Bud Hentzen of \nWichita, KS, and his family and what they are going to owe for interest \non the national debt. Bud is a proud family man. He has 10 children. He \nalso has 30 grandchildren. He did a calculation, and he was a little \nnervous about this. He is proud of his children and grandchildren, as \nwell. He wants to leave them a better and brighter future. He has \nworked hard all his life to provide for his children and for their \nfuture. He wants his country to be strong for them in the future. While \nhe personally has been responsible for providing for those children and \neducating them, he looks at his Federal Government and calculates that \nhis 10 children collectively owe over $700,000, and his 30 \ngrandchildren collectively owe over $4.8 million for a total of over \n$5.5 million just to pay the interest on the debt for the Bud Hentzen \nfamily.\n  That is not right. That is not what we are sent here to do. That is \ncertainly not what Bud Hentzen would want us to do. He told me that the \nonly thing he could tell them about the national debt was, ``I am sorry \nwe left you this debt.'' Well, so am I. We ought to be more than \nsorry--we should be ashamed.\n  This story makes it clear that this debate is about our children and \ntheir future. And it is about the immorality of our present system and \nwhether or not we have the courage to change it for the better.\n  Yet, opponents also claim that Congress does not need a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment in order to achieve balance. It simply \nneeds courage. Well, our recent history proves that this claim is \nfalse. This argument is dubious because it admits that opponents of \nthis amendment are motivated by political expediency, not true reform. \nFor should the importance of a balanced budget disappear from the mind \nof America, the pressure to balance the budget would likely disappear \nfrom the minds of Members of Congress and the Senate. We are here to \ndebate an issue of national importance that the march of time cannot \nand should not erode. This debate is not about the political whim of \nthe day, it is about the economic future of our country. Let us then \nbind ourselves not by the political culture of the day, but by the \nresolve to complete the work we have started.\n\n  The time to act is now. We must not betray our duty to our children \nand grandchildren, to Bud Hentzen's children and grandchildren, by \nfailing to act on an issue that is so important.\n  It is a moral imperative that we balance the budget and that we \nfurther give ourselves the tools we will need. How will future \ngenerations judge us if we have not the strength to end this practice \nof spending our children's inheritance for the sake of big Government? \nNo doubt, when the pages of history have spoken, the debate we are \nherein engaged will be remembered not by the shrillness of the \nrhetoric, but by the consequences of our action. May those consequences \nenrich our Constitution, defend our freedoms, and protect our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to, again, voice my strong \nsupport for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. I \nmight add that there are many ``Bud Hentzens'' in Nebraska, just as my \ndistinguished colleague from Kansas so eloquently stated. The numbers \nare real. I would like to pick up on my distinguished colleagues' \nremarks with the following statement:\n  During this debate, we have heard a number of arguments from both \nsides on the effects of a balanced budget amendment. I believe this \ndebate comes down to one question: Is the balanced budget amendment in \nthe best interest of our children, their children, and the future of \nAmerica? My answer is ``yes.''\n  Balancing our Federal budget is critical to ensuring that the \nAmerican dream lives for our future generations. The real issue behind \nbalancing the budget is our national debt. Mr. President, our national \ndebt has risen to proportions that are virtually unimaginable to most \nof us. Numbers like $5.3 trillion in present debt, or $7 trillion in \ndebt by the year 2002 are so far beyond the range of the daily lives of \nmost persons that these numbers are easily dismissed. But these numbers \ncannot be dismissed. These are not just numbers. Each and every dime of \nour debt represents a burden we are placing squarely on the shoulders \nof our children. It is our children--our children--whose incomes will \nbe taxed to pay off this debt. It is our children who will have to deal \nwith a limited-growth-in-job-opportunity world because the debt has so \nconstricted this economy that opportunities and possibilities will be \nseverely limited for our children. It is our children who may never be \nable to purchase their own homes, or send their children to college, \nbecause their incomes will be consumed with high taxes to pay for an \noppressive Government and make payments on the enormous debt that we \nhave run up for them.\n  The balanced budget amendment is no cure-all. Passing it will not \nsave us from the hard choices required to balance this budget. But it \nwill help us get there. It will force Congress to deal with the budget \nhonestly. It will force Congress down a different path than the one it \nhas traveled for 36 of the last 37 years. It will force Congress to \nbalance the budget. Most importantly, it will force Congress to keep \nthe balanced budget--to keep the balanced budget. It will give our \nfuture generations the hope and opportunities so that they can \ndetermine their own futures and the futures of their children, rather \nthan being held hostage by an undisciplined Congress and an \nundisciplined Government deciding their futures for them by mortgaging \ntheir futures.\n  Creating the kinds of opportunities for our children that we have \nenjoyed will require the kind of economic growth that should be \nAmerica's legacy for the 21st century. It will require bold, strong, \nand imaginative leadership. To get there, we must cut Government \nspending, cut taxes, and cut regulations. We need to cut the size and \nscope of Government and allow private and personal initiative to soar. \nWe must bring Government back to the people, where it is accountable. \nBalancing the budget is critical to this effort.\n  Our children deserve better than a balanced budget based on ``ifs,'' \n``buts,'' ``maybes,'' conditional tax cuts, and conditional spending \ncuts. They deserve the security of knowing Congress is required to \nbalance the budget every year. They deserve to know that Congress will \nnot continue to add to the national debt. They deserve to know that we \nare not playing shell games and numbers games and word games with their \nfutures.\n\n  Either we are going to balance the budget or we are not. Let us be \nhonest. Let us be honest with our children and our grandchildren. Let \nus be honest with this country. Our children deserve better than the \nhocus-pocus that we have been giving them. Where is our leadership? \nWhere is the leadership in this Congress? Where is the leadership in \nthis body? Where is the courage in this body? And where is the outrage? \nWhere is the outrage in the U.S. Congress for what we are doing and \nwhat we have done to the children of this country?\n  We must get control of the Federal budget and America's fiscal \npolicy. We must enforce lasting fiscal discipline on the Congress of \nthe United States. A balanced budget amendment ensures that we will \nbalance the budget for years to come. Regardless of who is President, \nregardless of which party controls the Congress, the balanced budget \namendment would be a nonpartisan enforcer of controlled Federal \nspending and responsible fiscal policy.\n  We owe our children no less. We owe our children more than flimsy \npromises and optimistic assumptions. We owe it to them to make a \nlasting commitment to balance the budget of the United States for years \nto come. They deserve no less than the same opportunities that were \nafforded each of us. In fact,\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nMr. President, they deserve greater opportunities to succeed just as \nour opportunities exceeded those of our parents. That has been the \nlegacy of every American generation. That is the magic of America. That \nis the greatness of America.\n  The only way to ensure this commitment to our children, the only way \nto make sure our promises are not undone, is to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, thank you, and I yield my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, thank you,\n  Mr. President, I have been watching this debate over the last few \ndays, and I heard some of the opponents to a balanced budget amendment \ntalk in a very eloquent way, as I have heard throughout the years. It \nseems like the arguments never change. So what I have done is picked up \na few of these, and I would like to respond to some of these arguments.\n  The other day one of the Members who has argued against a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution for as long as I can remember made \nthe comment that proponents want to treat children like children, \nhiding the hard truth from them, and then went on to elaborate about \nall of the things that are going to happen if we don't fully disclose \nwhat is going on with the proposition of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I can remember so well back when my No. 2 child was learning to ride \na bicycle back in Oklahoma. I can remember when he got on. He was \nwobbling. Maybe, Mr. President, you have gone through the same thing. I \nfinally got him so that he was able to go in a straight, narrow line. \nThen he made his first trip around the neighborhood. He is a hand \nsurgeon today. He came back, and he said something to me that is very \nprofound. He said, ``You know, daddy, I wish the whole world were \ndownhill.''\n  I think what we need to do is be fully honest with everyone and let \nthem know that it is not going to be easy if we pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution because, in fact, the whole world is not \ndownhill. It is going to take some sacrifices. We have demonstrated \nvery clearly what is going to happen if we do not do it.\n  I heard the other day opponents saying they are tired of Washington \ntelling people what to do and the Washington-knows-best mentality, that \nthe balanced budget amendment is the ultimate Washington mandate. I \nsuggest to you that just the reverse is true. We can talk about this \nall we want, but what we are saying to the American people when we deny \nthem the opportunity to have ultimately a balanced budget is we want to \nkeep control of all of these things in Washington.\n  Reference was made yesterday to the Governors who are talking about \nhow they are cutting taxes in their States and the successes that they \nhave had and suggested that the budget balancing amendment, if passed, \nwould force the States to have massive tax increases. Let me tell you. \nThat just isn't true. The problem that we have right now is there is a \nmentality that I think prevails in both bodies of Congress, or did at \nleast up until 1994, and certainly does today in the White House; that \nis this direct relationship between taxation and the deficit.\n  I can remember when this President was sworn into office and he \nappointed Laura Tyson to be the chief financial adviser to the \nadministration. She said--and this is a direct quote--in direct \ncontradiction to 12 years of Republican ideology, ``There is no \nrelationship between the level of taxes a nation pays and its economic \nperformance.'' To me this is really the key to the whole thing--\nsomebody who actually believed that. If you carry it on to its logical \nconclusion, you would say that all you have to do is have a taxation \nlevel of 100 percent, and everyone is going to be motivated the same \nand our revenues would go up. We know, obviously, that is not true. \nThere are many Democrats who knew that wasn't true back when President \nKennedy was President. He came out and said that we have to raise \nrevenues, that we have needs, and that the best way to raise revenues \nis to reduce taxes. He did, and it happened. Of course, we look \nthroughout history and we see it has happened over and over again.\n\n  In the case of all those who are critical of the administration and \nsay that back during the 10 years or the decade of the Republican \nadministrations in the White House, the tax increases, or the deficit \nincreases, came they say as a result of the tax decreases when in fact \nthe total revenues that came into the Federal Government in 1980 was \n$517 billion. In 1990 it was $1.031 trillion, exactly doubled. That \nhappened during a decade of the greatest tax reduction in the history \nof this country.\n  Mr. President, I know that we are coming up toward the end of the \ntime. But I would like to respond to just two more of the statements \nthat have been made.\n  First of all, they said that the balanced budget amendment will give \npoliticians the ``license to cut and slash needed programs.''\n  The Heritage Foundation not too long ago came out--and they have \nupdated it since then--with a study that came to the conclusion that if \nwe took all of the Federal programs and had a built-in increase of 1 \npercent, or 1.5 percent, or 2 percent, you could actually balance the \nbudget, that you could eliminate the deficit without cutting one \nFederal program. The problem is that programs come in--and we have seen \nit happen over the years--historically, they will come in and say this \nis going to meet a problem that we have, the problem goes away, and the \nprogram stays on.\n  I am always reminded of one of the great speeches made in our time \ncalled a ``rendezvous with destiny'' when Ronald Reagan made that \nspeech long before he was in public office. He said, ``There is nothing \ncloser to immortality on the face of this Earth than a government \nprogram once formed.'' That is what we have seen over and over again. \nThis has been going on for a long time.\n  I can remember when there was a very prominent Senator from Nebraska, \nCarl Curtis. Carl Curtis back in 1975 had a bright idea. He said, ``We \nare going to have to do something about this debt.'' I think the whole \ndebt was less than $400 billion at that time. He said, ``In order to do \nsomething about this, we are going to have to show that the States want \nit and that the people want it.'' So he decided to come and ratify an \namendment to the Constitution in advance. I remember when he came to \nOklahoma. I happened to be in the State senate at that time and \nintroduced a preratification resolution where we ratified it in \nadvance. Then all of the rest of the States came in.\n  I would suggest to you that there is a great groundswell out there of \npeople who want this to happen, and they recognize that it is not going \nto happen otherwise. We listen to people stand on the floor. I have not \nheard one person stand up here and say, ``We want larger deficits. We \nwant to increase the debt.'' They don't say that. They say, ``We will \ndo the responsible thing. We need to make the hard decisions.''\n  The problem is that for the last 40 years we have not made the right \ndecisions, and we have not made the tough decisions. Now that we have \nan opportunity, a rare opportunity, one that is realistic, it could \nactually happen, because we only missed it by one vote a year ago.\n  Let me finally conclude by saying that one Senator stood on the floor \nthe other day. This is a quote. He said, ``The budget balancing \namendment is nothing more than a vague and empty promise. Most Senators \nwho support it will not even be here in the year 2002 when it will take \neffect.''\n  Let me suggest to you that as a result of the vote, it is very likely \nthat there will be a lot of Senators who will not be here. I will make \na statement that sounds a little bit extreme. But I have to make it.\n  If you look back at the voting behavior of those U.S. Senators who do \nnot want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, you will find \nthat those are the ones who are the liberals. By ``liberals,'' I am \ntalking about individuals who vote for greater tax increases, who want \nmore Government involvement in our lives. I have a chart here that \nshows that. Those who voted against the balanced budget amendment last \nyear--and there were 33 of them--of those 33, all of them, 100 percent \nof them, voted for the largest--this is called the tax stimulus \nprogram--the largest tax increase that we\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nhad in 1994. And all of them have either a D or an F rating by the \nNational Taxpayers Union.\n  A lot of people forget that we don't have to guess how people perform \nup here because there are all kinds of organizations that are giving us \nratings. How is that going to affect some of the other elections? If \nyou look back and you look at the Members of Congress that were \ndefeated or retired in 1994, in the Senate there are 11, and 8 of them \nfell into this same spending class. In other words, those individuals \nwho are getting defeated now in the polls are individuals who are big \nspenders and individuals who are for tax increases as opposed to \ncutting the size of Government.\n  So I think there are some very real ramifications to this that are \npolitical ramifications. I suggest to you, Mr. President, that there \nare a lot of Members in here who, if they vote against our effort--it \nis a genuine effort for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution--will have to pay the political price for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1340-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1346-S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OUR EDUCATIONAL IMPERATIVE\n\n  Mr. REED. I rise today to speak about an issue that is critical to \nour country and critical to our future, and that issue is education.\n  Education has always been crucial to our country. Indeed, one of the \ngreatest triumphs of our Nation has been the creation of public \neducation through high school and in the postwar years the expansion of \naccess to higher education.\n  Our ancestors grasped a fundamental truth. Education is the engine \nthat powers our economy, and it is the force that sustains our over \n200-year experiment in democracy. ``Yankee ingenuity,'' groomed in the \nschoolrooms of New England and transported across the continent, \nspurred an era of invention that catapulted America to economic \nleadership. But education is more than just economic progress. \nEducation has allowed us to keep faith with the basic tenet of our \ncountry. At the core of American experience is the commitment to equal \nopportunity, and education is the greatest source of opportunity in a \nfree society. It can transcend the circumstances of income, region, \nrace, and gender to reaffirm the enduring belief that an individual \nthrough effort can achieve his or her fullest potential in America.\n  Throughout our history, education has always been an important part \nof the American experience. Today, it is rapidly becoming the essential \ncomponent of our national life. The combination of extraordinary \nprogress in technology, particularly information technology, and the \nunprecedented growth of international commerce has made education the \nkey to our leadership in the world and our prosperity here at home.\n  As we pass from the industrial age to the information age, the work \nof the future demands skills which only can be obtained through \nlifetime learning. And as we move into an era of global competition, we \nfind ourselves pitted against workers and students around the world. \nWhat might have been adequate for America in the age of the Model T in \na more insular world is plainly inadequate in the age of the Pentium \nprocessor and in a world in which the boundaries of business seldom \nconform to the boundaries of nations.\n  As Norman Augustine, vice chairman and CEO of Lockheed-Martin, said, \n``More and more, we see that competition in the international market \nplace is in reality a battle of the classrooms.''\n  The American people recognize that we can and we must do much more to \nimprove the quality of education. Studies comparing American students \nwith their foreign contemporaries in the ``battle of the classrooms,'' \nas referred to by Mr. Augustine, show that American students are not \nfirst in the world. In fact, they are only about average. The third \ninternational mathematics and science study, TIMSS for short, the \nlargest international science and math study ever undertaken, was \nreleased last fall.\n  The study found that U.S. eighth graders scored barely above the \nworld average in science and below the world average in mathematics. \nBeing ``average'' will not sustain the United States in a world where \ntechnology and trade demand excellence.\n  Just last month, Education Week, in collaboration with the Pew \nCharitable Trust, released a report card on the condition of public \nschools in the 50 States. The report characterized public education in \nthe United States as ``riddled with excellence but rife with \nmediocrity.'' With respect to the bottom line, student performance, the \nconclusion of the report is sobering. ``We did not give States a letter \ngrade. If we had, all would have failed. Nationally, only 28 percent of \n4th graders tested in 1994 were able to read at or above the proficient \nlevel and only 21 percent of 8th graders tested in 1992 were proficient \nor better in math.''\n  The American people recognize these shortcomings and the compelling \nneed to enhance education in the United States. They also want the \nFederal Government to play an appropriate role in this process of \neducational reform. Last month, a survey was released by the Coalition \nfor America's Children, and it found that 76 percent of those polled \nfavored increases in Federal spending for education.\n\n  However, spending alone will not reinvigorate education in the United \nStates. At every level of Government--Federal, State, and local--\ncalling on parents, teachers, business and community leaders, the great \ncivic core of America, we must all work together to make education come \nalive in the lives of our children. Our task is twofold: To improve the \nquality of public education and to enhance access to higher education.\n  Now, when we consider elementary and secondary education, we \nimmediately must recognize the central role played by the States. \nHistorically, States have been the leaders in public education from \ngrades K through 12. And when we boast of the extraordinary success of \npublic education in the United States throughout our history, we are \npaying tribute to the foresight and wisdom of State and local leaders \nwho invested in education. But it is not without some irony that today, \nas we talk about devolution of more and more social programs and \npolicies to the States, we at the same time point to the disturbing \nsigns of educational malaise. The ``devolutionists'' frequently \nprescribe the States as the all-purpose remedy for every social \nproblem, forgetting that the States like the Feds are political \ninstitutions awash in conflicting interests and afflicted with lapses \nof political will. That is not to suggest that the role of education in \nthe States has been overtaken. It should suggest, however, that States \nalone have not and cannot cut through the tangle of financial \ndifficulties, political interests and emerging problems that beset \npublic education as we approach the next century. There is a real \nopportunity and need for Federal leadership as a catalyst for reform.\n  In confronting the challenge of public education, we cannot confine \nourselves to just the schools. We must reach out beyond the schools to \nthe children. The first goal of Goals 2000 is that all children will \nstart school ready to learn. And as we discover more and more about \nchildhood development, this goal becomes increasingly more important. \nIt also becomes increasingly more obvious that our efforts must \nencompass the youngest children as well as those children just ready to \nenter school. Scientific evidence points to the critical years from \nbirth to age 3 in the development of intellectual and emotional \nabilities. As such, child care is an essential part of any strategy for \nthe long-term improvement of education. Good prenatal care, pediatric \nhealth care, and quality day care are all components of educational \nreform. In fact, an emphasis on early intervention may save scarce \neducational dollars in the long run. Research indicates that children \nwho attend quality child care programs are less likely to be placed in \nspecial education or to be retained in grade.\n  It is here in the area of child care that the Federal Government has \nlong played an important roll. With the creation of the Head Start \nprogram in 1965, the Federal Government embarked on an ambitious \nattempt to reach low-income children. Over the\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\npast several decades, Head Start has gained widespread and bipartisan \nsupport. But despite this support, the program still only serves one \nout of three eligible children. More must be done to reach a larger \npopulation of eligible children. Moreover, we must consciously develop \nprograms that involve very young children.\n  If we are serious about having all children ready to learn when they \nenter school, then we must commit ourselves to ensuring that every \nchild has affordable access to quality health care and day care. We \ncannot and should not usurp the role of parents. As such, our \nstrategies should be just as much about enabling parents to be better \nparents, with the time and income to do their part, as it is to reach \nout and teach the children.\n  While we summon the will and the resources to prepare children for \nschool, we cannot ignore the urgent need to reform our schools. The \nrecent study by Education Week revealed that on average less than one-\nthird of fourth graders were proficient in reading and less than one-\nthird of eighth graders were proficient in math. In a comparison of \ncut-off points on employer tests to student scores on national \nstandardized exams, researchers, Richard Murnane and Frank Levy, found \nthat ``close to half of all 17-year-olds cannot read or do math at the \nlevel needed to get a job in a modern automobile plant.'' And \nconsistent with these findings, the TIMSS report revealed that American \nstudents were not leading the world but were about average in a world \neconomy that increasingly demands excellence, not mediocrity.\n  In evaluating this lackluster performance, the TIMSS report \nsurprisingly did not blame the usual suspects--too much TV, not enough \nclass time, not enough homework. It turns out that American eighth \ngraders spend more hours per year in math and science classes than \ntheir Japanese and German counterparts. American teachers assign more \nhomework and spend more class time discussing it than teachers in \nGermany and Japan. And, it turns out that heavy TV watching is as \ncommon among Japanese eighth graders as it is among American eighth \ngraders. What then is the problem? The TIMSS report strongly suggests \nthat American students receive a ``less-advanced curriculum, which is \nalso less focused.'' At the heart of this disappointing performance is \nthe content and rigor of what is taught and the techniques used to \nteach it. In short, content and instructional standards are not \nadequate.\n  We will not materially improve public education in the United States \nuntil we adopt challenging standards, assess the performance of \nchildren with regard to these standards, and hold schools accountable \nfor these standards. Standards, assessment, accountability: the keys to \nreinvigorating public education.\n\n  A few years back, there was a popular book entitled All I Really Need \nto Know I Learned in Kindergarten. I guess I was a little slow because \nI'm tempted to say I learned a great deal in the Army and that was many \nyears after kindergarten. One of the great lessons of my Army \nexperience is the transforming power of high quality standards, \nrealistic assessments, and accountability. In the wake of the Vietnam \nwar, a demoralized and publicly scorned military began to reinvent \nitself and, over the last 2 decades, has become one of the most \neffective institutions in the country. Many factors can be cited: the \ndevelopment of an all volunteer force, the leadership of an \nextraordinary group of professionals who served in Vietnam and went on \nto senior positions in the Pentagon. But, a critical, and sometimes \noverlooked, factor was the development of training doctrine that rested \non detailed standards and realistic assessments.\n  As a company grade officer, I saw the transition from unimaginative \nfield manuals couched in general terms to materials that broke down \nmissions into constituent tasks, stressed the mastery of these tasks, \nand, then, the careful merging of individual tasks into group effort. \nAt every stage, clear standards of performance were identified and \nevaluated. Complementing these doctrinal changes was a renewed emphasis \non ``training the trainer''. Professional development was stressed not \nonly for officers but throughout the ranks, particularly non-\ncommissioned officers who are the backbone of the military. Finally, \naccountability, always a hallmark of the military service, could be \nrefocused from the mundane, ``did the troops look good'', to the \ncritical, could the unit accomplish its mission in the most realistic \ncircumstances. American education, today, seems to be at a similar \ncrossroads as the post-Vietnam military. And, the lesson of standards, \nassessments, and accountability seems equally compelling, for education \ntoday.\n  American students are graded from the moment they enter school. They \nrepeatedly take tests. But, seldom are they measured against agreed \nupon content standards. As such, school is less about understanding a \ncore body of knowledge and using that knowledge than it is about \nattendance. For too many students, the only ``standard'' that counts is \nshowing up frequently enough to get a high school diploma. Thus, it is \nno surprise that half of high school graduates would have a difficult \ntime getting a job in a modern automobile plant.\n  In a recent survey by a national non-profit group, Public Agenda, \nreported in the Washington Post, high school students expressed their \ncriticism of school. At the top of their list was the observation that \ntheir classes are not challenging enough. A typical response from a \nstudent is revealing. `` 'I didn't do one piece of homework last year \nin math' he said. 'I just took the tests . I'd get A's on the tests, \nnot do the homework, and I got a B in class. There's just lots of ways \nto get around it.''' This subering comment was found throughout this \ndiscussion in the report, but, the researchers were encouraged to find \n``strong support among students for having tougher standards in class. \nThree-fourths of them said they believed they would learn more, and \nschool would seem more meaningful, if they were pushed harder by better \nteachers.'' As Deborah Wadsworth, the executive director of Public \nAgenda, declared, ``The students seem to be crying out for the adults \nin their lives to take a stand and inspire them to do more.''\n  Standards are about excellence, but they are also about equality of \nopportunity. Diane Ravitch, a professor at Columbia and a former \nofficial in President Bush's education department, wrote,\n\n       ``[n]ations that establish national standards do so to \n     insure equality of education as well as higher achievement . \n     . . they make explicit what they expect children to learn to \n     insure that all children have access to the same educational \n     opportunities.'' Until we establish effective standards and \n     evaluate children according to those standards, we will \n     continue to ignore disparities in the educational experience \n     of children throughout the United States.\n  In keeping with the critical role of standards as benchmarks for \nexcellence and equality of opportunity, it is exciting to note \nPresident Clinton's proposal to develop voluntary national assessments \nfor reading at the fourth grade and math at the eighth grade. These \nassessments could truly be the bridge between standards and \naccountability; the bridge to a renewal of public education, in the \nUnited States.\n  Recognizing the critical role that standards can play in the \nreformation of public education, Congress in 1994 adopted the Goals \n2000: Educate America Act. Goals 2000 sought to place voluntary \nnational standards at the center of national debate about educational \nreform.\n  As a member of the Education and Labor Committee in the other body, I \nwas an active participant in the drafting of Goals 2000. I vigorously \npressed to ensure that standards were a key component of the strategy \nfor educational reform, and that there would be accountability for \nthese standards. One of the persistent failures of educational reform \nis the failure to follow through. We all are aware of repeated studies \nthat chronicle the problems of public education and propose credible \nreforms, but never seemed to go anylace. All of these studies seem to \nlanguish, gathering dust on the shelves. Even if the diagnosis is \nright, no mechanism is put in place to translate plans into results.\n  As such, I thought that, along with standards, the Goals 2000 process \nshould require the state and local educational authorities to answer a \nfundamental question: what will you do when a school or a school system \nfails to meet the standards established for\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\nits students? Failure to answer this question and to act accordingly \nwill doom meaningful educational reform.\n  I was pleased that a provision encompassing this question was \nincluded as a requirement of the state plan pursuant to Goals 2000. In \nthe spirit of the voluntary nature of Goals 2000, the Federal \nGovernment did not mandate any particular approach to failing schools, \nbut, in the process of developing standards-based reform, it would \nprompt states to ask this fundamental question. This provision is still \non the books. However, the overall importance of the state plan has \nbeen diminished. Tucked into the budget signed by President Clinton in \nApril of 1996 is language that removes the requirement for these State \nplans to be submitted to the Secretary of Education.\n  This unraveling of the minimal requirements of Goals 2000 does not \nbode well for ultimately tackling the tough issues of reform at the \nlocal level. Without the ``seriousness'' engendered by preparing a \nsubmission for Secretarial review, these plans might become another \nspecimen on the dusty shelf of accumulated plans for educational \nreform. Moreover, despite the protests of many local elected leaders, \nmany local educational leaders will concede that requirements in \nWashington frequently help them to cut through the tangle of local \ninterests that impede effective local reform.\n  Nevertheless, Goals 2000 is a milestone in emphasizing voluntary \nnational standards and hopefully will continue to serve as a \nspringboard for educational reform. Standards are critical, but without \ngood teaching these standards will also languish.\n\n\n                           IMPROVED TEACHING\n\n  Challenging content standards must be matched by effective teachers. \nContinuous professional development is no longer a luxury and can no \nlonger be incidental to teaching. The exponential growth in knowledge \nand constantly changing insights on teaching techniques require \ncontinual reeducation of teachers. Regrettably, such constant \nprofessional development is the exception today. Resources for \nprofessional development at the local, State, and Federal levels are \nconstrained. But, more than resources are necessary. There must be a \nrenewed commitment by all concerned parties. In particular, teachers \nand their unions must be at the forefront of this effort for \nprofessional development.\n  Teacher unions are powerful forces. They must become powerful forces \nto raise the capability and expertise of their members. Too often, \nteacher unions are perceived as interested only in the benefits of \ntheir members and not the in improvement of education. I do not believe \nthis to be the case, but this perception is widely held and must be \nreversed. Teacher unions should be seen as champions for raising the \nquality of teaching in the United States. That means challenging their \nmembers to be better teachers, helping them to meet that important \nchallenge and, in the small number of cases where individual teachers \nare not up to the challenge, working with local authorities to remove \nthat teacher from the classroom. It also means being full partners in \nlocal reform efforts and viewing this reform effort in terms of what it \nadds to the quality of education rather than what it may subtract from \nthe current status quo. This mission should not be viewed as something \nextra that the union does as a courtesy to the public. It must be at \nthe very core of their activities and increasingly the dominant \nrationale for their existence.\n  At the Federal level, we must encourage this renewal of teaching. I \nam delighted with President Clinton's efforts to support enhanced \nteaching. Under the President's budget, 100,000 more teachers will be \nable to seek certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards. The National Board has worked hard to establish \nnationally accepted credentials for excellence in teachers. Their \ncertification of ``master teacher,'' akin to the board certification of \nphysician specialist, raises the standards for teachers and creates a \npool of mentors who can assist other teachers to excel. President \nClinton has increased funding for other professional development \nprograms like the Eisenhower Professional Development Program and the \nNational Science Foundation's Teacher Enhancement Program. The \nPresident has proposed a series of technology initiatives which will \nalso assist teachers. The President's Technology Challenge Grant \nProgram supports private-public sector partnerships to develop models \nfor using technology in education, such as providing electronic field \ntrips for new teachers to learn from expert teachers and mentors around \nthe country. The President's technology literacy challenge Fund will \nleverage public funds to target school districts and schools committed \nto helping teachers integrate technology into the classroom. Finally, \nthe administration's 21st century teachers initiative will recruit \nthousands of technologically literate teachers to upgrade their \nknowledge and help at least five of their colleagues to master the use \nof technology in the classroom.\n  We have talked about elementary and secondary education. But, \nfrankly, excellent public education at the elementary and secondary \ngrades today is simply a prelude to lifetime learning. As we work to \nprovide students with the skills necessary to achieve and compete in \nthis information age, it is essential that we also expand access to \npostsecondary education.\n  Indeed, according to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60 \npercent of all new jobs created between 1992 and the year 2005 will \nrequire education beyond high school. A college education is also the \nkey to higher wages, as college graduates, on average, earn 50 percent \nmore than high school graduates.\n  For too many families, however, a college education for their \nchildren is growing increasingly out of reach. College costs rose by \n126 percent between 1980 and 1990, while family income increased by \nonly 73 percent. This situation has been coupled with a shift in the \nsource of Federal aid also. In 1975, 80 percent of student aid came in \nthe form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Now the \nopposite is true. As a result, students and families are going deeper \ninto debt as they attempt to pay for the costs of a college education. \nThe average student loan debt burden is expected to reach $21,000 by \nnext year.\n  Steps must be taken to make college more accessible and affordable in \norder to address these trends. I am pleased by the President's many \nproposals in this area. His call to provide assistance to middle-class \nfamilies in the form of a $1,500 tax credit for the first 2 years of \ncollege will cover the costs of most community colleges and provide a \nsignificant downpayment for a 4-year college. It would certainly be a \ntremendous development in our history if for the first time we can \nguarantee at least 2 years of postsecondary education as we now \nguarantee 12 years of elementary and secondary education.\n  Families would also be able to choose a $10,000 tax deduction for \ncollege, for graduate school, community college, and certified training \nprograms. These proposals are a common sense approach to help students \nenter and remain in college, lessen their reliance on loans, and \nprovide an avenue for lifelong learning.\n  Our efforts to increase access to college cannot include tax relief \nalone. We must also provide a boost to the Pell grants created and \nnamed after my predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell. The Pell grant is \nthe foundation of student financial aid for low- to moderate-income \nfamilies.\n  Over the past 20 years, however, we have witnessed the steady decline \nof the purchasing power of the maximum Pell grant. According to a 1996 \ncollege board report, the Pell grant covers only one-third of the cost \nat public universities, down from one-half in the mid-1980's, and about \n10 percent of the cost at private institutions, down from about 20 \npercent in the mid-1980's.\n  The task before us is to restore the purchasing power of the Pell \ngrant. The President has recognized this fact by seeking to increase \nthe maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000. This is a good start. But \nI believe more should be done so we can fulfill the Pell grant's \npromise of providing a substantial and consistent grant to low-income \nstudents.\n  America's future is being forged today in America's classrooms. It is \nour task to ensure that this great work of education is built on the \nsolid foundation of challenging standards, realistic assessments, and \nthorough accountability. It is also our task to ensure that education \nis a life-long process and that affordable higher education must be \navailable to all.\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\n  Our economy demands educated workers. Our democracy requires informed \nand responsible citizens. As we renew public education and open the \ndoors to higher education, we will propel America into the next century \npowered by knowledge, tempered by experience, and committed to justice. \nWe can do no less.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to use the morning business \ntime to further the debate on the balanced budget amendment and to \nindicate that I oppose the proposed amendment to our Constitution.\n  During the 103d Congress, Mr. President, this body wisely rejected \nthe proposed amendment. It did so again during the 104th Congress, a \nCongress which, perhaps unlike any other in our recent history, seemed \nintent on finding different ways to amend the U.S. Constitution, \nactually voting on more amendments to the Constitution than any of its \nrecent predecessors.\n  Mr. President, some of us believe there are many reasons to oppose \nthis constitutional amendment, and we have been hearing a lot of them. \nA number of respected authorities have raised several significant \npoints of concern, including problems related to the role of the courts \nand the power it might confer on unelected judges to set our national \nbudget policies and priorities.\n  Another serious concern that we have heard a lot about and we will \nhear even more about is the damage this proposal could do to the Social \nSecurity Program. There may also be unintended changes to Presidential \nimpoundment authority arising out of the constitutional amendment.\n  I believe that the constitutional amendment, in addition, will lead \nto unnecessary and possibly dislocating restrictions on our ability to \nestablish capital or investment budgets, to even have the kind of \nflexibility that States have or municipalities have when they happen to \nhave a balanced budget requirement.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think the balanced budget amendment leads \nto an effective prohibition on developing a fiscally responsible budget \nstructure that could include a surplus fund, a rainy day fund, a fund \nthat could be tapped for emergencies, such as national disasters or \nmilitary conflicts. The way it is drafted, we would not be able to plan \nfor or project even a small surplus that could actually be used to \nsolve an emergency.\n  Mr. President, during the next several days as we consider the \namendment, I, along with many others, will comment on some of those \nconcerns in more detail as we debate amendments designed to address \nthose defects that I have just listed. For now, Mr. President, I want \nto focus on the underlying assumption behind the proposed amendment, \nnamely that without making this change to our Constitution, the \nCongress and the President will not balance the budget, that it just \nwill not happen. It is a fair issue, it is a fair question, a fair \npremise for this whole debate.\n  Mr. President, the assumption that that job will not be done by this \nCongress and this President is not necessarily right. We have brought \nthe unified budget deficit down since 1992 by about 60 percent. Yet, \nall the rhetoric on the floor has not changed one bit. It has not \nchanged one iota to reflect the fact that real and significant progress \nhas been made in the past 4 years. All of the naysaying about ``it \ncan't be done, it will never be done, Congress and the President will \nnever get together and do this,'' has at least got to be questioned a \nlittle bit by the advocates of the balanced budget amendment when they \nlook at the record of the last 4 years. We have seen several plans \noffered by both sides that will bring the unified budget into balance \nby the year 2002. We have seen that from Democrats, we have seen it \nfrom Republicans, and we have seen it in a bipartisan package.\n  Mr. President, I recall when some of the Republican Members were \npushing for a 7-year balanced budget by the year 2002 using CBO \nnumbers, and the President was not sure he wanted to go with that. But, \nI agreed with the Republicans. I felt they were right, that we needed \nto have that timeframe and have a clear commitment. I still stand by \nthat. Today we have a President and a Congress in agreement that the \ndate we should be going for is the year 2002.\n  In fact, nearly every Member of this body voted for a unified budget \nplan that reached balance by 2002 at some time during the 104th \nCongress, and I really think working together this year, understanding \nthat neither party is running the whole show here, that we can come \ntogether in a bipartisan package that will, in fact, finish the good \nwork we have done and balance the budget by the year 2002.\n\n  Mr. President, all the budget plans I mentioned, all the votes we \ntook, all the progress we have made in the past 4 years, was done \nwithout a constitutional mandate. In fact, it was done without a \nconstitutional amendment floating out among the States, while we wonder \nwhether the States will ratify it or by when they will ratify it. In \nfact, Mr. President, I firmly believe that if we had adopted a \nconstitutional amendment in 1993, 1994, or 1995, and sent it to the \nStates for ratification, that many of those balanced budget plans would \nnot have been forthcoming in this Congress, that they would not have \neven been proposed, because people in both Houses would have been \nlooking to a future date when the hammer would come down, instead of \nbelieving that the hammer is coming down now, where we here have been \nelected to do the job now and not wait for the States to decide whether \nto ratify a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, without the ability to hide behind a lengthy \nratification process, Congress in the last few years has been forced to \nlive up to its rhetoric at least in part. A Member cannot go back home \nand say, ``Listen, I am very eager to cut spending in Washington. I \ndon't know exactly what we ought to cut, but once we get that balanced \nbudget amendment ratified, then we will get back to work on it.'' That \nexcuse is not available now. People in an audience for such a Senator \nor Member of Congress would say back to that person, ``Why don't you \njust do the job now? You were elected to do it now.'' That is, in fact, \nwhat we were elected to do.\n  Mr. President, I do not think the American public realizes that even \nif Congress approves the proposed amendment, it could be another 9 \nyears--9 years--before the balanced budget mandate begins to bite. If \nthe proposal languishes with State legislatures, we might not be forced \nto reach balance in 2002, but until the year 2006. The States get 7 \nyears to ratify, and the provision calls for the amendment to really \ntake its effect, to have its bite, 2 years after that. So it could be \nthe year 2006 if we wait for a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is strong reason to believe the States will not \nact quickly. We have already heard some loud second thoughts from many \nState policymakers about the impact of the proposed amendment on their \nState and local budgets. This proposal may not, in effect, Mr. \nPresident, then be the so-called slam-dunk ratification that some \npeople claim it will be.\n  Ironically, some who voiced their support for a constitutional \namendment may not really care. I do not think this is true of everyone, \nby any means. Some do care. Some are genuinely frustrated and turn only \nto this\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nconstitutional amendment alternative as a last resort. I can think of a \ngreat example, the previous Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, who I \nknow only turned to this alternative, I am sure, out of sheer \nfrustration with the process. He turned to that alternative prior to \nthe progress we made in 1992 through 1996.\n  I am afraid for others who pushed this amendment, the agenda is not \nso much a balanced budget but some political advantage. During the \ndebate, we will have an opportunity to see who really wants to reduce \nthe deficit and who is a little more interested in political posturing. \nI am going to offer an amendment, for example, that would reduce the \ntime for ratification from 7 years to 3 years to prevent unnecessary \ndelay by the States and ensuring Congress does not hide behind a \nprotracted ratification process during which Members could say, ``Well, \nwe are going to get to this balancing of the budget later, after the \nStates get done doing their job.''\n  Mr. President, if this amendment is more than just a political \nexercise, my proposal, my modification of going from 7 years to 3 years \nfor ratification should sail through the U.S. Senate.\n  I have to say I have some doubts about it because the proposed \namendment to our Constitution is, at its core, really political. We \nshould not be shocked by that. Congress, by its nature, is a political \nbeast. What is disturbing, though, is the growing willingness on the \npart of some to place in jeopardy our Constitution in this manner to \nget some momentary political advantage.\n  Sadly, using our Constitution as a political foil is becoming \nincreasingly popular. The so-called balanced budget amendment is only \none of many proposed changes to our Constitution. During the last \nCongress alone, over 130 changes were proposed to the U.S. \nConstitution. Many of them, I am afraid, were offered for political \nends. Many of them are entirely unnecessary. In fact, I say virtually \nall of them are entirely unnecessary to solve the problems at which \nthey are directed.\n  One of them, an amendment to require a supermajority to raise taxes, \nwas brought to the other body's floor solely because it was tax day, \nApril 15, so the proponents could stand up on tax day and make some \nspeeches about it. I am troubled by that use of the constitutional \namendment process. The thought that an amendment to our Constitution \ncould be offered because it presents the opportunity for a really \ntimely sound bite is indefensible. Many of the advocates of a balanced \nbudget amendment may be sincere in their support for the proposal, but \ntheir sincerity does not address the practical problems with the \namendment with a fundamental flaw underlying a constitutional approach.\n  The Constitution, Mr. President, will not solve our budget problems. \nThat says it all. The Constitution cannot solve our year-to-year and \nday-to-day budgeting problems. It will not give us the courage or the \nanswers we need to balance our books.\n  As President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address, all that \nis needed to balance the budget is our vote and his signature. The \nPresident's budget is a good starting place. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on the Budget Committee to build on the President's \nbudget and move beyond to reach balance, without using the Social \nSecurity surplus. We don't have to amend the Constitution to do that.\n  As I noted on the Senate floor last year, for over 200 years, the \nConstitution has served this Nation very, very well. It is essential to \nthe continuing development of our young Nation that the Constitution \nremains a statement of general principles, not a budgeting document.\n  In charting a different course, one which allows the Constitution to \nserve as a method of addressing each difficult challenge we face in \nthis Nation, inevitably, Mr. President, we will sacrifice the integrity \nof the most fundamental document of our Nation. This process will \nsacrifice the integrity of our Constitution.\n  We must guard against the U.S. Constitution becoming what James \nMadison feared would be, in his words, ``little more than a list of \nspecial provisos.''\n  Mr. President, the Constitution remains the cornerstone of our \nfreedom. Its power is its brilliant simplicity. The spate of \nconstitutional amendments offered over the past few years are at odds \nwith the fundamental notion that our Constitution establishes the \nframework or great outlines of our society. By seeking to use that \ndocument to address specific problems, no matter how severe, the \nConstitution will become something much less than it was intended to be \nand that it has been.\n  Although our Nation faces many problems--and I think the issue of \nbalancing the budget may be our most important problem--no problem can \nreally be attributed purely to a constitutional deficiency. We should \nquell our desire to amend this great document and, instead, address the \nproblems that confront this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest, after the process of the balanced budget \namendment debate is over, that we get, as fast as we can, to the real \nwork of balancing the budget and leave the Constitution alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time between 12 \nand 1 p.m. is divided between the Senator from Rhode Island and the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. As I understand it, the time reverts, \nat 1 o'clock, back to the proponents of the amendment, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed until 1 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Social Security program is America's time-honored \ncommitment to our senior citizens that we will care for them in their \ngolden years. It says to our seniors that you have worked hard and \nfaithfully paid into Social Security for all those years of labor, and \nwhen you finally retire, Social Security will be there for you. It will \nhelp you pay the rent, buy your groceries, and maintain a reasonable \nstandard of living throughout your retirement.\n  But under the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment, the \nSocial Security contract with America's senior citizens is broken. If \nthis amendment is added to our Constitution, then no one can assure you \nof a Social Security check every month.\n  The Rock of Gibraltar, on which our Nation's senior citizens have \ndepended for the past 62 years would be reduced to shifting sand.\n  The Reid amendment, which will be considered later this month, \nprevents this unacceptable outcome by protecting Social Security from \nthe proposed constitutional amendment.\n  The Reid amendment is needed because millions of the Nation's retired \ncitizens live from check to check. They need that check to arrive on \ntime at the beginning of each month to pay their bills.\n  Martha McSteen, who headed the Social Security Administration during \nthe Reagan administration, and now is president of the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said recently,\n\n       Keeping Social Security safe from budget tampering is \n     frankly a matter of life and death for millions of Americans. \n     For 10 million Social Security beneficiaries age 65 and \n     older, their monthly Social Security check amounts to 90 \n     percent or more of their income. Those checks keep 40 percent \n     of America's seniors out of poverty.\n\n  But under the proposed constitutional amendment, if Government \nrevenues fall unexpectedly or Government expenses go up, payment on \nSocial Security checks could stop.\n  If the balanced budget constitutional amendment is enacted, senior \ncitizens may well find that the check is not in the mail after all.\n  Three months ago, in November 1996, the House sponsors of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment agreed that this could happen. \nAs Congressman Dan Schaefer and Congressman Charles Stenholm said, \nunder the proposed constitutional amendment ``the President would be \nbound,\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nat the point at which the Government runs out of money, to stop issuing \nchecks.''\n  And now we learned just this week that this unwise constitutional \namendment could deny the Social Security program access to the trust \nfunds in the future. American workers have contributed their payroll \ntaxes to build up the trust so that when the baby boomers retire, there \nwill be enough money there to pay for their Social Security. But now we \nlearn from the experts in the Congressional Research Service that the \nproposed constitutional amendment could place the trust fund off \nlimits. The money will be sitting there, and the Social Security \nprogram will need it to write Social Security checks. But if the \nbalanced budget amendment is adopted, the Constitution will just say \nno.\n  Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded in an \nanalysis provided to Senator Daschle on February 5:\n\n       Because the balanced budget amendment requires that the \n     required balance be between outlays for that year and \n     receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social \n     Security surpluses would not be available for the payments of \n     benefits.\n  Clearly, Social Security benefits are at risk under the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  There are those on the other side who don't want America's seniors to \nknow that this proposed constitutional amendment puts Social Security \non the budget chopping block. They say that our concern about Social \nSecurity is a scare tactic.\n  But economists say there is a 50-50 chance in any given year that the \nbudget projections will be wrong and that under this constitutional \namendment, the Government will run out of money. Economic forecasting \nis not an exact science. The projections of budget experts could be off \nby only 1 percent. But under this constitutional amendment, that is \nenough to throw the budget out of balance and put Social Security \nchecks at risk.\n  Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, agrees. When \nthe committee was debating this constitutional amendment on January 30, \nhe said that under the proposed constitutional amendment, ``Social \nSecurity would have to fight its way, just like every other program.''\n  Senator Hatch went on to say that he believes Social Security ``has \nthe easiest of all arguments to fight its way.''\n  I don't believe we should take that gamble when the future of the \nSocial Security program is at stake.\n  There is nothing--nothing--to assure our seniors that their Social \nSecurity checks will survive the budget battles that lie ahead.\n  Senior citizens deserve more than speeches of good will by supporters \nof the constitutional amendment. If those who support this unwise \nconstitutional amendment are committed to protecting Social Security, \nthey should write that protection into their proposal and adopt the \nReid amendment.\n  President Clinton wrote to the Senate Democratic leader on January 28 \nabout the risk to Social Security. He said to Senator Daschle:\n\n       I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \n     constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose \n     grave risks to the Social Security System. In the event of an \n     impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be \n     waived nor met, disbursements or unelected judges could \n     reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. \n     No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social \n     Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment \n     overrides statutory law.\n\n  In the State of the Union Address, President Clinton added:\n\n       I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a \n     balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in \n     time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as \n     judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes.\n\n  But supporters of the balanced budget amendment are ready to cast \nSocial Security to the winds. They say to the Nation's senior citizens, \n``We are going to toss your retirement, your safety net into the rough \nseas of Federal budgeting and see if it can stay afloat.''\n  We cannot let that happen.\n  The balanced budget constitutional amendment turns its back on almost \na decade and a half of bipartisan progress in protecting Social \nSecurity.\n  In 1983, the Greenspan Commission recommended that we should place \nSocial Security outside the Federal budget. The Commission said we need \nto build up a sufficient surplus in the trust funds to have enough \nmoney to provide checks to baby boomers when they begin to retire. And \nwe can't do that if Social Security is subjected to the same ups and \ndowns as the rest of the Federal budget.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans supported this proposal. The \nCommission's recommendations were introduced as bill S. 1 sponsored by \nSenator Dole and Senator Moynihan. That bill required Social Security \nto be placed off-budget within 10 years. A bipartisan 58-to-14 vote, \nincluding 32 Republicans and 26 Democrats adopted the conference \nreport.\n  In 1985, Congress accelerated the process of placing Social Security \noutside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of \n1985--the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law--exempted Social Security \nfrom across-the-board cuts or sequestration.\n  Even more important, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law said Social \nSecurity could no longer be included in the unified budget of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  As Senator Gramm of Texas emphasized during the Senate debate on the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings proposal:\n\n       This bill takes Social Security off budget. So if you want \n     to debate Social Security, go to the museum, because that \n     debate is over. . . . The President cannot submit a budget \n     that says anything about Social Security. It is not in order \n     for the Budget Committee to bring a budget to the floor that \n     does anything to Social Security. Social Security is off-\n     budget and is a free-standing trust fund.\n\n  From that point on, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal \nbudget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time the \nCongress of the United States voted on a budget that included Social \nSecurity was 1985.\n  Congress supported this change by wide bipartisan majorities. The \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by a 61-31 vote in the Senate \nand a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives.\n  In 1990, some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security \nback into the Federal budget. But Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz \nrejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security \nremain off budget, and the Senate approved an amendment to protect \nSocial Security by a 98 to 2 vote. In fact, the final Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990 speaks forcefully of Congress's intentions to \ncontinue to protect Social Security. In section 13301 of that act, the \ntitle reads, ``Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.'' It says \nplainly that Social Security,\n\n       . . . shall not be counted as new budget authority, \n     outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n  Again in 1995, section 22 of the congressional budget resolution \namended the budget act even further to protect Social Security. In a \nprovision entitled the ``Social Security Fire Wall Point of Order,'' it \nsaid that any effort to include changes in Social Security in the \nFederal budget were subject to a 60-vote point of order in the Senate.\n  The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would reverse \nthese years of progress in protecting Social Security. These efforts to \nprotect Social Security and insulate it from the annual battles over \nthe Federal budget were started by the Greenspan Commission. Senator \nDole sponsored the bill in 1983 that got us started. And Democrats and \nRepublicans alike rallied to preserve the Nation's Social Security \nsystem.\n  But now, supporters of the balanced budget amendment are prepared to \nturn their backs on this important history.\n  For almost 15 years, they joined Democrats in arguing that Social \nSecurity should be protected. But now they have decided that Social \nSecurity should be left to its own in the budget battles that lie \nahead.\n  Some argue that if we fail to include Social Security in the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, it will cause even steeper cuts than \nnecessary in other programs like education or health care or highways. \nThey say that even President Clinton's balanced\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nbudget--while holding Social Security outside the overall Federal \nbudget--still counts the Social Security surplus to bring the overall \nFederal budget into balance.\n  But under current law, Social Security is protected, whereas under a \nconstitutional amendment it is not.\n  Under current law, even when the President counts Social Security in \ncalculating whether the budget is balanced, neither he nor Congress nor \nthe courts can use the budget process to change Social Security. Even \nif Republicans tried to use the Federal budget to cut Social Security, \nthey could not under current law.\n  A balanced budget constitutional amendment would end these \nprotections. Including the Social Security trust funds on the \nGovernment's balance sheet may be a useful way to reach a balanced \nbudget today. But what about the year 2020 or 2030, when baby boomers \nretire and trust funds decline? If Social Security is not off-budget, \nwe would have only three choices. First, we could cut Social Security \nbenefits. Second, we could raise taxes. Or third, we could cut billions \nof dollars from education, health, national defense, and other \npriorities to keep the Social Security checks flowing.\n  We must--and we will--balance the budget. We must--and we will--take \nsteps to ensure the solvency of Social Security well into the future. \nBut it makes no sense to jeopardize Social Security by subjecting it to \nthe requirements of this blunderbuss constitutional amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect Social Security by supporting the \nReid amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to look forward, in the next few days--\ncertainly before the end of the month--to join with my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Reid, and other Members of the Senate, in urging \nsupport for the amendment that Senator Reid will propose, which will \neffectively remove the Social Security trust funds from the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I offered that amendment in the Judiciary Committee. We ended up with \na tie vote, 9 to 9. We had the support of a Republican on that \namendment. But the Judiciary Committee was virtually evenly divided on \nthat issue, virtually evenly divided.\n  What we hear from our friends and colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives is there is increasing recognition of the importance of \nseparating the Social Security trust funds from the consideration of \nthe balanced budget amendment. I think that is wise. I believe, \nhopefully, that the Senate will reach that conclusion.\n  Mr. President, we can ask ourselves, is the Social Security trust \nfund of such special importance that we ought to consider it separately \nfrom the overall budget considerations? I suggest that it is, and not \njust because it is a lifeline for our senior citizens, and has been \ndepended on for over 60 years by those who reach their golden years to \nbe able to live in peace, dignity, and security. I think that would be \na compelling enough reason to separate out the Social Security.\n  But, Mr. President, for another very important reason, which has been \nunderstood by Republicans and Democrats alike, since the report of the \nGreenspan Commission in 1983 where, virtually unanimously, the members \nof that commission recommended that Social Security be separated from \nvarious budget considerations, and it was only a year or so after that \nthat a bipartisan leadership amendment was offered and supported \noverwhelmingly by Republicans and Democrats alike, that they would put \nthis off budget for a period of some 10 years. Later, in 1985, under \nGramm-Rudman measures, Republicans and Democrats--if you read the \nhistory of that debate, one of the prime reasons that that particular \nproposal was passed was because Social Security would be removed from \nthe considerations of the budget, and that was, again, the position \nthat was accepted in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 98 to 2 back in 1990. \nSo we have the recommendations of the Social Security Commission, you \nhave the action that has been taken by the Senate, and in a bipartisan \nway, in 1984-85, and repeated in 1990.\n  Now, why do the Members of this body believe that that fund ought to \nbe different? Well, I say that it is a very different fund, for a \nnumber of reasons. The most powerful one is because, as I mentioned \nbefore, of that contract that will be out there and exists between the \nseniors and the Federal Government, when it was established that there \nwould be a guarantee that those funds would be there as long as people \npaid in. That was the contract. People understood it. The elderly \nunderstood it.\n  But, now, under the balanced budget amendment, by including the \nSocial Security trust funds in that--and if that amendment were to pass \nand be ratified by the States--that would be at risk like all the other \nspending would be at risk, because of the language of the balanced \nbudget amendment. And that is recognized by the floor manager of the \nbill, Senator Hatch. It was recognized by those that were the principal \nspokesmen. Mr. Miller ,formerly of OMB, recognized that that would be \npart of the spending limitation. Now we receive assurances from those \nthat propose the balanced budget amendment, ``well, that is going to be \nOK because there will be more support for Social Security, so we really \ndon't have to worry about it.''\n  Well, Mr. President, all we have to do is look at the assaults on \nSocial Security in the last Congress by many of our good Republican \nfriends. Look at the period of the 1980's. I was here on the floor of \nthe Senate when there were other assaults on Social Security. I am not \none that is prepared to say, well, we are going to just let the dice \nroll and see whether this continues to remain in the balanced budget \namendment and the trigger is pulled on the balanced budget amendment, \nthat Social Security will be out there trying to do the best it can in \nterms of the spending limitations. Look at what happened in the last \nCongress--increased funding for defense over what was recommended by \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and assaults in terms of the Social Security \ntrust system. That was the record, Mr. President.\n\n  I don't think the seniors ought to have to be put in the position \nwhere their futures, their livelihoods, their whole security is going \nto be put at risk, based upon what action is going to be taken here. I \ndon't believe that should be the case for a very important reason, Mr. \nPresident, which is that unlike other spending proposals in the budget, \nthe fact is that this is the one aspect of the budget where people pay \nin, with the agreement that they will be able to receive.\n  Nobody battles stronger than I do in terms of trying to make \neducation more accessible and available. No one will struggle more in \nterms of fighting and helping and assisting academic accomplishments or \nteacher training in the schools in my State of Massachusetts or in the \ncountry. The fact of the matter is that those students didn't pay into \nthis fund. They didn't contribute to this fund. We recognize, as a \nmatter of national policy, the importance of enhancing education \nopportunity and access for the young people of this country, because it \nis vitally important for our Nation to be able to compete in the world, \nand it is vitally important in terms of our social responsibilities to \nthe young people of this country, in terms of their future.\n  But, Mr. President, they didn't contribute. But Social Security did. \nSocial Security did. The beneficiaries of the NIH research didn't \ncontribute either. I am all for NIH and for investing in that research. \nBut Social Security recipients paid in. Big difference. Major \ndifference. Major difference. Why are we going to treat both of the \ndifferent groups the same? That is wrong. It is wrong on the face of \nit. Most important, it is a basic and fundamental potential violation \nof a very fundamental contract made between the President of the United \nStates, the Congress of the United States, and the American people. \nThat was a contract, not just between two individuals; it was made by a \nNation, establishing that system that said if you pay in during your \nworking years, you are at least going to be able to live out of poverty \nduring the time of your retirement. That is a solemn commitment that we \nhave made year after year after year. And, yet, those who are promoting \nthe balanced budget amendment are saying, ``well, that is all fine and \nall well and good, but we want to make sure we put Social Security on \nbecause, if we do\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nnot, maybe our economy is going to deteriorate, and it will threaten \nsomehow the Social Security recipients.''\n\n  The problem for our economy is not our senior citizens. Sure we have \nto deal with what is going to happen after the year 2029 in terms of \nSocial Security. Although the fact remains that for the next 40 years \nafter that, three-quarters of the benefits could be paid without any \nchanges in it, I want to make sure those recipients are going to get \nthe full benefits. So I am going to work to try to make sure that we \nare going to do that.\n  But the problem in terms of 2003, 2004, and 2005, during that period \nof time, is not Social Security. It may be another factor. But why hold \nour Social Security recipients hostage to that factor? Why hold them \nhostage? That is basically the issue that is included in this \namendment. I believe that the American people wisely are understanding \nthe significance and the importance of this effort by Senator Reid and \nother sponsors, the importance of this debate and this discussion.\n  Now we will hear from our colleagues on the other side. ``Well, it is \nvery nice of you to point that out, Senator Kennedy, but look at what \nthe President has done. The President has put Social Security into his \nbudget when he makes that recommendation, and, therefore, don't you \nthink that we ought to do that?''\n  Well, Mr. President, it is an entirely different system. We have what \nwe call the walls that exist under the Federal budget that have been \nput there since 1990. So you cannot violate the funding of the Social \nSecurity system. Those walls exist, and they exist by statute. But you \npass a constitutional amendment and, as every Member of this body \nunderstands, a constitutional amendment supersedes those statutes. They \nare off. It is an entirely different situation.\n  So, Mr. President, I have listened over the period of the last days \nto those--Senator Reid, Senator Dorgan, and others--who have taken the \nfloor and supported this. I have listened to the responses and find \nthem woefully inadequate in terms of the power of this particular \nargument.\n  I think both in terms of fairness, in terms of justice, in terms of \ndecency, and in terms of our commitment to our seniors that this \namendment, which is going to remove the Social Security trust funds \nfrom the balanced budget amendment, is absolutely essential if we are \ngoing to maintain our commitment to our senior citizens. And I am going \nto welcome the opportunity to be a part of this debate that will take \nplace in these next several days and toward the latter part of February \nbecause I think this is really one of the very, very most important, if \nnot the most important, amendments that we will have on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is almost up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion in \nthe public media and otherwise about the pending nomination of the \nDirector of the CIA with the President having submitted the name of \nNational Security Adviser Anthony Lake.\n  Last year the Senate Intelligence Committee did an extensive inquiry \ninto a matter involving the sale of Iranian arms to Bosnia which \ninvolved Mr. Lake. I have written a ``Dear Colleague'' letter which I \nwould like to read into the Record, and I ask unanimous consent that, \nat the conclusion of my statement, the Intelligence Committee report, a \nbipartisan report although there were some dissents, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  We are checking to see how much of that may be printed in the Record \nunder the rules.\n  The ``Dear Colleague'' letter which I am submitting today is as \nfollows:\n\n       Dear Colleague: Since the media is filled with commentary \n     about National Security Adviser Anthony Lake's nomination to \n     be CIA Director and a pro-Lake ``Dear Colleague'' letter has \n     been circulated, I consider it important to give my fellow \n     senators and others my thinking from last year's Intelligence \n     Committee hearings, which I chaired, on his activities in \n     connection with the sale of Iranian arms to Bosnia.\n       In my opinion, an indispensable qualification to be CIA \n     Director is a mindset to keep Congress fully and currently \n     informed on intelligence matters. Mr. Lake acknowledges he \n     was a part of a plan by officials of the State Department and \n     National Security Council to conceal from Congress and other \n     key Executive Branch officials a new Administration policy to \n     give a ``green light'' on the sale of Iranian arms to Bosnia \n     when a U.S. and UN embargo prohibited it.\n       Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff John M. Shalikashvili and CIA Director \n     R. James Woolsey told the Senate Intelligence Committee they \n     knew nothing about that ``green light'' or the change in U.S. \n     policy.\n       In concluding that Congress should have been informed about \n     this matter, the bipartisan Intelligence Committee report \n     stated:\n       ``By keeping from Congress the full truth about U.S. \n     policy, the Executive branch effectively limited Congress's \n     ability to responsibly debate and legislate on the Bosnia \n     issue.''\n\n     Rejecting the argument that the matter involved traditional \n     diplomatic activity, the bipartisan Intelligence Committee \n     report stated:\n       ``But it was not traditional diplomatic activity to: (1) \n     give a response to a foreign head of state which effectively \n     contradicted stated U.S. policy on isolating a country, in \n     this case Iran, against which U.S. law imposed sanctions; (2) \n     implicity turn a blind eye to activity that violated a United \n     Nations Security Council resolution which the United States \n     had supported and was obligated to obey; and (3) direct a \n     U.S. Ambassador not to make a written report of a \n     conversation with a foreign head of state.''\n       Even though I heard Mr. Lake's version during the \n     Intelligence Committee's proceedings and have talked to him \n     in a private meeting since his nomination, I believe he is \n     entitled to be heard at his confirmation hearing before a \n     final judgment is made on his nomination.\n       I strongly disagree with the practice of abandoning \n     nominees like Lani Guinier, Douglas Ginsburg and Zoe Baird or \n     reaching a conclusion on their nominations until they have \n     had their day in court. If we are to persuade able people to \n     come into government, nominees are entitled to state their \n     case in Senate hearings so that the charges will not stand \n     alone without an appropriate opportunity to respond.\n       It is beside the point that the Department of Justice \n     concluded Mr. Lake did not commit perjury or obstruction of \n     justice in the inquiries on the sale of Iranian arms to \n     Bosnia. There never was any basis, in my opinion, for the \n     referral by the House Committee on those issues.\n       Nor am I concerned about the ancient history of Mr. Lake's \n     so-called leftist activities which have drawn considerable \n     attention. I had thought the stock sale issue was of lesser \n     importance until he agreed to pay a $5,000 fine, so that \n     issue calls for an inquiry; and it may be that other \n     questions merit investigation such as the recent report that \n     a member of his staff engaged in fundraising.\n       There is no doubt that Mr. Lake is a man of considerable \n     ability, and I do not question the sincerity of his motives \n     in acting in what he considered to be in the national \n     interest on the Bosnia issue. But the critical question \n     remains as to whether Mr. Lake can be counted upon to keep \n     the Congress currently and fully informed.\n       The Congress must have positive assurance on that issue in \n     the light of a half century's experience with the CIA \n     including the Iran Contra affair.\n\n  And this ``Dear Colleague'' letter is signed by me and circulated to \nmy colleagues.\n  In order to have a complete understanding of this issue, which as I \nsay I consider to be central to whether Mr. Lake ought to be confirmed \nas Director of the CIA, it is necessary to review in some detail and in \nsome depth the bipartisan report filed by the Intelligence Committee. I \nadvise my colleagues that the report is available from the Intelligence \nCommittee, and encourage all Senators to read it.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Tragically, the 44-footer capsized and three brave men died. Only \none crewman, Seaman Apprentice Benjamin Wingo of Bremerton, WA, \nsurvived to reach the rocky shoreline and safety.\n  Some of my colleagues have heard me address this body in the past to \ngive tribute to successful rescues made by Coast Guard personnel in \ndangerous situations where they themselves were placed in serious \njeopardy by their effort to save others. Most such rescues end happily. \nThis one--tragically--did not.\n  We pay formal tribute to those members of the military who fall in \nthe line of duty while fighting our Nation's enemies. I hope the \nMembers of this body will take just a moment to reflect on the \nsacrifice of these three young Coast Guardsmen. They, too, perished in \nthe line of duty, fighting to protect human life.\n  The Coast Guard motto, ``Semper Paratus,'' means ``Always Prepared.'' \nSometimes, it means being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1354-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1354-S1355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERIM STORAGE OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a very serious situation exists in our \nNation that I would like to discuss with my colleagues today. It \nconcerns the storage of nuclear waste that has been generated in \nconjunction with the operation of nuclear reactors that provide this \nNation with about 22 percent of the power generation that we currently \nenjoy. Without this contribution from the nuclear industry, we would \nhave to depend on some other form of generation to contribute that 22 \npercent. We would probably use more coal, perhaps more natural gas. The \npotential for developing more hydro is somewhat limited, based on the \ncosts and the fact that most of the potential hydro sites have already \nbeen developed. I happen to be chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, which has the obligation to oversee our country's \nelectricity industry. It is an industry that most Americans take for \ngranted. We are used to plugging in the iron, plugging in the coffee \npot, and having them work. We do not recognize and we do not really \nreflect on what is behind it--the people, the men and women working in \nthe power generating business, the business of transmitting the \nelectric energy, distributing it and making sure it works.\n  In any event, in connection with the tremendous dependence we have on \nnuclear energy in this country--I might add, we are the largest \nconsumers of nuclear generated energy of any nation in the world--I was \nstaggered to read that the Senate-White House meeting which was held \nyesterday resulted in agreement on some issues, but no agreement to \naddress the question of what to do with the nuclear waste generated by \nour power reactors.\n  I think a headline should have read, ``The Clinton Administration \nSimply Wants to Keep the Status Quo.'' Keeping nuclear waste in the \nneighborhoods of our country, and the consequences of that, deserve \nsome examination. This examination could start in your town, in your \nState, in your neighborhood. That is where it is being stored. High-\nlevel radioactive materials are piling up in 80 locations in 41 of our \nStates. Onsite storage is filling up, and the States which control the \nability of utilities to store nuclear waste on the reactor sites will \nhave to address whether they want to increase onsite storage at the \nnuclear reactors, or whether they will give in to pressure to simply \nnot allow any further storage beyond the limited amount of existing \nstorage.\n  Some see this as a way to shut down the nuclear industry in this \ncountry. By objecting to any increase in authority to store onsite, the \nreactors can be forced to shut down because there is no place to put \nthe spent fuel.\n  I have a chart which I am going to spend a few minutes on, because it \nshows the crucial nature of the problem. When the administration says, \n``We will just leave it where it is,'' I suggest to you, Mr. President, \nthat this is an unrealistic and unworkable alternative. By 1998, 23 \nreactors in 14 States will run out of storage space. What we have here \nare plants with adequate storage, and they are indicated in the light \nblue. You can see most of them are on the eastern seaboard. But in \npurple are plants requiring additional storage by the year 2010. These \nStates all have plants in purple: California, Arizona, Florida, \nGeorgia, North and South Carolina, and all up and down the east coast. \nThese plants do not have adequate storage to hold waste within the \nareas immediately adjacent to the reactors, and are going to have to \npetition the States to increase the authorization for nuclear energy \nwaste allowed to be stored at those sites. In the green are plants \nrequiring additional storage by the year 2015. They are primarily on \nthe eastern seaboard and the Midwestern States, such as Illinois.\n\n  So the point of this chart is to highlight that additional nuclear \nwaste storage is needed in this country now. The bill we have \nintroduced in our committee, S. 104, would provide a real solution to \nthis crisis that is coming down the track. It is a train wreck that is \ncoming. We have this material at 80 locations in 41 States. The Federal \nGovernment entered into a contractual commitment with America's \nratepayers who depend on nuclear energy and the nuclear generation \nindustry. In return for over $12 billion ratepayer dollars, the \nGovernment committed to take this waste by the year 1998. This is less \nthan 1 year away; it is about 10 months away. The Federal Government \nhas no place to put this waste and will default on its contractual \ncommitment in 1998, when it is obligated to take the waste.\n  There has been an effort to provide this Nation with a permanent \nrepository. The government has a study program under way at Yucca \nMountain, NV. We have spent $6 billion on this effort, but that \nfacility will not be ready for 15 years, at the earliest. Secretary \nO'Leary said it may be 20 years. It may be longer. But the point is, we \nare looking at somewhere in the area of 2015 or thereabouts, and where \nin the world are we going to be able to accommodate this waste? Because \nwe are not going to have a permanent repository then. We may never have \na permanent repository, and I will talk about that a little later.\n  S. 104 is a bill that got 63 votes in this body last year. The bill \nwould provide for construction of a temporary storage facility, either \nat the Nevada test site or another site chosen by the President and \nCongress, until such time as we have a permanent repository \nconstructed.\n  Why the Nevada test site? The geologists tell us it is the best site \nthat has been identified for a permanent repository. Furthermore, it is \na site where for over 50 years we have tested our nuclear weapons. It \nis a site that is monitored and secured. It is a site that is well \nknown. And it is the most appropriate site that has been identified.\n  Now, the bottom line with this whole issue, Mr. President, is nobody \nwants nuclear waste. But you cannot throw it up in the air. It will \ncome down somewhere. So the question is, what do you do with it? Again, \nlast year, 63 Members of this body indicated that they approved of the \nconstruction of a temporary repository at the Nevada test site because \nit would allow us to proceed with the permanent repository,\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nand when the permanent repository was done and certified and licensed, \nthe waste could go in there.\n  The point is, next year the Government has to take the waste or face \nliability and the damages associated with the failure to meet its \nobligation. Mr. President, this is the most important environmental \nbill before this Congress.\n  This administration has said, ``Leave it where it is.'' When this \nissue was brought up at Tuesday's meeting, it is my understanding the \nVice President said, ``Look, we're going to talk about the things we \ncan agree on. We can't agree on the issue of nuclear waste.'' Whether \nthat is a fair characterization, I can only depend on the news reports. \nBut the administration's position seems to be to leave the nuclear \nwaste where it is until we have a permanent place to put it.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the possibility of a permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain. We do not know whether Yucca Mountain may \never be ready. We have spent $6 billion already. It is estimated that \nit will cost a total of $30 billion by the time we are through with it. \nThe Department of Energy says it has a 50-50 chance of actually being \nlicensed.\n  The theory here is that the scientists have to go through this \nprocess to determine whether Yucca can contain nuclear waste for \nthousands of years.\n  Mr. President, if I may have another 6 or 7 minutes, I would \nappreciate it, and I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the difficulty we have here with Yucca Mountain is not \nknowing whether we will ever get it licensed because it has to \nwithstand a scientific analysis regarding any possible source of \nexposure--earthquake, volcanic activity, any leeching into the ground--\nfor approximately 10,000 years. We do not know whether science can come \nup with that kind of certification.\n  But, in any event, in order to try to make this case we have to \nproceed with the tunneling, and spend the money. However, we simply do \nnot know whether it will ever be a permanent repository. But the idea \nof moving this waste from 41 States, 80 sites, to a place where we have \nhad extensively studied certainly seems to make sense. If Yucca \nMountain is determined to be permanent, we will have the waste there \nand ready to put in a permanent repository. If Yucca Mountain is not \nthe permanent repository site, it will be dozens of years before \nanother permanent repository site can be located and studied, and a \ncentral interim storage facility will still be needed.\n  It is my understanding that the Vice President apparently was saying \ntwo things. The administration no longer supports any form of \ncentralized interim storage. In the meantime, we can only conclude that \ntheir policy is, ``Leave it where it is.'' Leave it where it is. Ignore \nthe problem. Put off the decision. Act like an ostrich--put your head \nin the sand. Let nuclear waste build up in 41 States, near the homes, \nnear the schools. This is the administration's irresponsible and \ndangerous policy on nuclear waste storage.\n  As I said, the Federal Government has a 1998 deadline. Taxpayers have \npaid billions of dollars only to have the Vice President say, ``Leave \nit where it is.''\n  I have another chart that I will refer to very briefly. These are the \nStates where ratepayers have paid into the Federal Government's nuclear \nwaste fund to provide for nuclear waste storage. The Federal Government \ndid not hold this money in escrow. They put it in the general fund. \nThey have spent it.\n  The point is, there is $12 billion that has been paid in by the \nratepayers for the Federal Government to take this waste in 1998. \nVirtually every State has bought nuclear power and paid into the fund. \nThat is where the Government's contractual commitments really lay.\n  Why is the administration simply saying no to any form of interim \nstorage when Yucca Mountain has only a 50-50 chance of opening? Some \nwho are on the fringes of the environmental movement think that this \nsort of foot dragging may help them close down the entire nuclear \nindustry. Those people apparently have no responsibility for replacing \nthat 22 percent of our power that we will lose. Twenty-two percent of \nour electricity, Mr. President, is generated by nuclear power. Even if \nall of the reactors shut down, we would be stuck with the utility waste \nand the defense waste still. We would not have an answer for what to do \nwith it. If they shut down the industry, we still have the waste to \ndispose of.\n  Mr. President, we won the cold war with the help of our nuclear \ndeterrent. Now we have an obligation to clean up the mess. We can win \nthe war on nuclear waste. Leaving it where it is is not an option, and \n41 States are watching us.\n\n  In addition to the nuclear waste of our power generators, we have \nnuclear waste that resulted from nuclear weapons development. I was at \nHanford 2 weeks ago and went through the old plants that developed the \nplutonium to make the Hiroshima bomb, and those that made advanced \nnuclear devices. One must seriously consider what those facilities \ncontributed to humanity and the burden they left. It is a \nresponsibility that we must bear. Nuclear weapons brought the Second \nWorld War to an early close. There were lives lost; there were lives \nsaved. The same thing is true regarding the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  No matter what your opinion regarding these matters, we have a legacy \nof nuclear waste. We have to address it. The responsible way to address \nit is to meet head on the obligations we have made. Under a contractual \ncommitment, we have collected $12 billion from ratepayers and are \ncommitted to take that waste by 1998.\n  The Government is not prepared to take the waste. This case is going \nto be litigated, and it will become a full employment act for the \nlawyers beginning in 1998. We have proposed in S. 104 to address it now \nby providing for the siting of an interim storage site, in the Nevada \ndesert, or somewhere else the President and Congress may choose, until \nwe have a permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, we have to have a temporary central storage facility \nin this country. There is absolutely no question about it. But this \nadministration chooses to ignore it. They want this problem to go away. \nThey do not want to address it on their watch. I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that this is irresponsible. I thank the President and wish \nhim a good day and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized to \nspeak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today to \ndiscuss an issue which is not pleasant. It is tragically controversial, \nand it is an unsavory topic. The issue is computer pornography.\n  I have a copy of the February 10, 1997 U.S. News & World Report \nmagazine. The cover story indicates, America is by far the world's \nleading producer of porn, churning out hard core videos at the \nastonishing rate of about 150 new titles per week. The magazine \nprovides an inside look at the industry.\n  Within this U.S. News & World Report edition is a lengthy article \ndiscussing the porn industry in the United States, shamefully \npronouncing the United States as the world's leading producer of \npornography. There is much in this article to shock, to disappoint, and \nto be ashamed of. But I am going to limit my remarks specifically to \nthe issue of computer pornography.\n  As a backdrop, let me quote from the article just to give us an idea \nof the scope of the problem. ``Last year,'' the article states, \n``Americans spent more\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\nthan $8 billion on hard-core videos, peep shows, live sex acts, adult \ncable programming, sexual devices, computer porn, and sex magazines--an \namount larger than Hollywood's domestic box office receipts and larger \nthan all of the revenues generated by rock and country music \nrecordings. Americans now spend more money at strip clubs than at \nBroadway, off-Broadway, regional, and nonprofit theaters; at the opera, \nthe ballet, and jazz and classical music performances . . . combined.''\n  That is the scope of the problem. It is a staggering statistic, one \nthat ought to shock us all.\n  The article also discusses the role of the Internet and the role of \ncomputer pornography in driving the technology that we have all become \nso aware of in just the last year or so. Let me again quote from the \nmagazine:\n\n       In much the same way that hard-core films on videocassette \n     were largely responsible for the rapid introduction of the \n     VCR, porn CD-ROM and on the Internet has hastened the \n     acceptance of these new technologies. Interactive adult CD-\n     ROMs, such as Virtual Valerie and the Penthouse Photo Shoot, \n     create interest in multimedia equipment among male computer \n     buyers.\n\n  According to the article. It goes on to say, and I quote:\n\n       The availability of sexually explicit material through \n     computer bulletin board systems has drawn many users to the \n     Internet. Porn companies have established elaborate web sites \n     to lure customers.\n\n  For instance, ``Playboy's web site, which offers free glimpses of its \nPlaymates, now averages about 5 million hits a day.'' Five million \ntimes someone is logging into the Playboy web site every day.\n  The article then goes on to quote a seeming cult figure of the \nanything goes set in America, Larry Flynt:\n\n       Larry Flynt imagines a future in which the TV and the \n     personal computer have merged. Americans will lie in bed, \n     cruising the Internet with their remote controls and ordering \n     hard-core films at the punch of a button. The Internet \n     promises to combine the video store's diversity of choices \n     with the secrecy of purchases through the mail.\n\n  Why do I bring this up, Mr. President? Because in the last Congress, \nthe 104th Congress, this Senate adopted the Exon-Coats amendment, known \nas the Communications Decency Act, as part of the telecommunications \nreform legislation. I bring this up not to point out what Americans \nshould or should not do in the privacy of their bedroom. I bring this \nup to ask the question as to whether or not we have a responsibility to \nprotect our children from the negative impact of pornography. The \nCommunications Decency Act simply extends the same protections that are \ncurrently in place, for children from pornography, that exists in every \nother means of communication but has not caught up with computer \ncommunication. The Internet has exploded on the scene and, yet, the \nsame restrictions and protections for children, regarding the \ndistribution of pornography that we have built into telephone \ntechnology, television technology, VCR technology, and others, has not \nbeen extended to computer technology, until the Communications Decency \nAct.\n\n  As U.S. News reports, ``The Nation's obscenity laws and the \nCommunications Decency Act are the greatest impediments to Flynt's \nbrave new world of porn.'' The article said that, ``Even he [Larry \nFlynt] is shocked by some of the material he has obtained through the \nInternet.''\n  Let me quote him. ``Some of the stuff on there, I mean, I wouldn't \neven publish it.''\n  Anybody familiar with Mr. Flynt's record in terms of extending the \nboundaries of publication of pornographic material have to be stunned \nby this statement. Basically what he is saying is that some of the \nmaterial that is available on the Internet without any protections for \nchildren, is so shocking even he wouldn't publish it in his magazines, \nwhich are only sold to adults, or are only supposed to be sold to \nadults.\n  Opponents of the Communications Decency Act, companies like America \nOn-Line, the ACLU, the American Library Association, have argued that \nthere should be no role for government in protecting children, that the \nInternet can regulate itself. The primary solution that they have \noffered is a system called PICs, Platform for Internet Content \nSelection. It is a type of self-rating system. This would allow the \npublisher of the material, the pornographer, to rate his own home page \non the Web, and browsers, the tools that are used to search the \nInternet, would then respond to these ratings.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that it is a ludicrous proposition to allow \nthe pornographer to rate their own material. There is no incentive for \ncompliance.\n  PC Week magazine, a prominent voice in the computer industry recently \npublished an editorial entitled ``Web Site Ratings--Shame on Most of \nUs.'' The column discusses the lack of voluntary compliance by content \nproviders. The article states,\n\n       We and many others in the computer industry and press have \n     decried the Communications Decency Act and other government \n     attempts to regulate the content of the Web. Instead, we've \n     all argued, the government should let the Web rate and \n     regulate its own content. Page ratings and browsers that \n     respond to those ratings, not legislation, are the answers \n     we've offered.\n\n  But then the article goes on to say:\n\n       The argument has been effective. With the CDA still wrapped \n     up in the Courts, the general feeling seems to be that we, \n     the good guys, carried the day on this one.\n\n  ``Too bad we left the field before the game was over,'' the article \nsays. ``We who work around the Web have done little to rate our \ncontent.'' The article goes on to say that, in search of the Web, they \nfound ``few rated sites.'' And even those rated sites were an \n``exception to the rule.'' In other words, the PICs don't work. Of \ncourse they don't work. They don't work because you are asking the \nproducer who is trying to sell the material to rate the material in a \nway that it will not be accessed as many people as it otherwise would. \nThere is no incentive for pornographers to comply.\n  So what are the ramifications to our children? A member of my staff \nwent on Lexis/Nexis and searched for articles containing the words: \nComputer and pornography and Internet and looked for articles dated \nafter the first of the year. And we came up with 139 separate stories. \n``Internet pornography at library concerns parents'', ``Parents want \nBPL (Boston Public Library) to block porn on Internet'', articles \nentitled, ``Kids see porn via the Internet.'' ``Mother sues America On-\nLine over cyber porn,'' and on and on.\n  At a time when the President and the Vice President are calling for \nevery classroom in America to be wired to the Internet, when Larry \nFlynt is shocked by some of the material he finds there, the ACLU and \ncongressional opponents of the Communications Decency Act claim that \nthe Government has no right to protect our children from this \npornographic material. Fortunately, the Senate spoke on a vote of 84 to \n16, and the Congress as a whole spoke overwhelmingly in favor of the \nCDA.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court will soon hear arguments on the \nconstitutionality of the CDA.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I introduced two bills, the \nDeadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1997, and the Sunshine in Litigation \nAct of 1997. Both address issues that are of enormous importance to our \ncommunities and country.\n  First, Senator DeWine and I introduced a measure to toughen the \noriginal Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 to ensure that more serious \ncrimes receive more serious punishment. Our new proposal sends a clear \nmessage to deadbeat parents: Pay up or go to jail.\n  Current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to \npay child support obligations to a child in another State if the \nobligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater \nthan $5,000. However, current law provides for a maximum of just 6 \nmonths in prison for a first offense and a maximum of 2 years for a \nsecond offense. A first offense, however, no matter how egregious, is \nnot a felony under current law.\n  Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law \neffectively, but they have found that current misdemeanor penalties do \nnot adequately deal with more serious cases, those cases in which \nparents move from State to State to intentionally evade child support \npenalties or fail to pay child support obligations for more than 2 \nyears--serious cases that deserve serious felony punishment.\n  In response to these concerns, President Clinton drafted legislation \nthat would address this problem, and we dropped it in last month.\n  This new effort builds on past successes. In the 4 years since the \noriginal deadbeat parents legislation was signed into law by President \nBush, collections have increased by nearly 50 percent, from $8 billion \nto $11.8 billion, and we should be proud of that increase. Moreover, a \nnew national database has helped identify 60,000 delinquent fathers, \nover half of whom owed money to women on welfare.\n  Nevertheless, there is much more that we can do. It is estimated that \nif delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, approximately \n800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare rolls. So our \nnew legislation cracks down on the worst violators and makes clear that \nintentional or long-term evasion of child support responsibilities will \nnot receive a slap on the wrist. In so doing, it will help us continue \nto fight to ensure that every child receives the parental support they \ndeserve.\n  With this bill, we have a chance to make a difference in the lives of \nfamilies across our entire country. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to give police and prosecutors the tools they need to \neffectively pursue individuals who seek to avoid their family \nobligations.\n  The second bill I introduced 2 weeks ago was the Sunshine in \nLitigation Act of 1997, a measure that addresses the growing abuse of \nsecrecy orders issued by Federal courts. All too often, our Federal \ncourts will allow vital information that is discovered in litigation \nand which directly bears on public health and safety to be covered up, \nto be shielded from people whose lives are potentially at stake and \nfrom the public officials we have asked to protect our health and \nsafety.\n  All of this happens because of the so-called protective orders, which \nare really gag orders issued by courts--and designed to keep \ninformation discovered in the course of litigation secret and \nundisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request \nto keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants \nthreaten that, without secrecy, they will refuse to pay a settlement. \nVictims cannot afford to take such chances. And while courts in these \nsituations actually have the legal authority to deny requests for \nsecrecy, typically they do not because both sides have agreed and \njudges have other matters they prefer to attend to. So judges are \nregularly and frequently entering these protective orders using the \npower of the Federal Government to keep people in the dark about the \ndangers they face.\n  This measure will bring crucial information out of the darkness and \ninto the light. The measure amends rule 26 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure to require that judges weigh the impact on public \nhealth and safety before approving these secrecy orders. It is simple, \neffective, and straightforward. It essentially codifies what is already \nthe best practices of the best judges. In cases that do not affect the \npublic health and safety, existing practice would continue, and courts \ncan still use protective orders as they do today. But in cases \naffecting public health and safety, courts would apply a balancing \ntest. They could permit secrecy only if the need for privacy outweighs \nthe public's need to know about potential public health and safety \nhazards. Moreover, courts could not, under this measure, issue \nprotective orders that would prevent disclosures to regulatory \nagencies.\n\n  I do want to mention that identical legislation was reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee last year by a bipartisan, 11-to-7 majority. I \ndo want to remind people that this issue is not going away: A number of \nStates are currently considering antisecrecy measures; the Justice \nDepartment itself has drafted its own antisecrecy proposal--one that in \nmany ways goes further than my own. The grassroots support for \nantisecrecy legislation will continue and grow, as long as information \nremains held under lock and key.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to do more to combat deadbeat parents and limit court \nsecrecy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1357-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1357-S1358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I speak to my colleagues and to the \nAmerican public today about a quiet crisis that is occurring in our \nNation. This is the crisis that has resulted from our failure to \nadequately invest in the basic services that will render our Nation \neconomically productive, with a strong national security, and prepare \nthe next generation of our citizens to meet their responsibilities. All \nover our Nation, from the largest cities to the smallest rural \ncommunities, we are seeing a deterioration of our basic public support \nsystem. Our schools, our bridges, our highways, our water and sewer \nsystems are deteriorating.\n  In areas of growth, we do not have enough resources to meet the needs \nof an expanding population. Too many children are learning in \novercrowded and unsafe classrooms. Too many motorists are driving on \ninadequate roads and highways. Too many communities are being forced to \nmake do with inadequate water, sewer, and environmental systems.\n  Our ability to compete in the economy of the future, and to maintain \nand enhance the quality of life of our citizens, will, in large part, \nhinge on whether and how we correct those problems.\n  As we enter the 21st century, we must build and rebuild the \nfoundations which will serve our people and their needs for years to \ncome. In the near future, I intend to continue the efforts that are \nunderway with my Republican and Democratic colleagues who have \nexpressed similar concerns. Out of this will come legislation which \nwill assist States and local communities to build the schools, roads, \nand water systems that they need now and in the future.\n\n  The numbers tell the story. A recent General Accounting Office report \nsays\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nthat one-third of our Nation's school districts have buildings in need \nof immediate and extensive repair. The same report states that 25 \nmillion students go to schools with poor lighting and heating, bad \nventilation or air quality, or a lack of physical security; 25 million \nboys and girls attend schools with those deteriorating conditions. It \nhas been estimated that $150 billion will be needed to remedy this \nsituation. That dollar amount does not include the cost to meet new \nschool construction for expanding populations.\n  This affects my State. It affects all of the States of the Nation. \nThe school facility crisis is estimated, for instance, in the State of \nNorth Dakota, to cost $450 million to remedy; $5 billion is needed in \nTexas, $7.5 billion in Florida, $15 billion in New York State, and $20 \nbillion in the State of California. In Louisiana, 88 percent of the \n1,500 public schools are in need of repair; 77 percent of Connecticut's \nmore than 1,000 schools need some rehabilitation. In Illinois, 89 \npercent of more than 4,000 schools need improvement.\n  I firmly believe the administration of elementary and secondary \neducation is the responsibility of State and local communities. It is \nnot a Federal responsibility. The Federal Government should restrain \nitself from interfering with curriculum, personnel and other \neducational policies. But I believe there is a role for the Federal \nGovernment in helping increasingly underfunded and overburdened school \ndistricts in the construction of badly needed new schools and the \nrenovation of existing schools. That is a role in which the Federal \nGovernment has had some history.\n  I recently spent a day working in a rehabilitation project on Opa-\nLocka Elementary School in Dade County, FL. I was impressed when I \nlooked at the plaque on the wall of Opa-Locka Elementary School, a \nschool which is 60 years old this year. It was built by the U.S. Public \nWorks Administration as a Depression-era job-creation project. The \nFederal Government has a history of assisting school districts in \nmeeting their capital needs and has done so without the criticism of \ninappropriate Federal intrusion.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the President's proposed school construction \ninitiative. It was one of the 10 points in the education program that \nhe presented to the Nation during his State of the Union Address. He \nhas opened the door to an important Federal-State-local partnership, \nand we must walk through that door. However, I believe the door needs \nto be widened.\n  Our school construction needs are much greater than the President's \nproposal would address. States and local school districts need to have \na wider range of policy and fiscal options to meet their needs. We must \naggressively build on the President's plan so that States and local \ngovernments can solve their tremendous needs.\n  School construction is obviously not the only capital issue facing \nStates and local governments. For example, the United States has 39 \nmillion miles of roads and 574,000 bridges. Recent estimates show that \n60 percent of our roads and a third of our bridges are substandard and \nin need of repair. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that \nwe currently invest $35 billion annually in highway construction. This \nis $15 billion less than is needed to keep up with deterioration and \n$33 billion less than the amount estimated to keep ahead of growth, \nchange, and congestion.\n  Nationally, our water and sewer management investment needs are in \nexcess of $138 billion.\n  The key question for us and for America is, how will we face these \nproblems? We must address these problems in a way that is responsible, \nboth to our commitment to a balanced budget and to the needs of States \nand local communities. It is vital that we find a funding source that \nis limited, stable and viable over an extended period of time.\n  I suggest that some of the principles of this new partnership of the \nFederal Government with State and local communities in meeting their \neducation, transportation and environmental infrastructure needs would \ninclude these: We must form an expanded and long-term partnership. It \nmust be a partnership built on a basic respect for the responsibilities \nof State and local government to make the key policy decisions.\n  It must also be built on a requirement that it be a true partnership \nwith the States and as a condition of participation that they provide a \nmatching source of funds to that which will come from the Federal \nGovernment and that they maintain their current level of effort so that \nthis will truly be an additional effort toward meeting our unmet needs, \nnot a substitution for current effort, and that there be maximum \nflexibility to the States in the form in which they choose to meet \nthose needs and the priorities which they establish.\n  I am going to suggest, Mr. President, as we develop these concepts \ninto legislation, that one of the most appealing ways in which to \nprovide that stable and sustainable revenue source in order to be able \nto form this partnership is to utilize the 4.3 cents per gallon of \nmotor fuels tax which was enacted in 1993 and which goes directly to \nthe Federal Treasury, not as does most other federally imposed motor \nfuels tax into a highway trust fund. This revenue source is currently \ngenerating in excess of $6 billion.\n  If States and local communities are willing to provide a substantial \nmatch to these funds--and I will suggest that that match should be in \nthe ratio of one-third State and local to two-thirds Federal--the total \neffect of this Federal contribution for educational, transportation, \nenvironmental needs over the next 5 to 10 years could be in excess of \n$200 billion, if these funds were used as the basis of innovative \nfinancing methods.\n  Mr. President, this will have the potential of tremendous positive \nimpact on our Nation's economy. Clearly, the economy will benefit by \nhaving children who are educated in appropriate environments. The \ncountry will benefit by having a transportation system that can meet \nour current and future needs that will not impose excessive costs due \nto congestion and inadequacy of facilities. Our Nation will be enhanced \nby having quality environmental systems that will protect our water and \nour air and our natural resources.\n  Those are some of the benefits. But in addition to those, a program \nof this scale will provide employment for literally hundreds of \nthousands of people, as we strive to construct these facilities that \nwill have such positive long-term benefits.\n  Mr. President, in the next weeks I expect to continue to work with my \ncolleagues in developing this into specific legislative proposals.\n  Our motorists and our Nation's commercial interests need safe, \nmodern, and reliable highways. Our communities deserve responsible \nwater and sewer and other environmental systems. Our children will \nrequire the best quality of educational facilities in order to achieve \nworld-class standards of educational performance. We can wait no longer \nto meet the needs of this quiet crisis of deteriorating infrastructure \nin America. Now is the time to act.

The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is right on \ntarget, it is the king of corporate welfare. The Senator from Arkansas \nhas been at this for years trying to save the conscience of this \nparticular body. I have been most interested in his factual, indepth \nstudy and report to the Congress, and particularly here to us in the \nSenate. It is just astounding to me that it continues.\n  As he said, the public can hardly believe what he says. I want to \nturn to a subject that the public cannot believe, and that is what we \nsay, because we have a funny way of talking about deficits. \nSpecifically, if you look, Mr. President, at the budget message of the\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nPresident in the budget green book, fiscal year 1998, on page 2, and \nyou want to see what the deficit is after the fifth year out, it says \non page 2 at the bottom, ``Surplus deficit.'' Why doublespeak? You \nwould not get that from your accountant.\n  Do not, by gosh, make your income tax statement in April on the basis \nof surplus deficit, on budget/off budget, unified budget, unified \ndeficit. But you will see here that they show a $17 billion surplus on \npage 2. However, Mr. President, if you turn to page 331, buried in the \nback, you will find table S-16, ``Federal Government Financing and \nDebt.'' All one needs do to ever determine a deficit is to just look at \nthe increase, if you please, of the debt each year. If the debt stays \nthe same, you have a balanced budget. If the debt goes down, then you \nhave a surplus. But, if the debt goes up, as it says on page 331, \nclearly you have a deficit. You can see that the debt in 2002 is \n$6.6525 trillion on the line which says ``Total gross Federal debt.'' \nThen, if you subtract the previous year's debt of $6.4852 in 2001 from \nthe 2002 figure of $6.6525 trillion, you will get, of course, a $167.3-\nbillion deficit. This is not a surplus as you find on page 2, but a \ndeficit, as it states on page 331. That is the real world, and it \nshould be our real world. It should be our real world, Mr. President, \nbecause, otherwise, the discipline has broken here in this body. \nSpecifically, if you are going to use some offset borrowing, it is like \ngoing to the bank and the teller says, ``Well, Hollings, you don't have \nany money left,'' and I say, ``Well, let me borrow from the next \nfellow's account over there and put it in mine.''\n\n  So what we do for the unified budget is borrow from Social Security \nand highway trust funds. Let me give you the list, Mr. President. This \nchart lists each President since Harry Truman in 1945, the U.S. budget, \nthe trust funds that are used, the real deficit, the gross Federal \ndebt, and then the gross interest costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

in 1962 CBO's ``1995 Economic\n  and Budget Outlook.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you go down each year and--incidentally, \nwhen I got here, in 1966, there wasn't any unified budget, or unified \ndeficit, or unified surplus. There wasn't anything unified. There \nwasn't any in 1967, 1968, and 1969. When they started that under \nPresident Johnson, they said President Johnson started it as a gimmick. \nIf you look at these figures, you will find out that President Johnson \ndid have a surplus and a balanced budget--I voted for it; I was here \nthen--and it did not use Social Security or any of the other trust \nfunds.\n  Then, Mr. President, as I was saying, there is a table here of the \ndifferent amounts used in this so-called unified budget, or deficit. In \nthe year 1997, there was $78 billion in Social Security moneys to \nreduce the size of that deficit; in 1998, $81 billion; in 1999, $88 \nbillion; in 2000, $94 billion; in the year\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\n2001, $98 billion; and in 2002, $104 billion. That is a total of $543 \nbillion.\n  Now, I am a budgeteer. I am on the Budget Committee. I go in the room \nand I say: Well, now, are we going to really look at the debt and see \nif we've got this Government on a pay-as-you-go program, or are we \ngoing to play the gamesmanship? Oh, they have reporters running all \naround the world, to China, to find out whether or not they made a \ncontribution in the Presidential election. But they don't have the \nintegrity to report the facts, truth in budgeting. The discipline is \nbroken. I go in as a budgeteer and you say: Wait a minute, you have \n$543 billion, a half trillion bucks, over the next 6 years, and if I \ndon't spend it for what I want, that fellow over there is going to \nspend it on defense; this one over here is going to spend it on foreign \naid; the next one is going to spend it on the national parks. I might \nas well get my money to take back home. There is no discipline. There \nis no trust.\n  Obviously, the public has heard us talk ad nauseam about deficits and \nbalancing budgets. And like old Tennessee Ernie sang, ``Another day \nolder and deeper in debt.'' We have these polls taken to see whether or \nnot they trust us. I hope they don't because we are not giving them the \ntruth in budgeting. I am trying my dead-level best here to list these \namounts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this particular table be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGross debt 1996....................   5182  Gross debt 1997......   5436\nGross debt 1995....................   4921  Gross debt 1996......   5182\n                                    -------                       ------\n      Difference...................    261        Difference.....    254\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           1996    1997\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit.................................................    107      124\nTrust funds:\n    Social Security.....................................     66       78\n    Medicare HI \\1\\.....................................     -4      -10\n    Medicare SMI........................................     13       -5\n    Military Retirement.................................      5        9\n    Civilian Retirement.................................     28       28\n    Unemployment........................................      6        7\n    Highways............................................      3        3\n    Airports............................................     -3       -4\n    Other...............................................      1        3\nAdditional borrowing:\n    Banking.............................................     16       10\n    Treasury loans......................................     23       11\n                                                         ---------------\n      Total trust funds and additional borrowing........    154      130\n                                                         ===============\nReal deficit............................................    261      254\nGross interest..........................................    344      360\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The HI part of Medicare is projected to go broke by 2001. Based on\n  numbers reported by the Treasury Department.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You will find that in the 1997 budget we use $78 \nbillion from Social Security; military retirement, $9 billion; civilian \nretirement, $28 billion; unemployment compensation fund, $7 billion; \nhighways, $3 billion; additional borrowings from banking, $10 billion; \nTreasury loans, another $11 billion.\n  So you can see the tremendous amounts that we do to obscure the size \nof that deficit. And this has been quite a problem for this particular \nSenator, because I have been trying to get one vocabulary, if you \nplease, so when we go into the Budget Committee we all talk the same \nlanguage. Then, we can have ``slush'' funds instead of ``trust'' funds. \nWe, very lightly, make a motion and say the money is there and we will \nuse it there, and we will use the CPI and pick up a trillion dollars \nover 10 years. Oh, there are all kinds of gimmicks to use. I got an \ninitiative in the formal statutory law, which was called a gimmick less \nthan 24 hours ago by the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I don't think the law is a gimmick.\n  I want to talk seriously about that, Mr. President, because we can go \nback to the National Commission on Social Security Reform in January \n1983. You will find, under section 21, a majority of the national \ncommission recommends that the operations of OASI, DI, HI, and SMI--the \ntrust funds, Social Security trust funds--should be removed from the \nunified budget. In the operations, the Social Security trust funds have \nbeen included in the unified budget. However, by including Social \nSecurity trust funds in the annual budget process, it gives a false \nimpression to the American public. The national commission believed \nthat changes in the Social Security program should be made only for \nprogrammatic reasons and not for balancing the budget.\n  Then, they projected as the reason for removing it from the unified \nbudget was to take Social Security from a pay-as-you-go program to \nbuilding up surpluses--tremendous reserves--to take care of the baby \nboomers in the next century. They use the year 2056 in one instance and \ntalk about protecting the fund for 75 years in another. Now, in all the \nlitany from these reports and emergency committees that go around \nstudying this, they are coming back in and saying it will be broke in \nthe year 2029, not 2056 or 75 years out as the Greenspan Commission \nreported.\n  What should we do? We should reduce benefits and increase taxes. But \ndo you know what happens? The trust fund surpluses created by the tax \nincreases are spent on other programs. The Social Security taxes that \nwe passed in 1983 were formally declared as revenues for Social \nSecurity surpluses, a trust fund for the baby boomers in the next \ncentury. They were certainly not to be used for defense, or foreign \naid, or housing, or any of these other endeavors. But we are spending \nit for any and all purposes except Social Security. It is a dirty shame \nwhat is going on. You cannot get it reported. And the effect is on us \nimmediately, not in the next century. The effect is this particular \nminute. We are running up these horrendous deficits and debt to the \ntune now--as you can see from the table that I put in--of $1 billion a \nday in interest costs. It was only about $1 billion a week when \nPresident Reagan came to town. He was going to balance the budget in 1 \nyear. I can show you the talk. He came to town and he says, ``Oops. \nThis is the way it works. I am going to balance it in 3 years.'' He \ncame in with ``Reaganomics.'' Brother, I can tell you the debt just \nwent soaring through the ceiling. We had 210 years of history with the \ncost of all the wars, the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, \nthe Spanish American War, the Mexican War, World War I, World War II, \nKorea, Vietnam--we had the cost of all the wars; we had 38 Presidents, \nRepublican and Democrat; and we never got to a $1 trillion debt. Yet, \nwithout the cost of a war in 15 years, we now have $5.3 trillion in \ndebt. That is the crowd around here talking about they are concerned \nabout deficits and the next fellow is not.\n  When the Greenspan commission made this recommendation I was on the \nBudget Committee. I cosponsored and worked in a bipartisan fashion on \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. Then I went to work on really stopping this debt \nfrom soaring that nobody knew was soaring because we were using \nbillions from the Social Security trust fund. And it took me until \n1990, Mr. President, to do just exactly that. And in July of 1990, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, I made the motion that we do as the \nGreenspan commission had recommended and put it off budget; build up an \naccounting surplus. And the vote was 20 to 1.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the vote in the Record at this \nparticular point.\n  There being no objection, the matter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n     Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay.\n       Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     and Mr. Bond.\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, thereafter we had a vote on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record that particular \nvote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Rollcall Vote No. 283--Omnibus Budget Reconciliation\n\n                     (Social Security Trust Funds)\n\n       YEAS (98):\n       Democrats (55 or 100%): Adams, Akaka, Baucus, Bentsen, \n     Biden, Bingaman, Boren, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, \n     Burdick, Byrd, Conrad, Cranston, Daschle, DeConcini, Dixon, \n     Dodd, Exon, Ford, Fowler, Glenn, Gore, Graham, Harkin, \n     Heflin, Hollings, Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, \n     Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, \n     Mikulski, Mitchell, Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, \n     Riegle, Robb, Rockefeller, Sanford, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, \n     Simon, and Wirth.\n       Republicans (43 or 96%): Bond, Boschwitz, Burns, Chafee, \n     Coats, Cochran, Cohen,\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\n     D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, \n     Gramm, Grassley, Hatch, Hatfield, Heinz, Helms, Humphrey, \n     Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kasten, Lott, Lugar, Mack, McCain, \n     McClure, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, Pressler, \n     Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Specter, Stevens, Symms, Thurmond, \n     Warner, and Wilson.\n       NAYS (2):\n       Democrats (0 or 0%).\n       Republicans (2 or 4%): Armstrong and Wallop.\n       NOT VOTING (0):\n       Democrats (0).\n       Republicans (0).\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, 98 Senators in the U.S. Senate agreed \nwith me. I will tell you, Mr. President, it was really interesting \nbecause I have never seen such a thing occur. We all went home in those \ncampaigns and we talked about how we had finally put it into law. It \nwas on November 5, 1990, that George Herbert Walker Bush signed that \ninto law. That is the formal section of the Budget Act, section 13301. \nIt says, ``Thou shalt not use Social Security surpluses to obscure the \nsize of the deficit.'' We wanted to have truth in budgeting. When I say \n98 Senators, I counted up about 33 that are still here in the U.S. \nSenate that were there in 1990 voting for this.\n  Right to the point, here is the provision in the statute. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Federal Old Age and Survivors \n     Insurance trust fund shall not be counted as new budget \n     authority, or as outlays, or as receipts, or deficits, or \n     surplus for the purpose of the budget of the U.S. Government \n     as submitted by the President, or for the purposes of the \n     congressional budget, or for the purposes of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n\n  When we passed that, the distinguished Senator--and there is no one I \nhave greater respect for, and he is my friend, and I am his friend--\ncame on the floor yesterday, the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and he came on the floor yesterday late in the \nevening, and it is one of the things that prompted my appearance here \nthis afternoon. Let me quote from page S. 1294 of the Congressional \nRecord of February 12:\n\n       Frankly, I want to make sure that everybody knows that the \n     best use of the word gimmick for anything going on on this \n     floor has to do with the gimmick that some on that side of \n     the aisle are using when they speak of taking Social Security \n     off budget so you will assure Social Security's solvency and \n     the checks. That is a gimmick of the highest order. For you \n     do that, and there is no assurance that Congress will not \n     spend the trust funds surpluses for anything they want. It is \n     no longer subject to any budget discipline. It is out there \n     by itself.\n\n  Senator Domenici is totally mistaken.\n  Let me quote the real Senator Domenici. Here is the report, and I \nrefer to the Social Security Preservation Act of July 10, 1990, and the \nadditional views of Mr. Domenici.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entirety be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Additional Views of Mr. Domenici\n\n       It is somewhat ironic that the first legislative mark-up in \n     the 16 year history of the Senate Budget Committee produced a \n     bill that does not do what its authors suggest and, more \n     importantly, weakens the fiscal discipline inherent in the \n     Gramm-Rudmann-Hollings budget law.\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations.\n       The best way to protect Social Security is to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit. We need to balance our non-Social \n     Security budget so that the Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses can be invested (by lowering our national debt) \n     instead of used to pay for other Federal operating costs. We \n     could move toward this goal without changing the unified \n     budget, a concept which has served us well for over twenty \n     years now.\n       Changes in our accounting rules without real deficit \n     reduction will not make Social Security more sound. In fact, \n     we could make matters worse by opening up the trust funds to \n     unrestrained spending. Under current law, the trust funds are \n     protected by the budget process. Congress cannot spend the \n     trust fund reserves without new spending cuts or revenue \n     increases in the rest of the budget to meet Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings deficit reduction requirements. If we take Social \n     Security out of GRH without any new protection for the trust \n     funds, Congress could spend the reserves without facing new \n     spending cuts or revenue increases in other programs. And if \n     we spend the trust fund reserves today, we will threaten the \n     solvency of the Social Security program, putting at risk the \n     benefits we have promised to today's workers.\n       Of course, I also understand that we might be able to \n     restore some public trust by taking Social Security out of \n     the deficit calculation. Trust that we in Congress are not \n     ``masking the budget deficit'' with Social Security. That is \n     why I believe we should take Social Security out of the \n     deficit, but only if we provide strong protection against \n     spending the trust fund reserves. We need a ``firewell'' \n     around those trust funds to make sure the reserves are there \n     to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without \n     a ``firewall'' or the discipline of budget constraints, the \n     trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any \n     number of costly programs.\n       Unfortunately, the Hollings bill does not protect Social \n     Security, which is why Senator Nickles and I offered our \n     ``firewall'' amendment, defeated by a vote of 8 to 13. The \n     amendment, drafted over the last six months by my self and \n     Senators Heinz, Rudman, Gramm, and Deconcini, included: a 60 \n     vote point of order against legislation which would reduce \n     the 75 year acturial balance of the Social Security trust \n     funds; additional Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction \n     requirements in all years in which legislation lowered the \n     Social Security surpluses; and notification to Social \n     Security taxpayers on the Personal Earnings and Benefit \n     Estimate Statements (PEBES) each time Congress lowered the \n     reserves available to pay benefits to future retirees.\n       With just one exception, the others side of the aisle voted \n     against this protection for Social Security beneficiaries.\n       Furthermore, the Hollings bill says nothing about how or \n     when we will achieve balance in the non-Social Security \n     budget. The bill simply takes Social Security out of the \n     deficit calculation. If enacted, the Hollings bill would \n     require $173 billion in deficit reduction in 1991 to meet the \n     statutory GRH target (see attached table). Obviously, that is \n     not going to happen.\n       I believe we need to extend Gramm-Rudman--Hollings to \n     ensure we have the discipline to achieve balance in the non-\n     Social Security portion of the budget. The Budget Summit \n     negotiators are discussing a goal of $450 to $500 billion in \n     deficit reduction over the next five years. Once we reach an \n     agreement, that plan should be the framework for extending \n     the GRH law.\n       I offered a Sense of the Congress amendment during the \n     mark-up expressing this view. I offered this to put the \n     Hollings bill in some context.\n       But the Democratic members of the Committee refused to \n     consider even an amendment acknowledging the facts about our \n     budget situation, rejecting my proposal by another 8 to 13 \n     vote. In fact, the Chairman indicated that there was some \n     concern on his side of the aisle about extending the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings discipline. One might infer that, for some, \n     this mark-up was really an effort to kill Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings.\n       I am not sure what we accomplished in reporting out a bill \n     with no protection for Social Security and with no suggestion \n     of what we think should happen regarding the deficit targets. \n     I, for one, do not want to do anything which could endanger \n     Social Security or Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget discipline. \n     At a minimum, I will offer the ``firewall'' amendment to \n     protect Social Security should the reported bill be \n     considered by the full Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote:\n\n       We need to balance our non Social Security budget so that \n     the Social Security trust funds surpluses can be invested by \n     lowering our national debt instead of using it to pay for \n     other Federal operating costs. If we take Social Security \n     without any new protection for the trust funds, Congress \n     could spend the reserves without facing new spending cuts or \n     revenue increases in other programs, and, if we spend the \n     trust fund reserves today, we will threaten the solvency of \n     the Social Security program putting at risk the benefits we \n     have promised to today's workers.\n\n  Then the Senator goes on to submit firewall protection. He said this \nparticular statute is not enough. Here he is adamant about this \nstatute, says it is necessary, says it has to be done so you can't use \nthe money for anything else. Yet he insists now using the money for \nanything else as just hunky-dory, and the law itself is a gimmick.\n  Let me make sure so they don't have to look it up, subtitle C, \nsection 1301.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Excerpt From Public Law 101-508\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at \n     the end the following: ``The concurrent resolution shall not \n     include the outlays and revenue totals of the old age, \n     survivors, and disability insurance program established under \n     title II of the Social Security Act or the related provisions \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this subsection or in any other \n     surplus or deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that is pretty serious business when the \ndistinguished chairman of your own Budget Committee, who is supposed to \nlead the discipline, leads the nondiscipline.\n  I have laid it on the line. When you spend these moneys to obscure \nthe size of the deficit, thereupon that discipline is broken because \nyou are spending it. We have already spent about $570 billion, at this \nparticular point, Mr. President, and by the year 2002 we will owe over \n$1 trillion. In any of these budgets that will be debated here this \nyear, we will use over $1 trillion of Social Security trust funds to \nbalance the budget.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I stood here with the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, the chairman of our Budget Committee, 2 years ago and said if \nyou can give me a balanced budget by the year 2002, without increasing \ntaxes, I will jump off the Capitol dome.\n  Right to the point, we have tried our best, Senator Dorgan, myself \nand others--there are five of us--and I ask unanimous consent to \ninclude in the Record a letter dated March 1, 1995, where five of us \nsaid just reiterate the law rather than repeal the law.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We have received from Senator Domenici's \n     office a proposal to address our concerns about using the \n     Social Security trust funds to balance the Federal budget. We \n     have reviewed this proposal, and after consultations with \n     legal counsel, believe that this statutory approach does not \n     adequately protect Social Security. Specifically, \n     Constitutional experts from the Congressional Research \n     Service advise us that the Constitutional language of the \n     amendment will supersede any statutory constraint.\n       We want you to know that all of us have voted for, and are \n     prepared to vote for again, a balanced budget amendment. In \n     that spirit, we have attached a version of the balanced \n     budget amendment that we believe can resolve the impasse over \n     the Social Security issue.\n       To us, the fundamental question is whether the Federal \n     Government will be able to raid the Social Security trust \n     funds. Our proposal modifies those put forth by Senators Reid \n     and Feinstein to address objections raised by some Members of \n     the Majority. Specifically, our proposal prevents the Social \n     Security trust funds from being used for deficit reduction, \n     while still allowing Congress to make any warranted changes \n     to protect the solvency of the funds. The prior language of \n     the Reid and Feinstein amendments was not explicit that \n     adjustments could be made to ensure the soundness of the \n     trust funds.\n       If the Majority Party can support this solution, then we \n     are confident that the Senate can pass the balanced budget \n     amendment with more than 70 votes. If not, then we see no \n     reason to delay further the vote on final passage of the \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Wendell H. Ford,\n     Harry M. Reid,\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is why I ask unanimous consent also in addition to \nthe letter that we include Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 1\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds \n     of each House concurring therein), That the following article \n     is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution, which shall \n     be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the \n     Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-\n     fourths of the several States within seven years after the \n     date of its submission to the States for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law \n     for such an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       ``Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n       ``Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of \n     the United States Government except those derived from \n     borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \n     United States Government except for those for repayment of \n     debt principal.\n       ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.''.\n\n  Mr. President, it is impossible for they on the other side of the \naisle, or anybody else, to provide a budget that would be balanced in \nthe year 2002 without increasing taxes. That is not a daring statement \nto make because all you have to look at is the chart that I included, \nand you see the gross interest cost for the fiscal year in 1997, the \nyear we are in, is estimated to be at $360 billion. That is $1 billion \na day. No one has in mind over that 5-year period of cutting $360 \nbillion. Nor do I recommend, necessarily, that you cut that amount, but \nit is going to have to be a combination of cuts, freezes, and increased \ntaxes if we are to reach the balanced budget--and perhaps foregoing \nsome new programs.\n  When they all talk about these tax cuts that they have in mind for \nfamilies here and families there and students here and everything else, \nthere are no taxes to cut. We are operating and have been operating in \ndeficit mode in such a disastrous fashion, as in a downward spiral. The \nspending is on automatic pilot that must occur for interest costs on \nthe national debt faster than we can possibly raise any revenues or cut \nany spending. That ought to be clearly understood.\n  The best way to raise taxes is to continue on this course because you \ncontinue to raise interest costs. When you raise the debt, you raise \nthe interest costs, which is added, of course, to the debt, which \nincreases the debt, which increases the interest costs that must be \npaid just like taxes.\n  So the surreptitious way in order to raise taxes is to continue on \nthis particular path. That is why I have called for truth in budgeting \nso that everyone would understand that it is not a gimmick when we come \nup here and talk about the 1990 law. There is no criminal penalty for \nviolating it, but maybe we will have to get some court injunctions or \nsomething of that kind to forego this reporting of a unified budget for \nthe simple reason that there is no basis in law for that. There is only \nthe basis in law that we must report the deficit without the use of \nSocial Security trust funds in order to show the true deficit. Now, \nthat is the law today, but they continue to call it a gimmick.\n  Now, what happens here in Senate Joint Resolution 1, if you see \nsection 7, Mr. President, it says, ``Total receipts shall include all \nreceipts of the U.S. Government except those derived from \nborrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \nGovernment except those for the repayment of debt principal.''\n\n  That particular section 7 thereby repeals section 13301, the Social \nSecurity protection. The trust fund is immediately made a slush fund \nconstitutionally. And then, Mr. President, the way the particular \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 reads in section 1, ``Total outlays for any \nfiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.''\n  Now, Mr. President, that being the case, you have to get a three-\nfifths vote to succeed. If total outlays shall not exceed total \nreceipts, you cannot use the Social Security trust fund surpluses. You \ncan get what you would ordinarily call a balanced budget, but\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\nyou have to either cut spending or increase taxes in order to pay the \nSocial Security recipients. You can't use the surplus.\n  Now, that is pointed out, Mr. President, in a very dramatic fashion, \nby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities back in January, which I \nincluded in the Record at that particular time. Let me read this \nparagraph.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           The Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security\n\n       In recent years, Congress has considered two versions of \n     the balanced budget amendment. The version supported by the \n     Republican Congressional leadership (herein termed the \n     ``Leadership version'') requires the ``unified budget'' to be \n     balanced each year, including Social Security. The other \n     version, which Senators Wyden, Feinstein, Dorgan and others \n     introduced in the last Congress, requires the budget \n     exclusive of Social Security to be in balance.\n       The version that includes Social Security in the unified \n     budget poses serious dangers for the Social Security system. \n     It also is inequitable to younger generations, as it would \n     likely cause those who are children today to be saddled with \n     too heavy a tax load when they reach their peak earnings \n     years. The Wyden/Feinstein version does not pose those \n     problems.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       In coming decades, Social Security faces a demographic \n     bulge. The baby boomers are so numerous that when they \n     retire, the ratio of workers of retirees will fall to a low \n     level.\n       This poses a problem because Social Security has \n     traditionally operated on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis. The \n     payroll taxes contributed by today's workers finance the \n     benefits of today's retirees. Because there will be so many \n     retirees when the baby boomers grow old, however, it will be \n     difficult for workers of that period to carry the load \n     without large increases in payroll taxes.\n       The acclaimed 1983 bipartisan Social Security commission \n     headed by Alan Greenspan recognized this problem. It moved \n     Social Security from a pure ``pay-as-you-go'' system to one \n     under which the baby boomers would contribute more toward \n     their own retirement. As a result, the Social Security system \n     is now building up surpluses. By 2019, these surpluses will \n     equal $3 trillion. After that, as the bulk of the baby boom \n     generation moves into retirement, the system will draw down \n     the surpluses. This is akin to what families do in saving for \n     retirement during their working years and drawing down their \n     savings when they retire.\n       This approach has important merits. It promotes \n     generational equity by keeping the burden on younger \n     generations from becoming too high. In addition, if the \n     Social Security surpluses were to be used in the next two \n     decades to increase national saving rather than to offset the \n     deficit in the rest of the budget, that would likely result \n     in stronger economic growth, which in turn would better \n     enable the country to afford to support the baby boomers when \n     they reach their twilight years.\n       To pursue this approach, the tasks ahead are to reduce \n     significantly or eliminate the deficit in the non-Social \n     Security budget so that the surpluses in the Social Security \n     trust funds contribute in whole or large part to national \n     saving, and to institute further reforms in Social Security \n     to restore long-term actuarial balance to the Social Security \n     system. Restoring long-term balance will almost certainly \n     entail a combination of building the surpluses to somewhat \n     higher levels and reducing somewhat the benefits paid out \n     when the boomers retire.\n\n\n                 the leadership BBA and Social Security\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the \n     Leadership would undermine this approach to protecting Social \n     Security and promoting generational equity. Under this \n     version of the BBA, total government expenditures in any \n     year--including expenditures for Social Security benefits--\n     could not exceed total revenues collected in the same year. \n     The implications of this requirement for Social Security are \n     profound. It would mean that the Social Security surpluses \n     could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the baby boom \n     generation when it retires. The benefits for the baby boom \n     generation would instead have to be financed in full by the \n     taxes of those working in those years. The Leadership version \n     thus would eviscerate the central achievement of the \n     Greenspan commission.\n       The reason the Leadership version would have this effect is \n     that even though the Social Security trust funds would have \n     been accumulating large balances, drawing down those balances \n     when the baby boomers retire would mean that the trust funds \n     were spending more in benefits in those years than they were \n     taking in in taxes. Under the Leadership version, that would \n     result in impermissible deficit spending.\n       By precluding use of the Social Security surpluses in the \n     manner that the 1983 legislation intended, the Leadership \n     version would be virtually certain to precipitate a massive \n     crisis in Social Security about 20 years from now, even if \n     legislation had been passed in the meantime putting Social \n     Security in long-term actuarial balance. Since the $3 \n     trillion surplus could not be used to help pay the benefits \n     of the baby boom generation, the nation would face an \n     excruciating choice between much deeper cuts in Social \n     Security benefits than were needed to make Social Security \n     solvent and much larger increases in payroll taxes than would \n     otherwise be required. The third and only other allowable \n     alternative would be to finance Social Security deficits in \n     those years not by drawing down the Social Security surplus \n     but instead by slashing the rest of government so severely \n     that it failed to provide adequately for basic services, \n     potentially including the national defense.\n       Given the numbers of baby boomers who will be retired or on \n     the verge of retirement in those years, deep cuts in Social \n     Security benefits are not likely at that time. Thus, under \n     the leadership BBA, it is almost inevitable that younger \n     generations will face a combination of sharp payroll tax \n     increases and deep reductions in basic government services.\n       For these reasons, the Leadership BBA is highly inequitable \n     to younger generations. Aggravating this problem, the \n     Leadership version would undermine efforts to pass Social \n     Security reforms in the near future. Why should Congress and \n     the President bother to make hard choices now in Social \n     Security that would build the surpluses to more ample \n     levels if these surpluses can't be used when the boomers \n     retire? Under the leadership BBA, there is no longer any \n     reason to act now rather than to let Social Security's \n     financing problems fester.\n\n\n      leadership bba also poses other problems for social security\n\n       Under the Leadership version, reductions in Social Security \n     could be used to help Congress and the President balance the \n     budget when they faced a budget crunch. This could lead to \n     too little being done to reduce or eliminate deficits in the \n     non-Social Security part of the budget and unnecessary \n     benefit cutbacks in Social Security.\n       At first blush, that may sound implausible politically. But \n     the balanced budget amendment is likely to lead to periodic \n     mid-year crises, when budgets thought to be balanced at the \n     start of a fiscal year fall out of balance during the year, \n     as a result of factors such as slower-than-expected economic \n     growth. When sizable deficits emerge with only part of the \n     year remaining, they will often be very difficult to address. \n     Congress and the President may be unable to agree on a \n     package of budget cuts of the magnitude needed to restore \n     balance in the remaining months of the year. Congress also \n     may be unable to amass three-fifths majorities in both \n     chambers to raise the debt limit and allow a deficit.\n       In such circumstances, the President or possibly the courts \n     may feel compelled to act to uphold the Constitutional \n     requirement for budget balance. In documents circulated in \n     November 1996 explaining how the amendment would work, the \n     House co-authors of the amendment--Reps. Dan Schaefer and \n     Charles Stenholm--write that in such circumstances, ``The \n     President would be bound, at the point at which the \n     `Government runs out of money' to stop issuing checks.'' This \n     would place Social Security benefits at risk.\n\n\n                      the wyden/feinstein approach\n\n       The Wyden/Feinstein approach resolves the problems the \n     Leadership version creates in the Social Security area. It \n     reinforces the 1983 Social Security legislation rather than \n     undermining that legislation. It does so both by requiring \n     that the surpluses in the Social Security system contribute \n     to national saving rather than be used to finance deficits in \n     the rest of the budget and by enabling the surpluses to be \n     drawn down when the baby boomers retire.\n       The Wyden/Feinstein amendment thus improves \n     intergenerational equity rather than undermining it. It \n     ensures the surpluses will be intact when they are needed, \n     rather than lent to the government for other purposes in the \n     interim.\n       The amendment also ensures that Social Security benefits \n     will not be cut--and Social Security checks not placed in \n     jeopardy--if the balanced budget amendment leads to future \n     budget crises and showdowns. However those crises would be \n     resolved, Social Security would not be involved, because cuts \n     in Social Security would not count toward achieving budget \n     balance.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Quoting on page 2:\n\n       Under this version of the balanced budget amendment, total \n     Government expenditures in any year, including expenditures \n     for Social Security benefits, could not exceed total revenues \n     collected in the same year. The implications of this \n     requirement for Social Security are profound. It would mean \n     that Social Security surpluses could not be used to cover the \n     benefit costs of the baby-boom generation when it retires. \n     The benefits for the baby-boom generation would, instead, \n     have to be financed in full by the taxes of those working in \n     those years.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The leadership version, thus, would eviscerate the central \n     achievement of the Greenspan Commission.\n\n  Mr. President, that is followed up, finally, here, of course, with \nthe Congressional Research Service, which on February 5, came out with \na report from the American Law Division.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this CRS report be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1997.\n     To: _______.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Outlays from Social Security Surpluses \n         under BBA.\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry with respect \n     to the affect on the Social Security Trust Funds of the \n     pending Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA). Under S.J. Res. 1 as \n     it is now before the Senate, Sec. 1 would mandate that \n     ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year . . . .'' Outlays and receipts \n     are defined in Sec. 7 as practically all inclusive, with two \n     exceptions that are irrelevant here.\n       At some point, the receipts into the Social Security Trust \n     Funds will not balance the outlays from those Funds. Under \n     present law, then, the surpluses being built up in the Funds, \n     at least as an accounting practice, will be utilized to pay \n     benefits to the extent receipts for each year do not equal \n     the outlays in that year. Simply stated, the federal \n     securities held by the Trust Funds will be drawn down to \n     cover the Social Security deficit in that year, and the \n     Treasury will have to make good on those securities with \n     whatever moneys it has available.\n       However, Sec. 1 of the pending BBA requires that total \n     outlays for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts for \n     that fiscal year. Thus, the amount drawn from the Social \n     Security Trust Funds could not be counted in the calculation \n     of the balance between total federal outlays and receipts. We \n     are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not \n     be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would not require \n     that result. What it would mandate is that, inasmuch as the \n     United States has a unified budget, other receipts into the \n     Treasury would have to be counted to balance the outlays from \n     the Trust Funds and those receipts would not be otherwise \n     available to the Government for that year. Only if no other \n     receipts in any particular year could be found would the \n     possibility of a limitation on drawing down the Trust Funds \n     arise. Even in this eventuality, however, Congress would \n     retain authority under the BBA to raise revenues or to reduce \n     expenditures to obtain the necessary moneys to make good on \n     the liquidation of securities from the Social Security Trust \n     Funds.\n\n                                            Johnny H.

Daschle, Attention: Jonathan \n         Adelstein.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Outlays form Social Security Surpluses \n         under Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry for an \n     evaluation of an argument made in connection with \n     interpretation of the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment \n     (BBA), now pending in the Senate as S.J. Res. 1. Briefly \n     stated, the contention is that the terms of the proposal, if \n     proposed and ratified, would preclude, at a future time when \n     Social Security outlays in a particular year begin to exceed \n     Social Security receipts in that particular year, the use of \n     surpluses built up in the Social Security trust funds to pay \n     out benefits.\n       At the present time, surpluses are being accumulated in the \n     Social Security trusts funds, at least as an accounting \n     practice, as a result of changes made in 1983. It is expected \n     that when the receipts into the funds fall below the amount \n     being paid out that moneys from the surpluses will be used to \n     make up the differences.\n       The BBA would have its impact on this legislated plan \n     because under Sec. 1 of the proposal ``[t]otal outlays for \n     any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that \n     fiscal year, . . . .'' Under Sec. 7 of the BBA, the two terms \n     are defined thusly: ``Total receipts shall include all \n     receipts of the United States Government except those derived \n     from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of \n     the United States Government except for those for repayment \n     of debt principal.''\n       Therefore, under the BBA's language, there is mandated a \n     balance in each year of the outlays that year and the \n     receipts that year. Payments out of the balances of the \n     Social Security trust funds would not be counted as \n     Government receipts under the BBA, when in the year 2019, or \n     whenever the time occurs, the receipts in those particular \n     years into the Social Security funds are not adequate to \n     cover he outlays in those years. That is, payments out of the \n     trust fund surpluses could not be counted in the calculation \n     of the balance between total federal outlays and receipts. \n     Because the BBA requires that the required balance be between \n     outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys \n     that constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be \n     available as a balance for the payments of benefits.\n       Now, of course, this does not mean that Social Security \n     benefits could not be paid. If the rest of the receipts into \n     the Treasury for a particular year exceed outlays, this \n     amount could be used to offset the Social Security deficit. \n     And, again of course, tax or expenditure provisions, or both, \n     could be altered to create a new balance.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n                                      American Constitutional Law.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from this:\n\n       Because a balanced budget amendment requires that the \n     required balance be between outlays for that year and \n     receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social \n     Security surpluses would not be available as a balance for \n     the payment of the benefits.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we are talking about serious matters--the \nAmerican Law Division, the priorities on budgets. You have a very \nserious matter which has been called by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee a ``gimmick.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that at this particular time the letter of \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico, dated January 13, be printed \nin the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 1997.\n       Dear Republican Colleague: We are likely to debate early in \n     the 105th Congress the Constitutional amendment to require a \n     balanced federal budget. When that debate begins, some \n     Senators will push to remove Social Security from the \n     balanced budget requirement.\n       I have always believed this effort to exempt Social \n     Security from the Constitutional amendment was more of a \n     diversion than anything else. It is raised to confuse the \n     debate and provide a rationale for some to oppose the effort.\n       Nonetheless, in preparation for debate in the Senate, I \n     thought it was important to review with you the consequences \n     of such a proposal so that we can all effectively debate it \n     using facts.\n       One of the arguments made by those who push for excluding \n     Social Security from the balanced budget amendment is that \n     excluding Social Security will force us to ``save'' the \n     Social Security surpluses and therefore enhance fiscal \n     responsibility.\n       This is only a very small part of the story.\n       It is true that Social Security is currently running \n     surpluses, and these surpluses offset deficit spending in the \n     rest of the budget. If the balanced budget requirement \n     excludes Social Security, we would be required by the \n     Constitution to achieve balance in the ``on-budget'' portion \n     of the federal government--which is everything except Social \n     Security. The total or unified budget--which is the sum of \n     the ``on-budget'' programs and Social Security--would \n     therefore be in surpluses in amounts equal to the Social \n     Security surpluses. Between 2002 and 2018, these surpluses \n     would total $1.2 trillion in 1996 dollars.\n       It should go without saying that, when we are amending the \n     Constitution--now into its third century--we should take the \n     long view. And in the long run, these near term Social \n     security surpluses will be overwhelmed by massive, long-term \n     Social Security deficits.\n       These deficits are projected to total $9.3 trillion in 1996 \n     dollars between 2019 and 2050, with a deficit of about $630 \n     billion in 2050 alone, again in constant 1996 dollars.\n       If it is true that excluding Social Security from the \n     balanced budget amendment would force us to ``save'' the \n     short-term surpluses, it is equally true that excluding \n     Social Security would allow us to run massive budget deficits \n     equal to the deficits that are projected to occur in the \n     Social Security trust funds beginning in 2019.\n       These deficits would be real deficits--just like the \n     deficits we are experiencing today. And they would have the \n     same negative economic consequences: lower national savings, \n     higher interests rates, lower investment and productivity, \n     and sluggish growth. The only difference is that these \n     deficits would be much larger than anything we have ever \n     experienced, and therefore the consequences would be much \n     worse.\n       Ironically, these massive and unprecedented deficits would \n     be specifically sanctioned by an amendment to the \n     Constitution calling for ``balanced budgets'' excluding \n     Social Security. Congress could continue to pass so-called \n     ``balanced budgets'' while running up massive new debt which \n     would tremendously burden our economy.\n       The attachment chart shows graphically what I have just \n     described. ``On-budget'' would show a zero deficit throughout \n     the time period, as required by the Constitution. The total \n     budget which includes Social Security would show surpluses \n     for two decades or so followed by massive and unprecedented \n     deficits.\n       It should be obvious from this analysis that, contrary to \n     assertions by some who want to exclude Social Security, such \n     a move will weaken fiscal responsibility, not strengthen it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read on the first page of that letter \nthe last line:\n\n       It is equally true that excluding Social Security would \n     allow us to run massive budget deficits equal to the deficits \n     that are projected to occur in the Social Security trust \n     funds beginning in 2019. These deficits would be real \n     deficits.\n\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\n\n  That is what I am talking about, real deficits, not gimmicks. When \nyou borrow from one to minimize the size of the other; namely, the \ndeficit itself, then you really mislead the real deficit; you misreport \nit. Again, on yesterday, the distinguished leader for the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah [Mr. Hatch], said on page S1336:\n\n       The 1990 Budget Act basically stated in one section to take \n     Social Security out of budget. It said in another section to \n     leave it in.\n\n  That is not the case. Only one law passed in 1990. It is not a \ndifferent section. He said:\n\n       This is confusing:\n\n  Well, the statement made by the distinguished Senator from Utah is \nwhat is confusing.\n\n       But both Congress and the President have construed the \n     Budget Act of 1990 to allow Social Security to be included \n     within the unitary budget.\n\n  How? This is in violation of the 1990 law. If we had an enterprising \nfree press, a media who would go for truth in budgeting so that the \npublic would be properly and accurately informed, the Members \nthemselves would begin to command discipline rather than broken \ndiscipline when deficits are misreported. Mr. President, you can see \nwhat we really have here.\n  Now, they come, of course, and say that what really has occurred is \nthat this is a vote for the senior citizens. Not at all. I readily \nacknowledge that Social Security is the senior citizens' program and \nthey are vitally interested in it. But between Medicare and Social \nSecurity, the present-day recipients have yet to be heard from. I \nhaven't heard from them. I have asked why not. Of course, the obvious \nreason, Mr. President, is they are going to get their money. They know \nthey are going to be paid right now. So they are putting all their \nefforts on saving Medicare and health costs and could care less about \nthe baby-boom generation. In contrast, the baby-boom generation are \nbeing told they are not going to get it, so why should they show any \nkind of interest in the thing that they say is not going to be there \nfor them anyway?\n  And the politicians sometimes say: Why should we concern ourselves \nabout the baby-boom generation? Why should we not look to the next \nelection rather than the next generation? Of course, that occurs. They \nlook just to the next election.\n  This particular initiative--the amendment that will be presented by \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid--is not a gimmick. \nIt is based in law. It is one worked on by the Senator from Utah, who \nvoted for it, the Senator from New Mexico, who voted for it and said it \nhas serious purpose. He did not call it a gimmick in 1990. We thought \nwe had it all down and understood. But that's what happens when they go \nout to Andrews Air Force Base. They went out there in 1990 and they \nrepealed the targets of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. So often, having been a \nprincipal cosponsor, I am asked, ``Senator, what about Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings?'' Oh, no, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was working. We had an \nautomatic cut across the board, and they eliminated it. I made the \npoint of order at 1:15 in the morning on October 21, 1990, that is \nexactly what they were doing. They voted that point of order down. So \ndon't come to me and say Gramm-Rudman-Hollings didn't work. It worked \nand would have continued to work had they not repealed it in 1990.\n  My final statement is to the effect that the distinguished President \nof the United States, for 10 years prior to his arrival here for his \nfirst term in 1993, spent 10 years balancing budgets down in Arkansas. \nHe is the only President since Lyndon Baines Johnson balanced this \nbudget in 1968 and 1969 to reduce the deficit 4 consecutive years. \nPresident Clinton is the only President who has come to Washington and \nlowered the deficit. Listen to that statement.\n  He has lowered it each year and every year. Yet, there is a crowd \nhere on the Senate floor which keeps running around in a circle like \nthe President is a tax-and-spend liberal Democrat when they are the \nones that tripled--excuse me, quadrupled--excuse me, quintupled the \nFederal debt. Five times $1 trillion is $5 trillion. It was less than \n$1 trillion when Ronald Reagan came to town. Now it is $5.3 trillion. \nThey are the ones, not President Clinton, that ran up this horrendous \ndebt that is causing us to spend $1 billion a day in interest costs \nwhich increases taxes $1 billion a day. Because you add it to the debt, \nyou have to pay for it, and it is a subtle way of increasing taxes. And \nrunning around fussing at the President saying, ``Where is his balanced \nbudget? And he has not balanced it.'' Where is their budget? I am \nlooking for one. I am on the Budget Committee. I attend meetings. I \nlook around. They don't have a budget.\n  It is wheeling and dealing, and all these other things going on. If \nthat is what we are going to have, let us get rid of the Budget \nCommittee so we can put our effort and time somewhere else. But that is \nthe gamesmanship that is being played. They don't want to put up a \nbudget because they know that budget will show massive tax cuts in that \n5-year period being offset by cuts in Medicare. And on up and up and \naway the deficit goes.\n  So I think the gamesmanship as we go on our break here in February \nought to conclude. Let us get their budget. Let us compare the two \nbudgets like we do in the regular sense of the word, reconcile the \ndifferences, and go forward with the work of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to briefly \nrespond to Senator Hollings concerning his remarks claiming that \npassage and ratification of the balanced budget amendment would harm \nthe Social Security Program. As did Senators Dorgan, Reid, and Conrad \nat a press conference held yesterday, Senator Hollings claimed that a \none-page memorandum, dated February 5, 1997, from the Congressional \nResearch Service--which was inaccurately termed a ``study''--was \ncharacterized as proof that passage and ratification of the balanced \nbudget amendment will harm Social Security. This is alleged to be true \nbecause the balanced budget amendment would not allow the present day \nsurplus to be used in the future when the program goes into the red to \npay benefits. The problem is that the CRS memorandum did not conclude \nthat at all.\n  All the CRS memorandum concluded was that Social Security existing \nsurpluses after 2019--the year the program no longer produces surpluses \nbecause of the retirement of the baby boomers--could not be used to \nfund the program unless benefit expenditures were offset by revenue or \nbudget cuts. Of course this is technically true. That's what a balanced \nbudget does. It balances outlays and receipts in a given year, and \nexpenditure of any part of the budget is an outlay. Despite what \nSenator Hollings alleges today, and Senators Conrad, Dorgan, and Reid \nclaimed yesterday at their press conference, under current law, assets \nof the Federal Treasury could be drawn upon to ensure payments to \nbeneficiaries today and when the system starts running annual deficits.\n  To clear-up the confusion that the Conrad-Dorgan-Reid press \nconference created about the February 5 CRS memorandum, which Senator \nHollings has apparently bought into, CRS produced another memorandum at \nSenator Domenici's request. I want to thank Senator Domenici for \nrequesting this new CRS memorandum--dated February 12, 1997. This \nmemorandum clearly states--and I quote--``We [that is CRS] are not \nconcluding that the trust fund surpluses could not be drawn down to pay \nbeneficiaries. The balanced budget amendment would not require that \nresult.''\n  Senator Hollings and the other critics of the balanced budget fail to \nmention a few things. They fail to mention that CRS in the memorandum \nalso concluded that the present day surpluses are merely ``an \naccounting practice.'' Past CRS studies clearly demonstrate that the \nSocial Security trust funds are indeed an accounting measure. There is \nno separate Federal vault where Social Security receipts are stored. \nThere exists no separate Social Security trust fund separate from the \nbudget. Social Security taxes--called FICA taxes--are simply deposited \nwith all other Federal revenues. The moneys attributed to Social \nSecurity are tracked as bookkeeping entries so that we can determine \nhow well the program operates. As soon as the amounts\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nattributed to FICA taxes are entered on the books, Federal interest \nbearing bonds are electronically entered as being purchased. This is \nthe safest investment that exists.\n\n  This country has a unified budget. This means that the proceeds from \nSocial Security Taxes are part of the Treasury--of general revenue. CRS \nhas recognized this. Moreover, I might add, without including the \npresent day surpluses, the budget cannot be balanced. That is why \nPresident Clinton has included the Social Security funds in every one \nof his budgets. Did Senators Hollings, Conrad, Dorgan, and Reid oppose \nthis?\n  Senator Hollings also denies that we have a unitary budget. He says \nthat the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act [BEA] placed Social Security off-\nbudget. That, in fact, we have two budgets--one for Social Security and \none for the rest of the Nation. Let me expand on the remarks I made \nyesterday concerning the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act and explain why \nSenator Hollings position is false. Under section 13301(a) of the act, \nthe receipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds are indeed \nnot counted in both the President and Congress' budgets. So it is off-\nbudget, but for only certain specific reasons. The primary purpose for \nthis exclusion was to exempt Social Security from sequestration by the \nPresident under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings procedures and from the act's \npay-as-you-go requirement. In addition, as added protections, sections \n13302 and 13303 of the BEA also created firewall point-of-order \nprotections for the Social Security trust funds in both the House and \nSenate. Nevertheless, this does not preclude both Congress and the \nPresident from formulating a unitary budget--that includes Social \nSecurity trust funds--for national fiscal purposes.\n  Look, I recognize that Social Security is in danger. But the problem \nis not the inclusion Social Security funds in the budget. The problem \nis that with the retirement of baby boomers, there will not be enough \nFICA taxes to fund their retirement. CRS, in an other study, concluded \nthat the present day surpluses would not be sufficient to resolve this \nproblem. These Senators never mention that. CRS also concluded that the \nSocial Security Program needs to be fixed.\n  Indeed, not including Social Security in the budget would harm the \nprogram. Congress would rename social programs--as they have done \nbefore--as Social Security and use the FICA taxes to fund these \nprograms. Then you'll really see the program raided.\n  My colleagues problem--in reality--is not with the balanced budget \namendment, but with the problems the Social Security Program faces. We \nneed to fix that and adopting the balanced budget amendment is a good \nstart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1358-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Coats].

Mr. President, I send a substitute or amended resolution \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 55) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the need to address immediately the decline \n     in milk prices.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this resolution is being submitted on \nbehalf of Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, \nWellstone, Snowe, and Collins.\n  It follows activity which Senator Santorum and I had undertaken in \nour State where the farmers have been very hard hit by low milk prices \nand rising costs of production, so that many, many farmers are near \nbankruptcy.\n  It is my understanding that this is a national problem, not only a \nproblem in Pennsylvania. On Monday of this week, Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman went to northeastern Pennsylvania and heard \nfrom a large assembly of farmers, estimated at some 500, and heard \nfirsthand the plight of those farmers, again, as I say representative \nof the Nation.\n\n  We all know that we rely upon the farmers for our supply of food. We \nknow how important milk is in that supply. And we have a large group of \nfarmers who laid it on the line in very emphatic and dramatic terms \nabout their impending bankruptcy, the hard times they were facing \nbecause the price of milk had dropped so precipitously from $15.37 per \nhundredweight in September to $11.34 cents per hundredweight in \nDecember 1996, all the time costs going up.\n  In our inquiry on this issue, we found that a key ingredient on the \npricing of milk was the price of cheese, and that the price of cheese \nhad been established by the Green Bay Cheese Exchange, and that the \nprice on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange might not be realistic of the \naccurate market price. If the price of cheese is raised by 10 cents, it \nmeans there would be a rise in the price of milk $1 per hundredweight.\n  I do believe that the Secretary of Agriculture is sympathetic to this \nissue and would like to ascertain the accurate price of cheese.\n  It is my thought, Mr. President, from all that I know, and it has to \nbe verified, that the price of cheese is priced unreasonably low at \nthis time by the Green Bay Exchange; therefore, the Green Bay \nExchange's price of cheese is really not the price of cheese.\n  This resolution maintains that it is the sense of the Senate that the \nSecretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately pursuant to \nhis legal authority to modify the basic formula price for dairy by \nreplacing the national cheese exchange as a factor to be considered in \nsetting the basic formula price.\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n  This resolution has been filed pursuant to the leadership initiated \nby my colleague, Senator Santorum, who traveled to northeastern \nPennsylvania several weeks ago. I went this past Monday. And I think it \nwill put us on a track to show that something can be done immediately. \nWhen I say immediately, within the course of the next several weeks.\n  It had been my hope that we might have been able to make some \nmodification in the price of cheese to have even faster action by the \nSecretary of Agriculture. But considering the fact that this resolution \nwas drafted on Monday morning and has gone through considerable \nanalysis by a number of Members of the Senate--and I thank my \ncolleagues for their prompt attention to this issue--we are moving now \nvery, very rapidly.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me point out that there was an \nextensive study of the Green Bay Cheese Exchange made at the request of \nthe Secretary of Agriculture of the State of Wisconsin, and there were \nsome indications there that because of the limited amount of cheese \nwhich was traded there, there was an opportunity to have a price \nestablished which was not genuinely a market price. The amount of \ncheese traded at Green Bay was less than one-half of 1 percent, and \nwhere you have such a limited exchange rate and with people at the \nscene who have a considerable interest in having a lower price of \ncheese, that result may not have represented the accurate market price \nof cheese.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority unilaterally to make a \nmodification on the price of cheese if he develops an evidentiary base \nfrom other transactions which lead him to conclude that is not the fair \nmarket price of cheese, and I believe that to be the case. The \nSecretary of Agriculture had previously initiated the process on \ninformal rulemaking, which would take some considerable period of time. \nBut he does have the authority.\n  If we may vote at this time, Mr. President, I will conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his efforts on this issue.\n  The Cheese Exchange is of great concern to all dairy farmers \nnationwide, because it is a market that is very thinly traded, \ncompletely unregulated, and has a great deal of influence on the prices \nthat farmers are paid for their milk.\n  That's why my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold and I have \nbeen working to reduce the influence of the Cheese Exchange. Both \nSenator Feingold and I introduced legislation on this matter last week. \nUltimately, what we need to do is find an alternative price discovery \nmechanism that is more reflective of market conditions, and less \nsubject to manipulation.\n  And we have two initiatives underway that could form the basis for \nnew price discovery mechanisms.\n  First, we've worked with Secretary Glickman to start a new cheese \nprice survey, to survey cheese plants nationwide, to get a better view \nof prices paid for cheese. If done right, this could be very useful as \na price discovery mechanism. But there's still some issues that need to \nbe ironed out.\n  And second, we've asked other exchanges such as the Coffee, Sugar, \nCocoa Exchange to explore the possibility of creating a new cash market \nfor cheese. Again, if this is done right, it could be very useful as a \nnew price discovery mechanism.\n  But in the short term, the Senator from Pennsylvania is right, we \nneed to delink the National Cheese Exchange from the farmers' milk \nprices, and we need to do that as soon as possible. Two weeks ago, the \nSecretary of Agriculture announced a 60-day comment period on that \nexact proposal. The trick will be to find a new equivalent price \nmechanism, to take it's place. We need to find a new mechanism that is \ncredible, or we'll merely make matters worse.\n  So I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I look forward to \nworking with him on this issue, which has been a longstanding concern \nof mine. As far as I'm concerned, the more Senators become aware of \nthis problem and join our efforts, the better.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, in submitting the Sense of the Senate \nResolution directing the Secretary of Agriculture to take action to \ndelink the National Cheese Exchange from the basic formula price \nestablished by USDA under Federal Milk Marketing Orders.\n  Dairy farmers have been concerned for many years about the role of \nthe National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, WI, in determining \nthe price they receive for their milk. While the exchange has had an \nindirect influence on milk prices for many years, it also directly \naffects milk prices through USDA's basic formula price, established by \nregulation in 1995. For years, Wisconsin farmers have been concerned \nthat the characteristics of the Exchange, outlined in this resolution, \nmake it vulnerable to price manipulation. Those fears were confirmed by \na March 1996 report by the University of Wisconsin Department of \nAgricultural Economics which found evidence supporting the allegations \nof manipulations. The concerns about manipulation and the influence of \nthe exchange on milk prices nationally, were further heightened by the \ndramatic and unprecedented decline in cheese prices on the exchange \nlast fall which led to a 26 percent decline in farm milk prices.\n  The senior Senator from Wisconsin Senator Kohl and I have been \nworking to address the concerns of the UW report for the last 10 months \nand have introduced legislation to address the short- and long-term \nproblems associated with the Cheese Exchange. The directive of the \nresolution introduced by the Senator from Pennsylvania is also included \nin my bill S. 258, the Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act of 1997 \nwhich I introduced last week. My legislation goes beyond the directive \nin the resolution by seeking additional long term solutions to the lack \nof price discovery in milk markets and by establishing improved USDA \noversight of the National Cheese Exchange. S. 256, introduced by the \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin Senator Kohl, which I have cosponsored, \nwould enhance the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in \nNational Cheese Exchange oversight as well.\n  The resolution we are introducing today, however, emphasizes the \nimportance of quick action on this problem by the Secretary of \nAgriculture and I am pleased to welcome the Senator from Pennsylvania \nto our efforts to resolve this very difficult problem. Farmers have a \nright to expect that milk prices are determined fairly and without \nmanipulation. The resolution introduced today is a step toward reducing \nthe influence of the exchange on farm-level milk prices.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to work with us \ntoward the enactment of S. 258 and S. 256 as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Pennsylvania propounding a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that I do have the authority \nto yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I send a substitute or amended resolution \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 55) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the need to address immediately the decline \n     in milk prices.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this resolution is being submitted on \nbehalf of Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, \nWellstone, Snowe, and Collins.\n  It follows activity which Senator Santorum and I had undertaken in \nour State where the farmers have been very hard hit by low milk prices \nand rising costs of production, so that many, many farmers are near \nbankruptcy.\n  It is my understanding that this is a national problem, not only a \nproblem in Pennsylvania. On Monday of this week, Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman went to northeastern Pennsylvania and heard \nfrom a large assembly of farmers, estimated at some 500, and heard \nfirsthand the plight of those farmers, again, as I say representative \nof the Nation.\n\n  We all know that we rely upon the farmers for our supply of food. We \nknow how important milk is in that supply. And we have a large group of \nfarmers who laid it on the line in very emphatic and dramatic terms \nabout their impending bankruptcy, the hard times they were facing \nbecause the price of milk had dropped so precipitously from $15.37 per \nhundredweight in September to $11.34 cents per hundredweight in \nDecember 1996, all the time costs going up.\n  In our inquiry on this issue, we found that a key ingredient on the \npricing of milk was the price of cheese, and that the price of cheese \nhad been established by the Green Bay Cheese Exchange, and that the \nprice on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange might not be realistic of the \naccurate market price. If the price of cheese is raised by 10 cents, it \nmeans there would be a rise in the price of milk $1 per hundredweight.\n  I do believe that the Secretary of Agriculture is sympathetic to this \nissue and would like to ascertain the accurate price of cheese.\n  It is my thought, Mr. President, from all that I know, and it has to \nbe verified, that the price of cheese is priced unreasonably low at \nthis time by the Green Bay Exchange; therefore, the Green Bay \nExchange's price of cheese is really not the price of cheese.\n  This resolution maintains that it is the sense of the Senate that the \nSecretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately pursuant to \nhis legal authority to modify the basic formula price for dairy by \nreplacing the national cheese exchange as a factor to be considered in \nsetting the basic formula price.\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n  This resolution has been filed pursuant to the leadership initiated \nby my colleague, Senator Santorum, who traveled to northeastern \nPennsylvania several weeks ago. I went this past Monday. And I think it \nwill put us on a track to show that something can be done immediately. \nWhen I say immediately, within the course of the next several weeks.\n  It had been my hope that we might have been able to make some \nmodification in the price of cheese to have even faster action by the \nSecretary of Agriculture. But considering the fact that this resolution \nwas drafted on Monday morning and has gone through considerable \nanalysis by a number of Members of the Senate--and I thank my \ncolleagues for their prompt attention to this issue--we are moving now \nvery, very rapidly.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me point out that there was an \nextensive study of the Green Bay Cheese Exchange made at the request of \nthe Secretary of Agriculture of the State of Wisconsin, and there were \nsome indications there that because of the limited amount of cheese \nwhich was traded there, there was an opportunity to have a price \nestablished which was not genuinely a market price. The amount of \ncheese traded at Green Bay was less than one-half of 1 percent, and \nwhere you have such a limited exchange rate and with people at the \nscene who have a considerable interest in having a lower price of \ncheese, that result may not have represented the accurate market price \nof cheese.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority unilaterally to make a \nmodification on the price of cheese if he develops an evidentiary base \nfrom other transactions which lead him to conclude that is not the fair \nmarket price of cheese, and I believe that to be the case. The \nSecretary of Agriculture had previously initiated the process on \ninformal rulemaking, which would take some considerable period of time. \nBut he does have the authority.\n  If we may vote at this time, Mr. President, I will conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, we have seen the specter this week of our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle proposing to exempt \nadditional programs from the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution: Social Security, emergency spending, veterans programs, \nhousing programs, education, health and welfare programs, college aid \nand training programs, law enforcement programs, the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, highways, bridges, dams, roads, buildings, and it goes on \nand on. Given how far afield we have gone in this debate, I wanted to \nvery briefly try to remind the Senate and those who are following this \ndebate what this debate is about. This debate is about families making \nhard decisions at their kitchen table, trying to make ends meet. So I \nthought I would look today, at 28 years ago, the last year that we had \na balanced budget in America.\n  The last time we had a balanced budget was in 1969. If you look at \nthe front page of the Washington Post for Thursday, February 13, 1969, \nyou can see that not very much happened in the world 28 years ago today \nwhen we had a balanced budget. But there was some very exciting news \nthat day. The very exciting news was not on the front page; the very \nexciting news was in the want ads. I would like just to review what \nAmerica looked like the last time we had a balanced budget.\n  Dale City is a city 25 miles south of Washington. It is sort of a \nmiddle-class neighborhood. In Dale City, 28 years ago today, when we \nhad a balanced budget, they were advertising new homes that were \nselling between $18,600 and $38,000 apiece. In the richest county in \nAmerica, Montgomery County, 28 years ago, when we had our last balanced \nbudget, they were advertising new homes in Walnut Hill for $32,500.\n  And 28 years of deficit spending later, they are still running want \nads. They ran them today. The want ads today show that houses in the \nsuburbs of Northern Virginia are selling between $230,000 and $340,000 \napiece, and in Montgomery County they are selling for $270,000 a piece.\n  The newspaper of 28 years ago today did not have any news on the \nfront page worthy of being remembered, but it had want ads worthy of \nbeing remembered.\n  A Chevrolet Impala could be bought for $51 a month, and you had it \npaid off in 3 years. That was 28 years ago today, the last time we had \na balanced budget. Today, to buy a Chevrolet Cavalier, it costs you \n$194 a month, and you have to pay for 6 years to pay it off.\n  There was not much exciting news on the front page of the paper 28 \nyears ago today, when we had a balanced budget, but there was exciting \nnews in the want ads. You could buy a new Goodyear tire for $8.75 \napiece. Now, in fact, there is an ad today for $24.99. But my guess is, \n28 years ago and today, if you went out to get the $8 tires then or the \n$24 tires today, you would find that they did not fit your car. But \nlook at what has happened to the base tire in terms of expenses.\n  Twenty-eight years ago today, the public was buying pork. And our \nGovernment was beginning to go on a binge of pork that would last 28 \nyears. Pork chops at Giant 28 years ago today were 89 cents a pound. \nPork chops at A 28 years ago today, as advertised in the Post, were \n89 cents a pound. Pork chops at Safeway 28 years ago today, when we had \na balanced budget, were 89 cents a pound. Today, in the Washington \nPost, Safeway boneless pork chops are $3.99 a pound. Mr. President, 28 \nyears ago there was not a big headline in the paper, but there should \nhave been. The big headline in the paper should have been, ``Budget \nBalanced This Year for the Last Year in 28 Years.''\n  Our colleagues say: Well, things are going great. It's wonderful. We \nought to exempt the budget from itself. There's no reason to quit \nspending. But I think anybody who looks at what was in the paper 28 \nyears ago today and what is in the paper today has to conclude that \nthere have been a lot of changes in the 28 years since we have had a \nbalanced budget and that many of those changes are not trends that we \nwant to continue.\n  Finally, tomorrow is Valentine's Day. Twenty-eight years ago today \nyou could buy this Whitman deluxe red foil heart assortment, 1 pound of \ncandy, for $2.66. After 28 years of deficit spending here in \nWashington, it costs $8.79.\n  Mr. President, maybe some of our colleagues on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle could say: Well, don't worry about housing costs up from \n$18,000 to\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\n$230,000 and don't worry about automobile costs up from a monthly \npayment of $51 to a monthly payment of $248. Maybe they could say: \nDon't worry about the price of tires and don't worry about pork. But \nwhen the cost of love is exploding, the time has come to stop deficit \nspending. That is what this debate is about. I wanted to remind my \ncolleagues before we all left for our work period at home. This \norganization is permanently charged with ensuring compliance with the \nconvention's requirements and with monitoring the chemical industry and \nthe chemical production throughout the world. The convention's \npreparatory commission, which is located in The Hague, is currently \ndetermining precisely how the permanent organization is going to be \nstructured and how the convention is going to be implemented.\n\n  Every State that ratifies that convention has to complete the \ndestruction of chemical weapons agents, munitions and production \nfacilities within 10 years of the convention's entry into force, or its \ndate of ratification, whichever comes earlier.\n  I would like to describe what the treaty accomplishes in terms of \ncontrol of chemicals and their precursors and monitoring and tracking \nof those chemicals and precursors.\n  The convention establishes three lists, or schedules as they are \ncalled, of chemical warfare agents and their precursor chemicals. These \nare arranged in the order of their importance to chemical weapons \nproduction and the extent of their legitimate peaceful or commercial \nuses.\n  The OPCW Technical Secretariat will update those schedules as needed \nand as circumstances change. And the production, the use, or the \ntransfer of any chemicals on these schedules above set minimal amounts \nmust be projected prospectively by the manufacturers and subsequently \nreported annually to the OPCW.\n  Any facility that makes use of or is capable of producing scheduled \nchemicals has to register with the OPCW, as do facilities that produce \nover 30 metric tons annually of a discrete chemical containing \nphosphorous, sulphur, or fluorine.\n  So, Mr. President, what we gain here is a mechanism for knowing \nglobally who produces what chemicals, how much they produce, and where \nthese chemicals are going.\n  The inspections of chemical facilities provided by the convention \nwill vary according to the nature of the chemicals. Those declared as \nproducing, storing, or destroying chemical weapons are subject to \nsystematic on-site inspection and continuous instrument monitoring. \nThose chemical facilities declared as nonchemical weapons facilities \nare subject to routine or random inspections, depending on the schedule \nor schedules on which the chemicals they produce or handle are listed. \nAll other facilities that produce or handle or are suspected of \nproducing or handling chemicals are subject to on-site challenge \ninspections upon the request of a signatory nation.\n  So, I reiterate, under the terms of the convention we will achieve \nfor the first time the ability to know who is producing what chemicals, \nhow much they produce, and where these chemicals are moving, and we \nobtain the ability to inspect any of those chemical production or \nhandling entities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1367-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1368]\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we have seen the specter this week of our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle proposing to exempt \nadditional programs from the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution: Social Security, emergency spending, veterans programs, \nhousing programs, education, health and welfare programs, college aid \nand training programs, law enforcement programs, the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, highways, bridges, dams, roads, buildings, and it goes on \nand on. Given how far afield we have gone in this debate, I wanted to \nvery briefly try to remind the Senate and those who are following this \ndebate what this debate is about. This debate is about families making \nhard decisions at their kitchen table, trying to make ends meet. So I \nthought I would look today, at 28 years ago, the last year that we had \na balanced budget in America.\n  The last time we had a balanced budget was in 1969. If you look at \nthe front page of the Washington Post for Thursday, February 13, 1969, \nyou can see that not very much happened in the world 28 years ago today \nwhen we had a balanced budget.

Mr. President, I want to talk about an issue of enormous \nimportance to our national security and express my hope that during the \ncourse of the next week, while the U.S. Senate is out of session, \nSenators will focus on and think hard about our responsibilities with \nrespect to the Chemical Weapons Convention. More than 100 years of \ninternational efforts to ban chemical weapons, 100 years of effort, \nculminated January 13, 1993, in the final days of the Bush \nadministration when the United States of America signed the Chemical \nWeapons Convention as one of the original signatories.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will focus \nclosely on the efforts of former President Bush, former National \nSecurity Adviser General Scowcroft, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff General Powell, and so many other people whose bona fides with \nrespect to issues of national security I do not believe have ever been \nat issue. They all worked hard and fought hard to bring this Convention \nto a successful conclusion.\n  Since the time the United States signed it as one of the original \nsignatories, 160 other nations have joined in signing it. That is 161, \nI might say, out of a total of 190 independent states that compose the \nworld community of nations.\n  Immediately after the signing, the process of ratification by the \nsignatories began. The convention was submitted to the U.S. Senate for \nits advice and consent in November 1993, and multiple hearings have \nbeen held by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Judiciary Committee \nduring both the 103d and the 104th Congresses. As of January 27, 1997, \n68 nations have already ratified the Convention, but not the United \nStates of America that helped lead the effort of its creation.\n  This Convention provides that it will take force and its provisions \nwill become applicable to party nations 180 days following its \nratification by the 65th nation. The 65th ratification occurred late \nlast year, so the clock is now ticking toward the date on which it \nenters into force. The Convention will enter into force on April 29 of \nthis year, just a little more than 2 months after we return from the \nrecess period that begins later today.\n  It is important to understand the provisions of the Convention, \nespecially when measured against that date. The Convention bans the \ndevelopment, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons by \nits signatories. It also requires the destruction of virtually all \nchemical weapons and production facilities.\n  This treaty also provides the most extensive, most intrusive \nverification regime of any arms control treaty yet negotiated, \nextending its coverage not only to governmental and military but also \nto civilian facilities.\n  The fact is that this verification package provides, in the end, \nincreased security to the United States. That verification package \nincludes instrument monitoring, both routine and random inspections, \nand challenge inspections for sites that are suspected of chemical \nweapons storage or production. The Convention also requires export \ncontrols and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as \nwarfare agents and their precursors.\n  In order to implement its provisions and to administer them on an \nongoing basis, the Convention establishes the Organization for \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, or the OPCW. This organization is \npermanently charged with ensuring compliance with the Convention's \nrequirements and with monitoring the chemical industry and the chemical \nproduction throughout the world. The Convention's preparatory \ncommission, which is located in The Hague, is currently determining \nprecisely how the permanent organization is going to be structured and \nhow the Convention is going to be implemented.\n\n  Every State that ratifies that Convention has to complete the \ndestruction of chemical weapons agents, munitions and production \nfacilities within 10 years of the Convention's entry into force, or its \ndate of ratification, whichever comes earlier.\n  I would like to describe what the treaty accomplishes in terms of \ncontrol of chemicals and their precursors and monitoring and tracking \nof those chemicals and precursors.\n  The Convention establishes three lists, or schedules as they are \ncalled, of chemical warfare agents and their precursor chemicals. These \nare arranged in the order of their importance to chemical weapons \nproduction and the extent of their legitimate peaceful or commercial \nuses.\n  The OPCW Technical Secretariat will update those schedules as needed \nand as circumstances change. And the production, the use, or the \ntransfer of any chemicals on these schedules above set minimal amounts \nmust be projected prospectively by the manufacturers and subsequently \nreported annually to the OPCW.\n  Any facility that makes use of or is capable of producing scheduled \nchemicals has to register with the OPCW, as do facilities that produce \nover 30 metric tons annually of a discrete chemical containing \nphosphorous, sulphur or fluorine.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, what we gain here is a mechanism for knowing \nglobally who produces what chemicals, how much they produce, and where \nthese chemicals are going.\n  The inspections of chemical facilities provided by the Convention \nwill vary according to the nature of the chemicals. Those declared as \nproducing, storing, or destroying chemical weapons are subject to \nsystematic on-site inspection and continuous instrument monitoring. \nThose chemical facilities declared as nonchemical weapons facilities \nare subject to routine or random inspections, depending on the schedule \nor schedules on which the chemicals they produce or handle are listed. \nAll other facilities that produce or handle or are suspected of \nproducing or handling chemicals are subject to on-site challenge \ninspections upon the request of a signatory nation.\n  So, I reiterate, under the terms of the Convention we will achieve \nfor the first time the ability to know who is producing what chemicals, \nhow much they produce, and where these chemicals are moving, and we \nobtain the ability to inspect any of those chemical production or \nhandling entities.\n  Signatory nations agree not to export the most troublesome chemicals, \nthose listed in schedule 1, to any nonsignatory nation. Schedule 2 \nchemicals may be traded with nonsignatory nations for only 3 years \nafter the Convention enters into force, and schedule 3 chemicals, which \nare the least troublesome and most widely used commercially, can be \nfreely traded for 5 years after the Convention comes into force so long \nas end-use certification is provided. Five years after the Convention \ncomes into force, additional controls will be considered and may be \nrequired.\n  Now, Mr. President, one might reasonably expect that all those in \nthis institution would by their study of history be aware of the \noccasions when chemical weapons have been used in conflicts and the \nhorrifying effects that they can have and have had on both combatants \nand noncombatants, and one would think those with such an awareness \nwould warmly embrace and applaud the successful negotiation and \napparent widespread acceptance of this Convention among the nations of \nthe world. The images, both visual and verbal, of the effects of \nchemical weapons have seared themselves into our minds.\n  We know the effects of mustard gas in the trenches of Europe in World \nWar I. We know of the terrible effect of chemicals employed in the \nIran-Iraq War. Americans have witnessed the anguish of those who served \nin the gulf war who are suffering from maladies that may have resulted \nfrom some exposure to chemical weapons amassed by Saddam Hussein in \nIraq. Civilized people everywhere have been repelled by the effects of \nthese horrible weapons. Indeed, that is what propelled us under a \nRepublican administration to negotiate and then to sign this \nConvention.\n  One might reasonably anticipate, therefore, that the United States, \nwhich led the way for so many years in seeking allies among the \ncommunity of nations in the effort to outlaw these weapons and their \nuse, and which was the driving force behind the negotiations that \nproduced the Chemical Weapons Convention, would see virtually universal \nsupport for the ratification of this critical treaty. But that is not \nthe case, as my colleagues know.\n  Most unfortunately, a small group of Senators, primarily within one \nsegment of the Republican Party, and nourished by a group of committed \ncold warriors whose reflexive behavior is to see catastrophe for the \nUnited States in any arms control agreement, has dedicated itself to \npreventing the Senate from approving ratification of this Convention. \nThey have found shadows behind the trees, and express great fear that \nUnited States participation could somehow weaken our Nation militarily \nand leave us vulnerable to a reemergent Russia or to some rogue nation \nthat refuses to abide by the Convention's requirements.\n  I want to emphasize that while I believe those conclusions are \nentirely unwarranted, I take no issue with anybody who wants to proceed \ncautiously here. I take no issue with anybody who asserts that \nconceivably there is some downside to the Convention, and it is \nappropriate for us to have legitimate debate about that. But legitimate \ndebate and legitimate expressions of caution are different from \nstanding in the way of the U.S. Senate being able to resolve this issue \nin a vote on the floor of the Senate and allowing the Senate to perform \nits critical constitutional responsibilities of advise and consent.\n  I agree it would be a mistake for this Nation to blindly assume that \nsimply as a result of the disappearance of the Soviet Union we will \nnever again face a serious threat from Russia or from some other nation \nwhose interests conflict with our own. That, of course, is why we spend \n$250-plus billion on defense every year.\n  But the vehemence with which these Senators oppose the Convention, \nand their rationales for so doing, persuade me that the principal \nproblem is not the Convention itself or its terms, but the fact that it \nis simply not a perfect treaty, that it is not 100 percent leakproof or \n100 percent verifiable.\n  We cannot establish such a standard, Mr. President, for by so doing, \nwe effectively would say that no arms control treaty could ever be in \nour national interest.\n  Mr. President, I reject the notion that there is no such thing as a \ngood arms control treaty, a treaty that advances the interests of the \nUnited States effectively. I specifically reject the notion that the \nChemical Weapons Convention does anything to diminish the national \nsecurity of our Nation, or that it is not in our national interest. To \nthe contrary, I believe that our Nation and our people will be safer \nand more secure and, in fact, will be the entire world community of \nnations, if the United States joins the other nations which have \nratified it.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, that is not just my belief. It is \nthe belief of former Presidents of the United States. It is the belief \nof the Chairman and Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the belief of \nthe current and immediate past Directors of Central Intelligence, the \ncurrent and immediate past Secretaries of Defense, Gen. Norman \nSchwarzkopf and a host of others whose credentials as national security \nexperts are sterling.\n  So let us address the specific concerns that are raised by those who \nwould rather see the United States not participate in this convention, \nand who would deprive the Senate of the opportunity to debate the \nconvention on the floor and vote on the resolution of ratification as \nthe American people should be able to expect.\n  The opponents claim that the Chemical Weapons Convention will not be \neffective because it fails to ban or control possession of all \nchemicals that could be used for lethal purposes, specifically \nincluding two agents used with deadly effect in World War I, phosgene \nand hydrogen cyanide. The reality is that the CWC does cover all toxic \nchemicals and their precursors ``except where intended for purposes not \nprohibited under this Convention * * *'' Phosgene and hydrogen cyanide \nare explicitly listed in schedule 3 of the convention.\n  The convention also contains a provision to expand the list of \nchemicals subject to declaration and verification as new CW agents are \ndeveloped and identified.\n  The opponents claim that the CWC is not global, since many dangerous \nnations--for example, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Libya--have not \nagreed to join the treaty regime. The reality, however, is that of the \napproximately 20 nations believed to have or to be seeking a chemical \nweapons program, more than two-thirds have already signed the \nconvention. The failure of the United States to ratify the treaty is \nunlikely to spur these countries to become signatories and relinquish \nany determination they may have to develop chemical weapons. And, \nindeed, our failure to ratify will actually give to those recalcitrant \ncountries political cover for their failure to join.\n  If the United States does not join, why should they care about it? If \nthe United States, which initially sought it and long worked for it, \nnow finds something wrong with the convention, then they have \njustification to also assert something is wrong with it. Further, \nseveral of the Convention's key provisions are targeted directly at \nnonparticipating nations. Some of the most threatening chemicals cannot \nbe sold to nonparticipating nations by signatories and chemical trade \nwith the nonsignatories will be impeded in other ways. In this \nimportant respect the treaty is, indeed, global in its reach.\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\n  In effect, those who claim to be defending the interests of the \nUnited States are, I believe, unwittingly--and I know not \npurposefully--aiding those countries that would continue to be \nrebellious nonparticipants in the work of removing chemical weapons \nfrom the earth.\n  If the opponents mean to point out that all convention provisions do \nnot apply to all nations, OK, they are correct. Not all provisions \napply to those 30 or fewer nations that have not yet signed the \nconvention and may choose never to sign or ratify. But there is no way \nthat one sovereign nation can force another to enter into a treaty. But \nyou can, through a treaty, isolate those nations that choose not to \nsign, and, indeed, make it extraordinarily difficult for them to pursue \ntheir nefarious objectives.\n  This treaty will, very definitely, according to the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the intelligence community, and many others in our defense \nestablishment whose judgment and expertise I respect in their \nspecialties, have significant constraining effects even on \nnonsignatories. It will be far more difficult for a nonsignatory to \nproceed to develop a chemical weapons program and to produce chemical \nweapons, and it will be much more likely--not 100 percent certain but \nmuch more likely--that we will know if they do so.\n  The opponents claim that the CWC is not verifiable, Mr. President. \nWell, the reality is that the intelligence community and the Department \nof Defense have testified that the convention, while not being \nperfectly verifiable to be sure, will facilitate the ability of our \nintelligence agencies to detect significant violations in a timely \nmanner, because it provides additional tools to do the job of tracking \nthe spread of chemical weapons--a job that we would have to do anyway, \nwith or without the Chemical Weapons Convention and its tools.\n  In fact, it is the acknowledged difficulty of detecting chemical \nweapons and their production, frankly, that makes the CWC all the more \nimportant. Our intelligence community needs all the additional tools \nand advantages it can get to make it more likely that such weapons and \nproduction will be identified, and identified as early as possible. The \nCWC provides critical tools and advantages, and the intelligence \ncommunity and Defense Department have urged the Senate to approve its \nratification.\n  The opponents claim that the convention will be toothless in \napplication and that violations, once identified, will go unsanctioned. \nThis, of course, is totally conjectural, and nothing in the verbiage of \nany treaty can absolutely guarantee that every provision will be \nenforced or every violation effectively sanctioned. But recent \nexperience with the North Korean nuclear program demonstrates that \ngovernments can and will respond to evidence of noncompliance and will \nact to uphold the integrity of an arms control agreement--in this case, \nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  I am of the opinion, personally, that violations of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention will result in a strong reaction by the community of \nnations that is participating in it--but that is my opinion. The only \ndemonstrable fact, in response to the fear expressed by opponents, is \nthat with the Chemical Weapons Convention, there is a multilateral \nmechanism to define objectionable actions and the basis on which to \norganize an international response. Those are both advantages that do \nnot exist today.\n  The opponents claim that the Chemical Weapons Convention will create \na massive new United Nations-type international inspection bureaucracy, \nwhich will result in costs to our taxpayers of as much as $200 million \nper year. The reality is that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated the U.S. costs to comply with declaration, \ninspection, and verification procedures of the CWC will average $33 \nmillion per year, an amount which includes our annual assessment to the \nOPCW of $25 million. That is considerably less than $200 million.\n  The active involvement of our negotiators in developing the treaty \nrequirements applying to the OPCW ensures that it will undertake only \nessential tasks, and will do so efficiently. After the trillions of \ndollars our taxpayers spent defending our Nation during the cold war, \nand in the face of the terrible threats of chemical weapons, I \nbelieve--and this is shared by the President, the intelligence \ncommunity, and the defense community--that an expenditure of $33 \nmillion a year for U.S. costs of participating in the CWC, and for \nguaranteeing for the first time intrusive tracking of chemical agents \nand precursors, is a very, very good buy for the taxpayers.\n  The opponents claim that the Convention will jeopardize our citizens' \nconstitutional rights by requiring the U.S. Government to permit \nsearches without either warrants or probable cause. Mr. President, that \nis not true. The reality is that most firms that will be subjected to \nCWC inspections will voluntarily grant access for that purpose. And it \nis important to note here that the vast majority of the chemical \nindustry of the United States is supportive of this treaty. The strong \nsupport of that industry and its active involvement during the CWC \nnegotiations strengthen the belief that, in fact, most of the firms \nsubject to inspection will not object to the inspections. But if a firm \ndoes exercise its constitutional right to object, then, Mr. President, \nthe U.S. Government is committed to fully complying with our \nconstitutional requirements. In such a case the Government will obtain \na search warrant prior to an inspection to ensure that the \nconstitutional rights of any citizen are fully protected.\n  The opponents claim that the Convention will subject as many as 8,000 \ncompanies across the Nation to new reporting requirements, entailing \nuncompensated annual compliance costs that could reach hundreds of \nthousands of dollars for each. The reality is that it will not affect \n8,000, it will affect only about 2,000 companies. Approximately 1,800 \nof those 2,000 companies will not have to do anything more onerous than \ncheck a box on a form regarding production range. They will not even be \nrequired to specify which chemicals they produce. Most of the firms for \nwhich compliance activities will be more extensive are supporters of \nthe treaty, and directly, or through their industry association, were \nconsulted as the CWC provisions affecting commercial facilities were \nnegotiated. The Convention's opponents generally fail to mention the \nfact that the biggest cost to the U.S. chemical industry is likely to \ncome as a result of the United States failing to ratify the Convention. \nAccording to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the trade \nrestrictions on export of chemicals that will apply to nonparticipating \nnations will place at risk $600 million in annual export sales for U.S. \ncompanies.\n  It is a very material fact that the Chemical Weapons Convention is \nprimarily about increasing the safety of the United States, of our \ntroops, and our citizens from the chemical weapons of other nations.\n  During the Bush administration, the decision was made for the United \nStates to leave the chemical weapons business and to destroy the vast \nmajority of our stockpile of chemical weapons--all those that the CWC \nwould require to be destroyed. It is very important that we understand \nthis. The Bush administration has already embarked this Nation on a \ncourse that will result in the destruction of our stockpile of chemical \nweapons. That process already is underway, and it will continue whether \nor not we ratify the Convention.\n  Does it not make sense, then, if we are stripping ourselves of these \nweapons anyway, for us to take steps to increase the likelihood that \nother nations will do the same, and that we will know if some nations \nchoose to manufacture and stockpile such weapons?\n  There certainly is no reason for the United States to refuse to \nratify the CWC because it in some way would impede the maintenance or \nproduction of weapons deemed important to our national security. The \ndecision to destroy our chemical weapons was made years ago, during the \nBush administration. It is not a decision that any of our defense \nleadership suggests should be reversed.\n  Last fall, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had favorably \nreported the resolution of ratification for the convention on a strong \nbipartisan vote, the convention was caught up, most unfortunately, in \nPresidential politics. Mr. President, as the ranking\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nmember of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over other matters that \nForeign Relations Committee Chairman Helms had linked to action on the \nConvention, I had worked hard with Senator Helms and others to get an \nagreement to bring the ratification resolution to the floor. While he \nwas majority leader, Senator Dole agreed that we should have a vote on \nthat resolution, and we secured a unanimous consent agreement that \nensured the Senate would consider and vote on the resolution of \nratification before the end of the 105th Congress. But then, in the \nheat of Presidential politics, although President Clinton strongly \nsupported ratification of the convention, Senator Dole, as the \nRepublican nominee for President, suddenly announced opposition to the \nCWC. That called into question whether the necessary two-thirds \nmajority vote for ratification could be secured. So we delayed action \non the resolution.\n  Mr. President, the time for action on this convention has arrived. It \nis now. We are beyond the complications of a Presidential election. We \nhave held the hearings, many hearings, in four separate Senate \ncommittees. We know the facts. The support of the defense and \nintelligence communities and leaders is strong and clear.\n  And now there is one more very important reason for expeditious \naction to approve the resolution of ratification. If the United States \nhas not ratified this convention by the time it takes effect on April \n29, by its terms U.S. citizens will be ineligible for appointment to \nthe OPCW administrative staff and corps of international inspectors, \nand, therefore, we will forfeit the opportunity to influence its \ndecisions, its budget, and inspection practices that our negotiators \nled the way to secure. To be sure, if the United States later ratifies, \nMr. President, American citizens will become eligible for such posts \nbut only as they become vacant at some point in the future. Our Nation \nwill have irrevocably lost out in the vitally important initial \nformative policy making and procedure development.\n  As scores of newspaper editorials around the country have said, those \nwho believe the threat of chemical weapons is real, and who realize \nthat our intelligence and defense organizations need all the help they \ncan get to identify where chemical weapons are being manufactured and \nstockpiled, must not let a small group of Senators prevent the U.S. \nSenate from acting on this important treaty.\n  I urge the majority leader to act in the interest of our country and \nour people and, in the interest of our institution and its \nconstitutional right and duty to advise and consent to treaties, to \npermit the Senate to act on this treaty, which I believe a significant \nmajority of this body supports.\n  We cannot permit the perfect to become the enemy of the good. We must \nnot permit those who make that mistake to prevent us from acting in the \nbest interests of our Nation and its people. And we cannot allow some \ncloudy objections to obviate the facts and prevent this institution \nfrom discharging its responsibilities.\n  I believe it would be a grave mistake to deprive our Nation, our \nArmed Forces, and our citizens of the additional protections from the \nthreat of chemical weapons that the Chemical Weapons Convention offers. \nAnd I think it would be foolish for the United States to relinquish the \ninfluence it will gain in implementing this critical treaty if it fails \nto ratify the Convention by April 29.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for \nhis forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me ask. Is my 30 minutes the \nlast business before the Senate today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes reserved for the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say, as much as I would like to use my 30 \nminutes, I do not want to delay the Senate indefinitely tonight. If \nSenator Kerrey intends to use time, let me suggest I could probably \nfinish in 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1369-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1372-S1374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say that it is a pleasure \nto address this issue with the senior Senator from the State of \nWashington in the chair. I don't know that what the Senator from New \nMexico is going to speak to today is needed to edify the occupant of \nthe chair, but I think it is imperative that, after an awful lot of \ntalk about a constitutional balanced budget and its potential effect on \nthe Social Security trust fund, that some of us state what we think \nthis whole scare about the Social Security trust fund is all about.\n  So let me first say to the senior citizens that I gather now that you \nknow the emotional ramping up by frightening senior citizens is \nbeginning to take place out there in our States and communities. Let \nme, to the extent that I can, say to the seniors who are listening to \nthose who would like to make you believe that they are really here \narguing to save Social Security, suggest to you that what they are \nreally arguing about is that they don't want a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget and they have now hit on what I perceive to be a \nrisky gimmick in an effort to frighten seniors and by that approach \ndefeat a constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  I might say to the seniors of this country, it is now the almost \nuniversal consensus of those who look at the next 25 years that the \nmost important thing for senior citizens and the best effect on the \ntrust fund is that this economy grow and grow and grow and that we have \nlow inflation and sustained economic growth. Those who have worked for \ndecades, looking at what is going to happen to Social Security and \nputting into that all of the mix that goes into it to see what they can \nproject, without exception they testify here and everywhere, do not \nforget that you must have a sustained and growing economy for these \nnumbers to be believable about the validity of this trust fund in the \nfuture.\n  Having said that, it would appear that balancing the American budget \nand keeping it balanced is probably in and of itself the single most \nimportant factor--not the only factor, but the single most important \nfactor--to productivity, growth, and prosperity when you already have a \n$5 trillion accumulated series of deficits which now equal the debt.\n  So let nobody be fooled, for those who want to inject Social Security \nand are trying to take it off the budget of the United States, the risk \nis we will never get a balanced budget. It is my honest opinion that it \nwas not an overstatement of the case when 29 budgets were piled up \nhere. In fact, I didn't have time to ask somebody, but how many times \nin those 29 budgets can Presidents say, ``I am giving you a balanced \nbudget?'' How many times after they were presented did Congresses of \nthe United States say, ``Oh, we are going to do better, we are giving \nyou a balanced budget\"? It never happened. And it will not happen. In \nfact, we are all dedicated to getting it balanced by 2002. But I am \nsuggesting, as one who is as dedicated to that mission as anyone here, \nthat you are far more apt to get it and keep it with the organic law of \nthis land saying that is the way it is going to be, it is the law of \nthe land.\n  Having said that, let me see if I can convince senior citizens and \nthose in this body who are worried about the issue of should you have \nSocial Security on budget or off budget.\n  First, just from the standpoint of a budget, you know Social Security \nis now the largest program in America. The tax for it is the largest \nsingle tax on America and Americans of all the entourage and litany of \ntaxes we have. Literally 55 to 60 percent of the public pay more in \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes, I say to my friend occupying the \nchair, pay more in that tax than they pay in income taxes.\n  Just from the standpoint of a budget, doesn't it seem kind of strange \nthat you would say Americans should have a budget and it should be \nbalanced, but, oh, let us take all of that big program that I have just \ndescribed and all of those taxes and let us just take them off the \nbudget?\n  So it is rather ironic that we speak of budgets and leave all of that \nwhich is so important to our future, so important to our young people \nwho have\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\njobs--because the taxes there must be compared with what? With the \ntaxes that the rest of society imposes on us. You cannot leave those \ntaxes and those payments out there untouched, unrelated as if they have \nnothing to do with the corporate income tax and the individual income \ntax and the State taxes. They are all related, and they should all be \npart of our budget as we look at it.\n  Now, I am not sufficiently versed in economics, but I have learned \nsomething because New Mexicans have sent me here long enough that, if \nnothing else, by osmosis I learn something about it because I sit there \nwith my colleagues most of the time and they talk and I listen. \nFrankly, the United States made a decision that to be real about its \nbudget, you ought to use a unified budget. We decided that more than \ntwo decades ago. And it serves us very well in trying to look at the \neffect of taxes and expenditures on the American economy and our \npeople.\n  Therefore, point No. 1. For those who are talking about gimmicks to \nfrighten us into not passing the constitutional amendment, the first \nthing that is happening that is very, very dangerous is they are \ndenying senior citizens the most significant tool to assure the success \nof Social Security.\n  Now, a second point.\n  Since Social Security is on budget now and it has a surplus now and \nthe surplus will go away at some point in the future and we will be \nstarting to spend that, there are some now who are saying to seniors we \nbetter take it off budget so they cannot spend it. Get it. Take it off \nbudget so they cannot spend it. Take it off budget so you cannot borrow \nfrom it.\n  Listen for a minute. You take the Social Security trust fund. It is \ndefined by statute law. It is not going to be in the Constitution. Who \ndefines statute law? Who defines statute law? Congress. Congress \ndefines statute law. So you take off a huge amount of money and a huge \namount of taxes and you say it is no longer in this budget because we \ndo not want anybody to spend it or borrow it.\n  Friends, in particular senior citizens, do you believe your trust \nfund is protected by being out there all alone, running up huge \nsurpluses, subject to whom? Who can spend it? Who can spend that \nsurplus? Oh, the same Congress that has been creating all these \ndeficits.\n  You mean they cannot spend it? somebody is going to stand up and ask. \nOf course, they can. All they have to do is pass a statute and spend \nthat surplus. On what? On what? Right now you have to invest it in \nTreasury bills of the United States. But I say to our friend from \nMichigan, over the next 20 years as that surplus is there and as \nCongress feels the pinch of not having money to spend over here and \nperhaps a Medicare system that is really hurting; 6 years from now we \nhave not helped it very much, or 8, and it is hurting for money to pay \nthe bills, what do you think is going to happen? Congress is going to \nsay, well, it is all seniors, right? Let us spend $48 billion for what \nwe need for the next 6 months for Medicare. Let us take it out of the \ntrust fund.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course,\n  Mr. GORTON. Is that not exactly one of the forms of risky gimmicks \nthat the Senator spoke of should we adopt this amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My friend, it is the biggest potential gimmick I have \never seen. And let me tell you, if there are those who say this cannot \nhappen, I will give you one. The President in this year's budget \ndecided that another trust fund, the Medicare trust fund--in this case \nit was running out of money, but the President decided I am going to \ntell Congress to just take out $82 billion of the expenditures that are \nin that trust fund, right, by fiat, by law. Who is going to do that? \nCongress is going to pass a law, he says, take out the $82 billion and \nlet somebody else pay for it.\n  Now, if you can do that, you can take a trust fund that is very \nsolvent and do the exact same thing. A President says, well, look, it \nis going to take us 5 more years to fix this Medicare mess so why not \njust borrow from that trust fund. It is sitting out there. It is all \nalone, right, and we do not want to count it over here on our budget \nbecause we thought it was really going to be protected if we took it \nout there, and lo and behold, that budget could have that very same \nthing in it. That is the real kind of gimmick that is going to be used.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield to another more \ngeneral question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. GORTON. Am I not correct in remembering that we went through \nexactly this same debate 2 years ago at the time at which the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment ultimately was defeated by one vote in \nthe Chamber of the Senate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GORTON. And we heard all of the same alarms from those who \nultimately opposed the balanced budget amendment about the future of \nSocial Security at that point?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No question about it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Now, perhaps my friend from New Mexico, who is the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and who has totally immersed himself \nin these problems, has a better memory than I have, but does the \nSenator from New Mexico remember any proposal after the defeat of the \nconstitutional amendment last time by those who opposed it that would \nbuttress or build up the Social Security trust fund, any changes in \neligibility, any increases in the payroll tax or not? I remember no \nattempts in this last 2 years to do anything about this imminent or \nfuture insolvency of the Social Security trust fund. Does my friend \nfrom New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. So is it the net result of the defeat of the \nconstitutional amendment 2 years ago that we are simply 2 years closer \nto the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely right, without a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is it not also true that all of those, almost all of \nthose who opposed the balanced budget constitutional amendment 2 years \nago told us all that was required to balance the budget was courage and \ndedication on the part of the Congress itself? Is that not pretty much \nthe message that we constantly get from them?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is absolutely right.\n  Mr. GORTON. And did we not take them up on that proposal and did we \nnot, in fact, pass through the Congress of the United States a budget \nthat would have been balanced by the year specified in the \nconstitutional amendment and would have postponed for an extended \nperiod of time the insolvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust \nfund?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GORTON. And was that not opposed by all of the people who opposed \nthe constitutional amendment with the single exception of the then \nSenator from Oregon and vetoed by the President of the United States?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is right.\n  I might also say to the Senator I am going to give myself enough \nlatitude so that I know I am right, but I think that same balanced \nbudget to which the Senator alludes, if carried out and all of the \nchanges made in it and projected it out beyond that time, would be \nbalanced 3 years, no longer than 3 years thereafter without using the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  So what I am saying, you put yourself on a trend line by entitlement \nreform to where you cannot get to balance without the Social Security \ntrust fund in the process of accomplishing your major goal of getting \nit balanced within the unified budget with everything on budget.\n  Mr. GORTON. And is it not also true that whether this constitutional \namendment passed or not, there would be no impact on the actual total \nspending of the Government of the United States or the total receipts \nof the United States; we would simply pretend that the largest single \nspending and social program were not a part of a budget or of balancing \nthe budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. GORTON. And then in several years, in a few years when the Social \nSecurity trust fund is paying out more money than it is taking in, \nCongress would be able to pretend that the budget was balanced when, in \nfact, we were\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nrunning a huge deficit in the Social Security trust fund. And, in fact, \nthe Social Security trust fund could go absolutely bankrupt, could it \nnot, and yet under that proposal the budget would still be balanced?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. In fact, I did not bring to the \nfloor a chart showing that, but it is one of the wonderful, factual \npresentations about how, after a few years, what they have been talking \nabout down here, about ``the Social Security fund ought to be off \nbudget so we can handle our matters within the rest of the budget and \nhow we can protect its solvency,'' it turns out that down the line a \nlittle--and if we do a constitutional amendment, it is going to be down \nthe line for a long time, it should be here forever--when the Social \nSecurity fund starts to spend out and go in the red, guess what we can \ndo? We can let it go right on in the red and spend. But over here on \nthe rest of the budget, which we call the unified budget less Social \nSecurity, you can spend so much money in that budget and still be in \nbalance because you are not charged with the deficit in Social \nSecurity. It is billions, about 18 or 20 years from now. You are going \nto be able to spend on this unified budget, less Social Security, \nsomething like $7 trillion more than you are currently expecting to \nspend, and be in balance, because you let this other big deficit occur \nand you do not do anything about it.\n  I want to add one thing. You could have asked me, ``Senator, when you \nhave this trust fund sitting out here all by itself and it starts to go \nin the red, because we did not have the guts to fix it, and over here \nis the rest of this budget, it has been kind of wallowing around, now, \nCongress gets together and says, `How do we fix that Social \nSecurity?''' Guess what, they can borrow money without being subject to \nthe constitutional amendment and put it in that trust fund. They could \nborrow $5 trillion. And guess what we would be doing? We would be \ngetting ourselves right back in the mess of borrowing to pay deficits.\n  Mr. GORTON. That $5 trillion figure, you did not pull that out of \nthin air, did you? That is what the indicators show we would have?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. And, frankly, I have to say, in all \nhonesty--I had a group of seniors I talked to today. They said to me, \n``You may be right, and you may be more right than them.'' But then \nthey said, ``Can't Congress, if you take it off budget, can't you just \npass a law so none of these terrible things will happen to this \nwonderful trust fund?\"\n  And I said, ``By asking me if we could pass a law, you have just \nanswered your own question. Of course we could.'' But Congress makes \nthe laws and Congress changes the laws. Consequently, we could protect \nit by statute and then, when it got in trouble, we could unprotect it \nby statute. But if you insist that it be counted in the unified budget, \nthen what you are saying is when money is spent out of it, it counts. \nAnd you have to find, within a budget, some cuts to make up for it. And \nthat is especially the case when Social Security starts to go in the \nred, if it does, and probably at some period in its history it will for \nawhile.\n  Mr. GORTON. In summary, then, I ask my friend from New Mexico, that \nis just one of the reasons that this proposed change in the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment is a risky gimmick, and the risk is to \nSocial Security and its beneficiaries themselves; is that not correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is absolutely right.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I want to wrap up my few minutes. I thank the \nSenator for his questions which made my presentation far more \nunderstandable than had I gone on rambling for 15 minutes.\n  But essentially the truth of the matter is, if the risky gimmick \nbeing offered by some defeats the constitutional amendment, that will \ninure to the detriment of senior citizens, for we will probably never \nhave a sustained and long-term balanced budget, and that is what Social \nSecurity needs more than anything else.\n  Second, the risky gimmick is to take it off budget and subject the \nentire trust fund to the will and whim of Congress and Presidents, \nwithout any of the discipline that would come from the spending and \nborrowing that you must account for within a unified budget.\n  I have a couple of graphs that explicitly show what I have been \nshowing. I am going to have them printed in the Record, especially with \nrespect to what happens when Social Security starts to spend out more \nthan it has taken in, the future amount of money that is then available \non budget to spend without having any effect on the budget.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are. The Senator is authorized to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is one of \nthose I admire most in this Chamber. He is one of the brightest and \nmost interesting Members to serve with. He has demonstrated over many \nyears and many disciplines a great knowledge and great intellect. I \nhave always enjoyed serving with him.\n\n  With great respect, I think he is so wrong on this issue, but I say \nthat with the greatest respect.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1372-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1374-S1377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to give the other side of exactly \nthe issue the Senator from New Mexico has just spent some time \ndescribing. I say this not because I believe my side is right and \ntherefore he is here doing something untoward. That is not the case. I \nthink we have a disagreement here about this issue that is very \nsubstantial, and it is very important. I do not suggest that someone \nwho does not agree with me on this position is out here deciding to \nplay games or to take a position for anything other than a noble \npurpose. But, by the same token, I feel so strongly that the discussion \nI just heard is wrong, I feel compelled to correct it, at least from my \nperspective.\n  Let me describe what we have. We have a proposal to change the \nConstitution of the United States. Some refer to it repeatedly as a \nproposal to balance the budget. It will not do that, and no one who \nunderstands the difference between a statute and a constitutional \nchange should refer to it as balancing the budget. You can change the \nConstitution 2 minutes from now, and 3 minutes from now you will not \nhave altered by one penny the Federal debt or the Federal deficit, and \nthere is not anyone in here who would stand up and contest that, I \nwould judge. So this is not about balancing the budget. It is about \naltering the Constitution.\n  I am prepared to alter the Constitution under certain circumstances, \nbut I will not--repeat, not--support an approach that changes the \nConstitution of the United States in a manner that I think will create \nmore problems than it solves.\n  We have, and will vote for, a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. We will all be required to vote on a couple of versions of \nthat, one, the version proposed by the majority, one, a version that I \nwill introduce as a substitute amendment. So we will have an \nopportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. The version proposed by the majority says this. It says that \nrevenues and expenditures in future years must be relatively equal so \nthat you are not running a deficit. And that includes counting all of \nthe revenues and all of the expenditures. Period. End of description--I \nthink a fair description of what the majority is proposing.\n  The problem with that is this. We have a separate program in \nGovernment, one of the largest programs, called the Social Security \nsystem. It has been a very successful program. But we have a \ndemographic problem with our Social Security system. We have a group of \nbabies born who represented the largest group of babies born in our \nhistory, and when they hit the retirement rolls, we are going to have a \nsignificant strain on that system. And so, a decision was made some \nyears ago to save for that purpose, and therefore this year, and last \nyear, and next year, to run a surplus, a very significant budget \nsurplus in the Social Security accounts, only in those accounts, in \norder to have that available to save for the future.\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n  The amendment that is being offered by the majority is an amendment \nthat would say: Let's not distinguish between one dollar and another \ndollar. Yes, we're running a surplus in Social Security, but it doesn't \nmatter. We can use the surplus of Social Security to just pay for other \nspending elsewhere.\n  Well, I do not think that is the way we say to those with whom we \nhave decided that we are going to provide for their future and have a \nSocial Security trust fund, I do not think that is the way for us to \nsay to them we are meeting our responsibilities. That is not meeting \nour responsibilities. What that is doing is allowing us to say we have \nbalanced the budget when we have not. We have taken trust funds that we \nsaid would be used for only one purpose and brought it to say, now we \nhave balanced the budget.\n  I am waiting--and I will ask the question again; there is only one \nother Member on the floor--but I would ask the question again, and I \nhave not yet heard an answer: If under this constitutional amendment \nand a budget plan that is proposed to meet this constitutional \namendment of balancing the budget, if in the year in which they claim \nthey have balanced the budget the Federal debt limit must be increased \nby $130 billion, how do you claim you have balanced the budget?\n  If you have balanced your family budget, do you have to borrow more \nmoney? I would not think so. If you have balanced your business budget, \nwould you have to borrow more money? I do not think so. Why, in this \nplan, in the year in which they say they balance the budget, does the \nCongressional Budget Office tell us in that very year they have to \nincrease the Federal debt limit by $130 billion? Why? Can anybody tell \nme? They have not told me for a couple weeks because there is not an \nanswer to that. There is not an answer.\n  The answer, if everyone here were honest, would be that this is not \ntruly balancing the budget. The budget will be called in balance, they \nwill describe it as in balance, and the Federal debt will continue to \nincrease. So the folks who moved the Federal debt clock around that \nshows how the Federal debt is increasing will still have a clock that \nkeeps ticking. The Federal debt will keep rising. I do not understand \nthat.\n  I would like us to balance the Federal budget. I think there is a \ncompelling reason for us to balance the Federal budget. In fact, the \nbudget deficit is down 60 percent in the last 4 years in part because \nsome of us have had the courage to cast hard votes, votes that were not \npopular. I am glad I did it. They were not very popular votes, but we \ncast the votes to bring the budget deficit down.\n  But the job is not done. The job is half done. We need to finish the \njob. We can alter the Constitution, but that will not finish the job. \nThe only way this job gets finished is if individual men and women in \nthe U.S. Senate make spending and taxing decisions that say we want to \nbalance the budget. When they say to their constituents, ``We've \nbalanced the budget,'' and then must confess to their bankers back \nhome, ``But, yes, we increased the Federal debt by $130 billion,'' no \none here can claim that with a straight face, unless they have no sense \nof humor, that they have done what they promised back home they are \ndoing.\n  That is the point I am making. If we are going to alter the \nConstitution, let us make those changes in the Constitution in a \ncareful, measured way that does not create more problems than it \nsolves.\n  My time is up. I will be on the floor for a few minutes and perhaps \nhave some other discussion. I know another Senator is waiting to \ndiscuss this. But, Mr. President, this is an important issue. We are \nfinally talking about what we ought to talk about. And I hope we can \nhave some exchange of views in the coming days on this very subject \nbecause this is not a nuisance issue. This is not a nettlesome issue or \nsome tiny, little issue. This is a trillion-dollar issue that deals \nwith people who earn paychecks and pay taxes, expecting certain results \nfrom them, and a trillion-dollar issue that deals with senior citizens \non Social Security who expect something from that program as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hutchinson pertaining to the introduction of S. \n328 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                    The Chemical Weapons Convention\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great \nimportance to our national security: the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  This convention, which is commonly known as the CWC, has been a high \npriority for the past three administrations, and is a perfect example \nof a bipartisan foreign and security policy issue. It was negotiated \nbeginning under President Reagan, it was signed under President Bush, \nand the Clinton administration is now seeking Senate advice and consent \nto its ratification.\n  The United States has always taken the lead on negotiating the CWC, \nand we should soon have before us an opportunity to improve the \nsecurity of our Nation and of the world by ratifying this convention. \nSome 160 countries have already signed the CWC, and more than 65 have \nratified it--including all our major NATO allies and China. It will \nenter into force on April 29 of this year, whether or not we ratify it. \nBut our ratification will make a big difference in the effect the \ntreaty has on us and on the effectiveness of the treaty worldwide.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize what the Chemical Weapons Convention \nwill do: it will drastically reduce the stockpiles of chemical weapons; \nrequire the destruction of chemical weapon production facilities; \nprovide for the most intrusive verification procedures ever \nnegotiated--including challenge on-site inspections; improve our \nintelligence of foreign chemical weapon activities; require domestic \nlaws that will permit nations to investigate and prosecute chemical \nweapon activities; and, perhaps most importantly, make it much more \ndifficult for rogue nations or terrorists to make or acquire chemical \nweapons.\n  As the Defense Department leadership and the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nhave testified on numerous occasions over several years: this \nconvention is in our national security interest, and we should ratify \nit as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, on January 22 the Senate Armed Services Committee held \na nomination hearing for our former colleague, Senator Bill Cohen, to \nbe the Secretary of Defense. That afternoon the Senate voted \nunanimously to confirm him by a vote of 99-0. He is now the new \nSecretary of Defense, and I am looking forward to working with him on \nthe many important and challenging national security issues that will \ncome before the Armed Services Committee and before the Senate.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the comments of then Secretary-\ndesignate Cohen about the CWC, because it is important that we consider \nthe views of the President's chief defense adviser.\n  At his nomination hearing, Senator Cohen made three important points \nabout the CWC.\n  First, he told the Committee ``whether we ratify it or not, we are \nengaged in the unilateral disarmament of chemical weapons. We are \neliminating all our stocks of chemical weapons, and they will be \ncompletely gone by the year 2004. That was initiated under the \nadministration of Ronald Reagan. So, whether we sign it or not, we are \ngetting rid of ours.''\n  Second, he told us that whether we sign it or not, the convention \nwill go into effect. Given that fact, it makes sense for us to ratify \nthe treaty and to take part in making the rules by which it will be \nimplemented, as well as having our own inspectors on the inspection \nteams.\n  Third, he told the Committee that the American chemical industry \nstands to lose up to $600 million in sales if we do not ratify because \nof sanctions which were intended for rogue nations but which will apply \nto our industry and prevent it from selling precursor chemicals to \nsignatory nations.\n  Secretary-designate Cohen concluded that it is in our national \ninterest to ratify the CWC because we are already getting rid of our \nchemical weapons, and by ratifying we can help assure that other \ncountries which ratify the CWC will get rid of theirs. Those are\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nthree points I hope our colleagues will keep in mind as the Senate \nconsiders the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  Prior to his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services \nCommittee, Secretary-designate Cohen had an opportunity to provide a \nmore comprehensive explanation of his support for the CWC. I would like \nto share those views with our colleagues because they clearly enumerate \nwhy the CWC is in our national security interests.\n  Here is the committee's question and Senator Cohen's answer:\n\n       Question. The President has made ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention a very high priority for early \n     Senate action. The Convention will enter into force on April \n     29, 1997, and ratification must occur prior to that date for \n     the U.S. to be an original party.\n       Do you agree that ratification of the CWC is very much in \n     our national security interest and do you support the goal of \n     ratification prior to the April 29 deadline?\n       Answer. Yes. The CWC, as both a disarmament and \n     nonproliferation treaty, is very much in our national \n     security interests because it establishes an international \n     mandate for the destruction of chemical weapons (CW) \n     stockpiles. Congress has mandated that the Army, as executive \n     agent for CW destruction, eliminate its unitary CW, which \n     constitute the bulk of its CW stockpile, by 31 December 2004. \n     That destruction process is well under way at the CW \n     destruction facilities at Johnston Atoll and Tooele, UT. The \n     CWC mandates that state parties destroy, under a strict \n     verification regime, their entire CW stockpiles within 10 \n     years after the Convention enters into force (April 2007). \n     Given that the U.S. does not need CW for its security, and \n     given that we are currently legally committed to eliminating \n     unilaterally the vast majority of our CW stockpile, common \n     sense suggests that it would be preferable to secure a \n     commitment from other nations to do the same; prohibits the \n     development, retention, storage, preparations for use, and \n     use of CW. These expansive prohibitions establish a broadly \n     accepted international norm that will form a basis for \n     international action against those states parties that \n     violate the CWC. Unlike the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which only \n     bans the use of CW in war, the CWC: includes a verification \n     regime; restricts the export of certain dual-use CW precursor \n     chemicals to non-state parties; prohibits assisting other \n     states, organizations, or personnel in acquiring CW; and \n     requires state parties to implement legislation prohibiting \n     its citizens and organizations from engaging in activities \n     prohibited by the Convention. The CWC also contains \n     mechanisms for recommending multilateral sanctions, including \n     recourse to the UN Security Council; increases the \n     probability of detecting militarily significant violations of \n     the CWC. While no treaty is 100% verifiable, the CWC contains \n     complementary and overlapping declaration and inspection \n     requirements. These requirements increase the probability of \n     detecting militarily significant violations of the \n     Convention. While detecting illicit production of small \n     quantities of CW will be extremely difficult, it is easier to \n     detect large scale production, filling and stockpiling of \n     chemical weapons. Over time, through declaration, routine \n     inspections, fact-finding, consultation, and challenge \n     inspection mechanisms, the CWC's verification regime should \n     prove effective in providing information on significant CW \n     programs that would not otherwise be available; hinders the \n     development of clandestine CW stockpiles. Through systematic \n     on-site verification, routine declarations and trade \n     restrictions, the Convention makes it more difficult for \n     would-be proliferators to acquire, from CWC state parties \n     precursor chemicals required for developing chemical weapons. \n     The mutually supportive trade restrictions and verification \n     provisions of the Convention increase the transparency of CW-\n     relevant activities. These provisions will provide the U.S. \n     with otherwise unavailable information that will facilitate \n     U.S. detection and monitoring of illicit CW activities.\n       I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention and \n     the goal of U.S. ratification of the Convention by 29 \n     April 1997, and I understand that the Department of \n     Defense shares that view. U.S. ratification of the CWC \n     prior to this date will ensure that the U.S. receives one \n     of the 41 seats on the Executive Council of the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \n     (OPCW), the international organization that will oversee \n     CWC implementation. Early ratification will also ensure \n     that U.S. citizens will fill key positions within the OPCW \n     and act as inspectors for the Organization. Direct U.S. \n     involvement and leadership will ensure the efficacy and \n     efficiency of the OPCW during the critical early stages of \n     the Convention's implementation. The U.S., upon \n     ratification and implementation of the CWC, will also \n     receive CW-related information from other state parties. \n     As a state party and a member of the Executive Council, \n     the U.S. will be in the best position to assure the \n     effective implementation of the Convention's verification \n     provisions.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a very strong and persuasive statement of \nsupport for the Chemical Weapons Convention. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider Secretary Cohen's views. We should take up the CWC for advice \nand consent to ratification without delay.\n  Mr. President, I want to provide an additional item for the record, \nand will ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my remarks that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The additional item is a letter from Dr. Lori Esposito Murray, \nSpecial Adviser to the President and ACDA Director on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, to this Senator dated January 14, 1997. This letter \nprovided a review of a number of issues concerning the CWC where there \nwas some confusion during our consideration last September. I think \nthis letter is a useful contribution to the Senate debate.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take up the Chemical Weapons \nConvention early enough to permit ratification before the April 29 \ndeadline. I hope the Senate leadership can make sure the Senate has an \nopportunity to exercise its unique constitutional responsibility for \nadvice and consent to treaty ratification.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the item I referred to previously be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Arms Control and,\n\n\n                                           Disarmament Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Levin: We understand that the Center for \n     Security Policy recently recirculated to you a letter on the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) dated September 6, 1996 \n     that had originally been sent to Majority Leader Lott. The \n     letter urges Senator Lott to reject ratification of the CWC \n     ``unless it is made genuinely global, effective, and \n     verifiable.'' Since the letter contains significant \n     misinformation about the Convention, we thought the following \n     information might be helpful as you assess this vital treaty.\n       Misstatement: ``The CWC is not effective because it does \n     not ban or control possession of all chemicals that could be \n     used for lethal purposes. For example, it does not prohibit \n     two chemical agents that were employed with deadly effect in \n     World War I--phosgene and hydrogen cyanide.''\n       Fact: Phosgene and hydrogen cyanide are covered by the \n     Convention and are explicitly listed on the Schedule of \n     Chemicals (Schedule 3). Moreover, the CWC definition of a \n     chemical weapon covers all toxic chemicals and their \n     precursors ``except where intended for purposes not \n     prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and \n     quantities are consistent with such purposes.'' Furthermore, \n     the CWC also includes provisions to expand the lists of \n     chemicals subject to declaration and verification as new CW \n     agents are identified and to improve verification procedures \n     and equipment as technology and experience improve.\n       Misstatement: ``The CWC is not global since many dangerous \n     nations (for example, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Libya) \n     have not agreed to join the treaty regime.''\n       Fact: Of the approximately twenty countries believed to \n     have or to be seeking a CW program, more than two thirds \n     already have signed the CWC. It is unlikely that those \n     outside the regime would join if the United States also \n     remained outside, giving them political cover. Additionally, \n     the CWC goes further than any other multilateral agreement to \n     date in applying pressure on nonsignatories to join the \n     regime.\n       Along with the political and diplomatic muscle that a \n     multilateral arms control agreement provides against rogue \n     states, the CWC explicitly applies trade restrictions to \n     states that are not Parties to the CWC. The Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty, which relied solely on diplomatic pressure to \n     encourage states to join, went from 43 State Parties in 1970 \n     to 184 in 1997. The CWC already has 67 State Parties and 160 \n     signatories, Iran among them. Most recently, China's \n     Parliament approved the CWC and the Russian Duma passed its \n     CW destruction plan. Without the CWC, these rogue states \n     would proceed, business as usual, in their efforts to acquire \n     chemical weapons. With the CWC, not only will we know more \n     about what they are doing, but it will be harder for them to \n     do it, and it will cost them--even if they hold off on \n     joining.\n       Misstatement: ``The CWC is not verifiable as the U.S. \n     intelligence community has repeatedly acknowledged in \n     congressional testimony.''\n       Fact: The Clinton Administration has determined that the \n     CWC is effectively verifiable because, among other things, it \n     will facilitate the ability of our Intelligence Community to \n     detect significant violations in a timely manner. The \n     Intelligence Community has emphasized in its testimony that \n     the CWC provides additional tools to do a job we would have \n     to do anyway with or without the CWC--track and control the \n     spread of chemical weapons worldwide.\n       Misstatement: ``. . . governments tend to look the other \n     way at evidence of non-compliance rather than jeopardize a \n     treaty regime.''\n       Fact: Our recent experience with the North Korean nuclear \n     program demonstrates that\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\n     governments can and will respond to evidence of non-\n     compliance and rally to uphold the integrity of an arms \n     control agreement, in this case the Non-Proliferation Treaty. \n     Indeed, the very existence of multilateral arms control \n     agreements provides a legal and political basis for taking \n     action against proliferators.\n       Misstatement: ``The CWC will create a massive new, UN-style \n     international inspection bureaucracy (which will help the \n     total cost of this treaty to U.S. taxpayers amount to as much \n     as $200 million per year).''\n       Fact: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \n     costs to the U.S. taxpayer to comply with the declaration, \n     inspection, and verification procedures of the CWC would \n     average $33 million per year, not $200 million. These \n     activities would include paying our $25 million assessment to \n     the CWC implementing organization. The United States has \n     worked diligently to ensure that the organization contains \n     only those elements essential to the completion of the task. \n     This contribution is certainly worth the investment in \n     reducing the risk that our troops will face poison gas on the \n     battlefield.\n       Misstatement: ``The CWC will jeopardize U.S. citizens' \n     constitutional rights by requiring the U.S. Government to \n     permit searches without either warrants or probable cause.''\n       Fact: The Administration expects that access to private \n     facilities will be granted voluntarily for the vast majority \n     of inspections under the CWC. If this is not the case, the \n     United States Government will obtain a search warrant prior \n     to an inspection in order to ensure that there will be no \n     trampling of constitutional rights.\n       Misstatement: ``As many as 8,000 companies across the \n     country may be subjected to new reporting requirements \n     entailing uncompensated annual costs between thousands to \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to comply.''\n       Fact: The CWC will affect approximately 2,000 not 8,000 \n     companies. Approximately 1,800 of these companies will not \n     have to do anything more than check a box regarding \n     production range. They will not even be required to specify \n     which chemicals they produce. No information will be required \n     regarding imports, exports, or domestic shipments. The CWC \n     provisions covering commercial facilities were developed with \n     the active participation of industry representatives. The \n     chemical industry has long supported the CWC. In fact, the \n     biggest expense to industry could come as the result of the \n     United States not ratifying the CWC. The CWC's trade \n     restrictions for non-Parties will apply to the United States \n     if we have not ratified the Convention by entry into force in \n     April 1997. According to the Chemical Manufacturer's \n     Association, these trade restrictions could place at risk \n     $600 million in export sales.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention will enhance U.S. security. \n     No one disputes that the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction to rogue states and terrorists is among the \n     gravest security challenges we face in the post Cold War era. \n     We will need every available tool to respond to it \n     successfully. The CWC is just such a tool. As Secretary of \n     Defense Perry and Attorney General Reno have stated, ``To \n     increase the battlefield safety of our troops and to fight \n     terror here and around the globe, the Senate should ratify \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention now.'' General Shalikashvili, \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has also testified, \n     ``The non-proliferation aspect of the Convention will retard \n     the spread of chemical weapons and in so doing reduce the \n     probability that U.S. forces may encounter chemical weapons \n     in a regional conflict.''\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention is mainly about other \n     countries' chemical weapons, not our own. The United States \n     has already made the decision to get out of the chemical \n     weapons business. In fact, we are currently destroying the \n     vase majority of our chemical weapons stockpile, and the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention will require other countries to \n     do the same.\n       As noted above, the Chemical Weapons Convention has the \n     strong support of industry. The impact on small business, in \n     particular, will be negligible. But should the United States \n     fail to ratify the CWC, trade restrictions originally \n     intended to put pressure on rogue states would be imposed on \n     U.S. chemical companies.\n       The United States has been a consistent and strong world \n     leader in the 25-year effort to ban these horrific and \n     indiscriminate weapons. This effort, which culminated in \n     President Bush's success in concluding the CWC, has had \n     strong bipartisan support over the years.\n       I urge your support for this Convention and hope the Senate \n     will act promptly and favorably so that the United States can \n     be among the original parties to the Convention when it comes \n     into force on April 29, 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Lori Esposito Murray,\n     Special Adviser to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1374-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1377-S1378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REGULATIONS REGARDING STAFF ACCESS TO THE SENATE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday, the Rules Committee approved an \namendment to the Regulations Controlling the Admission of Employees of \nSenators and Senate Committees to the Senate Floor.\n  The amendment to the regulations regarding staff floor access \nprovides full floor access for leadership staff and committee staff \ndirectors and chief counsels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Senators Lott and Daschle \nto Ranking Member Ford and myself be printed in the Record along with \nthe amended Regulations Controlling the Admission of Employees of \nSenators and Senate Committees to the Senate Floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1997.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Ford: Senator Byrd wrote us a \n     thoughtful letter last December that dealt with what he \n     characterized as ``a small but important matter: decorum in \n     the Senate.'' We share Senator Byrd's view ``of the \n     importance of maintaining proper order in the Senate at all \n     times'' and wish to encourage the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration to recommend a method for better management of \n     staff access to the Chamber. We understand the Sergeant at \n     Arms has developed such a proposal which has merit and is \n     deserving of a rapid review by the Committee.\n       Senators often require their staff to assist them in the \n     Senate Chamber, and Senators must continue to have access to \n     their staff when they determine it is necessary. We would in \n     no way wish to limit Senators' rights in this regard. Indeed, \n     Senators may at any time request unanimous consent to grant a \n     staff member the privileges of the Floor, and we would not \n     support limiting that right in any way. Door keepers in the \n     Chamber should urge staff to use the seating provided rather \n     than lean against the walls.\n       We feel confident that the Committee proposal will protect \n     the important balance between Senators' individual rights and \n     the needs of the larger body.\n           Sincerely,\n     Trent Lott.\n     Tom Daschle.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Regulations Controlling the Admission of Employees of Senators and \n                 Senate Committees to the Senate Floor\n\n       1. Of those persons entitled to the privilege of the Senate \n     Floor, under Rule XXIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     card admissions henceforth will apply solely to employees of \n     Senators and Committees. All cards for admission to the \n     Senate Floor, currently in possession of Senators or officers \n     and employees of the Senate under previous rules, shall be \n     withdrawn by the Sergeant at Arms.\n       2. Senators and Committee Chairman are requested to prepare \n     and forward to the Sergeant at Arms a list of those staff and \n     Committee employees who may have reason to apply for a Floor \n     Pass in the actual discharge of their official duties. These \n     provisions will not deprive any employee of the privilege of \n     the Senate Floor if he is entitled thereto under Rule XXIII. \n     They will, however, permit closer supervision over employees \n     admitted to the Senate Floor.\n       3. Serially numbered cards, referred to as Floor Passes, \n     will be retained at an admission table in the foyer of the \n     Vice President's Entrance to the Senate Floor. This table \n     will be manned by a representative of the Sergeant at Arms of \n     the Senate from one-half hour before each daily session until \n     one-half hour after recess or adjournment. When the actual \n     discharge of their official duties requires their presence on \n     the Senate Floor, employees of Senators and Committees, \n     otherwise entitled to admittance under Rule XXIII, will apply \n     to the attendant at the designated table for a Floor Pass.\n       4. Admission cards under the system will be available at \n     the admission table in quantities as follows:\n       All Committees of the Senate, Including Joint Committees--4 \n     cards to each Committee having jurisdiction of pending \n     legislation.\n       All Committees of the Senate, including Joint Committees--2 \n     cards to each Committee for official duties, with a 15-minute \n     limitation.\n       Staffs of individual Senators--2 cards for each Senator and \n     the Vice President.\n       Although two admission cards are provided for the qualified \n     staff personnel of each Senator, only one member of a \n     Senator's staff shall be allowed in the Senate Chamber itself \n     at any given time, with a time limitation of 15 minutes if \n     the individual Senator is not present. The other card (of \n     different color) may be used by an additional member of the \n     Senator's staff only to gain admittance to the Senate Lobby \n     (but not the Senate Chamber) for the sole purpose of \n     conferring with the Senator.\n       Each Committee may request two 15 minute Floor passes to be \n     used for the transaction of official business.\n       Should the occasion arise when an individual Senator \n     desires the assistance on the Senate Floor of personnel \n     additional to the number permitted under the above \n     allocations, he should request unanimous consent to augment \n     the maximum number allowed herein.\n       5. When an eligible employee presents [himself] his Senate \n     identification (ID) card at\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\n     the admission table, the attendant in charge there, as the \n     representative of the Sergeant at Arms, will satisfy himself \n     of the applicant's identity and eligibility before issuing a \n     Floor Pass. He will then note, on a special roster prepared \n     for the purpose, the name of the employee, his office, the \n     nature of his official business, and the serial number of the \n     card issued to him. When the employee leaves the floor he \n     will return the card to the above attendant. The latter will \n     replace the card in its appropriate place in the rack, after \n     noting its return on the roster. If, after completion of his \n     business on the Floor, a person to whom a Floor Pass was \n     issued fails to return the Pass or loses it, that person \n     shall not be admitted to the Floor until the Floor Pass is \n     returned or its loss is satisfactorily explained to the \n     Sergeant at Arms.\n       6. In no case shall any Doorkeeper admit to the Senate \n     Floor any office employee of a Senator or a Committee staff \n     member without a proper and correct visual presentation of a \n     Floor Pass. An employee admitted to the Senate Floor under \n     these regulations shall remain there only as long as \n     necessary for the transaction of his official business and \n     shall, at all times, while so present, have in his possession \n     his Senate ID card and the Floor Pass issued to him. While on \n     the Senate Floor, an employee shall in no way encroach upon \n     the areas and privileges reserved for Senator's only. When an \n     employee's objective is solely to follow the course of a \n     pertinent discussion or vote but not to render any actual \n     assistance otherwise to his Chairman or Senator, he should, \n     under normal circumstances, observe the proceedings from an \n     appropriate place in the Senate Galleries.\n       7. At the beginning of all roll-call votes the Sergeant at \n     Arms will clear the Senate Floor and the lobby of all staff \n     members except Senate clerks for whom unanimous consent has \n     previously been granted and except the staff personnel of the \n     Committee or Committees associated with the issue involved in \n     the roll-call vote shall be permitted to enter or remain in \n     the lobby for such purposes.\n       8. In addition to the Floor Passes discussed above, the \n     Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate shall issue to both the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders, fourteen Full Floor Access \n     Passes for their distribution to and use by their leadership \n     staff. These passes will be valid for the duration of the \n     Congress. The Sergeant at Arms shall also hold at the \n     admission table an additional twenty similar committee staff \n     Full Floor Access Passes, ten reserved for use by majority \n     party committee staff directors and chief counsels and ten \n     reserved for use by minority staff directors and chief \n     counsels. The Majority and Minority Leader and Committee \n     Chairman are requested to prepare and forward to the Sergeant \n     at Arms a list of those eligible staff who are authorized to \n     use a Full Floor Access Pass. A full Floor Access Pass shall \n     entitle eligible staff identified on such lists to access the \n     Senate Floor from any door. Committee staff Full Floor Access \n     Passes are issued on a daily basis beginning one-half hour \n     before each session and must be returned to the admission \n     table no later than one-half hour after recess or \n     adjournment. If a person to whom a Committee staff Full \n     Floor Access Pass has been issued, fails to return the \n     pass or loses it, that person shall not be admitted to the \n     floor until the pass is returned or its loss is \n     satisfactorily explained to the Sergeant at Arms.\n       9. The Sergeant at Arms will be responsible for the \n     enforcement of these regulations. He shall report to the \n     Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration the \n     name of any employee who, in the opinion of the Sergeant at \n     Arms, is guilty of abusing these regulations.\n       10. It is not the desire or intention of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration to limit assistance by staff \n     personnel to Senators on the floor. On the contrary, the \n     Committee believes that these regulations will insure \n     adequate opportunity for such assistance and, at the same \n     time, prevent the distraction to orderly proceedings \n     attendant upon the presence of superfluous employees in the \n     Senate Chamber. All Senators are asked to acquaint their \n     employees with the scope and purposes of these regulations.\n       11. Rules are effective in direct proportion to the vigor \n     of their enforcement and the cooperation demonstrated in \n     compliance. The Senators generally have expressed themselves \n     in full accord with efforts to diminish disorder and \n     confusion caused by the presence of unnecessary personnel on \n     the Senate Floor. It is hoped that all Senators, especially \n     when serving as the Presiding Officer of the Senate, will \n     cooperate with the Sergeant at Arms and the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration in this endeavor to control the \n     problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1377-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM L. HODSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with many others in \nUtah who have expressed their appreciation to Bill Hodson, director of \nthe Salt Lake City Veterans Medical Center.\n  Bill recently retired after many years of faithful service to our \nNation's veterans from New Jersey to Arizona, including the last 11 \nyears in Salt Lake City. These years have been ones of great \naccomplishment, not just for Bill personally, but for the VA. We have \nall, in one way or another, benefited from his innovation and \ndetermination. In 1992, Bill received the Secretary's Award for \nadvancement in nursing programs.\n  But, we in Utah owe Bill a particular debt of gratitude for his \nstewardship of our Salt Lake VA Medical Center. Bill Hodson led the way \non a $30 million project to renovate the main building of the VA \nMedical Center for patient areas and ambulatory care clinics, \nsuccessful management of a dynamic heart transplant program, and \nexpanded research and training programs. The buildings and services \nthat Bill has built will be a lasting legacy of Bill's leadership and \ncommitment to public service.\n  There can be no question that Bill was a highly able administrator; \nbut, more importantly, his compassion and concern for others has earned \nhim a special place in the hearts of veterans--and indeed all the \ncitizens of Utah.\n  Bill Hodson has been active in our community, particularly in the \nGreater Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts of America. This \ninvolvement clearly shows that he not only honors those citizens who \nhave already contributed to our country, but also that he believes in \nour youth and their capacity for contributing to our future. We will \nmiss him at the head of the Salt Lake VA Medical Center, but look \nforward to his continuing involvement in our community.\n  I hope that as he reads this tribute, Bill is already sitting on a \nnice warm beach and enjoying the first well deserved fruits of \nretirement. I wish him all the best and hope my colleagues will join me \nin recognizing an exemplary public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1378-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom Missouri for taking the lead on this important issue of term-\nlimits. Term-limits has been a concern of the people of Colorado for \nmany years. They have said time and time again that the hour has come \nfor Congressional term-limits and I share this belief. That is why I am \na proud sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 16, the Ashcroft-Thompson \nTerm Limitation bill which limits Representatives to 6 years in the \nHouse and Senators to 12 years in the Senate.\n  In 1990 with 71 percent of the vote, the State of Colorado was the \nfirst State to pass a constitutional amendment limiting the number of \nyears for Congressional Members--12 years in the House of \nRepresentatives and 12 years in the Senate. Four years later, Colorado \npassed a more restrictive term limit initiative of 6 years in the House \nand 12 years in the Senate. Since 1990, 22 other States passed some \nform of term-limits with the support of over 25 million Americans. \nHowever, in 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that State set term-limits \nfor Federal officials were unconstitutional. With the Supreme Court's \ndecision in mind, Colorado voters passed amendment 12 in 1996. The Term \nLimits Initiative calls for Colorado's elected officials to introduce \nterm-limit legislation, vote in favor of the Congressional Term Limits \nAmendment, and states that if a member of the congressional delegation \ndoes not vote in favor of the amendment then the designation of \ndisregarded voter instruction on term-limits next to their name on the \nballot.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to insert into \nthe Record a copy of the amendment 12 language at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, while I believe that States should have \nthe opportunity to set limits for their elected officials, as Colorado \nhas done on a number of occasions, the Supreme Court's decision has \nleft this important decision up to us. Some have argued that there is \nlittle chance that Members of Congress will ever limit their own terms \nand thereby limit their power. While there is some merit to this \nargument, I must say that this gives us a great opportunity to show \nthat we, as elected officials, can heed the will of the people and \nimpose term-limits on ourselves.\n  I began fighting for term-limits while in the State Senate of \nColorado and was one of four State Senators to stand-up on the Colorado \nSenate floor in favor of them. As a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I introduced and co-sponsored numerous pieces of term-\nlimit legislation. I was very proud to be a part of the 104th Congress \nwhere we voted for the first time in history on a term-limit \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I have always believed that our elected officials should be citizen \nlegislators. Citizens from all walks of life with new ideas, thoughts \nand private work experience fresh in their memory should have a chance \nto serve. Term-limits will ensure that lawmakers do not become too far-\nremoved from their constituents and will allow more citizens the \nopportunity to serve. Our legislatures will have a better understanding \nof main street and how their laws and actions affect the everyday lives \nof working men and women.\n  We find the concept of a citizen legislature in the very foundation \nof this country. In Article 57 of the Federalist Papers, my most \nadmired historical figure, James Madison wrote:\n\n       The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, \n     first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to \n     discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of \n     society; and in the next place, to take the most effectual \n     precautions for keeping them virtuous whilest they continue \n     to hold their public trust. The elective mode of obtaining \n     rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government. \n     The means relied on in this form of government for preventing \n     their degeneracy are numerous and various. The most effectual \n     one is such a limitation of the term of appointments as will \n     maintain a proper responsibility to the people.\n\n  Mr. President, I wholehearted agree with Mr. Madison and his \nassessment. Despite the large classes in 1994 and 1996, incumbent re-\nelection rates still exceed 90 percent. Term-limits at the State and \nlocal levels have made our elections more open and competitive thereby \nopening the doors to all Americans and allowing for a more diverse \nlegislature. Federal elections would be re-energized by opening-up \npolitics to many people who have been excluded by career incumbents. If \npeople call for more representation by women and minorities, then they \nshould be strong supporters of term-limits. In 1992, 22 of the 24 new \nwomen elected to the U.S. House of Representatives were elected in open \nseats, but only 2 of the 42 women candidates who challenged an \nincumbent were successful.\n  While I agree with many who call for campaign finance reform, only \nterm-limits will truly change the incentives for seeking office. They \nare a positive tool to break the cycle of excluding those citizens who \nwant to run for election to Federal office but cannot overcome the \nlargest obstacle of all--incumbency and name identification--regardless \nof the campaign laws and the amount spent on a campaign.\n  I have also heard that if the Framers believed term-limits were so \nimportant, they would have placed them in the Constitution from the \noutset. This is the same argument I hear concerning the Balanced Budget \namendment. My belief is that the Framers never thought persistent \ndeficits or spending one's career in political office would be a \nproblem. They believed that serving would always be a brief period in \none's life and would never be seen as a career. However, it is now \nclear that only a Constitutional amendment getting term-limits will \nensure that the citizen legislator is reestablished as envisioned by \nthe Framers of the Constitution.\n  I am pleased to carry on the tradition and hard work of my \npredecessor Senator Hank Brown. Senator Brown was a leader in this body \nfor term-limits and I am proud to serve in a like manner and continue \nto fight for term-limits and the will of the people of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, early in this session, we will have an opportunity to \nmake good on our campaign promises on term-limits. We must bring \nbusiness-as-usual to an end and return the power back to the people. I \nurge all my colleagues to join this fight and begin to make true \nchanges in the way this Congress operates. It is time to bring back the \ncitizen legislator and reconnect our elected officials to the people \nwhom they serve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Proposal of Text of Amendment 12--Term Limits\n\n       Be it Enacted by the People of the State of Colorado:\n       Article XVIII, section 12.\n       (1) Congressional term limits amendment.\n       The exact language for addition to the United States \n     Constitution follows:\n       Section 1: No person shall serve in the office of United \n     States Representative for more than three terms, but upon \n     ratification of this amendment no person who has held the \n     office of United States Representative or who then holds the \n     office shall serve for more than two additional terms.\n       Section 2: No person shall serve in the office of United \n     States Senator for more than two terms, but upon ratification \n     of this amendment no person who has held the office of United \n     States Senator or who then holds the office shall serve for \n     more than one additional term.\n       Section 3: This amendment shall have no time limit within \n     which it must be ratified to become operative upon the \n     ratification of the legislatures of three-fourths of the \n     several states.\n       (2) Voter instruction to state legislators.\n       (a) The voters instruct each state legislator to vote to \n     apply for an amendment-proposing convention under Article V \n     of the United States Constitution and to ratify the \n     Congressional Term Limits Amendment when referred to the \n     states.\n       (b) All election ballots shall have ``disregarded voter \n     instruction on term limits'' designated next to the name of \n     each state legislator who fails to comply with the terms of \n     subsection (5)(b).\n       (c) Said ballot designation shall not appear after the \n     Colorado legislature has made an Article V application that \n     has not been withdrawn and has ratified the Congressional \n     Term Limits Amendment, when proposed.\n       (3) Voter instruction to members of congress.\n       (a) The voters instruct each member of the congressional \n     delegation to approve the Congressional Term Limits \n     Amendment.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n       (b) All election ballots shall have ``disregarded voter \n     instruction on term limits'' designated next to the name of \n     each member of Congress who fails to comply with the terms of \n     subsection (5)(b).\n       (c) Said ballot designation shall not appear after the \n     Congressional Term Limits Amendment is before the states for \n     ratification.\n       (4) Voter instruction to non-incumbents.\n       The words ``declined to take pledge to support term \n     limits'' shall be designated on all primary and general \n     election ballots next to the names of non-incumbent \n     candidates for United States senator, United States \n     representative, state senator, and state representative who \n     have not signed the pledge to support term limits unless the \n     Colorado legislature has ratified the Congressional Term \n     Limits Amendment.\n       The pledge shall read:\n       I pledge to use all my legislative powers to enact the \n     proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth in \n     Article XVIII, section 12. If elected, I pledge to vote in \n     such a way that the designation ``disregarded voter \n     instruction term limits'' will not appear next to my name.\n       Signature of Candidate:\n       (5) Designation process.\n       (a) The Colorado secretary of state shall determine these \n     ballot designations. The ballot designation shall appear \n     unless clear and convincing evidence establishes that the \n     candidate has honored voter instructions or signed the pledge \n     in this subsection (4). Challenges to designation or lack of \n     designation shall be filed with the Colorado supreme court \n     within 5 days of the determination and shall be decided \n     within 21 days after filing. Determinations shall be made \n     public 30 days or more before the Colorado secretary of state \n     certifies the ballot.\n       (b) Non-compliance with voter instruction is demonstrated \n     by any of the following actions with respect to the \n     application or ratification by state legislators, and in the \n     case of members of Congress referring the Congressional Term \n     Limits Amendment for ratification, if the legislator:\n       (i) fails to vote in favor when brought to a vote;\n       (ii) fails to second if it lacks one;\n       (iii) fails to vote in favor of all votes bringing the \n     measure before any committee in which he or she serves;\n       (iv) fails to propose or otherwise bring to a vote of the \n     full legislative body, if necessary;\n       (v) fails to vote against any attempt to delay, table or \n     otherwise prevent a vote by the full legislative body or \n     committee;\n       (vi) fails in any way to ensure that all votes are recorded \n     and made available to the public;\n       (vii) fails to vote against any change, addition or \n     modification; or\n       (viii) fails to vote against any amendment with longer \n     limits than the Congressional Term Limits Amendment.\n       (6) Enforcement.\n       Any legal challenge to this section 12 shall be an original \n     action filed with the Colorado supreme court. All terms of \n     this section 12 are severable.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending nomination \nof Mr. Federico Pena, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of \nEnergy. The Armed Services Committee recently held a hearing to receive \ntestimony from Mr. Pena on his views and positions relative to \nDepartment of Energy Programs that fall within the jurisdiction of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  The purpose of the hearing was to explore Mr. Pena's proposals for \nthe Department's critical national security programs and to allow him \nthe opportunity to establish a coherent record of his views regarding \nthese programs. The Committee felt such a record needed to be \nestablished, because Mr. Pena has no background in national security \nmatters and, prior to last week's hearing, he had no identifiable \nposition on defense issues that Senators could use to assess his \nsuitability to manage the Department's diverse national security \nactivities.\n  I want to state very clearly that the purpose of this hearing was to \nprovide Mr. Pena with an opportunity to discuss his views. It was never \nour intent to delay his nomination or to interfere with the customary \nreporting process for his nomination in any way. I worked very closely \nwith Senator Murkowski to ensure that this hearing focused only on the \nDepartment's defense missions and did not infringe on the Energy \nCommittee's jurisdiction. Senator Murkowski was exceptionally helpful \nin coordinating the activities of our two committees and I applaud his \nleadership in this matter.\n  Regarding Mr. Pena's qualifications, let me say that I find him to be \nintelligent, thoughtful, and a quick study. If confirmed, I believe he \nwill bring much-needed management ability to the Department--something \nthat has been lacking for the past 4 years. However, the members of the \nArmed Services Committee take the Department of Energy's national \nsecurity and defense environmental cleanup missions very seriously. It \nis our responsibility to thoroughly assess the qualifications of those \nnominated to head this agency and make public our findings and \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, for some time now, the Armed Services Committee has \nexpressed its concern regarding the Department's approach to \nmaintaining the reliability and safety of the Nation's enduring nuclear \nweapons stockpile. We are concerned that the Department's proposed \nScience-based Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan may \nunnecessarily put our enduring nuclear forces at risk--both in terms of \nsafety and reliability. We are concerned that the Department's plan to \nrestore tritium production capabilities are not realistic and won't \ndeliver the required quantities of tritium in the timeframe needed by \nthe Department of Defense. We are further concerned that the pace of \ncleanup at former nuclear defense facilities may not be aggressive \nenough to meet the Department's stated 10-year cleanup goal.\n  We discussed these issues and others with Mr. Pena and generally \nfound his responses to be informed and reasoned. Unfortunately, on at \nleast two critical issues, Mr. Pena's testimony caused some level of \nconcern.\n  When asked what action he would take in a hypothetical situation \nwhere he was informed by all three DOE weapons laboratory directors \nthat a significant safety problem existed in a nuclear weapon in the \nU.S. stockpile and that the only feasible way to fix that problem was \nto conduct an under-ground nuclear test, Mr. Pena stated that he would \npresent the relevant information to the President, but steadfastly \nrefused to acknowledge his responsibility to make a test or don't test \nrecommendation to the President. I found his response troubling.\n  Mr. President, as the U.S. nuclear stockpile ages, the hypothetical \nsituation I just described is not only plausible, but one that we could \nface in the very near future. Unfortunately, Mr. Pena's response was \nless than forthright. We expect every Cabinet Secretary to present all \nthe relevant information to the President, but in this hypothetical, \nthe Secretary would be required to do more than that. This situation \nrequires that the Secretary of Energy make a recommendation to the \nPresident. Mr. Pena's refusal to commit to making such a recommendation \nraised considerable doubt regarding his understanding of the role that \nthe Secretary of Energy plays in advising the President on nuclear \nmatters and leads me to question his willingness to carry out the \nresponsibilities of the Secretary of Energy.\n\n  My fear is that Mr. Pena does not recognize that our current \nconfidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile could diminish rapidly in the \nnear future. The next Secretary of Energy must understand this reality \nand demonstrate a commitment to take all actions necessary to maintain \nthe safety and reliability of our enduring nuclear deterrent. If he is \nconfirmed, I hope to work closely with Mr. Pena to ensure the \nDepartment does not back away from its obligations in this area.\n  I also found Mr. Pena's commitment to restore U.S. tritium production \nless than satisfactory.\n  For my colleagues who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas that \nis required in all modern nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile. \nWithout tritium, our nuclear weapons cannot function. Because tritium \ndecays at a rate of 5 and 5\\1/2\\ percent per year, it must be replaced \nin weapons at regular intervals. The U.S. stopped producing tritium in \n1988 and current supplies are being exhausted.\n  The Department has pursued nearly a dozen different technical options \nfor tritium production--at great cost to the taxpayers--and we are \nstill no closer to restoring tritium production today than we were \nalmost a decade ago. Meanwhile, our supply of tritium continues to \ndegrade and our nuclear deterrent, which has served to protect this \nNation for over 50 years, becomes incrementally less effective with \neach passing year.\n  Congress has consistently directed the Department to move more \nquickly to restore tritium production. In fact, the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense Authorization Act required DOE to make a decision on tritium \nthis fiscal year. However, Mr. Pena endorsed the Department's current \ndual track strategy--\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nwhich will not result in the selection of a preferred option until \nfiscal year 1999--but, he also stated his intent to explore a new, \nthird option. This is a recipe for disaster that will result in further \ndelays and even more wasted taxpayer dollars.\n  The Department should stop studying this issue and move forward with \na decision. I believe that such a decision can and should be made this \nfiscal year and I will look toward the next Secretary of Energy to \nprovide leadership in this area.\n  These are two issues of deep concern to me and other members of the \nArmed Services Committee. I am looking for Mr. Pena to provide the \nSenate a clear answer on nuclear testing and demonstrate that he is \nwilling to move more quickly on restoring tritium. It will be difficult \nfor me to fully support Mr. Pena's nomination unless these issues are \naddressed.\n  Let me state that while I am very concerned about these issues, I \nremain openminded regarding Mr. Pena's nomination. I have made \navailable in room 228 of the Russell Building a copy of the hearing \ntranscript and Mr. Pena's responses to advance policy questions and \nposthearing questions. I encourage my colleagues to review these \nmaterials. I am certain that they will find them highly useful in \nmaking an informed determination on Mr. Pena's pending nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1379-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1381-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncomprehensive pension protection for women; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n        the comprehensive women's pension protection act of 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I introduce the Comprehensive \nWomen's Pension Protection Act of 1997. At the end of the 104th \nCongress, Congresswoman Kennelly and I introduced the Comprehensive \nWomen's Pension Protection Act of 1996. When we introduced that \nlegislation at the end of the last Congress we made a commitment to \nreintroduce this legislation at the beginning of the 105th Congress and \nto make women's retirement security a priority in the 105th Congress. \nToday we are keeping that promise.\n  The Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act of 1997 combines \nsome of the best ideas on women's pension legislation that have come \nbefore the House or the Senate and new proposals to increase the \nsecurity, equity, and accessibility of our pension system.\n  Many of America's women are facing a retirement without economic \nsecurity. The majority of the elderly in this country are, and will \ncontinue to be, women, and our retirement system is failing them.\n  Younger women are not earning sufficient pension benefits to provide \nfor their secure retirement. Due to the demands of child rearing and \nelder care, which often take women out of the workforce for a time, and \nto lower life-time earnings due to continuing wage inequities, the \naverage 35-year-old woman with a $50,000 salary must have accumulated \nretirement savings of $35,000 in order to have a comfortable \nretirement. A man need only have saved $3,000 by the time he is 35.\n  Many older women worked in the home or took time off to raise \nfamilies, and when pension benefits of their own. For many older women \ntoo, widowhood or divorce can rob them of their part of their husband's \npension benefits. To ensure that the golden years are not the \ndisposable years women need to take charge of their own retirement, but \nCongress must ensure that the Nation's retirement system enables them \nto do so.\n  On May 14, of last year I introduced, and many of my colleagues \ncosponsored, the Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996, to begin to \naddress one of the leading causes of poverty for the elderly--little or \nno pension benefits. Less than a third of all female retirees have \npensions, and the majority of those that do earn less than $5,000 a \nyear. The lack of pension benefits for many women means the difference \nbetween a comfortable retirment and a difficult one. Three of the six \nprovisions of that bill are now law.\n  This legislation is a continuation of my effort to enact real pension \nreforms that will allow women to achieve a secure retirement. Since \nintroducing the first of my women's pension equity bills, I have heard \nfrom hundreds of women from States across the country about the need \nfor pension policy that allows women to retire with dignity.\n  Addressing pension issues is an integral part of the solution to \nwomen's economic insecurity. In addition, pension issues are critical \nto our Nation as a whole. In light of the demographic trends facing \nAmerica, retirement security is increasingly important to the quality \nof life of all of our citizens. Social Security is the focus of much \ndiscussion and debate in Congress and throughout the Nation, and it \nshould be. However, addressing the problems facing Social Security \nalone will not provide women, or any American, with the tools to create \na secure retirement. The intent, from its inception, was that Social \nSecurity would provide a floor--a minimum amount of resources for \nretirement. The average retiree will only have about 40 percent of his \nor her wages replaced by Social Security.\n  Clearly, women must take charge of their own retirement and not just \nrely on Social Security. I have advocated that every woman create her \nown ``pension eight'' checklist to prepare for economic security. The 8 \nitems that should be on any woman's checklist include: (1) finding out \nif she is earning or has ever earned a pension; (2) learning if her \nemployer has a pension plan, and how to be eligible for the plan; (3) \ncontributing to a pension plan if she has the chance; (4) not spending \npension earnings if given a one-time payment when leaving a job: (5) if \nmarried, finding out if her husband has a pension; (6) not signing away \na future right to her husband's pension if he dies; (7) during a \ndivorce, considering the pension as a valuable, jointly earned asset to \nbe divided; and (8) finding out about pension rights and fighting for \nthem.\n  Even when women take charge of their own retirement, however, they \ncan face a brick wall of pension law that prevents them from investing \nenough for their future. Pension laws were not written to reflect the \npatterns of women's work or women's lives. Women are more likely to \nmove in and out of the workforce, work at home, earn less for the work \nthey do, and work in low paying industries. These factors limit our \nability to access or accrue pension benefits. Women are also more \nlikely to be widowed or divorced, live alone, and live longer in their \nretirement years, leaving them without adequate coverage.\n  This bill, which is also being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives today by Congresswoman Kennelly, a long-time champion \nof women's pension rights, addresses the range of concerns that women \nface as they consider retirement.\n  This legislation preserves women's pensions by ending the practice of \nintegration by the year 2004, the practice whereby pension benefits are \nreduced by a portion of Social Security benefits. It provides for the \nautomatic division of pensions upon divorce if the divorce decree is \nsilent on pension benefits. It allows a widow or divorced widow to \ncollect her husband's civil service pension if he leaves his job and \ndies before collecting benefits. And it continue the payment of court \nordered Tier II railroad retirement benefits to a divorced widow.\n  This legislation protects women's pensions by prohibiting 401(k) \nplans, the fastest growing type of plans in the country, from investing \nemployee contributions in the company's own stock. It requires annual \nbenefits statements for plan participants. And it applies spousal \nconsent rules governing pension fund withdrawals to 401(k) plans.\n  This legislation helps prepare women for retirement by creating a \nwomen's pension hotline, providing a real opportunity for women to get \nanswers to their questions.\n  By preserving and protecting women's pensions, we in Congress can \nprovide women with the tools they need to prepare for their own \nretirement. By reintroducing this legislation today we are giving \nnotice that pension policy will be at the top of the agenda for the \n105th Congress.\n  Pension policy decisions will determine, in no small part, the kind \nof life Americans will live in their older\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\nyears. With a baby boomer turning 50 every 9 seconds, we cannot ignore \nthe problems facing people as they grow older. Now, more than ever, all \nAmericans need to consider the role that pensions play in determining \nthe kind of life every American will lead. We look forward to being \njoined, on a bipartisan basis, by all of our colleagues in the fight \nfor pension equity.\n  Senator Murray joins me today in introducing the Comprehensive \nWomen's Pension Protection Act of 1997. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a summary of the bill and a copy of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

amendments made by this section shall apply \n     to the first plan year beginning on or after the earlier of--\n       (A) the later of--\n       (i) January 1, 1999, or\n       (ii) the date on which the last of such collective \n     bargaining agreements terminates (determined without regard \n     to any extension thereof after the date of enactment of this \n     Act), or\n       (B) January 1, 2000.\n       (3) Plan amendments.--If any amendment made by this section \n     requires an amendment to any plan, such plan amendment shall \n     not be required to be made before the first plan year \n     beginning on or after January 1, 2000, if--\n       (A) during the period after such amendment made by this \n     section takes effect and before such first plan year, the \n     plan is operated in accordance with the requirements of such \n     amendment made by this section, and\n       (B) such plan amendment applies retroactively to the period \n     after such amendment made by this section takes effect and \n     such first plan year.\n\n     A plan shall not be treated as failing to provide definitely \n     determinable benefits or contributions, or to be operated in \n     accordance with the provisions of the plan, merely because it \n     operates in accordance with this paragraph.\nTITLE V--SPOUSAL CONSENT REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SECTION 401(k) \n                                 PLANS\n\n     SEC. 501. SPOUSAL CONSENT REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM \n                   SECTION 401(K) PLANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 401(k) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified cash or \n     deferred arrangement) is amended by striking ``and'' at the \n     end of subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end of \n     subparagraph (D) and inserting ``, and'', and by adding at \n     the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) which provides that no distribution may be made \n     unless--\n       ``(i) the spouse of the employee (if any) consents in \n     writing (during the 90-day period ending on the date of the \n     distribution) to such distribution, and\n       ``(ii) requirements comparable to the requirements of \n     section 417(a)(2) are met with respect to such consent.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions in plan years beginning on or \n     after January 1, 1998.\n            TITLE VI--WOMEN'S PENSION TOLL-FREE PHONE NUMBER\n\n     SEC. 601. WOMEN'S PENSION TOLL-FREE PHONE NUMBER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Labor shall contract with \n     an independent organization to create a women's pension toll-\n     free telephone number and contact to serve as--\n       (1) a resource for women on pension questions and issues;\n       (2) a source for referrals to appropriate agencies; and\n       (3) a source for printed information.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated $500,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     1998, 1998, 2000, and 2001 to carry out subsection (a).\n            TITLE VII--PERIODIC PENSION BENEFITS STATEMENTS\n\n     SEC. 701. PERIODIC PENSION BENEFITS STATEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 105 of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n     1025) is amended by striking ``shall furnish to any plan \n     participant or beneficiary who so requests in writing,'' and \n     inserting ``shall furnish at least once every 3 years, in the \n     case of a defined benefit plan, and annually, in the case of \n     a defined contribution plan, to each plan participant, and \n     shall furnish to any plan participant or beneficiary who so \n     requests,''.\n       (b) Rule for Multiemployer Plans.--Subsection (d) of \n     section 105 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1025) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Each administrator of a plan to which more than 1 \n     unaffiliated employer is required to contribute shall furnish \n     to any plan participant or beneficiary who so requests in \n     writing, a statement described in subsection (a).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to plan years beginning after the earlier of--\n       (1) the date of issuance by the Secretary of Labor of \n     regulations providing guidance for simplifying defined \n     benefit plan calculations with respect to the information \n     required under section 105 of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1025), or\n       (2) December 31, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act of 1997\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                        section 101--integration\n\n       Problem--Social Security integration is a little known, but \n     potentially devastating mechanism whereby employers can \n     reduce a portion of employer-provided pension benefits by the \n     amount of Social Security to which an employee is entitled. \n     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited integration so as to \n     guarantee a minimum level of benefits, but the formula only \n     applied to benefits accrued in plan years beginning after \n     December 31, 1998. Low wage workers are disproportionately \n     affected by integration and are often left with minimal \n     benefits.\n       Solution--Apply the integration limitations of Tax Reform \n     Act of 1986 to all plan years prior to 1988, thereby \n     minimizing integration for low and moderate wage workers. In \n     addition, eliminate integration entirely for plan years \n     beginning on or after January 1, 2004. The lag between \n     enactment and 2004 is designed to be a transition period for \n     employers. No integration would be permissible for Simplied \n     Employee Pensions for taxable years beginning after January \n     1, 1998.\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nsection 102--application of minimum coverage requirements with Respect \n                     to separate lines of business\n\n       Problem--Current law allows companies with several lines of \n     business to deny a substantial percentage of employees \n     pension coverage. The employees denied coverage are \n     disproportionately low-wage workers.\n       Solution--Requires that all employees within a single line \n     of business be provided pension coverage to the extent the \n     employer provides coverage and the employee meets other \n     statutory requirements such as minimum age and hours.\n\n\n         section 103--division of pension benefits upon divorce\n\n       Problem--Pension assets are often overlooked in divorce \n     even though they can be a couple's most valuable asset.\n       Solution--Using COBRA as a model for the process, provide \n     for an automatic division of defined benefit pension benefits \n     earned during the marriage upon divorce, provided that the \n     couple has been married for five years. The employee would \n     notify his or her employer of a divorce. The employer would \n     then send a letter to the ex-spouse informing him or her that \n     he or she may be entitled to half of the pension earned while \n     the couple was married. The ex-spouse would then have 60 \n     days, as under COBRA, to contact the employer and determine \n     eligibility. If a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) \n     dealt with the pension benefits, then this provision would \n     not apply.\n\n\n   section 104--clarification of continued availability of remedies \n relating to matters treated in domestic relations orders entered into \n                              before 1985\n\n       Problem--In response to both the greater propensity of \n     women to spend their retirement years in poverty and the fact \n     that women were much less likely to earn private pension \n     rights based on their own work history, the Retirement Equity \n     Act of 1984 gave the wife the right to a share of her \n     husband's pension assets in the case of divorce. This law \n     only applied to divorces entered into after January 1, 1985.\n       Solution--Where a divorce occurred prior to 1985, allow the \n     Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) to be reopened to \n     provide for the division of pension assets pursuant to a \n     court order.\n\n\n  section 105--entitlement of divorced spouses to railroad retirement \n        annuities independent of actual entitlement of employee\n\n       Problem--Under the Railroad Retirement System a divorced \n     wife is automatically entitled to 50% of her husband's \n     pension under Tier I benefits as long as four conditions are \n     met: 1) the divorced wife and her husband must both be at \n     least 62 years old; 2) the couple must have been married for \n     at least 10 consecutive years; 3) she must not have remarried \n     when she applies; and 4) her former husband must have started \n     collecting his own railroad retirement benefits. There have \n     been situations where a former husband has delayed collection \n     of benefits so as to deny the former wife benefits.\n       Solution--Eliminate the requirement that the former husband \n     has started collecting his own railroad retirement benefits.\n\n\n   section 201--extension of tier ii railroad retirement benefits to \n        surviving former spouses pursuant to divorce agreements\n\n       Problem--The Tier I benefits under the Railroad Retirement \n     Board take the place of social security. The Tier II benefits \n     take the place of a private pension. Under current law, a \n     divorced widow loses any court ordered Tier II benefits she \n     may have been receiving while her ex-husband was alive, \n     leaving her with only a Tier I annuity.\n       Solution--All payment of a Tier II survivor annuity after \n     divorce.\n\n\n section 202--court orders relating to federal retirement benefits for \n                  former spouses of federal employees\n\n       Problem--Currently, under CSRS, if the husband dies after \n     leaving the government (either before or after retirement \n     age) and before starting to collect retirement benefits, no \n     retirement or survivor benefits are payable to the spouse or \n     former spouse.\n       Solution--Make widow or divorced widow benefits payable no \n     matter when the ex-husband dies or starts collecting his \n     benefits.\n\n\n   section 203--survivor annuities for widows, widowers, and former \nspouses of federal employees who die before attaining age for deferred \n                           annuity under csrs\n\n       Problem--In the case of a husband dying before collecting \n     benefits, his contributions to the Civil Service Retirement \n     System are paid to the person named as the ``beneficiary.'' \n     The employee may name anyone as the beneficiary. A divorce \n     court cannot order him to name his former spouse as the \n     beneficiary to receive a refund of contributions upon his \n     death, even if she was to receive a portion of his pension.\n       Solution--Authorize courts to order the ex-husband to name \n     his former wife as the beneficiary of all or a portion of any \n     refunded contributions.\n\n\n section 301--small 401(k) plans required to provide annual investment \n                        reports to participants\n\n       Problem--Current law requires that pension plans file an \n     annual detailed investment report with the Treasury \n     Department and make it available to any participant upon \n     request. Pension plans, including 401(k)s, with fewer than \n     100 participants and beneficiaries are not required to file \n     or make detailed investment reports available to \n     participants. 401(k)s, unlike traditional pension plans, do \n     not have the plan sponsor guaranteeing their pension benefits \n     nor do they have PBGC pension insurance. Consequently small \n     401(k) participants bear the investment risks, but are not \n     told what the investments are.\n       Solution--The Secretary of Labor must issue regulations \n     requiring small 401(k) plans to provide each participant with \n     an annual investment report. The details of the report are \n     left to the Secretary.\n\n\n           section 302--section 401(k) investment protection\n\n       Problem--Under federal law, a traditional defined benefit \n     pension plan may not invest more than 10 percent of its \n     assets in the company sponsoring the plan. The purpose of the \n     limitation is to protect employees from losing their jobs and \n     pensions at the same time. The 10 percent limitation does not \n     apply to 401(k) plans, despite their having become the \n     predominant form of pension plan, enrolling 23 million \n     employees and investing more than $675 billion.\n       Solution--Apply the 10 percent limit to employee \n     contributions to 401(k) plans--unless the participants, not \n     the company sponsoring the plan, make the investment \n     decisions.\n\n\n section 401--modifications of joint and survivor annuity requirements\n\n       Problem--Under current federal law, traditional defined \n     benefit pension plans can offer unequal survivor benefit \n     options. That option can pay the surviving spouse (most often \n     the wife) only half the survivor's benefit paid to the spouse \n     who participated in the plan. Plans may, but are not \n     required, to offer more equitable options. Current law also \n     requires that pension plans disclose retirement benefit \n     options to one spouse, the spouse who participated in the \n     plan. This leaves the other spouse (usually the wife) \n     uninformed about an irrevocable decision that affects her \n     income for the rest of her life.\n       Solution--Require that pension plans offer an additional \n     option that provides either surviving spouse with two-thirds \n     of the benefit received while both were alive. Require that \n     both spouses be given a illustration of benefits before any \n     benefit can be chosen.\n\n\n Section 501--Spousal Consent Required for Distributions from Section \n                              401(k) Plans\n\n       Problem--Under current federal law, in order for a plan \n     participant to take a lump sum distribution from a defined \n     benefit plan, the participant must have the consent of his or \n     her spouse. This is not true of a 401(k) plan. This means \n     that a participant can, at any time, drain his or her pension \n     plan and leave the spouse with no access to retirement \n     savings.\n       Solution--Require that 401(k) plans be covered by the same \n     spousal consent protections as defined benefit plans when it \n     comes to lump-sum distributions.\n\n\n          Section 601--Women's Pension Toll-free Phone Number\n\n       Problem--One of the key obstacles to women's pension \n     security is lack of information. Too many women do not know \n     whether or not they are eligible for retirement income, the \n     implications of the decisions they are asked to make \n     regarding divorce and survivor benefits, the steps they \n     should take to provide for a secure retirement, or even how \n     to gather the necessary information.\n       Solution--Create a women's pension hotline that can provide \n     basic information to women regarding pension law and their \n     options under that law.\n\n\n           Section 701--Periodic Pension Benefits Statements\n\n       Problem--Under federal law, pension plans are required to \n     provide a benefits statement annually, upon request by the \n     employee. Many employees, especially young employees, do not \n     consider pension income or do not feel secure requesting \n     information from their employer. Thus, many employees do not \n     know the amount of their accrued benefits, or payout upon \n     retirement. In addition, there are numerous instances of \n     defined contribution plans misappropriating money by failing \n     to place funds in the employee's account. Unless an employee \n     asks for a statement, he or she does not have a clear idea of \n     the state of his or her retirement security, or if the funds \n     are being properly placed.\n       Solution--Require that 401(k) plans provide benefits \n     statements automatically at least once a year. For defined \n     benefit plans, due to the more complicated calculations \n     required to produce an accurate future benefits statement be \n     automatically provided every three years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Levin, \n     Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Wellstone):\n\n  S. 322. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nrepeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact provision; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n       THE NORTHEAST INTERSTATE DAIRY COMPACT REPEAL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, to introduce the Dairy Fairness Act. In \nshort, this bill repeals the provision in the 1996 farm bill creating \nthe so-called Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  Senator Feingold and I offer this legislation with 10 other \ncolleagues,\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\nboth Democrats and Republicans, for two basic reasons: Fair process and \nsound policy. The compact sets a very dangerous precedent by violating \nboth. Let me be specific, first regarding process.\n  Back in the 103d Congress--to give history--the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held a business meeting to consider the compact, without the \nbenefit of a prior public hearing, and reported the bill to the floor. \nThe full Senate never considered it. A House Judiciary subcommittee \nheld a hearing on the proposal, but eventually sent it to full \ncommittee without a recommendation because the vote was evenly divided \nfor and against the compact. The bill died in full committee. It is \nimportant to note that the official Department of Agriculture witness \nat the House hearing stated the administration had no position and \ntwice stated that, we believe this is a matter that warrants further \nreview and consideration.\n  In the 104th Congress, the compact was the subject of not one single \nhearing in either the Judiciary Committee or the Agriculture Committee \nof the Senate. Nor was it the topic of a single hearing in counterpart \ncommittees in the House. The importance of all this is that veteran \nlawmakers knew, at best, that the Department of Agriculture was not \nsure about the compact. And, 11 freshmen senators and 87 House freshmen \nknew little-to-nothing about the compact because of the lack of any \npublic record.\n  Despite this, the compact was exhumed from its crypt and found its \nway into the Senate's version of the farm bill. Fortunately, many of my \ncolleagues and I led a successful bipartisan effort to strip the \ncompact from the farm bill. The House had never included the compact in \nits version.\n  Now, here is the kicker. The compact never had ample consideration in \nthe 103d Congress. It never had a single hearing in the 104th. The \ncompact was not included in the House version of the farm bill. And, it \nwas stripped out of the Senate's version. But the compact came back to \nlife in conference. It was included in the 1996 farm bill and, due to \ntime constraints on passage of farm legislation, as we know, the \ncompact became law.\n  Now, my purpose in reciting this litany of events is not to disparage \nthe respective committees for not considering the compact. They have \ntheir priorities. Nor do I mean to disparage those in the conference \ncommittee for agreeing to the compact.\n  They worked hard to present a timely and--aside from the compact--\nexcellent farm bill for farmers who were already making planting \ndecisions, if not already planting at the time the bill was passed.\n  Now my point is best summarized by the late Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes who said that ``the best test of truth is the power of the \nthought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and \nthat truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried \nout.''\n  I would like to think that my colleagues in what's been called the \nmost deliberative body in the world would want nothing less for the \ncompact or any other proposal. Unfortunately, the compact never faced \nthe test and, as a consequence it has never been accepted.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt about it, the compact circumvented a \nvery important process.\n  In regard to policy, the scenario does not improve. In a nutshell, \nthe compact would permit a six-State compact commission to fix prices \nfor that region's dairy producers. Yet, simple economics tells us that \nthe higher minimum price set by the commission will result in even more \nmilk production in the six-State region--which is great news for \nproducers in those six States. But the overproduction will undoubtedly \nfurther depress producer income for every other region of the country.\n  Unfortunately, as many of my colleagues know, producer income \nnationally is already so depressed that the Secretary announced some \nemergency steps to correct the problem including the purchase of $5 \nmillion in cheese and advanced cheese purchases for the School Lunch \nProgram. In the Midwest, it's reported to be so bad that small- and \nmid-sized producers aren't even recovering the cost of production. But \ndespite all this, the compact will drive national dairy prices down \neven further in 44 States in order to boost producer income in 6, even \nthough the 6 have traditionally received higher class I prices in the \nfirst place.\n  The compact is patently unfair. The inequity it creates for dairy \nfarmers in 44 States is exactly the problem the Framers of the \nConstitution thought Congress would protect against in providing us \nwith the power to regulate commerce among the States.\n  Now, I understand that even more States are pondering the idea of a \ncompact of their own. I cannot underscore how destructive this course \nis: using government-condoned, anticompetitive programs to the \ndisadvantage of other domestic producers in other regions of the \ncountry. In an era of freer and fairer trade, I find it very troubling \nthat what we don't want to do with our foreign competitors, we're now \ndoing to ourselves. That's no way to encourage a national industry and \nthat's no way to compete abroad.\n  Of course, it is not just dairy producers who are hurt by the \ncompact. According to Public Voice, a leading consumer advocacy group, \nthe compact will cost New England consumers over $300 million in just 3 \nyears, especially affecting the region's poor, and drive up the cost of \nFederal, State, and local food nutrition programs. Indeed, the St. Paul \nPioneer Press, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Boston \nHerald--whose employees as New Englanders are ostensibly served by the \ncompact--have called it ``noxious,'' ``absurd,'' an ``ugly precedent,'' \nand the ``OPEC of milk.''\n  The compact is being challenged in Federal court. In fact, last week, \nthe court issued an order allowing the Secretary of Agriculture 45 days \nto bolster his arguments for the compact before the case proceeds any \nfurther. But what was most telling was the tenor of the order and I'll \noffer just an excerpt. The order reads:\n\n       As the Court tried to make plain in its December 11, 1996 \n     Opinion, [the court] could not even tell whether anyone at \n     the Department of Agriculture had read all the comments in \n     the administrative record or just counted them since the only \n     expressed reason . . . for his finding of compelling public \n     interest . . . was that 95 percent of the comments . . . \n     supported the implementation of the Compact. But, a simple \n     head count will not do . . . particularly in view of the \n     numerous concerns the Secretary himself expressed [about the \n     Compact]. Those concerns, expressed in four paragraphs, \n     overshadow the four reasons, expressed in two sentences, that \n     the Secretary gave for finding a compelling public interest.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the order printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 96-\n                              2027 (PLF)]\n\nMilk Industry Foundation, plaintiff, v. Daniel R. Glickman, Secretary, \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, defendant, and Northeast Dairy Compact \n                    Commission, defendant-intervenor\n\n\n                                 order\n\n       This matter is before the Court on defendant's motion for a \n     stay of proceedings in this case to allow the Secretary of \n     Agriculture 45 days to provide what defendant characterizes \n     as ``an Amplified Decision on its finding that there is \n     compelling public interest in the compact region for the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.'' Plaintiff opposes the \n     motion for a variety of reasons, while defendant-intervenor \n     supports it.\n       The parties to this case are all aware that Congress placed \n     a particular condition on its consent to the Compact--that \n     the Secretary make a finding of compelling public interest. \n     As the Court tried to make plain in its December 11, 1996 \n     Opinion, it could not even tell whether anyone at the \n     Department of Agriculture had read all the comments in the \n     administrative record or just counted them, since the only \n     expressed reason the secretary gave for his finding of \n     compelling public interest (other than congressional consent \n     and state approval) was that 95 percent of the comments the \n     Department received supported implementation of the Compact. \n     Opinion at 8, 24-25. But ``a simple head count will not do,'' \n     id. at 24, particularly in view of the numerous concerns the \n     Secretary himself expressed about the potential adverse \n     effects the Compact might have, concerns presumably based on \n     material in the record. Id. at 9-10, 25. ``Those concerns, \n     expressed in four paragraphs, overshadow the four reasons, \n     expressed in two sentences, that the Secretary gave for \n     finding a compelling public interest.'' Id. at 25.\n       If the Secretary wants time now ``to amplify'' his \n     decision, he must make sure that the entire administrative \n     record, including the comments submitted, is thoroughly \n     reviewed and analyzed and approached from a\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\n     fresh perspective. It is not open to the Secretary under this \n     Court's Opinion of December 11, 1996, to approach his task \n     with a preconceived view that a compelling public interest \n     exists. His job is not merely to cull out from the favorable \n     comments reasons to support a pre-determined decision. His \n     responsibility is to review the quality of the comments in \n     the record and to decide whether his earlier finding is \n     justified at all.\n       The Court is prepared to grant the stay requested by the \n     defendant, so long as the Secretary of Agriculture and his \n     counsel understand what is required over the course of the \n     next 45 days. The Court agrees with plaintiff that if a stay \n     is granted the Secretary's responsibility is much broader \n     than he and defendant-intervenor suggest. The Secretary must \n     now be as open to reaching a finding of no public interest as \n     he is to concluding that there is one. Regardless of which \n     conclusion he reaches, he must articulate his reasons in \n     accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and the case \n     law. With the foregoing in mind, it is hereby\n       Ordered that all proceedings in this case are stayed until \n     March 20, 1997, during which time the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall review the Administrative Record in this \n     case, reach a conclusion with respect to the existence of a \n     compelling public interest, and provide a reasoned \n     explanation for that decision in accordance with this Court's \n     Opinion of December 11, 1996, and today's order, it is\n       Further ordered that the stay does not preclude plaintiff \n     from renewing its motion for a preliminary injunction should \n     the Compact attempt to move forward and impose higher milk \n     prices or for any other appropriate reason; it is\n       Further ordered that the briefing and argument schedule set \n     forth in this Court's Order of December 11, 1996, is \n     rescinded; and it is\n       Further ordered that the parties shall jointly propose \n     within ten days from the date of this Order a revised \n     briefing and argument schedule.\n       So ordered.\n                                                 Paul L. Friedman,\n                                     United States District Judge.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in short, a Federal judge cannot even find \nthe merit behind the compact. But, despite earlier misgivings, the \nDepartment seems resigned to embarking on what appears to be the \nherculean task of making some sense out of the compact in order to save \nit from a court.\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe this Congress has a unique opportunity \nto save an overcrowded court some time, help the Department focus its \nenergies on the consolidation and reform of milk marketing orders, and \ndo it all while guaranteeing New England consumers and dairy producers \nin 44 States a little fairness. We can do this by passing the Dairy \nFairness Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I see some of my other colleagues who have helped sponsor this \nlegislation, including Senator Kohl and Senator Feingold, are on the \nfloor, and I yield some time to them if they would like to add their \nsupport to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my continued opposition to \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact. As I have said many times in the past, it \ndoes not make me happy to oppose efforts by dairy farmers in other \nparts of the country to reap a higher price for their milk. For years, \nI have worked with many of the proponents of the compact in efforts to \nhelp farmers get a better price for their product. But in the past, \nthese efforts have been national. And I believe we should continue with \nnational efforts to bring farmers together, instead of regional efforts \nthat pit farmer against farmer.\n  The Northeast Compact is an effort by six Northeastern States to \nestablish a regional cartel, to guarantee the farmers in that region \nalone get a higher price for their milk, to the detriment of the \nconsumers in the Northeast, and farmers in other parts of the country, \nincluding Wisconsin. In my view, it is the exact opposite of what we \nshould be doing; which is establishing a fair and reasonable national \ndairy policy that gives farmers in all regions an opportunity to \nprosper, free of structural impediments from the Federal Government.\n  In my region of the country, the discriminatory nature of the current \nmilk pricing system has contributed to a dangerous erosion of our farm \neconomy. In Wisconsin alone, we have lost 12,000 dairy farms in the \nlast 10 years. And I believe that the Northeast Compact will worsen the \nregional inequities that exist today, and be detrimental to farmers in \nregions outside the Northeast.\n  To those outside the upper Midwest, who have not witnessed the \ndestruction caused by the current milk pricing system, it may be \ndifficult to understand how pricing schemes in one region could affect \nother regions of the country. But we cannot ignore that dairy markets \nare national, and any effort to artificially boost prices in one region \nalone will have effects throughout the national system. History has \nproven that point time and time again, and unfortunately, Wisconsin is \nthe proving ground of that destruction.\n  And even prior to its implementation, the evidence is beginning to \nbuild proving that the Northeast Dairy Compact sets a dangerous \nprecedent in U.S. economic policy. Recently, the secretaries of \nagriculture from 15 southeastern States announced that they would be \nseeking to establish a Southeastern Dairy Compact, citing the precedent \nestablished by the Northeast Compact. So we must ask ourselves, where \ndoes it stop? A 6-State dairy cartel in the Northeast, a 15-State dairy \ncartel in the Southeast. This disintegration of our national economic \nunity does not come without cost. We may not be able to predict where \nthis new regional cartel movement will stop, but it is clearly \ndangerous.\n  So I join my colleagues in introducing this legislation that would \nrepeal the section of the 1996 farm bill that gives the Secretary of \nAgriculture authority to approve the Northeast Compact. Whether it is \nstopped legislatively, or by the Secretary of Agriculture, to whom it \nhas been returned by a Federal judge for reconsideration, I believe it \nshould be stopped. And I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing this \ndangerous precedent for U.S. economic policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from \nWisconsin under time controlled by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, am pleased to rise in \nsupport of the legislation introduced by the Senator from Minnesota, \nand also by my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl.\n  I was prepared to give a longer speech but I am informed that the \nmother-in-law of the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, has passed away, \nand he is not able to be here today because of that. For that reason, I \nsimply associate my remarks with the Senator from Minnesota, and the \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin so we can take this debate up on another \nday when Senator Leahy is able to respond. He is very able to respond \nhimself. We have a strong disagreement on this issue, but I am a great \nfriend of his and I believe he is a fine Senator and prefer at this \npoint to wait.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation introduced by the \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, to repeal the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact was included in \nthe 1996 farm bill during conference negotiations after it had been \nstruck from the Senate version of the farm bill during floor \nconsideration of the farm bill early last year.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact establishes a \ncommission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, \nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--empowered to set minimum \nprices for fluid milk above those established under Federal Milk \nMarketing Orders. Ironically, the Federal milk marketing order system \nalready provides farmers in the designated compact region with minimum \nmilk prices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers \nthroughout the nation. The compact not only allows the six States to \nset artificially high fluid milk prices for their producers, it also \nallows those States to keep out lower priced milk from producers in \ncompeting States and provides processors within the region with a \nsubsidy to export their higher priced milk to noncompact States.\n  Mr. President, the arguments against this type of price-fixing scheme \nare numerous: It interferes with interstate commerce by erecting \nbarriers around one region of the Nation; It provides preferential \nprice treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers \nnationally; It encourages excess milk production in one region without \nestablishing effective supply control which may drive down milk prices \nfor producers throughout the\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\ncountry; It imposes higher costs on the millions of consumers in the \nCompact region; It imposes higher costs to taxpayers who pay for \nnutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch \nprograms which provide for milk and other dairy products in their \nprograms; and as a price-fixing compact it is unprecedented in the \nhistory of this Nation.\n  Most important to my home State of Wisconsin, Mr. President, is that \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact exacerbates the inequities within the \nFederal milk marketing orders system that already discriminates against \ndairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the upper Midwest. Federal \norders provide higher fluid milk prices to producers the further they \nare located from Eau Claire, WI, for markets east of the Rocky \nMountains.\n  Wisconsin farmers have complained for many years that this inherently \ndiscriminatory system provides other regions, such as the Northeast, \nthe Southeast, and the Southwest with milk prices that encourage excess \nproduction in those regions. Of course, that excess production drives \ndown prices throughout the Nation and results in excessive production \nof cheese, butter, and dry milk. Cheese and other manufactured dairy \nproducts constitute the pillar of our dairy industry in Wisconsin. \nCompetition for the production and sale of these products by other \nregions spurred on by artificial incentives under milk marketing orders \nhas eroded our markets for cheese and other products.\n  Mr. President, my State of Wisconsin loses more than 1,000 dairy \nfarms per year either through bankruptcy or attrition. The number of \nmanufacturing plants has declined from 400 in 1985 to less than 230 in \n1996. These losses are due in part, to the systematic discrimination \nand market distortions created by Federal dairy policies that provide \nartificial regional advantages that cannot be justified on any rational \neconomic grounds.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams and I are \non the floor today offering this legislation because the Northeast \nDairy Compact reinforces the discrimination that has so damaged the \ndairy industry in our States. We have fought to change Federal milk \nmarketing orders and we will fight to prevent the Northeast Dairy \nCompact from ever going into effect.\n  Less damaging but more insulting to Wisconsin dairy farmers than the \nincrease in regional inequities is the inherent assumption of the \ncompact proponents that either the financial distress of Northeast \ndairy farmers is worse than that experienced by farmers in other \nregions or that farmers in the Northeast are more important than \nfarmers elsewhere. Either assumption is ludicrous.\n  As all Senators are aware, when milk prices plummet, as they did last \nfall by 26 percent in 3 months, the financial pain is felt by farmers \nthroughout the Nation, no worse and no less by any particular region.\n  And yet the Northeast Compact provides price protection for dairy \nfarmers in six States, insulating them from market conditions which \nnoncompact farmers must confront and to which they must adjust. Compact \nproponents have never been able to explain how conditions in the \nNortheast merit greater protection from market price fluctuations than \nother regions of the country. The fact that there are no compelling \narguments made in favor of the compact that justified special treatment \nfor the Northeast was emphasized by a vote in the full Senate to strike \nthe compact from the 1996 farm bill. It was the only recorded vote on \napproval or disapproval of the Northeast Dairy Compact--and it killed \nthe compact in the Senate. The way in which the compact was ultimately \nincluded in the 1996 farm bill also illustrates the weak justification \nand the lack of support for its approval. It was never included in a \nHouse version of the farm bill and yet emerged as part of the bill \nafter a closed door Conference negotiation. Legislation which is \ndifficult to defend must frequently be negotiated behind closed doors \nrather than in the light of day.\n  The 1996 farm bill provided authority to approve the compact to the \nSecretary of Agriculture if he found a compelling public interest for \nthe compact in the Northeast. Congress, still unwilling to accept \nresponsibility for what I believe to be an unjustifiable compact, \ndelegated their authority to the Secretary. The Secretary approved the \ncompact last August but even he, with his teams of economists and \nmarketing specialists, was unable to come up with an economic \njustification for the compact. The Secretary's finding of ``compelling \npublic interest'' justifying his approval of the compact was so weak \nand unsupported by the public record that a suit was filed by compact \nopponents in Federal court charging that the Secretary violated the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. Last December, a Federal District Court \njudge found that, in fact, the plaintiffs in that suit were likely to \nprevail on their claim that the Secretary's decision was arbitrary and \ncapricious. More recently, the same Federal judge told USDA to review \nthe public record and determine whether in fact that compact should \nhave been approved.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Dairy compact can't be justified because \nit is just plain bad policy. It is bad public policy because it \nincreases costs to taxpayers nationally and consumers in the Northeast \nto benefit few. It is bad dairy policy because it exacerbates regional \ndiscrimination of existing Federal milk marketing orders by providing \nartificial advantages to a small group of producers at the expense of \nall others. And it is bad economic policy because it establishes \nbarriers to interstate trade--barriers of the type the United States \nhas been working hard to eliminate in international markets.\n  Mr. President, Congress should never have provided Secretary Glickman \nwith authority to approve the compact. That in my view, was an improper \nand potentially unconstitutional delegation of our authority and it was \nirresponsible. It is the role of Congress to approve interstate \ncompacts and we irresponsibly abrogated our responsibility in this \nmatter. It is time to make it right.\n  I hope the Secretary rescinds his earlier decision to approve the \ncompact in the additional time the courts have provided him. If he does \nnot, I hope the courts strike down the compact both on the grounds that \nit violated the APA and on constitutional grounds. However, in any \nevent, it is incumbent upon Congress to undo the mistake it made in the \n1996 farm bill. Congress can and should act independently of both the \nadministrative and judicial process to repeal the Northeast Interstate \nDairy compact. As the other branches of Government are doing their \njobs, we must continue to do ours.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Hagel):\n\n  S. 323. A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to declare \nEnglish as the official language of the Government of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 THE LANGUAGE OF GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I consider \nto be one of the most important pieces of legislation that will be \noffered this year. It is the Language of Government Act of 1997, which \ndesignates English as the official language of the U.S. Government. I \nhave as original cosponsors on that legislation Senators Byrd, \nCoverdell, Craig, Faircloth, Gregg, Helms, Hutchinson of Arkansas, \nInhofe, Lugar, Santorum, Thurmond, Cochran, and Sessions.\n  Mr. President, language, as we all know, is a powerful factor in \nsociety. As de Tocqueville observed more than a hundred years ago, \n``The tie of language is perhaps the strongest and the most durable \nthat can unite mankind.'' That was true then, and it is true today.\n  Just as surely as language has the power to unite us, it has the \npower to divide us. One year after French-speaking Quebec rejected by a \nrazor-thin margin the referendum to secede from Canada, our neighbor to \nthe north is still grappling with the repercussions of the vote. \nEnglish-speaking residents of Quebec have threatened to secede if \nQuebec proceeds with another referendum. There are many examples in the \nworld of what happens to nations that are divided among language and \nethnic lines. Bosnia, as we all know, has been decimated by ethnic \nstrife. The countries of the former Soviet Union are in constant \ninternal conflict and turmoil.\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\n  Today, more than 320 different languages are spoken in our country. \nWe should respect each of these languages and those individuals who \nspeak them. But in order to assimilate the various cultures and ethnic \ngroups that comprise our great Nation, I believe we must use English. \nFurthermore, the Federal Government should not, in my opinion, be \nexpected to administer its official business in all of these languages. \nYet, the Federal Government continues to expand the number and types of \nservices that it administers in foreign languages.\n  Layers of bureaucracy have been added as these governmental agencies \nhave evolved into permanent multi-language service providers. In light \nof this fact, Mr. President, I believe it is imperative that we \nestablish in America a responsible, coherent language policy for all of \nus.\n  The legislation that I offer today, on behalf of myself and the \ncolleagues I mentioned earlier, is simple and straightforward. It \ndesignates English as the language of the Federal Government and \nrequires that most Government functions be performed in English. There \nare exceptions to that rule, Mr. President, for safety, emergencies, \nand health-related services.\n  I want to emphasize that ``official English'' is directed at the \nFederal Government and its agents, but does not cover private citizens. \nIn no way, Mr. President, does the bill limit an individual's use of \nhis or her native language in home, church, community, or other private \ncommunications.\n  Mr. President, since last December, the Nation has engaged in a \nheated debate over using ``ebonics'' in public schools. We are all \nfamiliar with that. I do not intend to join that debate today. Instead, \nI raise this in order to mention a fundamental point. In the words of \nMaya Angelo, ``The very idea * * * can be very threatening, because it \ncan encourage young men and women not to learn standard English.'' \nWithout mastering English, our children and grandchildren cannot \nsucceed. Indeed, as so many Americans know from their own experiences, \nproficiency in English propelled them from a life of poverty to a \nfuture full of opportunity.\n\n  A substantial body of evidence supports that notion and confirms that \nthere is a direct correlation between an individual's ability to speak \nEnglish in America and that person's economic fortunes.\n  A recent Ohio University study concluded that if immigrant knowledge \nof English were raised to that of native-born Americans, their income \nlevels would increase by $63 billion annually. In 1994, the Texas \nOffice of Immigration and Refugee Affairs published a study of \nSoutheast Asian refugees in Texas. It conclusively demonstrated that in \nthat population, individuals proficient in English earned over 20 times \nthe annual income of those who could not speak English. Analysis of \n1990 census data shows that immigrants' incomes rise 30 percent as a \nresult of being able to communicate in English.\n  So, without question, fluency in the English language will do more to \nempower people coming to America than all Federal Government services \ncombined. The Federal Government, however, is offering more services \nand producing more publications in a multitude of foreign languages, at \na cost of $14 billion annually. Conducting official Government \nfunctions in a foreign language supposedly facilitates assimilation \ninto our society. What began in a piecemeal fashion to facilitate \nassimilation has mutated into institutionalized and permanent \nmultilingual programs and services.\n  The effect, Mr. President, is that it destroys the incentive to learn \nEnglish, which undermines one of the key objectives of integration in \nthis country. As I stated earlier, the plain truth is that immigrants \nwho do not develop proficiency in English will almost always be \nrelegated to a lower rung on the economic ladder, often far below their \nearnings potential.\n  By designating English as the official language of our Government, we \nsend a clear and unmistakable message that English is a necessary part \nof life in America. But it is not just a symbolic gesture. If most \ncommunication with the Federal Government is conducted in English, it \nencourages fluency in English. At the same time, establishing a \nlanguage policy will stop the frivolous expenditure of printing \nGovernment documents in foreign languages. There is no justification \nfor the money wasted to produce, for example, ``The Reproductive \nBehavior of Young People in the City of Sao Paulo'' in Portuguese or \npublication on the U.S. Mint in Chinese. The money squandered on those \ndocuments would be better spent teaching English to those who cannot \nspeak it. My bill states that the savings from this initiative be used \nto teach English in America.\n  Mr. President, national polling indicates that 86 percent of \nAmericans support making English the official language of this country. \nIn fact, Mr. President, 8 out of 10 first-generation immigrants in \nAmerica support this legislation. As our Nation becomes more diverse, \nit becomes more and more important for Congress to deal with the \nestablishment of an official language policy. Our consideration of this \nbill shows that we take our national heritage and democracy seriously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Campbell):\n\n  S. 324. A bill to amend title 32, United States Code, to provide that \nperformance of honor guard functions at funerals for veterans by \nmembers of the National Guard may be recognized as a Federal function \nfor National Guard purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL GUARD LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \ncommon sense piece of legislation of great importance to the veterans \nof our country.\n  Let me begin by thanking the veterans of my State for bringing this \nimportant issue to my attention. I particularly want to thank Mr. Fran \nAgnes, past national chairman, with the Former Prisoners of War \nveterans service organization. Fran is a champion for the veterans of \nmy State and he never lets an opportunity pass to share with me the \nviews of Washington State veterans.\n  My State is home to nearly 700,000 veterans, and one of the few \nStates with a growing veterans population. Washington State vets are \nactive; virtually every veterans service organization has chapters, \nposts, and members all across my State. At the State level, Washington \nveterans are also blessed with a team of dedicated veterans' advocates. \nFor me, this means I have a statewide ``unofficial'' advisory team to \nprovide me with regular information about the issues of importance to \nveterans. I hear from Washington vets in the classroom, in the grocery \nstore, at VA facilities, on the street, in my office and through the \nmail. My service on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is a genuine \npartnership with the veterans of my State.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a direct result of this \npartnership. Simply stated, my bill proposes to allow the performance \nof honor guard functions by members of the National Guard at funerals \nfor veterans.\n  It may shock my colleagues to know why this legislation is so \nimportant. Sadly, decorated U.S. veterans are being laid to rest all \nacross this country without the appropriate military honors.\n  For years, military installations trained personnel to provide color \nguard services at the funerals of veterans. Oftentimes, as many as 10 \nactive duty personnel were made available by local military \ninstallations to provide funeral services for a compatriot and his or \nher grieving family. These services were immensely important to the \nveterans community. It allowed veterans to see fellow veterans treated \nwith the appropriate respect and admiration they deserved, and to know \nthat they would also be afforded a dignified service.\n  As the military has downsized in recent years, many installations are \nno longer able to provide personnel to perform color guard services and \naid the veteran's family. Some installations do provide limited \nassistance if the deceased served in that branch of the military. In my \nState, that means very little to the Navy family who loses a loved one \nnear the Air Force or Army installations nearby. And we all know, when \na family member passes away there is little time or emotional capacity \nto plan a funeral. Too often, the result for a veteran is a funeral \nservice\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\nwithout the requested and the deserved military honors. This must \nchange.\n  Veterans' service organizations have stepped in and tried to provide \nthe color guard services for fellow deceased veterans. By most \naccounts, they do a very good job. But VSO's cannot meet the need for \ncolor guard services. By their own admission, they often lack the \ncrispness and the precision of trained military personnel. Our veterans \npopulation is getting older, and we cannot expect a group of older \nveterans to provide these services day in and day out for their \nmilitary peers. We are simply asking too much of a generation that has \nalready given so much.\n  My bill is an important first step toward ensuring that every veteran \nreceives a funeral worthy of the valiant service he or she has given to \nour country. I believe every single Member of Congress believes our \nveterans deserve to be remembered with the appropriate military honors \nduring a funeral service. By passing my legislation, the Congress can \nsend a message to veterans that their service to us all will never be \nforgotten. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to pass this \nlegislation at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator and Korean war veteran \nBen Nighthorse Campbell for joining me in this effort. Senator Campbell \nalso serves on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and I know personally of \nhis great commitment to the veterans of our country. And I'd also like \nto thank Congressman Paul Kanjorski, who has previously introduced this \nlegislation on the House side. As I understand it, his constituents in \nPennsylvania originally asked him to get involved in this effort. I \nlook forward to working closely with both Senator Campbell and \nCongressman Kanjorski in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Kohl):\n  S. 325. A bill to repeal the percentage depletion allowance for \ncertain hardrock mines; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 326. A bill to provide for the reclamation of abandoned hardrock \nmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, \n        and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 327. A bill to ensure that Federal taxpayers receive a fair return \nfor the extraction of locatable minerals on public domain lands, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   hardrock mining reform legislation\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three bills \nwhich are intended to reform hardrock mining on public land and \nrecover, for taxpayers, lost revenues resulting from the patenting \nprocess under the 1872 mining law.\n  The 1872 mining law was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant \nduring a time when our national policy was to encourage the settlement \nof the West with the enticement of free land and minerals. However, 124 \nyears have now passed and the mining law has become a relic. Rather \nthan serve the interests of the public, the mining law gives away \nbillions of dollars worth of land and minerals to mining companies for \npractically nothing.\n  While there are many flaws with the 1872 law, some of the most \noutrageous include: allowing the sale of public lands and minerals for \n$2.50 to $5.00 per acre; allowing the mining of valuable minerals \nwithout a dime in royalty payments to the taxpayers for those minerals; \nallowing patented land bought for $2.50 an acre to be resold at market \nprices--sometimes thousands of dollars per acre; and not adequately \nprotecting the environment.\n  Our attitudes toward public resources have changed since the 19th \ncentury and so have most of our public policies. While the mining law \nhas been amended indirectly over the years, its basic provisions remain \nunchanged and are in dire need of reform. Over the years numerous \nprivate, government and congressional studies have recommended either \nrevising the mining law or repealing it completely. One of the most \nthorough modern studies of the mining law was conducted by the Public \nLand Law Review Commission during the 1960's. The commission's work \nformed the basis for the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \n[FLPMA]. In ``One Third of the Nation's Land--A Report to Congress and \nthe President'' the commission stated:\n\n       The general mining law of 1872 has been abused, but even \n     without that abuse, it has many deficiencies. Individuals \n     whose primary interest is not in mineral development and \n     production have attempted, under the guise of that law, to \n     obtain use of public lands for various other purposes. The \n     1872 law offers no means by which the Government can \n     effectively control environmental impacts.\n\n  While the Public Land Review Commission and many others have called \nfor comprehensive mining law reform for some time now, Congress has \nfailed to respond. At a time when the public is clamoring for a more \nefficient government and a government that treats the taxpayers with \ndignity and respect, the 1872 mining law instead condones the giveaway \nof public lands and valuable minerals worth billions of dollars for \npractically nothing and which permits long-term environmental \ndegradation of our public lands.\n  In the last four Congresses I introduced legislation which would have \ncomprehensively reformed the mining law. On each occasion the mining \nindustry went to great lengths to successfully ensure that the 1872 \nmining law would not be comprehensively reformed. However, Mr. \nPresident, as we continue to strive to balance the Federal budget, the \nday of reckoning for beneficiaries of corporate welfare is getting \ncloser. Eventually, Congress is going to enact real mining law reform.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an effort to seek to \nprotect the interests of the very people that Members of Congress \npurport to represent--the American people. One hundred twenty-four \nyears after Ulysses Grant signed the mining law the time has come to \nbring our Nation's mineral policy into the present.\n  As always, I am willing to work with people on all sides of this \nissue in an attempt to develop a solution amenable to all. However, I \nwill not be a party to the efforts of those who, in an effort to end \ndebate on the subject, attempt to enact ``sham reform'' legislation \ndrafted by the mining industry.\n  The problems of the mining law and the proposed solutions contained \nin the three bills I am introducing today are described more fully \nbelow.\n  Under the existing mining law, a patent-fee simple title--to a mining \nclaim on Federal lands may be obtained for the purchase price of $2.50 \nan acre for a placer claim--or $5 an acre for a lode claim--a price \nwhich has not changed since 1872. During the last 124 years, the \nGovernment has sold more than 3.2 million acres of land under the \npatent provision of the 1872 mining law, an area similar to the size of \nthe State of Connecticut. This is a giveaway--pure and simple--and is \ndirectly contrary to the national policy enunciated in the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act--that, in most cases, public lands should be \nretained in public ownership.\n  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that $5 an acre is \nfar less than the fair market value of the patented land and the \nminerals thereon. In 1994 we witnessed one of the biggest taxpayer \nripoffs in the history of the mining law when the Federal Government \nwas forced to grant patents to a subsidiary of a Canadian-owned mining \ncompany. In exchange for 1,800 acres of land in Nevada containing more \nthan $10 billion in gold, the Federal Government received the princely \nsum of less than $10,000. Mr. President, believe it or not, the \ntaxpayers stand to do worse in the very near future. The Stillwater \nMining Co., which is jointly owned by Chevron and Manville, has applied \nfor patents on approximately 2,000 acres of Forest Service land in \nMontana. In exchange for $10,000, the company will receive fee title to \nland containing, according to Stillwater's own reserve estimates, $35 \nbillion worth of platinum and palladium.\n  Congress finally took action in 1994 by imposing a 1-year moratorium \non the processing of new patent applications and those applications \nthat were still in the early stages of processing. This moratorium has \nbeen renewed the last 2 years, albeit after an effort was made by \nSenators from the West to repeal it.\n  Under the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of 1997, which I am introducing\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\ntoday, mining claim holders would no longer be able to patent their \nclaims. The sale of Federal lands for $2.50 or $5.00 an acre would be \npermanently halted.\n  In addition to allowing the sale of lands for far less than fair \nmarket value, the mining law also permits corporations to mine valuable \nminerals from public domain lands without paying a nickel in royalties \nto the landowner--the taxpayers. While oil, gas, and coal producers all \npay royalties to the U.S. Treasury for production on Federal lands, the \nGovernment doesn't receive anything for hardrock minerals produced on \nFederal lands subject to the 1872 mining law.\n  The hardrock mining companies contend that they would be forced to \nshut down operations if they were required to pay royalties to the \nFederal Government. However, these same companies find themselves able \nto pay royalties for mining operations on State and private lands. In \nfact, the Newmont Mining Co. pays an 18 percent royalty on land \nacquired from private interests on a portion of its gold quarry mine in \nNevada's Carlin Trend. Ironically, a hardrock miner operating on \nacquired Federal lands pays a royalty to the Federal Government while \nhis counterpart on lands subject to the mining law pays nothing. There \nis no justifiable reason for this difference.\n  Billions of dollars' worth of hardrock minerals are extracted from \nthe public lands. It is absolutely unfair to the taxpayers of this \ncountry to permit hardrock mining companies to enjoy the same tax \nbreaks as others, while failing to adequately compensate the public \nlandowners. The legislation I am introducing today seeks to remedy this \nresult. First, the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of 1997 would require \nthe payment of a royalty of 5 percent of the net smelter return from \nmineral production on public lands. Because the royalty would not apply \nto minerals extracted on lands already patented under the mining law, \nthe Abandoned Mines Reclamation Act of 1997 would required mining \ncompanies operating on patented land to pay a net-income-based \nreclamation fee. Finally, because it makes absolutely no sense to \npermit mining companies to take advantage of a mineral depletion \nallowance when they are using taxpayer land without compensating the \ntaxpayers, the elimination of double subsidies for the Hardrock Mining \nIndustry Act of 1997 would repeal the depletion allowance for mining \noperations on land subject to the 1872 mining law.\n  Originally, the mining law required claimants to certify that they \nperformed 100 dollars' worth of work on their mining claims each year \nin order to maintain their claims. Because many claimants were not \nserious about mining their claims, Congress replaced the work \nrequirement with a $100 per claim maintenance fee. In conjunction with \nthe administration's proposal the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act increases \nthe fee for new claims to $125.\n  Mr. President, past mining activities have left a legacy of \nunreclaimed lands, acid mine drainage, and hazardous waste. More than \n50 abandoned hardrock mining sites are currently on the Superfund \nnational priority list. Some estimate that it could cost taxpayers \nupward of $70 billion to clean all the abandoned mining sites.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today would create an abandoned mine \nreclamation fund to help reclaim the many hardrock mining sites which \nhave been abandoned. Money for the fund would come from the royalties \nand holding fees collected under the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of \n1997 and the reclamation fees collected under the Abandoned Hardrock \nMining Reclamation Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, the mining industry knows that the public is slowly \nlearning about the 1872 mining law and the associated atrocities and \nbelieve me, the industry is worried. As they have done in the past, I \nsuspect the mining industry will once again raise a smokescreen by \nproposing so-called reforms. For instance, the mining industry has \nproposed that instead of paying $2.50 or $5.00 an acre for patents, \nthat instead they pay the fair market value of the surface, regardless \nof the value of the minerals located on the land. While the concept of \nfair market value is certainly a good one, it is absurd to argue that \nthe Stillwater Mining Co. would really be paying fair market value if \nthey paid for the surface--probably worth less than $100 an acre--and \nignored the value of the platinum and palladium--estimated to be $35 \nbillion. Mr. President, if you or I ran a company which sold land for \nsuch fair market value, we would be fired in a New York minute. Mr. \nPresident, I urge my colleagues to beware of such sham reform.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I urge you to support the long overdue \nreform of the 1872 mining law and to cosponsor my three bills. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats are always talking about change and the need \nto end business as usual in Washington. My legislation is intended to \nend business as usual and bring the 1872 mining law into the 20th \ncentury. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to protect \nemployer rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                    Truth in Employment Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an \nimportant piece of legislation which will enable thousands of \nbusinesses in my home State of Arkansas, and across the Nation, to \navoid an unscrupulous practice which is literally crippling business.\n  The Truth in Employment Act will protect these businesses and curtail \nthe destructive union tactic known as salting. It may not be in the \nsame magnitude of issues as the balanced budget amendment, which I am \ndeeply concerned about and in which we have had prolonged debate, but \nit is nonetheless a very, very significant issue that is affecting the \neconomic well-being of thousands of businesses across America. So I am \nglad to be able to introduce this today with 14 cosponsors joining me \non S. 328.\n  Salting is the calculated practice of placing trained union \nprofessional organizers and agents in a nonunion workplace whose sole \npurpose is to harass or disrupt company operations, apply economic \npressure, increase operating and legal costs, and ultimately the \npurpose of putting that company out of business. The objectives of \nthese union agents are accomplished through filing frivolous and unfair \nlabor practice complaints or discrimination charges against the \nemployer with the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], and the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC]. Salting campaigns have been \nused successfully to cause economic harm to construction companies and \nare quickly expanding into other industries across the country as well.\n  To my colleagues I would say, Mr. President, the average cost to the \nemployer to defend himself or defend herself against this practice runs \nupwards of $5,000 per case.\n  Salting is not merely a union organizing tool. It has become an \ninstrument of economic destruction aimed at nonunion companies. This is \nwhat happens. Unions send their agents into nonunion workplaces under \nthe guise of seeking employment. Hiding behind the shield of the \nNational Labor Relations Act, these salts use its provisions \noffensively to bring hardship on their employers. They deliberately \nincrease the operating costs of their employers through actions such as \nsabotage and frivolous discrimination complaints.\n  In the 1995 Town & Country decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \npaid union organizers are employees within the meaning of the National \nLabor Relations Act. Because of their broad interpretation of this act, \nemployers who\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nrefuse to hire paid union employees or their agents violate the act if \nthey are shown to have discriminated against the union salts.\n\n  This leaves employers in a precarious and vulnerable situation. If \nemployers refuse to hire union salts, they will file frivolous charges \nand accuse the employer of discrimination. Yet if salts are employed, \nthey will create internal disruption through a pattern of dissension \nand harassment. They are not there to work--only to disrupt. For many \nsmall businesses this means that whenever hiring decisions are made, \nthe future of the company may actually be at stake. A wrong decision \ncan mean frivolous charges, legal fees, and lost time, which may \nthreaten the very existence of their business.\n  I have received many accounts from across the Nation of how salting \nis affecting small businesses. In Carmel, IN, John Gaylor, of Gaylor \nElectric, is a favorite target of the local International Brotherhood \nof Electrical Workers. Mr. Gaylor has to budget almost $200,000 \nannually to defend himself against frivolous charges. In fact, Gaylor \nhas been forced to defend himself against at least 80 unfair labor \npractice complaints. However, in each case the charges against him were \ndismissed as frivolous. Nonetheless, he is bound to pay hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to attorneys to defend himself.\n  In a classic example of salting tactics, Gaylor had to fire one \nemployee after his refusal to wear his hardhat on his head. This \nemployee would strap the hardhat to his knee and then dare Gaylor, his \nboss, to fire him because he said the employee manual stated only that \nhe had to wear the hardhat, it did not state where he had to wear it.\n  Another common salting practice is for salts to actually create \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] violations and \nthen report those violations to OSHA. When the employer terminates \nthese individuals, they file frivolous unfair labor practice violations \nagainst the employer. This results in wasted time and money, as well as \nbad publicity for the company.\n  These are just a few of the many examples of how devastating this \npractice can be to small businesses. What makes this practice even more \nappalling is how organized labor openly advocates its use. According to \nthe group, ``Workplaces against Salting Abuse,'' the labor unions are \neven advocating this practice in their manuals.\n  The Union Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers explains why salts are used. Their purpose is to \ngather information that will\n\n       * * * shape the strategy the organizer will use later in \n     the campaign to threaten or actually apply the economic \n     pressure necessary to cause the employer to * * * raise his \n     prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business, \n     leave the union's jurisdiction, go out of business, * * *\n\n  The International Vice President of the United Food and Commercial \nWorkers Union has been quoted as saying that:\n\n       If we can't organize them, the best thing to do is erode \n     their business as much as possible.\n\n  That is what we are facing. The balance of rights must be restored \nbetween employers, employees, and labor organizations. The Truth in \nEmployment Act seeks to do this by inserting a provision in the \nNational Labor Relations Act establishing that an employer is not \nrequired to employ a person seeking employment for the primary purpose \nof furthering the objectives of an organization other than that \nemployer. Furthermore, this legislation will continue to allow \nemployees to organize and engage in activities designed to be protected \nby the National Labor Relations Act.\n  This measure is not intended to undermine those legitimate rights or \nprotections that employees have had. Employers will gain no ability to \ndiscriminate against union membership or activities. This bill only \nseeks to stop the destructive practice of salting. Salting abuses must \nbe curtailed if we are to protect the small business owners of this \nNation. This legislation will ensure these protections are possible.\n  I am glad that Senator Nickles, Senator Warner, Senator Mack, Senator \nKyl, Senator Brownback, Senator Cochran, Senator Roberts, Senator \nHatch, Senator Gorton, Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, Senator Allard, \nSenator Sessions, Senator Faircloth, and the majority leader, Senator \nLott, have joined as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  It is for these reasons I am introducing the Truth in Employment Act. \nI ask more of my colleagues to support this bill and restore fairness \nto the American workplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Employment Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management \n     relationships is essential to a productive workplace and a \n     healthy economy.\n       (2) The tactic of using professional union organizers and \n     agents to infiltrate a targeted employer's workplace (a \n     practice commonly referred to as ``salting'') has evolved \n     into an aggressive form of harassment not contemplated when \n     the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) was \n     enacted and threatens the balance of rights that is \n     fundamental to the collective bargaining system of the United \n     States.\n       (3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment \n     with nonunion employers not because of a desire to work for \n     such employers but primarily to organize the employees of \n     such employers or to inflict economic harm specifically \n     designed to put nonunion competitors out of business.\n       (4) While no employer may discriminate against employees \n     based upon the views of the employees concerning collective \n     bargaining, an employer should have the right to expect job \n     applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing the skills \n     of the applicants to further the goals of the business of the \n     employer.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \n     employees, and labor organizations that is fundamental to a \n     system of collective bargaining;\n       (2) to preserve the rights of employees to organize, or \n     otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under the \n     National Labor Relations Act; and\n       (3) to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals \n     who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace \n     of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed \n     to put the employer out of business.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following flush \n     sentence:\n\n     ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring \n     an employer to employ any person who seeks or has sought \n     employment with the employer in furtherance of the objectives \n     of an organization other than the employer.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 329. A bill to provide that pay for Members of Congress shall be \nreduced whenever total expenditures of the Federal Government exceed \ntotal receipts in any fiscal year, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto reduce the salaries of Members of Congress by 10 percent for every \nyear that the budget remains out of balance or Congress fails to enact \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Since the Senate is \ncurrently debating a balanced budget to the Constitution, I think it is \nan appropriate time to renew this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Federal budget has been out of balance since 1969. \nIf you exclude trust fund surpluses--as some argue we should--then the \nFederal Government has not had a surplus since the Kennedy \nadministration. Since that time, the on-budget deficit has risen from \n$4 billion in 1961 to $26 billion in 1971, $74 billion in 1981, and \n$321 billion in 1991. According to the CBO, despite recent \nimprovements, the deficit will continue to be a problem--over $200 \nbillion per year out into the future.\n  Uninterrupted deficits mean rising debt and debt service costs. The \ngross debt right now is over $5 trillion. By 2002, it will be over $6 \ntrillion. At that time, as we all have been warned, interest payments \non the debt will be the largest single portion of the Federal budget. A \nchild born today faces close to $200,000 in extra taxes over his/her \nlifetime just to pay interest on the Federal debt.\n  In other words, Mr. President, after 35 years of uninterrupted \npresence, I\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nthink we can call the Federal deficit an institution here in Washington \nand admit that there's an institutional bias toward operating in the \nred. The legislation I am reintroducing today would create an \ninstitutional bias in the other direction--toward balance.\n  Specifically, the bill provides that the salary of Members of \nCongress be reduced by 10 percent whenever the Federal Government is \nunable to balance the budget at the close of a fiscal year. It further \nprovides that such a reduced salary level remain in effect until the \nGovernment is successful in achieving a balanced budget. The bill's \nrequirements would sunset, however, upon passage of a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment by both Houses of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is a fundamental responsibility of \nGovernment to live within its means. Yet, Members of Congress find it \ntempting to spend more money than they are willing to take from \ntaxpayers. On the one hand, they reap the benefits by pleasing their \nconstituents. On the other hand, they avoid displeasing the taxpayers \nwho have to foot the bill. In the end, it is future generations of \ntaxpayers who will pick up the tab.\n  Last Congress, we came close to reversing this destructive trend. We \ncame within one vote of adopting a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and we came within one Presidential veto of instituting a \nplan to reduce spending, cut taxes, and balance the budget by the year \n2002. As we all know, however, close does not count, and the debt we \nimpose upon our children continues to rise.\n  For that reason, I will continue to fight for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment and I will continue to work as a member of the \nBudget Committee to enact a balanced budget plan. Until either of these \ninitiatives is adopted, however, I will continue to propose holding \nMembers collectively responsible for year-end deficits by reducing \ntheir pay.\n  Mr. President, as I said last year, the Congressional Fiscal Policy \nAct of 1997 is not a panacea for our current fiscal problems. However, \nuntil such time as a balanced budget amendment is placed into the \nConstitution, it would effect a small but potentially important step \ntoward more responsible Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Conrad, \n         Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Daschle):\n\n  S. 331. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide a \nminimum allocation of highway funds for States that have low population \ndensities and comprise large geographic areas; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \npiece of legislation on behalf of myself, Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Conrad, Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, Senator \nThomas, and Senator Daschle.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks I will send a copy of the bill and \nthe statement to the desk.\n  Mr. President, we will have in this Congress a lot of debates about a \nlot of issues. One of them that will be very interesting and have great \nconsequence will be the issue of reauthorizing the highway bill. And \nthe question of how much money is available to which States and under \nwhat conditions will the money be available to build, to construct, and \nto maintain highways, roads, and bridges across our country. And to \nsome that may seem like kind of a dull uninteresting subject. But the \ndevelopment, the building, and the maintenance of highways and bridges \nis critically important to regions of our country. It determines where \npeople live, and where people can travel. It determines economic \ndevelopment, jobs and opportunity.\n  I come from a rural State. I recognize that there will be a formula \nfight, as there always is--a formula fight about how to apportion the \nhighway dollars, and who gets what. I do not intend to take sides \nbetween one big State and another big State. But I come from a State \nthat is rather large in geography but small in population simply to say \nthat when all of the fighting is over we want to make certain that \nStates like North Dakota and others, where you have large expanses of \nterritory and relatively few people living in those States, are not \nleft out of this process.\n  Some may not understand the frame of reference to a North Dakota. Let \nme describe it, if I might, as I begin talking about this bill.\n  I come from southwestern North Dakota, a town of 300 people, and \ngraduated from a high school class of 9. The county I come from is \ncalled Hettinger County. The county next to Hettinger is Slope County, \na wonderful territory. Southwestern North Dakota is ranching country \nwith wonderful people. Slope County has fewer than 1,000 people. It is \na land mass the size the State of Rhode Island. Slope County is the \nsize of the State of Rhode Island but has fewer than 1,000 people.\n  There were a lot of births in Slope County last year. There were \n7,900 calves born. There were 2,500 pigs born. There were about 1,500 \nlambs born. And there were seven children born in Slope County; seven \nchildren born in Slope County, a land expanse the size of the State of \nRhode Island.\n  I have said--and I do it just I guess because it is obvious--that \nthere is not a lot of childbearing going on in the Medicare years. The \nfact is that the average age of the population in counties like Slope \nCounty, a rural county, is increasing, and there just are not a lot of \nchildren born in those counties. In North Dakota, we have 11 counties \nthat are growing and 42 counties that are shrinking. Slope County is an \nexample of that.\n  I mention all of this to you for one reason. Roads are important. How \nhard do you think it is to support road building or road maintenance in \na county that size with so few people? I can say the same thing about \nHettinger County not only in North Dakota, but in South Dakota, New \nMexico, Wyoming, Montana, and other States as well. It is very hard \nwith a small population base and a lot of miles of road to support them \nwith our current circumstance.\n  As we have a fight about highway funding here in the Congress--and \nthe fight is a big-stakes fight over billions and tens of billions of \ndollars to be sliced up and divided between 50 States, and the big \nStates have an enormous amount of money at stake, New York, Florida, \nCalifornia, and others--an enormous amount of money is at stake for \nthese States. I am going to be someone who helps move this along by \nsaying that I think highway building, highway maintenance, highway \nconstruction, and bridge repair is very important for our country's \nfuture. We must rebuild our country's infrastructure. We must pay \nattention to these kinds of things. All you have to do is go to some \nless-developed country and drive the first mile and understand how \nimportant infrastructure is and what we have here versus what they have \nin many other areas of the world.\n  But much of our infrastructure is in trouble, and we must reauthorize \na highway funding bill that gives us the resources across this country \nto rebuild our infrastructure.\n  How do we divide up the money? Well, that then becomes part of this \nformula fight. How much does one State get versus another?\n  There are about eight States in this country where you have a large \nland mass, and only a few people. That makes it very difficult for the \nfew people living in those States to maintain the network of highways \nnecessary. Why is it necessary? It is necessary for the country. It is \nnecessary for an entire transportation system.\n  You can imagine perhaps President Eisenhower sitting at the White \nHouse probably having Speaker Rayburn down to talk about his idea of an \nInterstate Highway System across our country connecting various parts \nof our country. And, if someone in that meeting when they talked about \nbuilding an interstate highway program had said, ``Well, gee, how could \nyou conceivably support building a four-lane, expensive interstate \nhighway that goes among other places from Fargo, ND, in the east and \nexits at Beach, ND, in the west as it enters Montana, for the number of \npeople it serves in North Dakota, how on Earth could this country \njustify that investment in the interstate highway program?'' the answer \nwas simple. It was a national program. And the fact that you build a \nhighway across a State with low populations such as North Dakota means \nthat frozen fish and fresh fruit move from Boston to Seattle, not \nacross gravel roads\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nin the center of the country because there are only a few people living \nthere, but across an interstate highway system that is part of a \nnational network of highways and roads that are important for our \nentire country. That is the purpose of all of it this.\n  Those of us that come from the less-densely populated States drive a \nlot. Gas taxes mean a lot to us. The price of gasoline means a lot to \nus. In North Dakota, for example, we drive exactly twice as much per \nperson as they do in New York.\n  Why? Well, if you are going to go someplace in North Dakota, it is \nnot two blocks to the hospital. It might be 50 miles to the hospital. \nIt might not be a block and a half to a movie. It might be 10 miles or \n15 miles from the farmstead to the small town with a theater.\n  The fact is we drive just almost exactly twice as much in North \nDakota per person as they do in New York City. Therefore, per person we \npay twice as much in highway taxes as they do, for example, in New York \nCity or the State of New York. Is that unfair, unfortunate? Probably \nunfortunate. We do not like that necessarily, but we choose where we \nlive.\n  The point I am making with that is that in terms of burden, we have a \nvery substantial burden with respect to highway taxes. Our burden is \nmuch higher than the burden per person in other States.\n  The contribution to the Federal highway trust fund in terms of gas \ntaxes by the average North Dakotan is $116 a year; the average Florida \nresident, $73; Massachusetts, $61; Rhode Island, $55, and the list goes \ndown. We are fourth from the top in per person contribution to the \nFederal highway trust fund.\n  Some will come to this floor in all of this fight about money and \nthey will say, well, there are donor States and donee States, and the \ndonor States are the ones that pay more into the highway trust fund \nthan they get back and that ought to change; it is unfair. The donee \nStates are the recipient States and they are the ones that get more \nback than they paid in and they ought not to.\n  That is one way of looking at it. I suppose if you want to look at \nthat in the context of funding the Coast Guard, we do not have any \ncoast to guard up in North Dakota so whatever our taxpayers in North \nDakota are paying into the Federal Government for the purpose of \nrunning a Coast Guard, I suppose we are a donor State. We are a donor \nState for the Coast Guard. But so what. That is not the way you ought \nto measure this, nor should you measure it that way from a highway \nfunding standpoint. Measure it in terms of what citizens are having to \ncontribute to the highway trust funds relative to the amount of driving \nthey are doing and the amount of tax they are having to pay, and what \nyou will see is a State such as North Dakota is right near the top.\n  A group of us who come from States similarly situated, States with \nvery large expanses of land and not as many people, and therefore not \nhaving the tax base to raise the funds necessary to meet the needs of \nroad maintenance and road building and bridge making, and so on, want \nto be a part of this debate on the reauthorization of ISTEA or the \nhighway reauthorization bill in a manner that says the following. We \nwant at the end of this discussion for these eight States that are \nsituated in this manner not to be a part of the juggling between the \nformula fights that will go on on this floor from time to time this \nyear on highway funding, but instead to be a part of a solution that \nsays with respect to those States with unique circumstances, we will \nprovide a guarantee that those States will receive what they have \nreceived in the past in terms of the percentage of the highway funds \nthat have gone to these eight States with large expanses of land, many \nmiles of highway to maintain and a lower population base, and in \naddition to that we will have a highway preservation fund of 1 \npercent--1 percent out of 100 percent of the money that is available--\nto be put in a pool to be distributed back to those eight States on a \nneed basis to preserve those highways, roads and bridges, build and \nmaintain and preserve that infrastructure in those eight States that \nface this unique challenge and face these unique circumstances.\n  That is all we say in this legislation--two things. One, North \nDakota's share, for example, of the current formula is about .62 of 1 \npercent. North Dakota and the other seven States would be guaranteed \nthat allocation at the end of the reauthorization bill for the coming \nyears, plus we would be the recipients on a need basis of a pool equal \nto 1 percent of the highway fund that would then be reallocated on a \nneed basis to the eight States that face these special and unique \nchallenges.\n  There are a number of us, 16 Senators specifically that come from \nthese 8 States, who have already cosponsored this legislation. I hope \nothers will. And when we do, I hope we will be able to make a case to \nthe rest of the Congress that we want to be helpful to others. We want \nto be helpful to all of those who believe there ought to be a robust \nhighway funding program, that funding for it ought to be certain, that \nfunding for it ought to be adequate to meet the needs in this country \nand we are prepared to support that. But that when the larger formula \nfights are completed, those eight States, uniquely situated, the eight \nStates which include North Dakota, situated in a circumstance where \ntheir population base does not allow them to raise the resources to \nmeet their infrastructure and transportation needs, they will be dealt \nwith in a fair and equitable way. That is what our legislation does. It \nis what it would provide. And we hope that when this is over at the end \nof this Congress, we will look back and say we did something that was \nimportant for our States.\n  I want to mention one additional point. Some say let us not have a \nFederal highway program anymore. Let us abolish the Federal gas tax, \nand then say to the States, you go ahead and raise your own money. All \nthat I have been discussing so far describes the unique problem we have \nraising our own money with a large road network to deal with and a \nsmaller population base. If we were required under a program like that, \na devolution of the highway program, saying we will not have a Federal \nprogram, let us let the States do it, and therefore a State like North \nDakota, we were told, you go ahead and raise this yourself, just to \nmeet the current revenue stream we now have from the Federal highway \nprogram in North Dakota, we would be required to raise the current \nState gas tax by 27 cents per gallon simply to replace the revenue the \nState currently receives. Other States would not fare the same way. \nOther States would be able to decide they could raise their gas tax at \nthe State level by a very small amount of money.\n\n  For example, Florida would have to raise their State gas tax 11 cents \nto raise the amount of money they now have under their road program. So \nwhen you take a look at the impact and the burden on taxpayers here, \nthat approach, the devolution approach, saying let us not have a \nFederal highway program, let us tell the States raise your own money by \nyour own gas tax, would say to Florida, you raise your gas tax by 11 \ncents, and would say to North Dakota, you raise yours by 27 cents.\n  That is the inequity of it. That moves us away from the notion that \nhighways represent a national need, that transportation is a national \nsystem and is part of a unifying force in this country that we have \nalways felt should work to meet our country's universal needs, and that \nincludes especially the area of transportation.\n  Mr. President, this year the Congress will be debating the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA]. Some have focused the debate around the question of the ratio \nbetween how much States receive in highway funding related to what they \npay in. However, framing the debate around the donor verses donee State \nconcept fails to address the real issues in the reauthorization of \nISTEA: that is, how do we allocate resources to maintain a national \ntransportation system and ensure that all States have the necessary \nresources to participate in that system. If the heavily populated \nStates want to ship their frozen fish and fresh fruit from coast to \ncoast in trucking convoys, they don't want to be shipping it on gravel \nroads in parts of the country where the local tax base is not \nsufficient to maintain a national network of good roads. It is in the \ninterest of all Americans to have a national network. That is why the\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\ndonor verses donee formula fights are so counterproductive.\n  If we are interested in maintaining a national transportation system, \nthe question should be how do we allocate resources to meet all the \nNation's highway needs. This includes meeting the unique needs of rural \nStates with low-density populations and large geographic areas. If \nthere is a national need, there's a national responsibility and we \nought not to have formula fights in ways that hurt small population \nStates with large networks of highways to maintain.\n  I am not a bit uncomfortable that North Dakota receives more money \nback in highway funding than it sends into the highway trust fund \nthrough gas taxes. In fact, if measured on a per capita basis, North \nDakota is actually one of the highest contributors to the Federal \nhighway trust fund. Some of the so-called ``donor States'' contribute \nhas as much in gas taxes per capita than many of the ``donee States'' \ncontribute. That happens because we have a small population and are \nrequired to maintain a large highway system on a small local tax base. \nWithout a Federal program to make up for scarce local resources in low-\ndensity States, we could not have a national network of highways.\n  Those who frame the debate as one between donor or donee States beg \nthe question as to why does this notion only apply to highway funding. \nShould we treat all transportation programs the same way? Why single \nout only highway funding? Why not apply the same ``return to the \nstates'' approach for mass transit, disaster relief for hurricanes and \nearthquakes, or the Airport Improvement Program? Should the same \nprinciple be applied to funding the Coast Guard and the Maritime \nAdministration whose services are almost entirely used by coastal \nStates? We don't have much of a Coast Guard in North Dakota, but our \ntaxpayers still help pay for it. Thus, North Dakota is a donor State \nwhen it comes to these programs. Why should landlocked States support \nthese programs?\n\n  The reason is simple--we have a national economy, not a State-by-\nState economy. If such approach were adopted, it would represent a \ndramatic abandonment from the basic principle that has been vital to \nour national economic and social well being: a quality national \ntransportation system. And that is why the debate about the \nreauthorization of ISTEA must meet the unique needs of rural States.\n  A network of efficient and well-maintained roads in rural areas is \njust as important to densely population urban centers that export \nproducts across the country as the roads are to middle America.\n  We need a national transportation system that reflects a commitment \nto all regions of the Nation as the principle priority. To do this, \nhighway funding formulas must provide for the unique needs of every \nregion. Currently, the needs of States with small populations but that \nmaintain highways for large geographic areas are not reflected under \nISTEA formulas and this ought to be changed. ISTEA formulas need to \nreflect the needs of the national system and the unique circumstances \nof various geographic regions. While major urban areas need support for \nrelieving congestion and heavy traffic loads, rural States with low \npopulations need additional assistance to maintain long stretches of \nroads with smaller local tax bases.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to ensure that rural \nStates with low-density populations and large geographic land areas get \nan adequate share of Federal support under the Federal Aid to Highways \nProgram. There are two major provisions under this legislation. First, \nlow-density States with large geographic land areas will be held \nharmless under the same percentage distribution of total highway funds \nas they received under ISTEA. In addition, these same States would \nqualify for a rural State adjustment, which would be established by \nsetting aside 1 percent of the total highway program for rural States. \nThese funds would be distributed by a formula that takes into account \nthe number of National Highway System [NHS] miles of road in a \nqualifying State and the number of NHS vehicle miles traveled in that \nState. Certainly, this legislation does not resolve the matter as to \nhow Federal highway funds will be distributed to all States. Rather, \nthis bill only focuses on one aspect of the picture--that is, it \nemphasizes the unique circumstances of a small number of States that \nought to have their needs recognized in the final formula.\n  Those of us from rural States are not suggesting that all we care \nabout is meeting our unique needs. Much to the contrary. We desire to \nwork cooperatively with all our colleagues to develop a strong and \neffective highway bill that meets the needs of all regions. Our \nobjective is to have a fair formula that ensures that our Nation \nmaintains a truly national system. To that end, we pledge our good \nfaith and determination to develop the best reauthorization of ISTEA \npossible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kempthorne, Senator Conrad, and \nI in supporting this legislation. It is our hope that the Congress will \nsucceed this year in passing a strong reauthorization of ISTEA and \nhopefully, that legislation will reflect the concerns raised in the \nbill we are introducing today.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sending the legislation to the desk, and I \nhope in the coming week or so to add cosponsors to the legislation. I \nhope when the debate occurs on the reauthorization of the highway \nprogram, the ideas embodied in this bipartisan piece of legislation \nwill be ideas that we will see incorporated in the final legislation \npassed by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural States Highway \n     Preservation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a national surface transportation system that includes \n     a national network of highways and that provides for \n     efficient and safe interstate travel in every State is vital \n     to the economic and social wellbeing of the United States;\n       (2) Federal policy for allocating resources to maintain an \n     efficient and safe national surface transportation system \n     should reflect the unique needs and circumstances of each \n     State's ability to participate in the transportation system;\n       (3) low-density States that comprise large geographic land \n     areas--\n       (A) bear unique financial burdens in maintaining their \n     share of the national surface transportation system; and\n       (B) typically support higher per-mile costs of maintaining \n     highways and contribute more per capita to the Highway Trust \n     Fund than other States;\n       (4) many rural States have to maintain large highway \n     systems, which provide interstate access between major \n     population centers, but have small local populations to \n     support their highways;\n       (5) since the approval and implementation of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement, many rural States along the \n     northern border of the United States have experienced \n     increased use of, and demands on, their share of the national \n     surface transportation system due to increased international \n     trade activities;\n       (6) Federal funding for surface transportation should \n     include adjustments that reflect reasonable and appropriate \n     resource allocations to ensure that rural, low-density States \n     that comprise large geographic land areas can adequately \n     participate in the national surface transportation system; \n     and\n       (7) contributions from all States permit the Federal \n     Government to provide support for essential intermodal \n     national priorities, such as a national system of highways, \n     mass transit, maritime activities, airports and air service, \n     and passenger rail service.\n\n     SEC. 3. MINIMUM HIGHWAY FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES \n                   OF STATES.\n\n       Section 157(a)(4) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``In fiscal'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--In fiscal''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Low-density, large-geographic-area states.--\n       ``(i) Definition of eligible state.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term `eligible State' means a State that--\n\n       ``(I) has a population density of less than 20 individuals \n     per square mile; and\n       ``(II) comprises a land area of 10,000 square miles or \n     more.\n\n       ``(ii) Historical apportionments.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, for fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal \n     year thereafter, the Secretary shall increase the amount of \n     funds that, but for this clause, would be apportioned to an \n     eligible State\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\n     under section 104(b)(3) so that each eligible State receives \n     not less of the apportioned and allocated funds described in \n     section 1015(a)(1) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (23 U.S.C. 104 note; 105 Stat. 1943) \n     (as in effect on October 1, 1996) than the percentage listed \n     for the State in section 1015(a)(2) of that Act (as in effect \n     on October 1, 1996).\n       ``(iii) Set-aside.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, on October 1 of fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall--\n\n       ``(I) before making any funds available out of the Highway \n     Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for the \n     fiscal year, set aside from the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the \n     Mass Transit Account) for the fiscal year an amount equal to \n     1 percent of the funds that were made available out of the \n     Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account) for \n     the preceding fiscal year;\n       ``(II) after making any increase for an eligible State \n     necessary to carry out clause (ii), allocate 50 percent of \n     the amount set aside under subclause (I) among eligible \n     States in the ratio that--\n\n       ``(aa) the number of miles of highways on the National \n     Highway System in the eligible State; bears to\n       ``(bb) the number of miles of highways on the National \n     Highway System in all eligible States; and\n\n       ``(III) after making any increase for an eligible State \n     necessary to carry out clause (ii), allocate 50 percent of \n     the amount set aside under subclause (I) among eligible \n     States in the ratio that--\n\n       ``(aa) the number of vehicle miles traveled on the National \n     Highway System in the eligible State during the latest 1-\n     year-period for which data are available; bears to\n       ``(bb) the number of vehicle miles traveled on the National \n     Highway System in all eligible States during the latest 1-\n     year-period for which data are available.''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I might say to my friend from North Dakota \nthat he raises a most important issue, and it is obviously one that we \nare going to have a tremendous tug-of-war on around here. It is my \nhope, representing a State with very old infrastructure and with \nenormous public works projects, a very large population in an urban \narea, that as we approach this we are not going to get dragged into a \nfractionalized, regionalized, State-versus-State, haves-versus-have-\nnots issue. But, rather, that we are going to think this through in \nterms of the overall needs of the Nation which he has appropriately \naddressed with respect to his State and his region. I think the key \nhere is to make sure we come out with an adequate amount of \ninfrastructure investment for the country as a whole and with an \nappropriate division of that. I certainly intend to work with him and \nothers, but I think we need to guarantee that.\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the \nRural States Highway Preservation Act. This is an act that would ensure \nfairness in the distribution of funds from the Highway Trust Fund. But \nmore importantly, Mr. President, this bill ensures that we continue our \ncommitment to maintain a national transportation system, that in doing \nso, we meet all the Nation's transportation needs and, just as \nimportantly, the unique needs of our States that have small populations \nand very large geographic areas, States such as New Mexico, North \nDakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Alaska, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming.\n  My home State of New Mexico has only 14 people per square mile and \nits total land area is 121,335 square miles. Residents of large, rural \nStates like New Mexico pay more per person in gas taxes because of the \nlong driving distances. It is not uncommon for New Mexicans to travel \n50 or more miles to their nearest large town or country seat, where \nthey have to go to get essential supplies, health care, school, or \ninteract with their government. To maintain this infrastructure, New \nMexicans currently pay one of the highest per capita State taxes to \nmaintain the same highways used by interstate trucks or the tourists \nwho visit our beautiful State. Under any eventual ISTEA reauthorization \nthat does not address these unique characteristics, New Mexico and \nsimilar States would lose highway funding that it could never recover. \nUnder devolution, for example, New Mexico would have to impose at least \na 17.8-cent gas tax just to generate the same revenue as it received \nfrom the Highway Trust Fund in 1995. Such a proposal would be \ndevastating not only for our residents, but for the many trucks that \ncross our State, and for the increasing traffic between Mexico and the \nUnited States. Such a proposal would impair new Mexico's highways, but \nbecause we are but one part of a national transportation system, it \nwould impair our national system.\n  The Rural States Highway Preservation Act would ensure that \ntransportation funds that will be distributed under a reauthorized \nISTEA will be done fairly, with consideration to the uniqueness of \nStates with low population density and high geographic area, and with \nour national transportation needs as a priority.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 332. A bill to prohibit the importation of goods produced abroad \nwith child labor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE CHILD LABOR DETERRENCE ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Child Labor \nDeterrence Act of 1997. The bill I am introducing today prohibits the \nimportation of any product made, whole or in part, by children under \nthe age of 15 who are employed in manufacturing or mining. This is the \nfourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this \nbill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law.\n  Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization [ILO] \nreleased a very grim report about the number of children who toil away \nin abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over 200 million \nchildren worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving \na basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at \nthe age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and \noften forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay.\n  Child labor is most prevalent in countries with high unemployment \nrates. According to the ILO, some 61 percent of child workers, nearly \n153 million children, are found in Asia; 32 percent, or 80 million, are \nin Africa and 7 percent, or 17.5 million, live in Latin America. Adult \nunemployment rates in some nations runs over 20 percent. In Latin \nAmerica, for example, about 1 in every 10 children are workers. \nFurthermore, in many nations where child labor is prevalent, more money \nis spent and allocated for military expenditures than for education and \nhealth services.\n  The situation is as deplorable as it is enormous. In many developing \ncountries children represent a substantial part of the work force and \ncan be found in such industries as rugs, toys, textiles, mining, and \nsports equipment manufacturing.\n  For instance, it is estimated that 65 percent of the wearing apparel \nthat Americans purchase is assembled or manufactured abroad, therefore, \nincreasing the chance that these items were made by abusive and \nexploitative child labor. In the rug industry, Indian and Pakistan \nproduce 95 percent of their rugs for export. Some of the worst abuses \nof child labor have been documented in these countries, including \nbonded and slave labor.\n  Venezuela and Colombia exported $6,084,705 and $1,385,669 worth of \nmined products respectively to the United States in 1995. Both were \ndocumented by the Department of Labor as using child labor in mining. \nMining hazards for children include exposure to harmful dusts, gases, \nand fumes that cause respiratory diseases that can develop into \nsilicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis and emphysema after some \nyears of exposure. Child miners also suffer from physical strain, \nfatigue and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as serious injuries from \nfalling objects.\n  Children may also be crippled physically by being forced to work too \nearly in life. For example, a large scale ILO survey in the Philippines \nfound that more than 60 percent of working children were exposed to \nchemical and biological hazards, and that 40 percent experienced \nserious injuries or illnesses.\n  These practices are often underground, but the ILO report points out \nthat children are still being sold outright for a sum of money. Other \ntimes, landlords buy child workers from their tenants, or labor \ncontractors pay rural families in advance in order to take their \nchildren away to work in carpet weaving, glass manufacturing or \nprostitution. Child slavery of this type has long been reported in \nSouth Asia,\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nSouth East Asia and West Africa, despite vigorous official denial of \nits existence.\n  Additionally, children are increasingly being bought and sold across \nnational borders by organized networks. The ILO report states that at \nleast five such international networks trafficking in children exist: \nfrom Latin America to Europe and the Middle East; from South and South \nEast Asia to northern Europe and the Middle East; a European regional \nmarket; an associated Arab regional market; and, a West Africa export \nmarket in girls.\n  In Pakistan, the ILO reported in 1991 that an estimated half of the \n50,000 children working as bonded labor in Pakistan's carpet-weaving \nindustry will never reach the age of 12--victims of disease and \nmalnutrition.\n  I have press reports from India of children freed from virtual \nslavery in the carpet factories of northern India. Twelve-year-old \nCharitra Chowdhary recounted his story--he said, ``If we moved slowly \nwe were beaten on our backs with a stick. We wanted to run away but the \ndoors were always locked.''\n  Mr. President, that's what this bill is about, children, whose dreams \nand childhood are being sold for a pittance--to factory owners and in \nmarkets around the globe.\n  It is about protecting children around the globe and their future. It \nis about eliminating a major form of child abuse in our world. It is \nabout breaking the cycle of poverty by getting these kids out of \nfactories and into schools. It is about raising the standard of living \nin the Third World so we can compete on the quality of goods instead of \nthe misery and suffering of those who make them. It is about assisting \nThird World governments to enforce their laws by ending the role of the \nUnited States in providing a lucrative market for goods made by abusive \nand exploitative child labor and encouraging other nations to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, unless the economic exploitation of children is \neliminated, the potential and creative capacity of future generations \nwill forever be lost to the factory floor.\n  Mr. President, the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1997 is intended to \nstrengthen existing U.S. trade laws and help Third World countries \nenforce their child labor laws. The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of \nLabor to compile and maintain a list of foreign industries and their \nrespective host countries that use child labor in the production of \nexports to the United States. Once the Secretary of Labor identifies a \nforeign industry, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to \nprohibit the importation of a product from an identified industry. The \nentry ban would not apply if a U.S. importer signs a certificate of \norigin affirming that they took reasonable steps to ensure that \nproducts imported from identified industries are not made by child \nlabor. In addition, the President is urged to seek an agreement with \nother governments to secure an international ban on trade in the \nproducts of child labor. Further, any company or individual who would \nintentionally violate the law would face both civil and criminal \npenalties.\n  This legislation is not about imposing our standards on the \ndeveloping world. It's about preventing those manufacturers in the \ndeveloping world who exploit child labor from imposing their standards \non the United States. They are forewarned. If manufacturers and \nimporters insist on investing in child labor, instead of investing in \nthe future of children, I will work to assure that their products are \nbarred from entering the United States.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I first introduced this bill 4 years \nago, it is time to end this human tragedy and our participation in it. \nIt is time for greater government and corporate responsibility. No \nlonger can officials in the Third World or U.S. importers turn a blind \neye to the suffering and misery of the world's children. No longer do \nAmerican consumers want to provide a market for goods produced by the \nsweat and toil of children. By providing a market for goods produced by \nchild labor, U.S. importers have become part of the problem by \nperpetuating the impoverishment of poor families. Through this \nlegislation, importers now have the opportunity to become part of the \nsolution by ending this abominable practice.\n  Mr. President, countries do not have to wait until poverty is \neradicated or they are fully developed before eliminating the economic \nexploitation of children. In fact, the path to development is to \neliminate child labor and increase expenditures on children such as \nprimary education. In far too many countries, governments spend \nmillions on military expenditures and fail to provide basic educational \nopportunities to its citizens. As a result, over 130 million children \nare not in primary school.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, my bill places no undue burden on U.S. \nimporters. I know of no importer, company, or department store that \nwould willingly promote the exploitation of children. I know of no \nimporter, company, or department store that would want their products \nand image tainted by having their products produced by child labor. And \nI know that no American consumer would knowingly purchase something \nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. These entities take \nreasonable steps to ensure the quality of their goods; they should also \nbe willing to take reasonable steps to ensure that their goods are not \nproduced by child labor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 333. A bill to increase the period of availability of certain \nemergency relief funds allocated under section 125 of title 23, United \nStates Code, to carry out a project to repair or reconstruct a portion \nof a Federal-aid primary route in San Mateo, CA.\n\n\n                      THE DEVIL'S SLIDE TUNNEL ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Devil's \nSlide Tunnel Act to allow previously appropriated funds to be used for \na tunnel project in San Mateo County, CA. This bill is essentially a \ntechnical change to a 1984 emergency spending bill to provide relief \nfor heavy winter storms that occurred during the winter of 1982-83. \nThese rains caused a mountain mud slide to block the use of California \nHighway 1, a key coastal highway linking San Mateo County to San \nFrancisco.\n  This section of highway has become known as Devil's Slide because it \ncrosses a sea cliff 600 feet above the Pacific Ocean surf about 12 \nmiles south of San Francisco. Perennial closures because of mud slides \nhave cut off coastal communities, particularly access to emergency \nservices during disasters as well as to local businesses. Congress \napproved the supplemental appropriations for permanent repair after \nexhaustive study, including field hearings by the House Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee.\n  The California Department of Transportation [Caltrans] made temporary \nrepairs and proposed a bypass construction. The bypass was opposed by \nenvironmental interests and construction was blocked in court for \nyears. This battle fortunately ended in November when voters \noverwhelming approved a referendum calling for construction of a mile-\nlong tunnel as a project alternative.\n  Congressman Tom Lantos has introduced legislation in the House to \ncarry out the voters' request. I am introducing an identical bill. Our \nlegislation simply amends the law to allow for previously appropriated \nfunds to be used for a project alternative and that the amount is \navailable until expended.\n  It is time that we fix this dangerous highway section that threatens \nmany people's lives and livelihoods. I urge my colleagues to join me \nand take swift action to allow the project alternative to proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Devil's Slide Tunnel Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY.\n\n       Section 6 of the Act entitled ``An Act to apportion certain \n     funds for construction of the National System of Interstate \n     and Defense Highways for fiscal year 1985 and to increase the \n     amount authorized to be expended for emergency relief under \n     title 23, United States Code, and for other purposes'', \n     approved March 9, 1984 (98 Stat. 55), is amended--\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``A \n     project''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Availability of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, sums that are allocated under section 3 for \n     any project alternative selected under this section before, \n     on, or after the date of enactment of this subsection shall \n     remain available until expended.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 334. A bill to amend section 541 of the National Housing Act with \nrespect to the partial payment of claims on health care facilities; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 partial payment of claims legislation\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that makes a \nsmall but significant change in the hospital mortgage program and the \nnursing home mortgage program administered by the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development. The Section 242 Program, as it is known, enables \nHUD to guarantee to private lenders that they will not lose money on a \nconstruction loan to a hospital. If the hospital cannot make its \npayments, HUD will assume the mortgage. The program insures loans for \nrenovation, modernization, and new construction, and also covers the \nrefinancing of existing mortgages. The Section 232 program does the \nsame for nursing home projects.\n  In August, 1995 the portfolio included 100 projects in 18 States. It \nis particularly important in New York where State regulations require \nhospitals to secure such insurance and where construction costs are \nhigh. Further, because New York is deregulating its hospitals, in the \nnext few years the hospitals need as much flexibility as possible, \nincluding the ability to refinance existing debt. The program will be \nmore important than ever.\n  Ensuring hospital mortgages may seem to be a risky venture, but this \nprogram is successful. Since 1969 it has made a net contribution to the \ngovernment of $221 million through fees it charges the hospitals, and \nin only three years has it had a negative net cash flow. The most \nrecent was 1991.\n  The bill I am offering today would strengthen the program by giving \nHUD partial payment of claims authority. Currently, if a hospital or \nnursing home cannot make a mortgage payment, HUD must assume the entire \nmortgage at considerable cost and administrative effort. Partial \npayment of claims would prevent this. If, for example, a hospital owes \na $10 million payment and only has $6 million available, HUD would \nsimply provide the $4 million shortfall. There would be no requirement \nnor necessity of assuming the mortgage.\n\n  HUD already has partial payment of claims authority in most of its \nother mortgage insurance programs, such as the multifamily housing \nprogram, and it works well. There is no reason for the Agency not to \nhave this authority in the hospital and the nursing home program, and \nin fact it makes eminent sense.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, joins me as a cosponsor of \nthis bill. I ask my other colleagues to join us in supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 334\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARTIAL PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON HEALTH CARE \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 541(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1735f-19) is amended--\n       (1) in the section heading, by adding ``and health care \n     facilities'' at the end; and\n       (2) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by inserting ``or a health care facility (including a \n     nursing home, intermediate care facility, or board and care \n     home (as those terms are defined in section 232)), a hospital \n     (as that term is defined in section 242), or a group practice \n     facility (as that term is defined in section 1106))'' after \n     ``1978''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``or for keeping the health care facility \n     operational to serve community needs,'' after ``character of \n     the project,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Ford, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Helms, Mr. Coats, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Shelby, Mr. Bond, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hutchinson, \n        Mr. Gramm, Mr. Robb, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Cleland and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 335. A bill to authorize funds for construction of highways, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              THE STEP-21 ISTEA INTEGRITY RESTORATION ACT\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenator Bob Graham and so many of my colleagues in introducing the \nSTEP-21, ISTEA Integrity Restoration Act, to reauthorize our Nation's \nsurface transportation programs.\n  The current legislation--commonly known as ISTEA--expires on \nSeptember 30 of this year. New legislation must be passed for our \nStates and local governments to receive any transportation funds on the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year on October 1.\n  Mr President, my bill presents a regionally balanced, multimodal \napproach for establishing a new transportation policy that will \nsuccessfully carry us into the 21st century.\n  STEP-21 is a 5-year authorization bill that maintains a strong \nFederal role in transportation. It responds to the mobility and \naccessibility needs of all Americans to a modern and safe \ntransportation system. It provides the resources and policies necessary \nfor our American products to compete in a global marketplace. And, we \ncontinue the guiding principles of ISTEA committed to a system that is \neconomically efficient and environmentally sound.\n  Our STEP-21 proposal is grounded in two fundamental principles--\nfunding equity and a streamlined program.\n  Already much attention has focused on the regional disparities in the \nfunding distribution formulas. But, our legislation recognizes that all \nregions of the Nation have important transportation needs. We are \ncommitted to devising a program that--for the first time--responds to \nour transportation demands using current needs information. In doing \nso, we provide a program that acknowledges that sparsely populated \nStates with large land areas or States with small populations cannot go \nit alone. We are committed to continuing a national transportation \nsystem--to provide effective connections among the States. I believe \nthe needs of these States must be addressed and we do so in our \nlegislation.\n  STEP-21 has a much broader focus than just the single issue of \nfunding distribution.\n  STEP-21 moves us beyond the advances of ISTEA with further \nstreamlining of the current bureaucratic maze of Federal programs. We \nreduce the number of program categories, thus increasing the \nflexibility permitted for our State and local partners to determine \ntheir own transportation priorities.\n  STEP-21 also continues and builds upon the many successes of ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, this legislation maintains our national focus on \nmultimodal solutions to moving people and goods efficiently.\n  We continue the flexibility of State and local decisionmakers to \ninvest their resources in nonhighway alternatives--such as transit or \ncommuter rail options.\n  We continue the important role of metropolitan planning organizations \nand their need to have an identified funding source.\n  We recognize a full and open planning process that stimulates public \nparticipation at both the State and local level will foster \ntransportation solutions that respond to larger community goals.\n  We provide a program that is environmentally sound, recognizing that \ntransportation plays an important part in our national goal to improve \nthe quality of the air we breathe. States can continue to invest in \nthose transportation choices that move people and goods without \ndegrading air quality. The enhancements program that invests in \nalternative forms of transportation--bike paths and pedestrian \nwalkways--and mitigates the impacts of past transportation choices on \nour communities quality of life will be continued.\n  In brief, STEP-21 ensures that we have a national multimodal \ntransportation policy that is ready to meet the economic demands of a \nglobal marketplace. It provides solutions to the regional disparities \nof the current program and the Federal second-guessing of State and \nlocal transportation\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nchoices. It does not retreat from the principles of ISTEA to provide \nfor an open decisionmaking process permitting States and localities to \ninvest in different modes of transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 336. A bill to convert certain excepted service positions in the \nUnited States Fire Administration to competitive service positions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  u.s. fire administration legislation\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to convert eight remaining excepted service positions at \nthe U.S. Fire Administration to competitive service status.\n  During its first few years of operation, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency used an excepted service authority provided under the \nFire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 in order to quickly staff the \nNational Fire Academy with personnel who were uniquely qualified in \nfire education.\n  In the early 1980's, after the Academy's original vacancies had been \nfilled and the Academy was up and running, it became FEMA's policy to \nfill openings at the NFA through a competitive civil service hiring \nsystem. Today, 91 of the NFA's 99 employees are under the general \nschedule with only eight employees who were hired in the 1970's and \nearly eighties remaining in excepted service status. As a result, these \nremaining eight are subject to significant limitations within the USFA. \nAlthough they each average over 17 years of Federal service and were \nhired solely because of their strong backgrounds and unique \nqualifications in fire education, they are legally barred from \ncompeting for management positions within the Fire Administration. The \nremaining eight excepted service employees are not even allowed to \nserve on details to competitive service jobs--even within their own \norganization--without an official waiver from the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  Mr. President, I am proposing to remedy this situation. The \nlegislation which I am introducing will enable the Director of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management to convert any employees appointed to the Fire \nAdministration under the Federal Fire Protection and Control Act, to \ncompetitive service--without any break in service, diminution of \nservice, reduction of cumulative years of service, or requirement to \nserve any additional probationary period with the Administration. Those \nconverted under this legislation shall also remain in the Civil Service \nRetirement System and retain their seniority. This practice is \nconsistent with other federally supported training academies. The \nCongressional Budget Office has indicated that there would be no cost \nfor this conversion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Nickles, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 337. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nrestrict assistance to foreign organizations that perform or actively \npromote abortions; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n        the foreign assistance act of 1961 amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 337\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RESTRICTION ON ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS \n                   THAT PERFORM OR ACTIVELY PROMOTE ABORTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Restriction on Assistance to Foreign Organizations \n     That Perform or Actively Promote Abortions.--\n       ``(1) Performance of abortions.--\n       ``(A) Restriction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no funds appropriated for population planning activities \n     under subsection (b) or other population assistance may be \n     made available for any foreign private, nongovernmental, or \n     multilateral organization until the organization certifies to \n     the President that it will not, during the period for which \n     the funds are made available, perform abortions in any \n     foreign country, except where the life of the mother would be \n     endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or in cases \n     of forcible rape or incest.\n       ``(B) Statutory construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) \n     may be construed to apply to the treatment of injuries or \n     illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions or to \n     assistance provided directly to the government of a country.\n       ``(2) Lobbying activities.--\n       ``(A) Restriction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no funds appropriated for population planning activities \n     under subsection (b) or other population assistance may be \n     made available for any foreign private, nongovernmental, or \n     multilateral organization until the organization certifies to \n     the President that it will not, during the period for which \n     the funds are made available, violate the laws of any foreign \n     country concerning the circumstances under which abortion is \n     permitted, regulated, or prohibited, or engage in any \n     activity or effort to alter the laws or governmental policies \n     of any foreign country concerning the circumstances under \n     which abortion is permitted, regulated, or prohibited, except \n     as provided in subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to \n     activities in opposition to coercive abortion or involuntary \n     sterilization.\n       ``(3) Application to subcontractors and subgrantees.--The \n     prohibitions of this subsection shall apply to funds made \n     available to a foreign organization either directly or as a \n     subcontractor or subgrantee, and the certifications required \n     by this subsection shall apply to activities in which the \n     organization engages either directly or through a \n     subcontractor or subgrantee.''.\n       (b) Appropriations Covered.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (a) shall apply to appropriations made before, on, \n     or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. Abraham, Mr. President: I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nHutchinson, as an original cosponsor of S. 337, his amendment to the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, will subject our nation's funding of \ninternational population control programs to appropriate restrictions, \nseeing to it that American monies are not used to promote or perform \nabortions.\n  In adopting this amendment we will continue our country's long \nestablished policy of opposing the use of our taxpayer's money to fund \ncontroversial procedures. First, this bill prohibits funding to any \nforeign organization, whether nongovernmental, multilateral or private, \nthat performs or actively promotes abortion. Second, it prohibits \norganizations receiving U.S. funds from violating any of the host \ncountry's laws concerning abortion and from engaging in efforts to \nalter the host country's abortion laws. There is an exception for \nactivities in opposition to coercive abortions or involuntary \nsterilizations. Third, this legislation extends these prohibitions to \nsubcontractors and subgrantees of foreign organizations which receive \nfunding under the population assistance program.\n  I strongly support this legislation because I believe that it will be \ninsure that U.S.-funded population planning programs are administered \nin an appropriate manner. By this I mean that they will abide by the \nguidelines Congress laid down for 10 years, under both the Reagan and \nthe Bush administrations. S. 337 will continue our established practice \nof protecting taxpayers from misuse of their funds and protecting \nunborn children around the world. It is a worthy piece of legislation. \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Helms and \n        Mr. Robb:)\n\n  S. 339. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to revise the \nrequirements for procurement of products of Federal Prison Industries \nto meet needs of Federal agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      THE FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES COMPETITION IN CONTRACTING ACT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nFederal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act. This bill, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Akaka, Helms, and Robb, would \nimplement the recommendation of the National Performance Review that we \nshould ``require [Federal Prison Industries] to compete commercially \nfor federal agencies' business'' instead of having a legally protected \nmonopoly. Our bill would ensure that the taxpayers get the best \npossible value for their Federal procurement dollars. If a Federal \nagency could get a better product at a lower\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nprice from the private sector, it would be permitted to do so--and the \ntaxpayers would get the savings.\n  Mr. President, many in both Government and industry believe that FPI \nproducts are frequently overpriced, inferior in quality, or both. For \nexample, I understand that the Veterans Administration has sought \nrepeal of FPI's mandatory preference on several occasions, on the \ngrounds that FPI pricing for textiles, furniture, and other products \nare routinely higher than identical items purchased from commercial \nsources. Most recently, VA officials estimated that the repeal of the \npreference would save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency \nalone, making that money available for veterans services.\n  Similarly, the Deputy Commander of the Defense Logistics Agency, \nwrote in a May 3, 1996, letter to Members of the House that FPI has had \na 42 percent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries, \ncompared to a 6 percent rate for commercial industry. For this record \nof poor performance, FPI has charged prices that were an average of 13 \npercent higher than commercial prices.\n  On July 30, 1996, the master chief petty officer of the Navy \ntestified before the House National Security Committee that the FPI \nmonopoly on Government furniture contracts has undermined the Navy's \nability to improve living conditions for its sailors. Master Chief \nPetty Officer John Hagan stated, and I quote:\n\n       In order to efficiently use our scarce resources, we need \n     congressional assistance in changing the Title 18 statute \n     that requires all the Services to obtain a waiver for each \n     and every furniture order not placed with the Federal Prison \n     Industry/UNICOR. * * * Speaking frankly, the FPI/UNICOR \n     product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. \n     UNICOR has, in my opinion, exploited their special status \n     instead of making changes which would make them more \n     efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need \n     your support to change the law and have FPI compete with GSA \n     furniture manufacturers. Without this change, we will not be \n     serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and \n     efficient way.\n  In the last Congress this bill was supported by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Business and \nIndustrial Furniture Manufacturers' Association, the American Apparel \nManufacturers' Association, the Industrial Fabrics Association \nInternational, and the Competition in Contracting Act Coalition. It has \nalso received support from hundreds of small businesses from Michigan \nand around the country that have seen FPI take jobs away from their \nbusinesses and give them to FPI with a guaranteed purchase--regardless \nof price and quality.\n  We all want to do what we can to ensure that we make constructive \nwork available for Federal prisoners, but the way we are doing it is \nwrong. As one small businessman in the furniture industry put it in \nemotional testimony at a House hearing last year:\n\n       Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in \n     and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who \n     was twice wounded fighting for our country and give that work \n     to criminals who have trampled on honest citizens' rights, \n     therefore effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's \n     business which the Veteran's Administration suggested he \n     enter?\n\n  At the end of the last Congress, I received a letter indicating the \nAdministration's agreement that the process by which Federal agencies \npurchase products from Federal Prison Industries needs to be reformed. \nThat letter states:\n\n       The Administration favors reform of Federal Prison \n     Industries to improve its customer service, pricing, and \n     delivery while not endangering its work program for Federal \n     inmates. * * * The Administration will present reform \n     proposals for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in \n     the next session of Congress.\n\n  With this letter, the administration has promised to join us in a \nserious reevaluation of the process by which Federal Prison Industries \nsells its products to other Federal agencies. The heart of that process \nis, of course, FPI's mandatory source status. The administration has \nmade a commitment to work with us on reforming the Federal Prison \nIndustries procurement process in this Congress, and I intend to hold \nthe administration to that commitment.\n  Mr. President, our bill would not require FPI to close any of its \nfacilities, force FPI to eliminate any jobs for Federal prisoners, or \nundermine FPI's ability to ensure that inmates are productively \noccupied. It would simply require FPI to compete for Federal contracts \non the same terms as all other Federal contractors. That is \nsimple justice to the hard-working citizens in the private sector, with \nwhom FPI would be required to compete.\n\n  Mr. President, I am a supporter of the idea of putting Federal \ninmates to work. A strong prison work program not only reduces inmate \nidleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work ethic, \nprovide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to productive \nsociety upon their release.\n  However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a \nmanner that does not unfairly eliminate the jobs of hard-working \ncitizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able to achieve \nthis result only if it diversifies its product lines and avoids the \ntemptation to build its work force by continuing to displace private \nsector jobs in its traditional lines of work. We need to have jobs for \nprisoners, but it is unfair and wasteful to allow FPI to designate \nwhose jobs it will take, and when it will take them. Competition will \nbe better for FPI, better for the taxpayer, and better for working men \nand women around the country.\n  I had hoped to get a vote on this bill last year, but the \nparliamentary situation at the end of the Congress made that \nimpossible. However, this issue is not going to go away. The issue is \ntoo important to the taxpayers, and too important to the many small \nbusinesses adversely affected by unfair competition from Federal Prison \nIndustries, to be ignored. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto make reform of the Federal Prison Industries procurement process a \nreality in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 341. A bill to establish a bipartisan commission to study and \nprovide recommendations on restoring the financial integrity of the \nMedicare Program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the national bipartisan commission on the future of medicare\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Finance, to introduce legislation establishing a National Commission \non the Future of Medicare.\n  This Medicare Commission will serve as an essential catalyst to \ncongressional action, and ultimately lead to a solution that will \npreserve and protect the Medicare Program for current beneficiaries, \ntheir children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, we have two immense challenges presented by the \nMedicare crisis. First, we have the short-term problem, the looming \ninsolvency date of 2001. Second, in the not distant future, the vast \nnumbers of baby boomers will challenge the long-term viability of \nMedicare. Congress must take action immediately on the short-term \nbankruptcy crisis, where the Commission will help us solve the longer \nterm problem.\n  I am encouraged that President Clinton has moved in our direction by \noffering in his budget package a $100 billion reduction in Medicare \nspending growth over the next 5 years. I must admit, however, that I \nwas somewhat concerned when the President, in his State of the Union \nAddress last week, devoted only one sentence to discussing his plans \nfor Medicare. And half of that sentence was devoted to expanding the \nprogram.\n  The President stated that his plan extends the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund until 2007. However, in order to achieve this, the \nPresident's budget resorts to a budgetary sleight of hand. If we truly \nare to consider taking steps to preserve and protect the Medicare \nProgram as a whole for future generations, shifting money from one \ntrust fund account to the other does nothing for its long-term health. \nIt only buys us a little extra time. Instead, we should take steps to \nextend the short-term solvency without budget accounting gimmicks.\n  Relying on a gimmick like the home health transfer has a certain \nappeal--it buys us some time by extending the short-term life of the \nMedicare hospital insurance, HI or part A, trust\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nfund which is headed for bankruptcy in 2001. Quite simply, Medicare is \nspending more than it collects from all sources of revenues. \nTransferring the majority of the outlays for home health care extends \nthe life of the HI trust fund without having to make any real \ndecisions.\n\n  Gail Wilsnsky, a well-known health economist, stated recently ``[t]he \nterms of the transfer of 480 billion of home care should be considered \ncarefully because of the precedent it sets in transferring an \nobligation into what effectively is the general revenue of the \nTreasury. Normally, when an expense is brought into part B, a portion \nof the total spending becomes part of the premium paid by the elderly \nand the expense itself is subjected to a 20 percent coinsurance charge. \nThis is not being done for the home health care transfer. While an \nargument can be made that the separation of Medicare into parts A and \nB, with two separate streams of funding is an archaic holdover from \nMedicare's inception, removing the limited cost constraints that now \nexist without reforming the entire program is very risky.''\n  The anticipated bankruptcy of the trust fund in 2001 means there will \nnot be money to pay the hospital, skilled nursing care, home health \ncare, and hospice care bills of our senior citizens and disabled \nindividuals who reply on Medicare. If we change current law, Medicare \ntrends will continue on a collision course.\n  In 1995, expenditures out of the HI trust fund exceeded all sources \nof revenues into the trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office \npredicts that in 2001 Medicare will out spend its revenues and spend \ndown its current surplus, becoming insolvent with a $4.5 billion \nshortfall. This shortfall grows rapidly to over one half trillion \ndollars--$556 billion--in 2007. And, this is before the baby-boomers \nbegin to retire in 2010.\n  In the long-term, demographic trends will continue to increase \nfinancial pressure on the trust fund, challenging its ability to \nmaintain our promise to beneficiaries. Today, there are less than 40 \nmillion Americans who qualify to receive Medicare. By the year 2010, \nthe number will be approaching 50 million, and by 2020, it will be over \n60 million. While these numbers are increasing, the number of workers \nsupporting retirees will decrease. Today, there are almost four workers \nper retiree, but in 2030 there will be only about two per retiree.\n  The supplemental medical insurance [SMI] trust fund does not have the \nsame solvency problem, as it has an unlimited claim on the U.S. \nTreasury. The SMI trust fund is financed by a monthly premium paid by \nbeneficiaries, which covers 25 percent of the cost of Medicare part B. \nThe remaining costs are paid by general revenues. The SMI trust fund is \nsolvent because the Federal Government is obligated to make up the \ndifference between beneficiary premium amounts and part B costs.\n  Spending for the SMI trust Fund is unsustainable. According to CBO, \nSMI spending is expected to increase at an annual rate of 9.1 percent \nbetween 1997 and 2007, while its premium receipts will grow by only 4.5 \npercent a year. Under current law, the percentage of costs paid from \ngeneral revenues will steadily increase. In recent testimony, Joseph \nAntos, the Assistant Director for Health and Human Resources at CBO, \ndescribed this situation precisely, ``The SMI program is no more \nfinancially sound than the HI program, in the sense that both \ncomponents of Medicare are growing more rapidly than the economy's \ncapacity to finance them.''\n\n  The Commission should also consider that since Medicare's enactment \nin 1965, there has been a great deal of change in the private health \ncare system in the United States, yet Medicare has remained \nfundamentally unchanged. Indeed, Medicare beneficiaries do not enjoy \nthe same benefits private sector plans often offer their enrollees. \nThis rigid 31-year-old program is unable to offer the private sector \nimprovements in alternative systems of delivery of care or many \ntechnological advances. If Medicare were a television, it would be a \n30-year-old, 12-inch black and white model.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today is modeled \nafter two well-known previous bipartisan, bicameral national \ncommissions.\n  First, the mission of the Commission is similar to the 1983 National \nCommission on Social Security Reform, established by President Reagan \nby Presidential Executive Order, December 16, 1981. As was the charge \nto this 1983 Blue Ribbon Commission, the Medicare Commission is \ndirected to thoroughly review Medicare and make appropriate \nrecommendations. The Medicare Commission will review and analyze the \nlong-term financial condition of both the Federal hospital insurance, \nHI or Part A, trust fund and the Federal supplementary medical \ninsurance, SMI or Part B, trust fund.\n  Second, the structure of the 15-member Medicare Commission follows \nmore closely the model established by the 1990 U.S. Bipartisan \nCommission on Comprehensive Health Care, known as the Pepper \ncommission. The Pepper commission was chaired by Senator Rockefeller \nand issued a report making recommendations on comprehensive health care \nreform.\n  The Medicare Commission will facilitate our ability to address the \nMedicare crisis. Ultimately, I hope to see the Medicare Commission put \nforward a proposal after thoroughly analyzing the options that will \ntruly preserve and protect the Medicare Program, not just through the \nnext 5 years, but for the next generation so that we can leave a legacy \nof a robust Medicare Program for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to put partisanship aside. Time is \nrunning short, and we need to work together to avert the crisis.\n  Given the very short time that Medicare will remain solvent, and \ngiven the demographic facts of the American population, we cannot \nafford more delay. We need to preserve and protect the Medicare \nProgram. We need to make sure we leave a solid legacy for the next \ngenerations. It is no longer time for rhetoric, but time for action. \nPlaying politics with Medicare is simply wrong. Putting off what needs \nto be done is the cruelest tactic.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of Legislation Establishing the National Bipartisan Commission \n                       on the Future of Medicare\n\n       Establishes a 15 member commission.\n       Based on the membership structure of the 1990 US Bipartisan \n     Commission on Comprehensive Health Care (also known as The \n     Pepper Commission), the 15 members are appointed in the \n     following manner: 3 by the President; 6 by the House of \n     Representatives (not more than 4 from the same political \n     party); 6 by the Senate (not more than 4 from the same \n     political party); and the Chairman is designated by the joint \n     agreement of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     the Majority Leader of the Senate.\n       Duties are similar to the 1983 National Commission on \n     Social Security Reform:\n       1. review and analyze the long-term financial condition of \n     both Medicare Trust Funds;\n       2. identify problems that threaten the financial integrity;\n       3. analyze potential solutions that ensure the financial \n     integrity and the provision of appropriate benefits;\n       4. make recommendations to restore solvency of the HI Trust \n     Fund and the financial integrity of the SMI Trust Fund;\n       5. make recommendations for establishing the appropriate \n     financial structure of the program as a whole;\n       6. make recommendations for establishing the appropriate \n     balance of benefits covered and beneficiary contributions; \n     and\n       7. make recommendations for the time periods during which \n     the Commission recommendations should be implemented.\n       Must submit a report to the President and Congress no later \n     than 12 months from the date of enactment.\n       Commission terminates 30 days after report is submitted.\n       Funding authorized to be appropriated from both Medicare \n     Trust Funds.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, in introducing a bill that \nwould establish a commission to address the long term problems \nconfronting the Medicare Program.\n  In 1983, I joined with then-Senator Bob Dole as a member of the \nGreenspan Commission, which proposed a series of reforms and \nimprovements in the Social Security program. Congress' ability to \nresolve the complex and controversial issues facing Social Security\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\nat that time were in doubt up until the last minute. In the end, it was \nthe bipartisan nature of the Greenspan Commission that allowed Congress \nto agree on a solution.\n  This year, combined tax income to the Medicare and OASDI trust funds \nhas been less than the amount paid out of these trust funds. The \ntrustees of the Federal hospital insurance trust fund, the independent \nactuaries at the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] and the \nCongressional Budget Office all agree that the HI trust fund will run \nout of money in the year 2001.\n  Near-term insolvency can be resolved by reducing the rate of growth \nin the Medicare Program in legislation implementing the federal budget \nfor fiscal year 1998. Yet current proposals do not address the \ndemographic and structural factors that threaten the solvency of the \nMedicare Program over the longer term. Approaching changes in our \nNation's demographics are well known. The so-called ``baby boom,'' \nconsisting of individuals born between 1946 and 1964, will begin \nturning 65 in the year 2011. The sheer number of people in this \ndemographic bulge will be overwhelming to the Medicare Program.\n  At the same time, the number of people in the generations that follow \nis significantly smaller, such that by the year 2030 there will be only \n2.2 workers for each individual over 65, and thus eligible for \nMedicare. In 1995 there were 3.9 workers per beneficiary. These \ndemographic changes, combined with projected growth in program costs \nunder its current structure, guarantee an imbalance between the amount \nof money we will have to pay for the program and the cost of the \nbenefits that it is expected to cover.\n  During the recent Presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, \nBob Dole, asked if I would sit on a Medicare Commission that he wanted \nto set up if he were elected President. I responded that I would be \nhappy to serve on any such commission, regardless of which candidate \nwon the White House. In the meantime, President Clinton has also called \nfor a bipartisan process to address the long term difficulties facing \nMedicare. The President's most recent call for such a process came in \nhis State of the Union Address last week.\n  The bipartisan bill we are introducing today will begin this process. \nWe urge our colleagues to join this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1383-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Bryan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 25, a bill to reform the \nfinancing of Federal elections.\n\n\n                                 S. 98\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hutchinson, the names of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] and the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 98, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to provide a family tax credit.\n\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n  At the request of Ms. Landrieu, her name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 197, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage \nsavings and investment through individual retirement accounts, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 239\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Hagel] was added as a cosponsor of S. 239, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to the treatment of livestock \nsold on account of weather-related conditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 261\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 261, a bill \nto provide for a biennial budget process and a biennial appropriations \nprocess and to enhance oversight and the performance of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n\n                                 S. 263\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the names of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] and the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 263, a bill to prohibit the import, \nexport, sale, purchase, possession, transportation, acquisition, and \nreceipt of bear viscera or products that contain or claim to contain \nbear viscera, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 278\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the names of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] and the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 278, a bill to guarantee the right of \nall active duty military personnel, merchant mariners, and their \ndependents to vote in Federal, State, and local elections.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 6\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the names of the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm] and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 6, a joint resolution proposing \nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States to protect the \nrights of crime victims.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 16\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the names of the Senator from \nOklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] and the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland] were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 16, a joint resolution \nproposing a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] were withdrawn \nas cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 16, supra.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 53\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Resolution 53, a resolution to express the sense of the Senate \nconcerning actions that the President of the United States should take \nto resolve the dispute between the Allied Pilots Association and \nAmerican Airlines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1407-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 55--RELATIVE TO MILK PRICES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \nGrams) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 56\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was invested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of \n     America drew heavily upon the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the founders of the modern Greek state modeled \n     their government after that of\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n     the United States in an effort to best imitate their ancient \n     democracy;\n       Whereas Greece is one of the only three nations in the \n     world, beyond the former British Empire, that has been allied \n     with the Untied States in every major international conflict \n     this century;\n       Whereas the heroism displayed in the historic World War II \n     Battle of Crete epitomized Greece's sacrifice for freedom and \n     democracy as it presented the Axis land war with its first \n     major setback and set off a chain of events which \n     significantly affected the outcome of World War II.\n       Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our two nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 1997 marks the 176th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our two great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That March 25, 1997 is designated as ``Greek \n     Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and \n     American Democracy.'' The President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nalong with 43 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 1977, as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''\n  The Greeks began the revolution 176 years ago, that would free them \nfrom the Ottoman Empire and return Greece to its democratic heritage. \nIt was, of course, the ancient Greeks who developed the concept of \ndemocracy in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the \npeople. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily upon the political and \nphilosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our \nrepresentative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, ``to the \nancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for the light which led \nourselves our of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, then, that we should \nrecognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return \nto that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science, \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas the Expedition commanded by Meriwether Lewis and \n     William Clark, which came to be called ``The Corps of \n     Discovery'', was one of the most remarkable and productive \n     scientific and military exploring expeditions in all American \n     history;\n       Whereas President Thomas Jefferson gave Lewis and Clark the \n     mission to ``. . . explore the Missouri River & such \n     principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication \n     with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia, \n     Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct \n     & practicable water communication across this continent for \n     the purposes of commerce. . .'';\n       Whereas the Expedition, in response to President \n     Jefferson's directive, greatly advanced our geographical \n     knowledge of the continent and prepared the way for the \n     extension of the American fur trade with Indian tribes \n     throughout the area;\n       Whereas President Jefferson directed the explorers to take \n     note of and carefully record the natural resources of the \n     newly acquired territory known as Louisiana, as well as \n     diligently report on the native inhabitants of the land;\n       Whereas Lewis and Clark and their companions began their \n     historic journey to explore the uncharted wilderness west of \n     the Mississippi River at Wood River, Illinois on May 14, \n     1804, and followed the Missouri River westward from its mouth \n     on the Mississippi to its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains;\n       Whereas the Expedition spent its first winter at Fort \n     Mandan, North Dakota, crossed the Rocky Mountains by \n     horseback in August 1805, reached the Pacific Ocean at the \n     mouth of the Columbia River in mid-November of that year, and \n     wintered at Fort Clatsop, near the present city of Astoria, \n     Oregon;\n       Whereas the Expedition returned to St. Louis, Missouri, on \n     September 23, 1806, after a 28-month journey covering 8,000 \n     miles during which it traversed 11 future States: Illinois, \n     Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, \n     Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon;\n       Whereas the explorers faithfully followed the President's \n     directives and dutifully recorded their observations in their \n     detailed journals;\n       Whereas these journals describe many plant and animal \n     species, some completely unknown to the world of science or \n     never before encountered in North America, and added greatly \n     to scientific knowledge about the flora and fauna of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas accounts from the journals of Lewis and Clark and \n     the detailed maps that were prepared by the Expedition \n     enhanced knowledge of the western continent and routes for \n     commerce;\n       Whereas the journals of Lewis and Clark documented diverse \n     American Indian languages, customs, religious beliefs, and \n     ceremonies; as Lewis and Clark are important figures in \n     American history, so too are Black Buffalo, Cameahwait, \n     Sacajawea, Sheheke and Watkueis;\n       Whereas the Expedition significantly enhanced amicable \n     relations between the United States and the autonomous Indian \n     nations, and the friendship and respect fostered between the \n     Indian tribes and the Expedition represents the best of \n     diplomacy and relationships between divergent nations and \n     cultures;\n       Whereas the Native American Indian tribes of the Northern \n     Plains and the Pacific Northwest played an essential role in \n     the survival and the success of the Expedition;\n       Whereas the Lewis and Clark Expedition has been called the \n     most perfect Expedition of its kind in the history of the \n     world and paved the way for the United States to become a \n     great world power;\n       Whereas the President and the Congress have previously \n     recognized the importance of the Expedition by establishing a \n     5-year commission in 1964 to study its history and the route \n     it followed, and again in 1978 by designating the route as \n     the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior through the National Park \n     Service; and\n       Whereas the National Park Service, along with other \n     Federal, State, and local agencies and many other interested \n     groups are preparing commemorative activities to celebrate \n     the bicentennial of the Expedition beginning in 2003: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the work of the National \n     Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council and all the Federal, \n     State, and local entities as well as other interested groups \n     that are preparing bicentennial activities to celebrate the \n     200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during \n     the years 2004 through 2006;\n       (2) expresses its support for the events to be held in \n     observance of the Expedition at St. Louis, Missouri in 2004 \n     and Bismarck, North Dakota in 2005, and many other cities \n     during the bicentennial observance;

Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate \nresolution to focus national attention to the Bicentennial of the Lewis \nand Clark Expedition which will be celebrated during the years 2003-\n2005. I am pleased that Senators Bond, Burns, Conrad, Cochran, Craig, \nDaschle, Gorton, Jeffords, Kerrey, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Gordon Smith, \nand Reid have joined me as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  The Lewis and Clark Expedition is one of the most remarkable events \nin our history. In the words of historian Paul Cutright, ``the Lewis \nand Clark Expedition stands, incomparably, as the transcendent \nachievement of its kind in this hemisphere, if not the entire world.'' \nKnown as the Corps of Discovery, the expedition traversed a vast \nexpanse of largely unknown territory that was just added to the United \nStates through the Louisiana Purchase.\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\n  The expedition was conceived by Thomas Jefferson at his home in \nMonticello, VA. His primary motivation was to find a water route to the \nPacific Ocean for commercial reasons. But President Jefferson was \ninterested in far more than trade routes. He was equally interested in \nexpanding the Nation's knowledge of the flora, fauna, geology, \ngeography, and the native peoples who inhabited this vast expanse of \nunexplored territory that was recently added to the United States. He \nspecifically instructed Lewis and Clark to carefully record what they \nfound. The historic Lewis and Clark Journals were the result of that \nPresidential directive. The journals, maps, drawings, and specimens \nwhich Lewis and Clark produced vastly enhanced the Nation's scientific \nknowledge and created a lasting cultural legacy for the Nation.\n  During their 28-month journey, the expedition crossed 11 future \nStates. All along the route--from St. Louis, MO, to Mandan, ND, to Fort \nClatsop, OR--preparations are already underway to celebrate this epic \nexploration. The National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council was \nformed to stimulate and coordinate bicentennial activities across the \nNation. Its mission is ``to commemorate that journey, rekindle its \nspirit of discovery, and acclaim the contributions and goodwill of the \nnative peoples.'' In cooperation with, Federal, State, tribal, and \nlocal governments as well as other interested groups, the council will \nundertake educational programs, re-enactments of historical events, \nessay competitions, symposia, athletic events, and other commemorative \nactivities in observances of the bicentennial of this historic journey.\n  I hope this resolution will help to focus public attention on this \ngreat American adventure and its remarkable achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1408-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 58--RELATIVE TO THE TREATY OF MUTUAL COOPERATION AND \n              SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Rockefeller) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 58\n\n       Whereas, the Senate finds that the Treaty of Mutual \n     Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America \n     and Japan is critical to the security interests of the United \n     States, Japan and the countries of the Asian Pacific region;\n       Whereas, the security relationship between the United \n     States and Japan is the foundation for the security strategy \n     of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas, strong security ties between the two countries \n     provide a key stabilizing influence in an uncertain post-Cold \n     War world;\n       Whereas, this bilateral security relationship makes it \n     possible for the United States and Japan to preserve their \n     interests in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas, forward-deployed forces of the United States are \n     welcomed by allies of the United States in the region because \n     such forces are critical for maintaining stability in the \n     Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas, regional stability has undergirded economic growth \n     and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas, the recognition by allies of the United States of \n     the importance of United States armed forces for security in \n     the Asia-Pacific region confers on the United States \n     irreplaceable good will and diplomatic influence in that \n     region;\n       Whereas, Japan's host nation support is a key element in \n     the ability of the United States to maintain forward-deployed \n     forces in that country;\n       Whereas, the Governments of the United States and Japan, in \n     the Special Action Committee on Okinawa Final Report issued \n     by the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee estalished \n     by the two countries, have made commitments to reducing the \n     burdens of United States forces on the people of Okinawa;\n       Whereas, such commitments will maintain the operational \n     capability and readiness of United States forces;\n       Whereas, the people of Okinawa have borne a \n     disproportionate share of the burdens of United States \n     military bases in Japan; and\n       Whereas, gaining the understanding and support of the \n     people of Okinawa in fulfilling these commitments is crucial \n     to effective implementation of the Treaty;\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between \n     the United States of America and Japan remains vital to the \n     security interests of the United States and Japan, as well as \n     the security interests of the countries of the Asia-Pacific \n     region; and\n       (2) the people of Okinawa deserve special recognition and \n     gratitude for their contributions toward ensuring the \n     Treaty's implementation and regional peace and stability.\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Thomas, Mack, and Rockefeller to submit a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution expressing our gratitude to the Okinawan people for their \ncontributions toward ensuring the viability of the Treaty of Mutual \nCooperation and Security between the United States of America and \nJapan. My friend and colleague, Rep. Lee Hamilton, is submitting a \nsimilar resolution in the House of Representatives today.\n  Mr. President, the Security Treaty forms the core of our bilateral \nsecurity arrangements with Japan and of our overall security strategy \nfor the Asia Pacific region. Those arrangements have helped provide the \npeace and stability that have undergirded the region's economic \nsuccess--from which the United States has benefitted directly.\n  To help ensure the viability of the Treaty, this past December, the \nUnited States and Japan agreed on terms to return roughly 20 percent of \nthe land used by the American military. The Special Action Committee on \nOkinawa Final Report issued by the United States-Japan Security \nConsultative Committee sets out timetables for the return of the land. \nIt also calls for training and operational procedures aimed at \nlessening the intrusiveness of American forces in Okinawa and \nimprovements in certain procedures of the Status of Forces Agreement.\n  Even with the coming changes, Japan will continue to provide our \nforces based in that country with significant amounts of host nation \nsupport. And no one in Japan shoulders a more disproportionate share of \nthat burden than the people of Okinawa.\n  For their many contributions to the United States-Japan relationship \nand the peace and stability of all the Asia Pacific region, the \nOkinawan people justly deserve our recognition and our sincerest \nthanks. That is precisely what this resolution does. But it also goes \nfurther: the resolution makes it clear that the continued support of \nthe Okinawan people is crucial if we are to maintain a bilateral \nrelationship that serves both our countries' interests, as well as \nthose of the Asia Pacific and the entire world.\n  In light of the need for the support and understanding of the \nOkinawan people, and of the prefecture's continuing economic problems, \nI hope the Government of Japan gives serious consideration to some of \nthe ideas that have been circulating on making the prefecture into a \nbastion of free trade and investment. The surest cure for Okinawa's \neconomic ills is a dose of fundamental market reform.\n  Mr. President, I submitted a similar resolution at the end of the \n104th Congress. While that resolution was cleared for passage, Congress \nadjourned before we could take the measure up for final consideration. \nBecause of the importance of the United States-Japan relationship, I \nurge all my colleagues to join me in making passage of this resolution \npossible this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1409-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1409-S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           subcommittee on forests and public land management\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, tomorrow evening, Howard \nUniversity will be honoring and celebrating one of our Nation's most \ntreasured poets, Gwendolyn Brooks. There, they will highlight her \nlifetime of accomplishment: Many awards, over 70 honorary degrees, and \nher status both as the first black Pulitzer Prize winner and Poet \nLaureate of Illinois. I would like to take a moment to add a few words \nof my own to the many that will be saluting her tomorrow.\n  Like myself, Miss Brooks grew up on the south side of Chicago and \nattended Chicago public schools. Her parents loved literature and \nnurtured her early talent. She published her first poem when she was \n11, and the world of poetry was forever changed. Her work gave voice to \nan entire class of people who had not yet been heard, and who had so \nmuch to say.\n  Her poetry has a soul of its own, sometimes whimsical, sometimes \nmournful, but always full of truth, and beauty. She writes of love and \nlife and loss and liberty and lunacy and laceration. Her work is often \nprovocative, and always inspirational. One of her most clever poems \nchallenges its readers, shaking them out of complacence, preventing \nthem from passively enjoying her art:\n\n     A poem doesn't do everything for you.\n     You are supposed to go on with your thinking.\n     You are supposed to enrich the other person's poem with your \n           extensions,\n     your uniquely personal understandings,\n     thus making the poem serve you.\n\n  However, Gwendolyn Brooks doesn't merely challenge readers, she \nchallenges writers. For more than half a century, she has dedicated \nherself to nurturing the talent of young writers through her teaching. \nShe sponsors annual poetry contests, using her own money for cash \nprizes. She is as generous with her time as her money, dispensing \nadvice and answering questions posed by aspiring writers.\n  Gwendolyn Brooks is not only one of America's greatest poets and a \nliving legend, but an inspiration to many, myself included. One of the \nhighlights of the day I was sworn in as a Senator 4 years ago was her \nreading of Aurora to me. Her words from that day live on in me as they \ndo in anyone who has ever heard her speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1411-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL SURPLUS PROPERTY DONATION ACT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to speak about S. 307, \nthe Federal Surplus Property Donations Act introduced earlier in the \nweek by Senators Lugar, Harkin, Leahy, and myself.\n  This legislation will enable food banks and other charities, which \nprimarily serve low-income persons, to receive surplus Federal property \nsuch as computers, office furniture, copiers, warehouse equipment, and \ntrucks. Items like these are often not available because of their \nexpense. Such equipment can contribute to efficient and effective food \nbank operations.\n  I want to thank Second Harvest, Habitat for Humanity, and other major \ncharities which serve needy families and children every day for their \nsupport of this legislation and their commitment in responding to \nhunger in our communities.\n  Mr. President, Second Harvest and Habitat for Humanity work with food \nbanks serving all 50 States and Puerto Rico. In my home State of \nKentucky, this legislation will assist Dare to Care Food Bank in \nLouisville, God's Pantry Food Bank in Lexington, and Kentucky Food Bank \nin Elizabethtown in accessing Federal surplus property.\n  This is a modest but important bill. It can make a real difference in \nthe lives of those who are served by these valuable programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both this legislation and the food \nbanks across the country that serve needy families and \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1411-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          GAO'S REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we are now at the height of a \ncontentious debate on whether or not Social Security payments will be \nmade in the 21st century if we pass the balanced budget amendment. The \nquestion is moot.\n  According to a report released yesterday by the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO], come January 1, 2000, the ``Year 2000 Computer Problem'' \nwill render all Social Security funds impounded. On the first day of \nthe new millennium thousands of computer systems at the Social Security \nAdministration as well as all the other Federal Agencies--Defense \nincluded--could malfunction.\n  It is February 13, 1997; we have 1,051 days remaining until January \n1, 2000. Not only does the Year 2000 Computer Problem render our \nbalanced budget debate moot, but its extent and impact will have \nconsequences unseen in history. I have introduced a bill, S. 22, that \nwould set up a commission to address the problem. This issue should be \nthe No. 1 priority of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and of the \n105th Congress.\n  If this matter lingers unaddressed, I can only imagine what else \nbesides Social Security will fail in our computer-dependent \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1411-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1411-S1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO UTAH'S MOTHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSybil Shumway Stewart, Utah's 1996 Mother of the Year. I want to \nrecognize her for the decades of service to her community, her church, \nand her family. We have been proud to have her represent our State this \npast year.\n  Sybil Shumway was born in Trenton, UT, on April 1, 1920, the youngest \nof four daughters, raised under the most humble of circumstances during \nthe Great Depression. Sybil's father was a schoolteacher who taught in \nCache County schools and was respected throughout the community. From \nthe earliest age, her parents instilled in her the fundamental values \nof hard work, honesty and integrity, sacrifice and service.\n  As a student in junior high school, Sybil recalls her civics teacher \ndetailing the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany and subsequently learned \nto cherish and value the freedoms many of us often take for granted. \nShe committed herself at that time to serving her community and \ncountry. She also recognized the importance that she teach her own \nchildren to cherish these same values.\n  Sybil graduated from Logan High School and Utah State University in \n1942. Her desire to give something back to her community led her to \npursue an occupation as a schoolteacher. While she only taught for a \nshort while, she sees many of her students today. Her students never \nfail to express their appreciation for the skills they learned in her \nhome economics class.\n  On Valentine's Day 1943, Sybil Shumway received an engagement ring in \nthe mail from a young Army Air Corps lieutenant named Boyd Stewart, \nwhom she had dated in college. They were married on May 21, 1943, while \nBoyd was home on weekend leave. They embarked on their life together \nand left that night for Randolph Field in Texas where Boyd was \nstationed as a flight instructor. After 20-plus years of Air Force duty \nand more than 30 years of running two farms, their marriage is still \ngoing strong almost 54 years later.\n  Sybil and Boyd raised 10 children; 6 boys and 4 girls. They taught \ntheir children the value of hard work and service to their fellow men. \nThey instilled in each of them a love of God, country, community, and \nfamily. Sybil and Boyd's children went on to become schoolteachers, \ngovernment administrators, successful business owners, elected \nofficials, community activists, farmers, Scout leaders, a published \nauthor, and a world record holder. Five of their six sons served in our \nNation's Armed Forces. Four of those sons served as missionaries for \ntheir church. Most important, following the example of their mother, \nthose 10 children are now devoted parents to 41 grandchildren and 8 \ngreat-grandchildren. Indeed, Sybil's legacy and example will live on \nfor generations to come.\n  In our world today, success is unfortunately often measured by great \nwealth, an expensive education, and the recognition and honors of men. \nSybil Stewart has proven that the\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\ngreatest success one can have is within the walls of their own home. I \ncongratulate her on the completion of her term as Utah's 1996 Mother of \nthe Year. I know that to her family however, she will always be the \nMother of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1411-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE 1995 PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION \n                               REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when a certified public accountant \nprovides an opinion on a company's financial statements, investors and \nconsumers rely on that statement. This role is vital to the efficient \nworkings of our capital markets, which are the envy of the world. To \nkeep our markets the best, investors must have confidence in them. That \nis why I have worked over the years for stronger rules to protect \ninvestors from corporate fraud.\n  In recent years, corporate fraud has been perpetrated in the health \ncare arena, military contracting and in the savings and loan fiasco, \ncosting taxpayers billions of dollars. As a Member of the House and as \na new Senator, I have worked to put in place clear procedures for early \ndetection of fraud and illegal acts so as to protect the public from \nhuge losses of their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  To strengthen the fight against fraud, I worked as part of a \nbipartisan coalition that was successful in adding a new Section 10A to \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I wish to take a moment today to \nupdate my colleagues on the status of that section's implementation.\n  Since the enactment of this law in December 1995, I have been \ninterested in how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the \naccounting industry would respond to the new requirements and the \nspirit of the law. I am pleased that both the industry and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission have taken positive steps to assure \nthat both the letter and the spirit of the law are fully adhered to. \nWithin the industry, I would note that the American Institute of \nCertified Public Accountants (AICPA) last year issued a revised \nstatement of Auditing Standards (SAS) Number 82 ``Consideration of \nFraud in a Financial Statement Audit.'' The new SAS supersedes \nStatement of Auditing Standards (SAS) Number 53 relating to ``The \nAuditor's Responsibility to Detect and Report Errors and \nIrregularities.'' The previous AICPA Statement of Auditing Standards \nNumber 53 required auditors to report errors and irregularities. The \nnew SAS takes an important step forward by making clear for the first \ntime an auditor's responsibility to detect material fraud in financial \nstatements and by offering various fraud risk factors to be considered \nin planning and performing all audits. The new revised SAS, read in \nconjunction with the AICPA's SAS Number 54 relating to an auditor's \nresponsibility to detect illegal acts, is not only consistent with \nSection 10A but also promotes the intent of that provision to put \nprocedures in place to help detect fraud early.\n  To date, the SEC has only limited experience with Section 10A because \nit becomes effective in two stages. For companies that file selected \nquarterly financial data with the SEC, Section 10A applies to annual \nreports for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. For \ncompanies that do not file these reports, the provision applies to \nannual reports for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1997. \nMany financial reports are filed at the end of the calendar year, \nmeaning that most company audits for the 1996 fiscal year have not yet \nbeen completed. The SEC has assured me that it will evaluate and report \non its experience with implementation of Section 10A in a timely \nmanner.\n  In addition, I wrote SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt seeking his views on \nwhether the AICPA's new SAS Number 82 and existing SAS 54 relating to \nillegal acts are consistent with the purpose and intent of Section 10A. \nIn his reply, Chairman Levitt states: ``We believe that both these \nstandards improve the ability of auditors to detect management fraud \nand are consistent with the purposes of Section 10A.''\n\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of accountants are honest, capable \nprofessionals. The number of audit failures is actually quite low \ncompared to the amount of work they do. The AICPA's new revised SAS No. \n82 and section 10A are added protection for investors and corporations \nagainst such failures.\n  I am pleased with both the work of the AICPA in clarifying the role \nof auditors in detecting fraudulent acts and with Chairman Levitt's \nreply assuring us that the SEC and AICPA procedures should work well \ntogether to promote the early detection of corporate fraud.\n  I submit for the Record my letter to SEC Chairman Levitt and his \nreply of January 31, 1997, and ask that they be printed.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Arthur Levitt, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, \n         DC.0\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to seek your views as \n     Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the \n     status of implementation of Section 10A of the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and particularly the \n     relationship between Section 10A and the American Institute \n     of Certified public Accountants' (AICPA) revised Statement of \n     Auditing Standards (SAS) Number 53 relating to fraud.\n       As the sponsor of Section 10A of the legislation, my goal \n     was to clarify the auditor's role in detecting fraud in \n     financial statements and to put in place clear procedures for \n     early detection of fraud and illegal acts so as to avoid the \n     need for strike suits in the first place. I would appreciate \n     your views on whether the AICPA's revised SAS 53 and existing \n     SAS 54 relating to illegal acts are consistent with the \n     purpose and intent of Section 10A in seeking early detection \n     of illegal acts that are material to the financial statements \n     being audited. I would also appreciate knowing whether you \n     have encountered any problems in implementing and enforcing \n     the requirements of new Section 10A.\n       I look forward to your prompt response to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1997.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your letter seeking \n     information on the implementation of section 10A of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which was adopted as Title \n     III of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n       In connection with this legislation, the American Institute \n     of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) revised SAS No. 53, \n     entitled ``The Auditor's Responsibility to Detect and Report \n     Errors and Irregularities.'' To implement the reporting \n     provisions of section 10A(b), the Commission issued proposed \n     rules, a copy of which are enclosed. Final action is expected \n     soon.\n       The AICPA's revised standard clearly requires auditors to \n     assess the risk of material misstatements in financial \n     statements due to fraud. In discharging this duty, auditors \n     must consider various fraud risk factors in planning and \n     performing the audit. It also requires that working papers \n     document both the auditor's assessment of those risk factors \n     and any responsive action taken.\n       Additional guidance for auditors discharging their \n     responsibilities under section 10A(a) is found in existing \n     SAS No. 54, since this standard is not limited to fraudulent \n     conduct. SAS No. 54, as you know, served as a template in \n     drafting certain provisions of section 10A. We believe that \n     both these standards improve the ability of auditors to \n     detect management fraud and are consistent with the purposes \n     of section 10A.\n       The Commission's experiences under section 10A have been \n     limited due to the provision's relatively recent \n     effectiveness.\\1\\ Section 10A becomes effective in two \n     stages, depending on whether a company files selected \n     quarterly financial data with the SEC. For those companies \n     who file this information, the provision applies to annual \n     reports for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, \n     1996. For companies who do not file these reports, the \n     provision applies to annual reports for fiscal years \n     beginning on or after January 1, 1997. Since most companies \n     file at calendar year-end, the audit for the 1996 fiscal year \n     for most companies has not yet been completed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ During an enforcement investigation, however, an \n     accounting firm provided certain information and requested \n     that it be deemed to be submitted under section 10A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       After we have had time to evaluate our experiences for this \n     period, we would be pleased to furnish you with additional \n     information. Thank you again for your continuing interest in \n     these important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1412-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1412-S1413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROGERS H.

Mr. President, the Monday, February 10, \n1997, Chicago Tribune contained an editorial entitled: ``Nurturing \nChicago's Exchanges.'' The editorial, talking about the Chicago Board \nof Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of \nOptions Exchange, made the point that:\n\n     the Chicago exchanges' global market share in future and \n     options plunged from 60 percent in 1987 to 31 percent in \n     1995. The business is going overseas, where regulatory costs \n     are lower, and off exchanges, where banks and other companies \n     can engineer innovative contracts in a day or two without \n     government approval.\n\n  The Tribune had it exactly right.

There is a revolution underway in finance, and, if \nthe United States sits back and ignores the new realities of the \nmarketplace, the result will be to seriously damage American financial \nmarketplaces vis-a-vis their global competition, and to increasingly \nwarp and distort the competition between and among various American \nfinancial markets.\n  We must respond; we must respond vigorously; and we must respond now. \nChicago's future and option exchanges are an American treasure; their \ninnovations literally created this industry and are in no small part \nresponsible for American leadership in finance. And the creativity of \nthe Chicago exchanges has had a huge pay off for the Chicago area. As \nthe Tribune editorial pointed out:\n\n     the commodities and securities businesses have been strong \n     job machines here, accounting for 50,000 direct jobs and \n     total employment of 151,500, up 31 percent from a decade ago. \n     The industry also keeps about $35 billion in Chicago banks.\n\n  It is imperative, therefore, that we act quickly to reauthorize the \nCommodity Futures Trading Act as quickly as possible, and that we do so \nin a way that enhances the ability of the American futures and options \nindustry to meet both their less regulated competition here in the \nUnited States, and their evermore formidable competition abroad. I \nintend to work for quick enactment of the legislation put forward by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator \nLugar. I urge my colleagues to join me, and to ensure that a \nprocompetitive, commonsense approach that allows the futures exchanges \nto meet and compete with all comers passes this body before the snow \nmelts in Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the Tribune editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune Feb. 10, 1997]\n\n                     Nurturing Chicago's Exchanges\n\n       The Chicago Board of Trade will soon inaugurate a new $182 \n     million trading floor, which will triple its space and \n     seemingly prepare the nation's oldest futures exchange for \n     continued growth into the 21st Century.\n       Instead of celebrating, however, Board of Trade honchos are \n     bemoaning their inability to compete against foreign \n     exchanges and bankers who sell customized financial products \n     in largely unregulated, off-exchange markets.\n       Indeed, unless the CBOT can create innovative products and \n     lower costs to attract new customers, and unless it can get \n     fair regulatory treatment from Washington, the new floor may \n     turn out to be a monument to the past, not a springboard to \n     the future.\n       CBOT leaders are confident they can invent new contracts \n     and a joint committee of the Board of Trade and the Chicago \n     Mercantile Exchange is working on cutting costs. (That group \n     should push for consolidation of the two exchanges' clearing \n     operations.)\n       But Congress also needs to update the Commodity Exchange \n     Act to reflect the realities of today's financial markets. If \n     it doesn't, Chicago will quickly lose its place as the \n     world's center for managing financial risk.\n       That would be a severe blow to the city. According to a \n     recent study the commodities and securities businesses have \n     been strong job machines here, accounting for 50,000 direct \n     jobs and total employment of 151,500 up 38 percent from a \n     decade ago. The industry also keeps about $35 billion in \n     Chicago banks.\n       Despite all that, the Chicago exchanges' global market \n     share in futures and options plunged from 60 percent in 1987 \n     to 31 percent in 1995. The business is going overseas, where \n     regulatory costs are lower, and off exchanges, where banks \n     and other companies can engineer innovative contracts in a \n     day or two without government approval. The Board of Trade \n     must wait six months to get a new contract approved.\n       That and other rules were enacted years ago, when most \n     customers of the exchanges were farmers using futures to \n     hedge against swings in crop prices. Today 95 percent of the \n     trades are between large financial institutions and \n     professional investors, who are interested in efficiency, not \n     government protection.\n       Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar of \n     Indiana has introduced a bill to speed approval of new \n     contracts and require regulators to do cost-benefit analyses \n     before imposing new rules. It also would continue to deny \n     commodity regulators authority to oversee off-exchange \n     trades--a step the Treasury Department strongly supports.\n       But Lugar's bill would give the Chicago exchanges a chance \n     to compete on an equal footing in the ``professional'' \n     markets by allowing unregulated products for institutional \n     customers to be developed while still insisting on protection \n     for small retail customers.\n       It carefully balances the need to safeguard individual \n     investors with the need to free the exchanges to compete in \n     global markets. A similar House bill has been proposed by \n     Rep. Tom Ewing (R-Ill.). Congress must debate these measures, \n     reconcile and then pass them if Chicago is to have the chance \n     to preserve its global leadership in financial risk \n     management.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1413-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1413-S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LOCKWOOD GREENE DONATES RARE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS TO THE SMITHSONIAN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I recognize Lockwood \nGreene, and its chairman, Donald R. Lugar, for the company's donation \nof 5,000 original engineering drawings to the Smithsonian's National \nMuseum of American History.\n  The Lockwood Greene Collection dates to the mid-1800's and is the \nlargest single holding of early American engineering and architectural \ndrawings. The drawings offer a window into the U.S. industrial history \nand the changes that occurred with the harnessing of electricity and \nthe invention of the automobile.\n  The donated drawings, mostly on linen using India ink and still in \nmint condition, reveal the skills and talent of 19th and early 20th \ncentury draftsmen. They document information unrecorded elsewhere such \nas: The first application of electric drive to an 1893 manufacturing \noperation in Columbia, SC; modifications providing for the transition \nfrom horse and buggy to automobile to the important east west route, \nthe Lincoln Highway in Lake County, IN; designs for WWII era radio \nstations; and drawings of the Androscoggin textile mill in Lewiston, \nME, from the 1890's depicting power transmission through the factory \nprior to the introduction of electricity.\n  The official ceremony for the donation will take place at the \nSmithsonian's Ceremonial Court Hall\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\non February 19, 1997. Museum officials are delighted by the gift and \nthey have begun compiling a computerized index of them.\n  I congratulate Lockwood Greene's generous decision to make this \npriceless gift to the Smithsonian Institution, thus securing it for \nfuture generations. Lockwood Greene, one of the country's most \nprominent consulting, design, and construction firms, was founded in \nNew England in 1832 and is now headquartered in Spartanburg, \nSC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1413-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NEED FOR CHILD SAFETY LOCKS ON AMERICAN-MADE HANDGUNS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of \nthe Senate a terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday in Bridgeport, \nCT. The death of 8-year-old Tynisha Gathers demonstrates once again the \nneed for child safety locks on American-made handguns.\n  Yesterday, Tynisha was playing at her grandmother's house when one of \nher friends found a small 38-caliber handgun. In the course of acting \nout a scene from a popular movie, Tynisha was shot in the forehead and \nkilled. Her 10-year-old playmate has been charged with manslaughter. If \nthe handgun used to kill Tynisha Gathers included adequate safety \nfeatures, this tragedy could have been prevented.\n  I have introduced legislation to require all American-made handguns \nto meet the same quality and safety standards currently required of \nimports. President Clinton has recognized this crisis, calling in his \nState of the Union Address for Congress to pass legislation requiring \n``child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use.''\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators to read this Associated Press \nstory about the tragic death of Tynisha Gathers and consider \ncosponsoring S. 70.\n  I ask that the Associated Press article be printed at this point in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n        Police Say Movie Linked to Fatal Shooting of Young Girl\n\n                        (By Brigitte Greenberg)\n\n       Bridgeport, CT.--A movie that authorities have linked to \n     shootings in California and Missouri apparently instigated a \n     fatal shooting of an 8-year-old girl here, police said.\n       Tynisha Gathers was shot in the forehead as she and other \n     children imitated scenes from the movie ``Set It Off,'' \n     police said Wednesday. The little girl was shot by one of \n     three other children playing with a small pistol a .380-\n     caliber semiautomatic handgun, police said.\n       Detectives were investigating how the children got access \n     to the weapon, said police Capt. John Donovan. A 10-year-old \n     girl was taken into custody and charged with manslaughter.\n       The shooting occurred after the four children watched a \n     videotape of the movie Tuesday evening, police said. Donovan \n     said the tape apparently was a bootleg copy; the film, which \n     arrived in theaters in November, is not yet in video stores.\n       The children said they were replaying a scene from the \n     movie, said police Lt. Frank Resta.\n       The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention center, Resta \n     said.\n       Donovan was circumspect about the movie's impact on the \n     children.\n       ``I'll leave that to the sociologists. We have charges \n     lodged against a 10-year-old,'' he said.\n       Police said the shooting occurred in the victim's \n     grandmother's house; the grandmother was home at the time but \n     was not in the room.\n       The R-rated ``Set It Off,'' which features rap star Queen \n     Latifah, is about four desperate women who go on a bank \n     robbery spree.\n       Authorities in California and Missouri have linked the \n     movie to several shootings. The film was canceled at an \n     Independence, Mo., theater after a moviegoer fired a gun \n     inside a theater.\n       In Torrance, Calif., one man was killed outside a theater \n     showing the movie and two teen-agers were wounded. In Los \n     Angeles, three people were injured during a shootout between \n     rival gangs inside a theater where the film was \n     playing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1414-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1414-S1415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL.

Announcement of Hearings.--The committee shall \n     undertake consistent with the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of \n     Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate (relating to \n     public notice of committee hearings) to issue public \n     announcements of hearings it intends to hold at least one \n     week prior to the commencement of such hearings.\n       Rule 14. Witnesses at Hearings.--(a) Each witness who is \n     scheduled to testify at any hearing must submit his written \n     testimony to the staff director not later than noon of the \n     business day immediately before the last business day \n     preceding the day on which he is scheduled to appear. Such \n     written testimony shall be accompanied by a brief summary of \n     the principal points covered in the written testimony. Having \n     submitted his written testimony, the witness shall be allowed \n     not more than ten minutes for oral presentation of his \n     statement.\n       (b) Witnesses may not read their entire written testimony, \n     but must confine their oral presentation to a summarization \n     of their arguments.\n       (c) Witnesses shall observe proper standards of dignity, \n     decorum and propriety while presenting their views to the \n     committee. Any witness who violates this rule shall be \n     dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and written) shall \n     not appear in the record of the hearing.\n       (d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings, the staff shall \n     attempt to schedule witnesses so as to attain a balance of \n     views early in the hearings. Every member of the committee \n     may designate witnesses who will appear before the committee \n     to testify. To the extent that a witness designated by a \n     member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set \n     aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for \n     the witness to testify if the member designating that witness \n     is available at that time to chair the hearing.\n       Rule 15. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for \n     open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with \n     the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally \n     observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or \n     disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness \n     are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions \n     or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing \n     shall be expelled from the hearing.\n       Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.--(a) Broadcasting of \n     open hearings by television or radio coverage shall be \n     allowed upon approval by the chairman of a request filed with \n     the staff director not later than noon of the day before the \n     day on which such coverage is desired.\n       (b) If such approval is granted, broadcasting coverage of \n     the hearing shall be conducted unobtrusively and in \n     accordance with the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy \n     and decorum traditionally observed by the Senate.\n       (c) Equipment necessary for coverage by television and \n     radio media shall not be installed in, or removed from, the \n     hearing room while the committee is in session.\n       (d) Additional lighting may be installed in the hearing \n     room by the media in order to\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\n     raise the ambient lighting level to the lowest level \n     necessary to provide adequate television coverage of the \n     hearing at the then current state of the art of television \n     coverage.\n       (e) The additional lighting authorized by subsection (d) of \n     this rule shall not be directed into the eyes of any members \n     of the committee or of any witness, and at the request of any \n     such member or witness, offending lighting shall be \n     extinguished.\n       (f) No witness shall be required to be photographed at any \n     hearing or to give testimony while the broadcasting (or \n     coverage) of that hearing is being conducted. At the request \n     of any such witness who does not wish to be subjected to \n     radio or television coverage, all equipment used for coverage \n     shall be turned off.\n       Rule 17. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the \n     approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative \n     subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full \n     committee calendar unless a majority of the members present \n     and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an \n     appropriate subcommittee.\n       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-\n     passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph \n     (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that \n     period, the legislation will be restored to the full \n     committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding \n     sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event \n     that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present discharge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from \n     passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate, \n     subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the \n     Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop \n     specific proposals for full committee consideration but may \n     not report such legislation to the full committee. The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate \n     record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether \n     they be open or closed to the public. This record, marked as \n     ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members \n     of the Senate, or members of the committee together with \n     their staffs, at any time. This record shall not be published \n     or made public in any way except:\n       (a) By majority vote of the committee after all members of \n     the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to correct \n     their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately reflect \n     statements made.\n       (b) Any member may release his own remarks made in any \n     markup of the committee provided that every member or witness \n     whose remarks are contained in the released portion is given \n     a reasonable opportunity before release to correct their \n     remarks.\n       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an \n     executive session of the committee that is closed to the \n     public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in \n     any way except by majority vote of the committee after all \n     members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to \n     correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately \n     reflect statements made.\n       Rule 19. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be \n     added to, modified, amended or suspended at any time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1415-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1416-S1417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RULES OF PROCEDURE--U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 21, the \nadjournment resolution.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 21) providing for an \n     adjournment of both Houses.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall \nnot object, I just wanted to bring up two quick questions with the \nmajority leader.\n  Last time after the swearing-in ceremony, the majority leader will \nremember that I said I might object and I asked the majority leader \nwhether I could get some kind of a commitment for a clear timeframe for \ntaking up comprehensive campaign finance reform. I do not know whether \nthe majority leader is prepared to make that commitment tonight, but I \ndo want to be clear that if by March when we come back there has been \nno commitment made as to when we will have a bill on the floor and how \nwe will move forward on it--because otherwise I fear delay and delay \nand delay, much like we did with gift ban--I will start to take \namendments, campaign finance reform amendments, and attach those \namendments to other bills because I believe we have to move this \ndiscussion forward. I think people want action.\n  I am interested in the response of the majority leader. I want to \nmake clear to colleagues, because I think you need to give people a \nwarning, that when we come to our next recess it may be the case that I \nwill not agree to a unanimous consent. So I am using the model the \nmajority leader and I worked out together at the end on gift ban and we \ncame up with reform. I am using that model, and I think it is important \nfor Senators to be out here on the floor really pushing very hard for \nthis. I wonder whether the majority leader could tell me whether he has \nany plan now, whether we could get a specific time when we could have a \nbill--again, I am not trying to predetermine what the piece of \nlegislation would be--on this floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator's \nquestion. First of all, it is very hard to pick a date, to say by a \ndate certain we will get something done. For instance, on the matter \nthat has been pending before the Senate, Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, we had hoped we \ncould have a reasonable and fair debate and amendments being offered--I \nbelieve the Senator from Minnesota has had three or so and maybe he had \nsome more--and that by the end of the month we would have a vote on \nthat after having had a good, fair debate and amendments being offered.\n  But now we are having trouble getting amendments up and getting a \ntime agreed to. Now I understand we may have, I do not know, 20 or 25 \namendments lurking around out there. So now I have to begin to consider \nfiling cloture on something that--we do not want to start the cloture \nwars this year. So I try to take into consideration everybody's needs, \nand we have problems we have to take into consideration, like funerals \nof relatives or the Ambassador today. So it is very hard to say a time \ncertain.\n  Another example is, before we have reform, I think we ought to find \nout, first of all, what laws have been violated already on the books. \nToday we have in the paper that China is working, perhaps, on trying to \nget some foreign contributions, illegal contributions in the \nPresidential campaign. There seems to be an article every day--every \nday.\n  Before we start trying to reform a law, I think we ought to see a law \nthat is already on the books that I voted for back in 1973 or 1974 that \nis being used or abused. Yet we are seeing an all-out fight to stop the \nfunding for the Governmental Affairs Committee to begin its work to \nfind out what happened so we will know what laws have been violated, so \nwe will know what kind of reform we may or may not need. Unfortunately, \nas it is being delayed and the appearance of obstruction in getting \nthat hearing started, that has an impact on when we might get to a vote \non legislation here in the Senate.\n  The next thing is we would like to have hearings on this issue in the \nRules Committee. In fact, we will have. And yet the Rules Committee has \nbeen tied up for almost 2 weeks on trying to get the committee funding \nresolution and the resolution of the question with regard to the \nalleged illegal contributions in the Presidential campaign in 1996.\n  Then, also, I have to say to the Senator, are we ready now to begin \nto work on a bill that maybe both sides can agree to, or will it be one \nwhere you want to stick it to our side? Are you ready now to begin to \nget some language in there that would say that we must have paycheck \nequity? In other words, when I talk to my friends in my hometown, union \nmembers, some of which I used to represent when I practiced law, and my \nfather was one, they get irate that their dues are being used for \ncampaign purposes across this country without their approval or \ndesignation.\n  So, there is not going to be a campaign finance bill that does not \naddress a question like that. So, is the Senator ready to include \nsomething like that in the legislation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to respond to the majority leader. I did \nnot know we would have quite this debate but I understand----\n  Mr. LOTT. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I try to be calm and respond gently, but when the Senator \npricks me a little bit, I have to try to respond in a way that explains \nwhy I can't just say, ``April 15 on tax day we are going to take this \nbill up.'' I need help. I need cooperation on your side. We have done \nthat.\n  The Senator from Minnesota knows that last year I worked with him, I \nkept my word to him even one time when there was a little \nmisunderstanding, but we worked through it and got it done. I am \nwilling to do that, but you have to keep in mind what we are trying to \naccomplish here on a number of issues that do interrelate.\n  I am happy to yield for a response to that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I shall be brief, Mr. President. The majority leader, \nI appreciate his graciousness. I actually like his passion. It does not \ntrouble me at all.\n  Mr. President, I actually made it very clear that I am not trying \nto--he has his own ideas about what should be in a bill. I did not \ninsist on a particular piece of legislation. We have the McCain-\nFeingold bill that has been much talked about and could be a vehicle \nthat people could work with.\n  My point is I learned through the gift ban we only finally took \naction when we just started putting that piece of legislation on other \nbills. The majority leader is, after all, the majority leader, and, \nyes, we are now on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, \nbut the majority leader, I think, can be a real leader on this if we \ncan get a commitment that says, look, we will not have delay and delay \nand delay. We will have a bill on the floor and resolve this by July 4 \nor whatever date the majority leader picks out, and that makes it clear \nto people in the country that we are not going to just stall and stall.\n  The majority leader is talking about today's piece in the Washington \nPost, but the point is we do not really need to find out that there are \nproblems in the way campaigns are financed. This has been going on for \na long time. There is plenty to be fixed. People in the country are \nexperts at what they do not like. There is no reason whatever that we \ncannot move forward with a bill. I just would like to get a commitment. \nI take it from what the majority leader has said today and the way he \nsaid it that he is not ready to make such a commitment. That is fine, \nbut I want to be clear that if that is the case come March, I think the \nmajority leader can expect to see at least\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\non my part as a Senator from Minnesota, some different parts of \ncampaign finance reform as amendments on other bills. I want colleagues \nto know that this time I am not objecting to the UC for recess. But, \ncome next spring--and this is plenty of warning--that may very well \nhappen.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reclaim my time. I understand. As I have \nsaid earlier this year, and again here today, every Senator is within \nhis or her rights to offer amendments. I know, as we go forward, there \nwill be disagreements, and I know that the Senator from Minnesota is \ngoing to pursue this issue. He is entitled to do that. I appreciate his \ncomments today and that he is not going to object. We will have to see \nhow it moves forward in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the resolution is \nagreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 21) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            H. Con.

Therefore, there will be a vote around 2:15 on \nTuesday on that population planning issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/13/senate-section/article/S1418-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 1\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, \nFebruary 24, immediately following the vote on or in relation to the \nByrd amendment, Senator Reid be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelative to Social Security. I further ask unanimous consent that when \nthe Senate convenes on Tuesday, February 25, the time between 9 a.m. \nand 12:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form on the Reid \namendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following the vote at 2:15 on \nTuesday, February 25, the Senate resume debate on the Reid amendment \nuntil 6 p.m., with a vote occurring on or in relation to the Reid \namendment beginning at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, February 25.\n  I finally ask that on Wednesday, February 26, Senator Feinstein be \nrecognized at 9 a.m. to offer an amendment, with the time between 9 \na.m. and 11 a.m. divided equally in the usual form for debate on the \nFeinstein amendment; and, finally, a vote to occur on or in relation to \nthe Feinstein amendment at 11 a.m. on the 26th.\n  I also ask that no amendments be in order to Reid or Feinstein or any \nlanguage proposed to be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, that means we will have a vote on the Byrd \namendment around 5:30 on Monday. We will come in at 9 on Tuesday, the \nweek of the 24th and 25th, and we will have debate during the morning \nof Tuesday on the Reid amendment. We will recess for the policy \nluncheons then and come in at 2:15 for a vote on the population \nplanning issue. We will continue to debate the Reid amendment after \nthat, with a vote at 6 o'clock on Tuesday, the 25th. We will come in at \n9 o'clock on Wednesday and begin the debate on the Feinstein amendment \nand vote at 11 o'clock.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation in getting these \nthree amendments to the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget \nscheduled. Because of that cooperation, I did not file a cloture motion \nthis afternoon. That is somewhat risky, because if we don't get good \ncooperation, if we don't work through these amendments with time \nagreements, that will mean that I could not file a cloture motion and \nrequire a vote until Wednesday of that week. But if the Members will \nwork with us in good faith, on both sides, if we make progress and we \nmove toward completion of the constitutional amendment that first week \nthat we are back, ending the 28th, then maybe a cloture motion will not \nbe necessary. But we must have cooperation on these amendments to \neither get the ones that are not serious dispensed with, or to get a \nvote scheduled quickly on Wednesday of that week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
