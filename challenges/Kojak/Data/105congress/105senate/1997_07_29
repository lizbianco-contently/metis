Mr. President, approximately 1 year ago I asked President \nClinton to convene a summit on the environmental problems facing Lake \nTahoe. He did convene a summit in Lake Tahoe this past Friday and \nSaturday. Vice President Gore and President Clinton both came to Lake \nTahoe.\n  Mr. President, Mark Twain said that Lake Tahoe is ``the fairest \npicture the\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\nwhole Earth affords.'' I think Mark Twain was right. That beautiful \nlake, that is shared by the States of Nevada and California, is the \nfairest place in all the Earth.\n  That beautiful piece of real estate is also shared with the Federal \nGovernment because the Federal Government owns about 75 percent of the \nland mass within the Tahoe basin.\n  The reason, Mr. President, that the President was asked to come to \nLake Tahoe is because that beautiful resource is in distress. \nApproximately 50 percent of the trees in the basin are dead or dying. \nErosion is taking away the beautiful clarity of that lake. The clarity \nof that lake is leaving at the rate of over a foot a year because of \nerosion and pollutants going into that lake. Additionally, we have \ntremendous fear, through the whole basin, of forest fires.\n  Lake Tahoe is clearly the crown jewel of our national treasures and \nit must be preserved.\n  Mr. President, we should all be proud of what took place there these \npast several months. The planning and execution of the summit involved \nover 1,000 local people. We had four Cabinet officers who came to the \narea on more than one occasion. The workshops and the forums that were \nheld prepared the Vice President and the President for their visits. It \nwas not the result of the President coming and saying, ``Here's what we \nare going to do.''\n  In fact, what the President decided to do was based upon what the \nthousand people said should be done. It was not possible to determine \nwho was speaking, whether it was an environmentalist, an owner of a \nbusiness in the area, or a local government official. They were all \nspeaking as if they were singing from the same sheet of music.\n  In fact, the President said that one of the most remarkable things is \nthat this summit, this Presidential forum set the pattern of how \ndisputes should be resolved all around the world, not only in our own \ncountry, because he felt that people joined together for a common cause \nand decided that the environment could be taken care of and the economy \ncould still grow. The people said that unanimously. At Lake Tahoe, \nthere is no false choice between the economy and the environment. Each \ndepends upon the other.\n  The people of the Tahoe Basin and the States of California and Nevada \nagree that something must be done. They asked for a partnership with \nthe Federal Government, and they got that partnership.\n  Holding such a forum at this time is critical: If we continue our \ncurrent path for another 10 years, the damage already done would become \nirreversible. If we continue on our current path for 30 years, Lake \nTahoe will be no better than any other lake. It will be just an average \nlake. This would be devastating to the people of this country.\n  Lake Tahoe is not just another lake and we must not let it become \none.\n  We have tens of millions of visitors each year that visit the lake. \nWe can no longer let the lake be treated the way it has been in the \npast. History will not be kind to us if we let this jewel slip away. We \nhave been given a gift, and we must provide adequate stewardship over \nthis gift.\n  I have indicated that 75 percent of the land in the basin is \nfederally owned. There is a Federal responsibility to do our share.\n  Mr. President, when the President came, he not only acknowledged that \nthere was a problem with the lake, but this was more than a photo \nopportunity. The President came and signed an Executive order \nindicating that all Federal agencies would have to work together to \nsave the lake.\n  The first chairman of the Federal task force is Secretary Glickman. \nThe first work being done as a result of the President's visit started \nyesterday. Some of the things being done I think are significant. I am \nnot going to mention the 28 different action items that the President \ninitiated that have dollar signs attached to them, but it is about $50 \nmillion worth over two years, a doubling of the current effort.\n  One of the things that so impressed me is that the President said \nthat this year 29 miles of old logging roads will be obliterated. Some \nof the roads have been in existence for more than 100 years going back \nto the days of the Comstock when they took away all the forests in the \narea to satisfy the voracious appetite of the mines in the Virginia \nCity area. After 10 years, all the old roads will be gone. These roads \nhave added significantly to the erosion that has taken place in that \nlake over these many years.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, there will be work done on \nwatershed assessments so that people will understand what we are \ndealing with there. Two million dollars will be used to clear dead \nbrush and deadwood from the more than 3,500 federally owned lots. These \nlots have been purchased as a result of Federal lands being sold 500 \nmiles away in the Las Vegas area. These lots now need to be cleaned up. \nAs a result of the action of the President, they will be cleaned up.\n  The Forest Service also, Mr. President, will begin a program \nimmediately of prescribed burns. We spend about $1 billion a year \nfighting fires in this Nation. We are now going to spend part of these \nmoneys starting controlled fires. It is the only way that that forest \naround Lake Tahoe can be regenerated and made safe. In the past we have \nburned about 100 to 200 acres a year. This will be an increase of up to \n1,000 acres a year which will be burned carefully and on purpose.\n  The Forest Service will also use prescribed fires, and other means, \nto reduce fuels on another 4,000 acres per year. This will be 4,000 \nacres a year that will become a much better, safer place.\n  Mr. President, the work that was done these past 3 months is \nsomething that I think we should all be proud of. It shows that the \nFederal Government can work with State and local governments in a \nnonadversarial way. I think what took place here is an indication of \nwhat can take place in the future in other areas around the country.\n  It is possible, I repeat, that you can grow the economy and protect \nand preserve the environment, as indicated with the work that has taken \nplace in the Lake Tahoe area during the last 3 months. Lake Tahoe and \nthe area around there is only 26 percent registered Democrats. But it \nwas impossible to determine, these past 3 months, who was a Democrat \nand who was a Republican. Everyone joined together to recognize that \nthis great lake is in trouble and that we all need to work together--a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Congress.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the American people realize that we can \nwork together, as indicated by the budget agreement that has been \nworked out around here these past few weeks, and that we can work \ntogether on difficult problems, not only environmental problems, but \neconomic problems.\n  So, I'm very happy that the President accepted my invitation to come \nto Lake Tahoe. I think that his coming there was a home run for the \neconomy and the environment and government in general.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8207-8", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8208-S8210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, we learned that last evening the \nWhite House and congressional leaders reached agreement on a budget and \ntax cut proposal. I think that will be good news for the American \npeople.\n  I have been in Congress for some long while, as has been the \nPresiding Officer, and we have seen budgets and more budgets. We have \nseen claims and counterclaims. We have seen good times and bad times. \nWe have seen economies that are expanding and economies that are \ncontracting.\n  I remember the action taken in 1993 by this Congress, at a point in \ntime in 1993 when the budget deficit was swelling in an almost \nuncontrolled manner and the budget deficit was, in the unified budget, \nover $290 billion--if you count all the money the way you ought to, it \nwas well over $300 billion--and then in 1993, with that deficit out of \ncontrol, this Congress took action. By one vote here in the Senate and \none vote in the other body, this Congress passed what should be called \nthe Balanced Budget Act. We then called it a deficit reduction bill. \nAnd it has worked.\n  From 1993 until now, we have seen the budget deficit go down, down, \ndown and way down. That has allowed, I think, the American people to be \nmore\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\nconfident about this Congress' willingness and ability to deal with \nfiscal policy in a responsible way. The economy has blossomed and \nprovided more economic growth, and because of that, unemployment has \ngone down, way down; inflation is down, way, way down; and because all \nthe economic indicators are good and because economic growth has been \nup, we have seen the budget deficit now nearly disappear.\n  As a result of this economic boom, Members of Congress, working with \nthe President, have reached a budget accord on not only spending issues \nfor the coming 5 years, but also the question of what kind of tax \nreductions should be made available.\n  The one thing that is certain about all of us is that none of us will \nbe around here 100 years from now; 100 years from now, we will all be \ngone. We will be faint memories. And 100 years from now, if someone \nwanted to look and evaluate what was this Congress about, what were the \nAmerican people about, what did they hold dear and what did they think \nwas important, they could look back a century at the budget of the \nUnited States of America 100 years prior to that time and evaluate what \nthat Congress and the American people felt they should spend their \nmoney on, what they felt they should invest in. So 100 years from now, \nif they look back and evaluate what it is we held most dear, what we \nthought was most important, they could look into this budget agreement \nand evaluate what, in July 1997, motivated these men and women, what \ndid they think was important.\n\n  The reason I came to the floor this morning is I think a number of \nthe impulses in this budget agreement and the tax agreement are \nprecisely the right kind of impulses for this Congress and for the \nAmerican people to act on. First of all, I have, over time, tended to \ncategorize the policy issues as kids, jobs and values; working on the \nissues of kids, jobs and values. Somehow the threading of those issues \ntogether in providing the right kinds of policy initiatives gives us \nthe right direction.\n  Well, let's take a look at what's in this budget agreement and the \nproposal on tax reductions relative to kids, jobs and values.\n  First of all, what has happened in this agreement is the President \npushed, and we pushed, and we pushed some more, and we have in an \nagreement a substantial new investment in education, $35 billion worth \nof tax relief targeted for education. This agreement says to the \nAmerican people that when you send your kids to college, you are going \nto get a tax credit that is an inviting and important tax credit for \nyou.\n  Why is that important? Because there is no substitute for education. \nA society, a country that is not educated is not going to improve and \nadvance. Thomas Jefferson once said, ``Those who believe a country can \nbe both ignorant and free believe in something that never was and never \ncould be.''\n  So this agreement, thanks to the President, thanks to many of us in \nCongress who pushed and pushed and pushed and would not quit, says to \nparents who are going to send their kids to school, there is $35 \nbillion for investment in education in the form of tax credits, a 100 \npercent tax credit for the first $1,000 you spend in sending your child \nto college, and 50 percent of the second $1,000 in the first 2 years of \npostsecondary education. This agreement says education is important. \nThat is the one that says kids and their future represent the future of \nthis country.\n  Also, child health. Twenty-four billion dollars in this agreement is \ndedicated to insure more children in this country who are now \nuninsured. Of the 10 million children who have no health insurance and \nno health coverage, 5 million of those children will be able to see the \nbenefits of health insurance under this piece of legislation. That is a \npriority. That represents the kids portion of what we deem important \nhere in this Congress and in our country. For poor children, 5 million \npoor children, the question of whether they get health care will no \nlonger be a function of whether their parents have money. Health care \nfor those sick children ought to be a right. And this budget \nagreement--again, thanks to this President and to many of us in \nCongress who pushed very hard to say children's health is important; \nwhen we have 10 million children without health coverage, we had to do \nsomething about it--moves a giant step in that direction.\n  Jobs, values. Well, this proposal on the budget and on taxes also is \na proposal that says that saving is important. Savings and investment \nare important. It manifests that by the tax incentives; it says that we \nwant the American people to have the incentives to save and to invest \nby providing tax incentives for that purpose. My grandmother, who is \ngone now, bless her soul, once said to me, ``You know, Byron, I never \nhear anybody talking about saving up to buy anything anymore because \nthe whole economy is to say, `Come over here and buy this, we will give \nyou a rebate and give you the product, and you don't have to make the \nfirst payment for 6 months.''' That is the whole economy these days.\n  But the fact is, our economic strength and future economic growth \nrests on the ability to promote savings and, therefore, investment. \nSavings is critically important, and this budget agreement provides \nincentives, more tax incentives, for savings.\n  Home ownership. This tax agreement provides substantial tax help for \nthose who sell their home and who now will no longer be paying any kind \nof capital gains tax on the value of that home sale.\n\n  Most importantly, with respect to children again, is the children's \ntax credit, a $500 tax credit. It is phased in in different ways. But \nthe fact is, for those families who have children and who are \nstruggling to make ends meet and pay bills and go to work every day and \nprovide for their children's needs and send their kids to school, this \nprovides a $500 child tax credit. The President pushed for that, the \nCongress pushed for that. That is also part of this agreement.\n  Now, we had a big fight about who is going to get that and should \nsome children be left out because their parents don't make enough \nmoney--both parents working, both at minimum wage, neither of which pay \nmuch income taxes, but both of which pay a substantial payroll tax, and \nthe payroll tax is the tax that has been increasing.\n  This agreement, as I understand it from last evening, does move in \nthe direction of saying, yes, you are a taxpayer, if you make $25,000 a \nyear and don't pay much in income tax but if you are paying a payroll \ntax, we consider you a taxpayer, and we think you deserve some tax \nreduction as well. So this $500 per child tax credit is going to be \nvery beneficial to a good number of families who feel the pinch of the \nburden of taxes that they would like to be relieved of if they could in \norder to better provide for themselves and their families.\n  Now, I happen to think that the first goal and the first objective of \neliminating the budget deficit is the important one. I want to go back \nto 1993, which is where I started this discussion. In 1993, when we \npassed on the floor of this Senate a budget agreement which we thought \nof as the Deficit Reduction Act. I voted for it. It wasn't the popular \nthing to do and certainly wasn't the political thing to do. There was \nnothing but political heartache and headache as a result of voting for \nthat. It passed by only one vote. Some of my colleagues are no longer \nin this Chamber because they voted for it. They were defeated or they \nleft.\n  I think, in retrospect, that history will show that, in 1993, this \nCongress turned the corner and made a U-turn and said to the American \npeople: we want to tell you something. We are committed to deficit \nreduction and we are willing to make the tough choices and demonstrate \nthat to you. And we passed the Deficit Reduction Act, which should \nreally be called the Balanced Budget Act, because that is what has \ncreated the confidence in this country by the American people that \nCongress was willing to head in the right direction.\n  We have all these economists in the country who explain to us what \nhas happened and what will happen. Most of them don't have the foggiest \nnotion of either what happened or what will happen. I used to teach \neconomics for a couple of years in college. I think economics is \nprincipally psychology pumped up with a little helium. All these \neconomists tell us what is going to happen. Well, in 1993, we had this \nwhat I call the Balanced Budget Act, which I voted for. We had people \nhere,\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nsome of whom were economists, stand up and say, ``If you pass this \nlegislation, this economy is going to go in the tank. We are going to \nhave a recession, or a depression, and joblessness.'' I mean, the \npredictions were very dire.\n  In fact we passed that legislation and we have had unemployment go \nstraight down, new jobs go straight up, inflation go straight down, and \nthe deficit go straight down. The unified budget deficit was $290 \nbillion in 1992. This year it may end up at less than $40 billion. The \neconomy is on better footing. Why? Because it is not the economists \nthat understand what is going on.\n  This economy rests on a cushion of confidence. If the American people \nare confident about what we are doing and the direction in which this \ncountry is heading, then they make the right decisions. ``We are \nconfident about the future,'' they say, so they buy the next washer and \ndryer or the next car and make the decision to purchase a home.\n  If they are not confident, they make the other decision. ``We will \ndefer the purchase. We will not buy the car. We won't buy the home. We \nwon't buy the washer and dryer. We won't buy the refrigerator.'' And, \nas a result, the economy contracts.\n  But this economy is expanding. Why? Because in 1993 this Congress \nmade the right decision--the tough decision--to put this country on the \nright course. It allows us now, in 1997, to make some other decisions. \nYes, to make budget choices that are the right choices in many cases \nand to make tax reduction decisions that will be good decisions for \nmany families in this country.\n  Are there some things in this piece of legislation that I don't like? \nSure. There are probably some of them I don't yet know about.\n  Watching this crowd work on budget issues is a lot like taking your \ncar to a garage. Once they lift your hood and tell you what they are \ncharging you for, you do not have the foggiest idea what they are \ntalking about. Some of that same mentality can certainly be true about \nthe budget negotiations here in Congress because they are down there \noutside the regular committee process making deals. And I am sure that \nI will discover things that give me heartburn and stomach ache with \nrespect to what they have put in this legislation. So, will there be \nsome things that I don't like? Yes.\n  But, in the main, have we succeeded in pushing and pushing the kind \nof agenda that is important for this country? Have we expanded health \ninsurance for 5 million kids? Have we provided a $500 tax credit that \ngoes to working families--yes, all working families? Have we improved \nyour ability to pass on a family farm or a small business to your sons \nand daughters who want to run it with the estate tax changes that are \nin this piece of legislation that Senator Daschle from South Dakota \nworked on and that I worked and others have worked on? Have we helped \nyou to more easily send your kid to college and get tax credit for \ndoing so, helped working families so that their kids have the \nopportunity to go to college? Have we done all of these things? The \nanswer is: yes, we have.\n  Are they going to be helpful? I think so.\n  So I come to the floor today feeling that we are moving in the right \ndirection and we are making the right decisions. Frankly, I am one who \nbelieves that the ability for the Republicans and Democrats to get \ntogether and work together and have common goals together for the \nfuture of this country is good for this country. Sometimes we should \nfight over things, and we do. We fought, for example, over the question \nof whether a family that is going to make $25,000 a year working full \ntime should have access to the $500-per-child tax credit. Some in \nCongress said, absolutely not, because they are not paying much of an \nincome tax. We said absolutely that they should get it, because they \nare paying taxes--significant payroll taxes. So we fight about those \nthings.\n  But I am pleased to say that in the main much, much more of what we \nfought for is going to be in this conference agreement. I think the \njoining of the issues today on these range of issues in this budget \nagreement will spell good news for this country.\n  Let me finally mention one additional point. As we proceed to do \nthese things on both the spending side and the tax side of this budget \nreconciliation agreement, it is very, very important that all of us \ndecide that the budget deficit still matters, and at the first sign of \nratcheting up a budget deficit once again, this Congress must take \naction. What we hope will happen is that this agreement will continue \nthe economic growth we have had, and to the extent it does, that we \nwill have a balanced budget not only in the year 2002 and perhaps even \nbefore, but also in subsequent years thereafter.\n  But when and if it appears that expenditures will exceed revenues--\nthat we will run a deficit--then this Congress must be prepared to take \naction to stop it, because balanced budgets are important.\n  Now we have some room to provide some capability of tax cuts and some \nother things in the budget agreement that makes some sense for the \nAmerican families. But American families most of all understand that \nbalancing the budget is what will give them confidence in this economy. \nThey know that balancing the budget is what will give this country the \nchance to grow and to provide jobs and to provide hope for all \nAmericans, now and in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on the agreement \nthat has now been reached between negotiators on the budget and tax \npackage. That agreement will soon be before us.\n  I would like to put what has happened in some historical perspective. \nI have been reading and listening to the commentary over the last \nseveral days of how we got to the position we are in today, in which we \ncan consider significant tax relief and continue on a path to balance \nthe unified budget by the year 2002.\n  I think we have to go back to 1993 when President Clinton came into \noffice and faced a $290 billion deficit he had inherited from the year \nbefore. I think we have to go back to the economic plan that he laid on \nthe table to get our fiscal house in order and to lay the basis for \nstrong economic growth.\n  When we go back to that period, I think we remember the situation we \nconfronted. Deficits had been growing, were out of control. There were \nmany who wondered if the best years of the United States were behind \nus.\n  The President put out an economic plan that proposed cutting \nspending. It also proposed higher taxes on the wealthiest among us, \nasking the wealthiest 1 percent in this country to pay higher income \ntaxes. That plan passed the Congress. In fact, it passed in this body \nonly because the Vice President of the United States broke a tie and \nvoted in favor. There were those on the other side of the aisle who \nsaid this plan, which was going to raise taxes on the wealthiest and \nwas going to have spending cuts, was going to crater the economy. They \nsaid at the time it was going to increase unemployment; it was going to \nreduce economic growth. All these bad things were going to happen.\n  Now we can look back and see what has really happened. None of the \nbad things came true. Instead, what we have seen is really a remarkable \neconomic record.\n  Just with respect to the deficit, the so-called unified deficit, it \nwas $290 billion in 1992 and came down every year under that economic \nplan. This year, the most recent projection was $67 billion, but even \nthat is now outdated. We are now told that the deficit this year may be \n$45 billion, or may be as little as $30 billion.\n  So the fact is that the economic plan which passed in 1993, a 5-year \nplan, has exceeded every expectation. The deficit has come down each \nand every year under that economic plan and come down sharply. In fact, \nwe are close to balancing the unified budget without any additional \naction. According to the\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nOffice of Management and Budget, if one looks at long term savings, \nwhat one sees is the savings from the 1993 deficit reduction package \nare $2 trillion over 1994-2002. The budget agreement that the Senate \nwill consider tomorrow is about $200 billion, about one-tenth as much. \nSo if we go back and look at what made a difference here, the 1993 \neconomic plan is the reason we have seen such dramatic deficit \nreduction and is the reason why we are in a position now to have tax \nrelief for hard-pressed American taxpayers.\n  It is very interesting to go back and review the record of what has \nhappened in this economy since that 1993 economic plan was adopted. By \nthe way, it is the only economic plan that was adopted during that \nperiod. It was adopted without any help from the other side, and now we \ncan look at the record.\n  The misery index. We used to talk a lot about the misery index. That \nis the combined rate of unemployment and inflation. The combined rate \non July 14, 1997: 8.7 percent, the lowest average since the Johnson \nadministration. That is a long time. Inflation: 2.8 percent per year, \nthe lowest average since the Kennedy administration.\n  Employment. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said when we \npassed the 1993 plan--it is still ringing in my ears--I remember a \nSenator on the other side of the aisle saying this was going to crater \nthe economy. It was going to increase unemployment. It was going to \nreduce economic growth. It was going to be devastating. Well, we can \nnow look back and see what happened. Employment has increased by 12.5 \nmillion new jobs--the only administration to exceed 11 million in our \nhistory.\n\n  Deficit reduction. I have already talked about that. We have seen the \nunified deficit go from $290 billion to this year perhaps as little as \n$45 billion. Maybe even less. Business investment has grown at 10.5 \npercent a year, the fastest growth since the Kennedy administration.\n  The stock market. We all know what has happened to the stock market. \nIt has gone from 3,242 on January 20, 1993, when this President took \noffice, to 7,922 on July 11 of this year. Now we know it is over \n8,000--the fastest growth since World War II.\n  And the poverty rate. The poverty rate in this country has declined \nfrom 15.1 percent in 1993 to 13.8 percent in 1995--the largest drop \nsince the Johnson administration. Median family income has gone up \n$1,600 between 1993 and 1995--the fastest growth since the Johnson \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I recall this history because I think it is important. \nIt is important to understand what has worked in terms of economic \npolicy. Some said in 1993, if you raise taxes on anybody in this \ncountry, that will have a devastating economic impact.\n  They were wrong. They were simply wrong. I believe the reason they \nwere wrong is because the benefits of deficit reduction to the economy \nfar outweighed any negative consequences. No question, when you raise \ntaxes that creates some drag in the economy. But it also had a \nbeneficial component. The beneficial component was that deficit \nreduction took pressure off interest rates because we really did reduce \nthe deficit.\n  The fact there was a move to ask the wealthiest 1 percent in this \ncountry to pay more in income taxes combined with the spending cuts of \nthe 1993 plan meant the deficits came down. That meant there was less \nGovernment borrowing. That took pressure off of interest rates. \nInterest rates came down. In fact, we know every 1 percent reduction in \ninterest rates takes $128 billion a year off this economy. That is \nlower borrowing costs for businesses, lowering borrowing costs for \nfarmers, lowering borrowing costs for individuals. And that made a \nprofound difference in this economy. It helped this economy reignite. \nAnd, again, since 1993, we see the results--not only this dramatic \ndecline in the deficit as a result of that economic plan, but also a \nremarkable resurgence of economic growth, savings, and investment. \nWe've seen the lowest level of core inflation in 31 years, and in May \nthe lowest unemployment rate in 24 years. That is a remarkable economic \nrecord.\n  Some who are listening will say, well, Senator, you can't attribute \nthis all to the 1993 plan. Fair enough. You cannot attribute it all to \nthe 1993 plan because economic conditions are a result of not only \nfiscal policy but monetary policy as well. But make no mistake, the \naccommodative monetary policy we have had as a result of Federal \nReserve Board decisions, follows the fiscal policy decisions that were \nmade in 1993. That is not just my opinion. Alan Greenspan, the head of \nthe Federal Reserve, says that himself. He has indicated that much of \nthe strength we have seen in the economy can be attributed directly to \nthe 1993 economic plan.\n  I think if one is fair and objective one would say, no question, this \neconomic resurgence in terms of Government policy is a combination of \nfiscal policy that was passed by Congress in 1993 and the monetary \npolicy that the Federal Reserve Board has followed since that time. But \nwhat made possible those Federal Reserve decisions was the fact that we \nbit the bullet, that we took action to reduce the deficit. Because we \ntook that action in fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve Board \nresponded with accommodative monetary policy, the result has been this \nremarkable economic resurgence.\n  There are other factors as well, but in terms of Government policy, \nwhat Government can do to affect outcomes, there is no question. The \nrecord is absolutely clear. The 1993 economic plan worked and worked \nremarkably well to strengthen this economy.\n  Mr. President, I look forward in the coming days to discussing this \neconomic package that has now been agreed to by negotiators. I look \nforward to talking about the spending side of the ledger as well as the \ntax side of the ledger, the agreement that will be before us tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, pending the approach to this Chamber of \nour distinguished chairman and the original sponsors of some \namendments, including the Senator from Minnesota, let me note the \nenvironment of Santa Claus in July.\n  It seems a lot of us are not here this morning. Instead, they are out \nselling their homes so they can make that $500,000 and go back home and \nlive comfortably. We have the so-called agreement for a balanced \nbudget. What a wonderful instrument. Everyone with a home can make up \nto $500,000 from this agreement. Couples in the $110,000 bracket and \nbelow would get $600. And,\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nof course, the rich will all get richer with the capital gains tax \nreduction.\n  My comment is to bring a note of reality. It is somewhat like when \nyou are up to your neck in the swamp with the alligators and the \noriginal intent was to drain the swamp. Here, the original intent, of \ncourse, is to balance the budget and get us out of the red and into the \nblack. And, of course, let's see exactly where we are at the present \ntime.

1997 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook, May 19, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it was projected on May 19 by the \nCongressional Budget Office that the actual deficit for this fiscal \nyear would be $180 billion. Now, I hasten to add that the picture has \nimproved. We find that the revenues are coming in even better than what \nwas originally anticipated. So the actual deficit, if it stays on \ncourse, would be down to $140 billion and, if it continues, let's say \nit would be right at $100 billion next year. That is what I was told \nthis morning by those at the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Now, the unified deficit that everyone refers to is down to under $40 \nbillion and could be balanced next year. The term ``unified'' is, of \ncourse, just a shibboleth for, ``don't bother, we are just running \naround spending all the pension funds, which we made illegal in 1990.'' \nWe are spending the pension funds to allocate against the deficit \nitself.\n  So what is really happening is that we are on the course, under the \nunified deficit, toward getting into the black. But it is not on \naccount of passing anything here this week in the midst of this \nwonderful jubilation atmosphere that everybody won this morning with \nthe agreement last night. The truth of the matter is that we are on \ncourse as a result of the 1993 budget plan, whereby we on this side of \nthe aisle, without a single vote on the other side of the aisle, voted \nfor real deficit reduction that worked. I emphasize the fact that it \nwas this side of the aisle, because we were told that if we increased \nthe Social Security tax, they would be hunting us down like dogs in the \nstreet and shooting us. I am one of the dogs to be shot in the street. \nThey said that we were going to have a catastrophe and a depression, \nnot just a recession, and all sorts of other things, which were totally \noff-base.\n  Without a single vote on the other side, we cut some $255 billion in \nspending, increased taxes $241 billion. We increased taxes on the \nhighest income tax bracket. We increased gasoline taxes. We increased \nSocial Security taxes. We eliminated over 250,000 Federal jobs and \nreduced the size of the Government itself, and it is working. I guess, \nby way of emphasis, the point is that the thrust here today and last\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\nnight is to stop the bickering and to show that we can get together. \nThis Senator would say, in the extreme, of course, let's continue the \nbickering because, with the bickering, we are bound to get, under a \nunified budget, the Government back into the black. Stay the course.\n  In fact, I offered an amendment earlier this year to not cut any \ntaxes and not increase any spending. Now, what has been done in this \nparticular agreement? Well everybody admits we are spending more than \n$100 billion more than we are taking in. If that's the case, what you \nwant to do is cut spending and increase your revenues. Instead, we \nincreased spending some $52 billion, under this agreement last night, \nand we cut the revenues--instead of $85 billion, we cut the revenues \nsome $90 billion.\n  So, as a result of the 1993 budget agreement and enactment, we are \nmomentarily on course, having reduced the deficit each year for 5 \nyears. Yet you are hearing shouts in the halls that, ``this is the \nfirst tax cut since 1981.'' We ought to say we got the first tax cut \nsince the disaster of 1981, because the result of 1981, of Reaganomics, \nis that we are still spending over $100 billion more than we are taking \nin. So we are still in the red. The debt increases, the interest costs \nincrease. So, under this so-called balanced budget agreement, the debt \ncontinues to grow, and our Government continues to borrow more and more \nmoney.\n  We are talking now about how we helped families with the child credit \nand by cutting taxes, but, in actuality, we have increased the taxes \nfor children because we, the senior citizens, are going to move right \nalong and leave them with the bill.\n  My distinguished chairman is here. I will be able to elaborate, Mr. \nPresident, in a more appropriate fashion at an appropriate time. I \nthink there ought to be a note of sobriety with the ``Santa Claus in \nJuly'' that we are now experiencing here this morning that everybody \nwon. The truth of the matter is that we have changed course, once \nagain, to cutting taxes and increasing spending. Under a budget of that \nkind, there is no way for us to get really into the black and start \nreducing that debt and the carrying charges that are some $285 billion \nmore than back in 1981. We are spending $285 billion more in interest \ncosts than we were in 1981 for absolutely nothing.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, would realize, if we had that $285 billion, we could \nsatisfy every subcommittee chairman on the 602(b) allocation, we could \nbuild many bridges, we could do all the research at NIH we need, we \ncould double the President's request on education; we could have better \nhousing, highways, and everything else of that kind. So that is not the \ncase. I think what we ought to do is look at the reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8211-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8213-S8215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1024 through 1031, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT \n                   PAYMENTS TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (A) it reaffirmed the importance of universal service \n     support for telecommunications services by passing the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996;\n       (B) the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the Federal \n     Communications Commission to preserve and advance universal \n     service based on the following principles:\n       (1) Quality services should be available at just, \n     reasonable, and affordable rates;\n       (2) Access to advanced telecommunications and information \n     services should be provided in all regions of the Nation;\n       (3) Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-\n     income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost \n     areas, should have access to telecommunications and \n     information services, including interexchange services and \n     advance telecommunications and information services, that are \n     reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban \n     areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \n     comparable to rates charged for similar services;\n       (4) All providers of telecommunications services should \n     make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the \n     preservation and advancement of universal service;\n       (5) There should be specific, predictable, and sufficient \n     Federal and State mechanisms\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\n     to preserve and advance universal service; and\n       (6) Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health \n     care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced \n     telecommunications services;\n       (C) Federal and state universal contributions are \n     administered by an independent, non-federal entity and are \n     not deposited into the Federal Treasury and therefore not \n     available for Federal appropriations;\n       (D) the Conference Committee on the Balanced Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1997, is considering proposals that \n     would withhold Federal universal service funds in the year \n     2002; and\n       (E) the withholding of billions of dollars of universal \n     service support payments may result in temporary rate \n     increases in rural and high cost areas and may delay \n     qualifying schools, libraries, and rural health facilities \n     discounts directed under the Telecommunications Act of 1996:\n       Now, therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997 should not \n     manipulate, modify, or impair universal service support as a \n     means to achieve a balanced Federal budget or to achieve \n     Federal budget savings.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from North Dakota \nfor highlighting the case against including the Universal Service Fund \nin our budget reconciliation process. This is bad public policy. It is \nunfair to the residents of rural America. I hope that today the Senate \nwill take a strong stand against it.\n  The Universal Service Fund is comprised of private fees assessed to \nour Nation's telecommunications carriers. Over the last 60 years, this \nfund has made it possible for every resident in the United States to \nhave access to telecommunications services. It represents a national \nguarantee that wherever you decide to live and work and raise a \nfamily--even if it is in one of the most remote areas of our country--\ntelecommunications services will be affordable.\n  Although universal service is a Federal guideline, there are no \nFederal tax dollars involved in the Universal Service Fund. Moreover, \nthe fund is administered by a nongovernmental agency that operates on \nthe simple notion that carriers in low cost urban areas contribute more \nso that carriers who serve residents of high cost rural areas can \nprovide affordable service. The administration of this fund has worked \nso well that most Americans do not even know it exists and take for \ngranted the low rates for basic telephone service we all currently \nenjoy.\n  The principle of universal service represents one of our Government's \nmost sacred and successful agreements with the American people. It \nguarantees those who live in rural areas the same access to \ntelecommunications services as those who live in urban areas and is a \nmajor contributor to the rapid development and growth our rural areas \nare currently experiencing. Many parts of my home State of South \nDakota, quite frankly, may not have been settled were it not for this \nguarantee, and I am very concerned that the budget deal may \ninadvertently undermine the Universal Service Fund.\n  Under the budget agreement concluded last night, the Universal \nService Fund will be used to mask a $2 billion hole in the Federal \ndeficit in fiscal year 2002. This sets a dangerous precedent. This \nprivate fund should not be incorporated into the Federal budget \nprocess, and the affordable rates it guarantees should not be left \nvulnerable to budget whimsy.\n  Throughout the past year, I have worked closely with Senator Dorgan \nand many other colleagues to impress upon the administration the value \nof ensuring equitable and affordable access to telecommunications \nservices in rural areas. While administration officials have been \nlargely receptive to this argument, the decision to put the USF on \nbudget raises questions about some policymakers' understanding of rural \nconcerns.\n  I am greatly troubled that placing the Universal Service Fund on \nbudget will create a dangerous precedent that could raise rates in \nrural America and endanger our Government's 60 year promise of \naffordable telecommunications service to all areas of this country. The \nprinciple of universal service represents a sacred agreement between \nthe Government and its citizens. It must not be undermined by budget \ngames.\n  The Dorgan amendment puts the Senate on record that the use of these \nfunds in the budget process is wrong, and I strongly urge its approval.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan Amendment, \nwhich expresses the view of the Senate that the universal service \nsupport system which keeps telephone service affordable; should not be \nturned into a piggy bank which can be raided to produce an illusory \ndeficit reduction.\n  The Conferees working on the Reconciliation Conference report are \nconsidering legislation which for the first time would manipulate the \nuniversal service support system for budgetary gains. This would be a \nterrible precedent which could drive up phone rates, especially for \nrural Americans.\n  In 1996, the Congress enacted dramatic reform in the laws which \ngovern the organization of America's telecommunications markets. The \nlaw was intended to introduce competition into all telecomm markets and \npreserve universal service.\n  The bargain was that competition would replace regulation but that \nall carriers would share the responsibility for providing universal \nservice.\n  The idea of Universal Service is profound. It is one of the most \nfundamental principles of telecommunications law and economics. The \nconcept was introduced in the original Communications Act of 1934 which \npromised ``to make available to all Americans a rapid, efficient, \nnationwide and world-wide wire and radio communications service . . .''\n  From 1934 to 1996, regulation and monopoly were the primary means of \nensuring telephone services to all Americans. In 1996, the Congress \nembraced the idea that competition would best deliver \ntelecommunications services to all Americans at affordable rates.\n  The Congress also recognized that there were some markets which \ncompetitive companies would not serve and some areas where costs are so \nhigh that rates would drive citizens off of the phone network. In those \nmarkets, universal service support would keep comparable services and \ncomparable rates available in rural and urban areas.\n  The principle of universal service is that all Americans should have \nmodern, efficient and affordable communications services available to \nthem regardless of where they live.\n  In the aftermath of the break-up of AT, a system of intercompany \npayments were established to assure that competition in long distance \nservices did not drive prices for local phone service through the \nroof, especially in rural areas.\n\n  Universal service support is not a subsidy, and it is not a tax. It \nis a shared cost of a national telecommunications network.\n  What makes the American phone network valuable is that almost anyone \ncan be reached. Affordable phone service is not just important to the \ncitizens of rural America, it is of value to the citizens who live in \nurban areas who need and want to reach Americans in rural areas.\n  The basic bargain of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was that the \ngates of competition would open, provided all telecommunications \ncarriers contribute to the support of universal service. Under the act, \nsupport would be sufficient, predictable, and the burdens would be \nshared in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n  To assure that all Americans shared in the benefits of the \ninformation revolution, the Congress also adopted the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment which provided for discounts to \nschools, libraries, and rural health care facilities. The bottom line, \nMr. President was that no American would be left behind.\n  If certain budget negotiators have their way, many Americans will be \nleft behind.\n  The precedent that the reconciliation conferees have under \nconsideration is dangerous because it attempts to undermine the promise \nof sufficient and predictable support for universal service. It does so \nto gain a mere bookkeeping advantage in the effort to reach a balanced \nbudget by 2002.\n  If the universal service support system is manipulated for this \npurpose, consumers lose. They will get higher rates and lower service.\n  By adopting the Dorgan amendment, the Senate can send a clear message \nto conferees that affordable phone service is important to all \nAmericas. The very system which assures affordability\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nshould not be jeopardized by an attempt to avoid the real choices \nnecessary to produce a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1028\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n       At the end of the section in title I regarding the ``WAIVER \n     OF CERTAIN VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS'', insert the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(b) Report.--The Attorney General, in conjunction with \n     the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and State, shall \n     report to Congress within 6 months of the date of enactment \n     of this Act on how to establish an enforcement program to \n     ensure that immigrants who receive waivers from the \n     immunization requirement pursuant to section 212 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act comply with the requirement \n     of that section after the immigrants enter the United States, \n     except when such immunizations would not be medically \n     appropriate in the United States or would be contrary to the \n     alien's religious or moral convictions.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1029\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, this amendment extends the crime law trust \nfund through 2002 at the funding levels of the budget agreement.\n  This amendment has the same effect as the Biden-Gramm-Hatch amendment \npassed by the Senate 98 to 2 on June 27, 1997.\n  Let me point out just one practical effect of my amendment. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee reported major youth violence legislation \nlast week--this Hatch-Sessions bill calls for $1.5 billion from the \ncrime law trust fund in 2001 and 2002--this is almost one-half of the \ndollars to fund a new Republican youth violence block grant.\n  Now, I do not agree with many of the specifics of this block grant \nand I look forward to debating these issues on the floor.\n  But, the bottom line is real simple--if we do not pass this \namendment, there will be no trust fund in 2001 and 2002, and so, there \nwill be no youth violence block grant in 2001 and 2002--no matter what \nform this block grant ultimately takes.\n  And, it is the same for prisons, 100,000 cops, and violence against \nwomen. If we do not pass my amendment, there will be no trust fund in \n2001 and 2002, and there will be no more funding for prisons and no \nmore to fight violence against women.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that I believe that there \nare Budget Act points of order which could be lodged against my \namendment. I say that just so all of us are clear about my amendment. I \nwould move to waive such a point of order were it raised. I just want \nmy colleagues to understand this fact as we pass this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1030\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Community Policing to Combat \n                       Domestic Violence Program)\n\n       On page 29, line 18, insert ``That of the amount made \n     available for Local Law Enforcement Block Grants under this \n     heading, 10,000,000 shall be for the Community Policing to \n     Combat Domestic Violence Program established pursuant to \n     section 1701(d) of part Q of the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968: Provided further,'' after \n     ``Provided,''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1031\n\n       On page 65, on line 25 after ``expenses'' insert the \n     following: Provided further, That the number of political \n     appointees on board as of May 1, 1998, shall constitute not \n     more than fifteen percentum of the total full-time equivalent \n     positions at the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Withholding, and I do not intend to object, I \nunderstand it is pretty well worked out, but there was one language \ninclusion.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is all done.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1024-1031), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going to have some further \ndiscussion on this bill, the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations \nbill, and I understand there are at least a couple of votes. This \npackage of amendments has eliminated four of the votes. In fact, I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw amendments Nos. 992, 996, 997, and 998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 992, 996, 997, and 998) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just for the information of the Members, we \nare now down to what appears to be final passage, plus potentially four \nvotes. Hopefully, we can reduce that further. We are certainly going to \nwork on that. And then we can complete the bill. I understand we are \ngoing to proceed to these votes and final passage around 3:15. That is \nthe plan presently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8213-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8215-S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me speak briefly on the budget \nagreement which was reached late last night, and mention my thoughts on \nthis. This agreement is obviously not everything that everybody wanted. \nBut it is a giant step in the right direction. It is especially a giant \nstep on the issue of cutting taxes for the working American family, or \nthat group of Americans in the middle-income brackets who are \nstruggling with the costs of raising children and sending those \nchildren to college.\n  For a family whose income is in the range of $32,000 or $35,000, this \ntax cut could well represent a tax cut of almost 50 percent for a \nfamily of four. That is a big tax cut. For that same family, should \nthey have a child who is headed off to college, this could represent a \ntax cut of up to 75 percent. That is a huge tax cut.\n  In addition, if you are in a working family situation and you are \ntrying to make ends meet, you are going to be able to take advantage of \nthis child credit coming to you to help you support the cost of raising \nyour children--$500 per child. And all of these tax cuts that I am \ntalking about are directed at middle-income Americans. In fact, almost \nall of them phase out as you get into incomes over $100,000.\n  Further, if you are a family where one of the spouses is staying at \nhome to try to raise your children, under today's law, you can't have \nan IRA account that is deductible. That stay-at-home spouse can't have \nan IRA account that is deductible. Under this bill, the mother that is \nhome raising the children will have the opportunity to have an IRA \naccount that will be deductible and safe for her retirement. That is a \nmajor step forward.\n  In addition, there is a significant estate tax savings, especially \nfor small business people and for farmers. Estate tax savings, which \nmeans that when somebody works all their life to build up a grocery \nstore, a restaurant, or a gas station business, or some other small \nbusiness, they are not going to lose that business to taxes when they \ndie. They are going to be able to pass on that business to their \nchildren. That is very important.\n  So this is a major step forward. It is the first significant tax \ncut--it is the first tax cut for middle-income Americans in 16 \nyears. It should have been done a long time ago. But it has taken a \nRepublican Congress and a commitment of a Republican Congress to have \nthis as our No. 1 goal, and a commitment to accomplishment. While we \nhave accomplished this tax cut, we have at the same time put in place a \nspending pattern which controls the rate of growth of Federal spending \nso that we can reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. We may even \nreach it before that, according to present estimates. But that was \nanother major goal of this Republican Congress--to balance the budget.\n\n  So we have done two very significant things here. We have balanced \nthe budget, and we managed to cut taxes\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nfor working Americans, and especially for working Americans who have \nfamilies to raise. That is good news. Is it everything we want? Of \ncourse not. I would like to see more action in the area of Medicare, \nfor example. But the will wasn't there--both at the White House and, \nunfortunately, in the other body. But as a practical matter, the \nspending restraints in this bill are very significant.\n  The rate of growth in spending in this bill is approximately one-half \nof 1 percent over the next 5 years in discretionary nondefense \naccounts--one-half of 1 percent. That is the lowest rate of growth of \nspending that has occurred in the last 20 years in this Government in \nthe area of discretionary accounts. That is significant. Because we \nhave that low rate of growth of spending on the discretionary side of \nthe ledger, we are able to bring into balance the budget agreement of \nthis Government by the year 2002. We will have to go back and we will \nhave to revise the issue of Medicare. There is no question about that. \nThat remains a big issue of public policy. But within the Medicare \naccounts we made some very substantive and positive changes in this \nbill.\n  In the spending package is the proposal for Choice Care. Choice Care \ngives seniors approximately the same type of options which we as \nMembers of Congress have--the ability to go out into the marketplace \nand choose from a variety of different health care plans. The practical \neffect of that is to bring the market forces into play to control the \nrate of growth of the cost of Medicare and, at the same time, give \nseniors much more choice, many more options, in the way they get their \nhealth care provided. Choice Care is a very positive, substantive, \nlong-term reform for the Medicare system, and it is in this bill. So \nthere were significant steps taken in that account, too.\n  But, most importantly, you have to return to the fact that not only \ndo we balance the budget, but we give these very significant tax cuts \nto working Americans--especially working Americans who are trying to \nraise a family. Isn't it about time? This is relief that is long \noverdue. As this Government finally gets its fiscal house in order, as \nwe move toward a balanced budget, who should be the recipient of that \npositive event, of that good fiscal management? Well, the people who \npaid for the Government should be the recipient of that.\n  That is what this bill essentially does. It turns back to those folks \nwho are paying the cost of the Government some of their hard-earned \ndollars so that they can make the decision as to how they are spent \nrather than having that decision made here in Washington. We do not \nhappen to believe, those of us who support this tax cut, that the \nFederal Government is a better manager of your dollars if you are \nrunning a household than you are. We think that if you have money to \ndecide how you want to raise your children and to use it on spending \nfor your children's education, you are going to do a better job of \nspending that in educating your children than if the Federal Government \ntakes your money, brings it here to Washington, and then redistributes \nit to you.\n  So this tax cut is a very important event, and a big win--a big win--\nfor the working American family. Thus, I am certainly hopeful that we \nwill pass this package later this week and make that major step \nforward, or that significant step forward, in assisting families in \nthis country meet the costs of raising kids and see that at the same \ntime we move this Government toward a balanced budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8215-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nhas now arrived.\n  Let me just remind colleagues once again. When we look at the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998--we wouldn't \nput that entire conference report in the Record, obviously. But I ask \nunanimous consent that section 5 on page 4, which only contains some \nseven lines, be printed in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (5) Public debt.--The appropriate levels of the public debt \n     are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1998: $5,593,500,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1999: $5,841,000,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2000: $6,088,600,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2001: $6,307,300,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2002: $6,481,200,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows the public debt for the fiscal \nyear 2001 at $6,307,300,000,000, and it shows for fiscal year 2002 the \npublic debt has increased to $6,481,200,000,000, an increase of $173.9 \nbillion. It does not show a balanced budget. It does not show, I \nemphasize, a balanced budget in the fiscal year 2002. We all know from \nthe agreement last evening that rather than cutting taxes only $85 \nbillion, it was a net tax cut of $90 billion. So we have increased the \nloss of revenue some $5 billion. We also know that the spending under \nthe particular 1998 budget agreed to last evening increased some $52 \nbillion.\n  So what we have done since we made that agreement--and the conference \nreport was adopted last month--is to actually increase spending more, \nand reduce the revenues more. So we know that come the year 2002, we \nwill not have the first balanced budget in 33 years. The document \nitself shows it is in deficit because the debt increases that last \nyear. Why will the debt increase if we had a balanced budget?\n  It is quite obvious that we have not taken significant steps for the \nmiddle class or the working Americans as has been described here. If we \nreally wanted to help working Americans, we could have cut payroll \ntaxes. But the truth of the matter is that we cut capital gains taxes \nfor the rich. We cut the inheritance tax for the rich. So we didn't do \nit for working Americans. We kept that high payroll tax up. We left out \nthe working Americans, and we agreed on both sides to call it balance, \nwhich is a total fraud.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8216-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2209\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1032.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 5  . For fiscal year 1998 and subsequent fiscal years, \n     in establishing the income or assets of an individual who is \n     a victim of domestic violence, under section 1007(a)(2) of \n     the Legal Services Corporation Act (42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2)), \n     to determine if the individual is eligible for legal \n     assistance, a recipient described in such section shall \n     consider only the assets and income of the individual, and \n     shall not include any jointly held assets.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand that this amendment will \nbe accepted. I am very pleased. I think there is strong bipartisan \nsupport for it. We worked very hard to make sure it was kept in \nconference.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for their \nsupport, and Senator Torricelli who is out here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly summarize this amendment. This \namendment essentially ensures that no one who is a victim of domestic \nviolence will be denied legal representation because of the economic \nstatus of her or his abuser.\n  Mr. President, I am saddened to have to really on the floor of the \nSenate make the point that what we have right now in the country is \nsomething close--it is a staggering problem. We have an estimated 4 \nmillion American women who experience a serious assault by a husband or \nboyfriend each year. In 1993 alone, over 1,300 women were reportedly \nkilled by abusive partners or former partners.\n  I want to make it clear that Legal Services has done a wonderful job. \nThey have handled over 250,000 cases involving domestic violence; \n50,000 of those cases involved clients seeking protection from abusive \nspouses.\n  The problem is that all too often those on the receiving end of \ngrants in some cases--I know in Minnesota this happens--they really do \neverything they can and extend the rules or figure out ways of \nproviding legal representation. Most of the time it is for a woman. But \nsometimes what happens in other situations is they don't because it is \na horrible catch-22 situation where the income of the husband or assets \nof the husband which are the assets of the household makes this woman \nwho has been abused and beaten up ineligible for any legal \nrepresentation. By the same token, she can't afford to have legal \nrepresentation on her own, in which case she is without protection. \nThis is critically important. I actually don't think that this is an \nexaggeration to say that this quite often is a life or death situation.\n  So when we are talking about obtaining orders of protection, child \nsupport, and other kinds of protection, this is critically important.\n  I again thank both of my colleagues for their support of this \namendment. I want to thank Senator Torricelli who has been very active \nand a real leader in this area for his support.\n  This is an important clarification. One more time, and I will finish.\n  The legal services community in the country is doing the very best \njob. But, if we had a debate, I would have brought out to the floor \nmany examples--very telling examples--of women who have not been able \nto receive the protection. Legal Services lawyers want to provide it \nbut are not at all clear that they can because of the income of the \nhusband and sometimes the income of a wife. This is a tragedy.\n  This is a huge step forward. It is a very significant amendment. I \nthank both of my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think it is an excellent amendment, and \nit is an appropriate amendment. We have no objection to it.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know that we have amendments. But I \nyield some time to my colleague from New Jersey, who has been a real \nleader in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nyielding. And I want to offer my thanks to Senator Hollings and Senator \nGregg for agreeing to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time that I have joined with \nSenator Wellstone in legislation to help women who are the victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  In the last Congress we successfully led an effort to deny access to \nhandguns to people who have convictions of domestic violence. We return \nhere today because the plague of domestic violence has not abated. It \nis believed that there are 3 to 4 million women every year in America \nwho are subjected to domestic violence. Every 18 seconds another victim \nis struck. Indeed, during the course of a lifetime, half of the women \nin this country will be abused by a husband or a boyfriend or someone \nwith whom they live.\n  One of the tragic ironies of this terrible situation is that in the \nmoment when women need the help of the law the most they are denied. \nThe Legal Services Corporation last year handled a quarter of a million \ncases of domestic violence and yet those women who may have needed the \nhelp the most could not get Legal Services assistance because the \nincome of their husbands, the very people who might be striking them, \nthe person from whom they are seeking a restraining order or a divorce, \nmade them ineligible.\n  The amendment we offer today would eliminate this tragic \ncontradiction. I believe it is a good statement by this Senate, a \nrealistic recognition of a terrible national problem and the ending of \nthis real dilemma for American women, that in the future it can be said \nany woman, regardless of her husband's income, will be able to get \nlegal assistance because of her own vulnerability, based on her own \nlack of resources. So she gets the protection she needs.\n  I am very pleased to be offering this amendment with Senator \nWellstone today and once again offer my thanks to Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think we can go forward with the \nvote. I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Please, I say to both of my other colleagues, this is a very \nimportant amendment. It really is connected to many people's lives, and \nmany of them are women--some men but I am sad to say mainly women. This \nis an extremely important protection that we are now providing to these \nwomen with children. I hope we will keep this in conference committee.\n  I thank, Mr. President, the National Task Force on Violence Against \nWomen and NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, for their help on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time and \nask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1032) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1033\n\n(Purpose: To require the Legal Services Corporation to conduct a study \n   regarding persons prohibited from receiving legal representation \n              regarding efforts to reform welfare systems)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 1033.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 5  . The Legal Services Corporation shall--\n       (1) conduct a study to determine the estimated number of \n     individuals who were unable to obtain assistance from its \n     grantees as a result of the enactment of section 504(a)(16) \n     of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-134:110 State. 1321-55), during the six month \n     period commencing with the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) not later than 30 days thereafter, submit to Congress a \n     report describing the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can be very brief on this. This is \nreally just a study.\n  Basically, what this amendment asks is that as we go forward with the \nwelfare bill and it is implemented in States around the country, the \nLegal Services Corporation compile data on what kinds of appeals might \nbe made by women and their families dealing with the welfare law as it \nis implemented.\n  It is simply a study to document numbers of people who come to them \nwith a variety of different grievances so that we get a clear record of \nwhat is happening. Right now, in many cases, these lawyers are not able \nto take up these cases.\n  This does not mandate anything. It just simply calls for a study.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, and I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1033) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  Is the amendment agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As to this amendment, I think what we want to make \nsure of, whatever differences we have about the welfare bill, what I \nthink is a kind of bipartisan consensus is that it work well as it gets \nimplemented at the State level. And so whether it is food-nutrition \nprograms or whether it is a mother trying to find child care or whether \nsomeone who is in a job training program and trying to stay in that \nprogram or whether it is an issue of public transportation, we want to \nmake sure that all of our citizens, even if they are poor, even if they \nare women and children, have legal representation and that the due \nprocess rights are maintained. I think this study will give us a \nclearer picture as to where we are in relation to these issues.\n  I thank both my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank them for their patience. I \nwas at Justice Brennan's service and that is why I was a little late in \ngetting back.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n   Restrictions on INS Fingerprinting in the CJS Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to raise with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, State, and the Judiciary, an important issue related to \nrestrictions included in the CJS bill that reform the taking and \nprocessing of fingerprints by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService for criminal background checks. At the outset, I would also \nlike to thank Senator Gregg for his work on this issue, which has been \nof significant concern to me as chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee. I know it is also of great concern to the ranking member \non our Subcommittee, Senator Kennedy.\n  In fact, I chaired a hearing on this issue earlier this Congress and \nam considering legislation to address some of the very serious faults \nin the INS's conduct of criminal background checks. I have also raised \nthis issue with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nwho expressed serious concerns--in terms of both quality and \nintegrity--with the INS's use of outside entities to take fingerprints. \nAccordingly, I am pleased that the CJS bill will take us away from the \ncurrent system, although I know that much remains to be done in this \narea.\n  The language in the manager's package will permit fingerprints for \nINS purposes to be taken only by offices of the INS or by law \nenforcement agencies, which may collect a fee for the service of taking \nand processing the fingerprints. The INS has indicated that it is \nmoving to a new fingerprint processing system under which it would take \nall of the fingerprints at INS offices, and has indicated that it can \ndo so without unduly delaying the naturalization process. However, the \nINS will not be able to bring its new system up and running by the \nstart of the next fiscal year. Even with the ability to also utilize \nthe services of law enforcement agencies, I believe that a delayed \neffective date of 9 to 12 months will be required so there can be an \norderly transition to the new system and so that the processing of \nnaturalization applications can continue without complete disruption to \nthe system.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree wholeheartedly with the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, and I share his concerns. The backlog in \ncitizenship applications continues to grow. Without a significant delay \nin the effective date, we will have serious and possibly irreversible \ndisruption in the naturalization process.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis remarks. I would simply like to confirm with Senator Gregg my \nunderstanding that the effective date will be looked at in conference \nso that the effect of this provision can be delayed--I would hope in \nthe range of 9 to 12 months--to an appropriate point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. In conference, we will certainly examine the \neffective date of this provision and modify it as needed to make this \ntransition work.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman in advance for his careful \nconsideration of this issue in conference, and for the modifications to \nthe provision that he has already made. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with him in addressing the very serious problems in the INS's \nprocessing of citizenship applications.\n\n\n             U.S./Israel Science and Technology Commission\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify report language \non page 65 concerning the committee's willingness to permit the \ntechnology administration to undertake certain international economic \ndevelopment initiatives, particularly as it affects the United States/\nIsrael Science and Technology Commission. I have long been a supporter \nof the work of the Commission, a binational program that promotes \neconomic and technological collaboration between the United States and \nIsrael that has already provided numerous benefits to both countries. \nIt was not our intention to affect in any way the current or future \nactivities and operations of the Commission, and I would like to \nclarify with the chairman of the subcommittee that it was not his \nintention either.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8216-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8218-S8219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TEENS, CRIME AND THE COMMUNITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like the attention of my \ncolleagues to point out what I see as an unintentional omission. Last \nyear's Commerce, Justice, State appropriations' conference report \ncontained language which provided $1.0 million for the National Crime, \nPrevention Council's Teens, Crime and the Community Program otherwise \nknown as TCC. The Senate supported this provision last year and it was \nmy intention that it be included in this year's bill. Unfortunately, it \nwas inadvertently left out of the committee report. For my part, I \nbelieve it should be the Senate's intent that funding for The Teens, \nCrime, and the Community Program be included when the bill reaches \nconference.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the ranking member, Senator Hollings, \nbringing this oversight to the Senate's attention. Last year, I \nsupported including this program in the conference report,\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\nand, I agree with the Senator from South Carolina, it should be \nincluded in this fiscal year 1998 bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the Senator's support and would point out \nthat the TCC Program provides a unique curriculum to educate young \npeople about crime risks and prevention with the aim of reducing or \neliminating specific crime problems in their school or community. Over \n500,000 young people in over 1,000 different schools and communities \nall across the country have participated in the program. It has proven \nto be an effective strategy for reducing crime, preventing delinquency, \nand involving youth in community crime prevention efforts.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me conclude by saying that in conference we will seek \nto get the House to agree to provide $1.0 million of juvenile justice \nand delinquency prevention funds for this worthwhile program. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n         SOUTH DAKOTA EMERGENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary, Mr. Gregg, and \nthe ranking member, Mr. Hollings, for their excellent work on the \nfiscal year 1998 Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary appropriations \nbill. They and their staffs have put together an excellent bill and \nshould be commended for their leadership.\n  Let me take a brief moment to explain my intentions regarding \namendment 1004. Its purpose is twofold. First, it makes $100,000 \navailable for a grant to Roberts County, SD.\n  It is clear from my discussions with law enforcement personnel in \nrural areas of South Dakota that few greater priorities exist than to \nensure that South Dakotans have immediate access to emergency services \nwhen necessary. Unfortunately, many rural counties in South Dakota do \nnot have the resources to purchase equipment for a 911 system to \nprovide this capability. It is my intention that these funds be used \nfor the purchase of that equipment and any other functions that must \nnecessarily take place for the establishment of a 911 system in Roberts \nCounty. It is my further hope that in coming years Congress and the \nDepartment of Justice will continue to address the urgent need for \nassistance in the purchase of equipment to provide 911 services.\n  The second purpose of the section is to provide $900,000 to the South \nDakota Division of Criminal Investigation [DCI]. The DCI requires an \nimmediate upgrade of computer and telecommunications equipment in its \nfield offices, new equipment for its forensics lab, and new radio \nequipment to address problems in law enforcement radio transmissions. \nThese funds will be of significant assistance in the provision of this \nequipment for the DCI, and I am pleased that I have been able to work \nwith the committee to meet this need.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nassistance with these important matters.\n\n\n                             FTE INCREASES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the appropriation measure before us \nincludes $363 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service. In \naddition, the Committee recommendation allows for the administration's \nproposed increased of 58 full-time equivalents [FTE's] for the National \nMarine Fisheries Service [NMFS]. The Committee directs the NMFS to use \nas many available FTE's as are needed to ensure the full and timely \nimplementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized in the 104th \nCongress after a long and difficult process of negotiation and \ncompromise. It includes many new provisions to improve the conservation \nand management of this Nation's fishery resources. I appreciate the \ntremendous task the NMFS faces in fully implementing all of the new \nprovisions and requirements we placed on the NMFS and share the \ncommittee's desire to see adequate FTE's allocated to this important \ntask.\n  I am also concerned, however, about the very real need for FTE's to \nimplement the requirements of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], \nparticularly in the Pacific Northwest. With several salmon species \nalready listed under the ESA and an elaborate recovery plant currently \nbeing implemented with a critical decision point rapidly approaching, \nwith habitat conservation plans being negotiated with public utility \ndistricts in central Washington, and additional ESA listings likely \ncoming in the future, the NMFS is in desperate need of both resources \nand personnel to meet its obligations. I appreciate the committee's \nwillingness to fund NMFS efforts in these areas at or above the \nPresident's requested levels. These funds will go along way toward \nsalmon recovery efforts throughout the entire Pacific coast. I would \nlike to emphasize the need for adequate FTE's to be provided to this \nimportant effort. While the committee has correctly directed FTE's to \nthe implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, this allocation should \nnot come at the expense of the agency's ability to undertake salmon \nrecovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Both of these \nresponsibilities of the NMFS are vitally important to Washington State \nand the Pacific Northwest. I urge the NMFS to meet the real need for \nFTE's in both of these areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8218-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8219-S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TIIAP-FUNDING FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that Senate \nappropriators have restored $10.5 million to the Telecommunications \nInformation Infrastructure Assistance Program [TIIAP]. TIIAP is a \nhighly competitive, merit-based, grant program that provides seed money \nfor innovative, practical technology projects across the United States.\n  TIIAP grants help our communities utilize the information \ntechnologies that play an increasingly important role in the world \neconomy. Without access to advanced telecommunications services that \ndeliver education, healthcare, social services, and news, individuals \nand sometimes entire communities are relegated to second-class economic \nstatus. Rural and low income regions that already face difficult \neconomic hurdles are pushed even farther behind because they lack the \nresources to join the information revolution. The Federal assistance \nprovided by TIIAP has already helped many of these areas transition \ninto the information economy.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, TIIAP has helped the city of Crete \npurchase computers to build an access center where adults are taught \ncomputer skills and are given assistance to apply those skills to new \njobs. Through the Nebraska Network for Children and Families, a TIIAP \ngrant provides funding for the Ideas Network. The Ideas Network is an \ninteractive place where Nebraska families and professionals involved in \nthe human services system may find information, dialog opportunities, \neducation resources, advocacy information, and supportive \nrelationships. Specifically, this valuable network is devoted to \nNebraska's foster families, subsidized adoptive families, families of \nchildren with special needs, and human service professionals.\n  TIIAP is a matching grant program. Since 1994, $79 million in Federal \ngrant funds generated investment of $133 million of local funds. \nUnderfunding this productive program would have been a tremendous \nmistake. Without the seed money provided by TIIAP, valuable community \nbuilding projects such as the Ideas Network would not be possible. This \ninnovative program is an important component of better education, \nhealth care and improved community relations.\n\n\n                          Jacob Wetterling Act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I wish to ask my colleague from New Hampshire a question. \nIt is my understanding that the Senator from New Hampshire has authored \nlanguage in this appropriations bill that amends the Jacob Wetterling \nCrimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I have worked hard to address some technical changes \nto this act that I believe will improve the procedure for the \nregistration of sex offenders, and raise States' compliance with its \nprovisions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate your leadership on this important issue, and \nbelieve that you have improved this important law. However, the \nattorney general of Ohio has raised an issue shared by a majority of \nStates that I am compelled to address.\n  Current law under the Jacob Wetterling Act requires that States\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\ncreate a special State board. This board must be composed of experts in \nthe field on the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders, victims' \nrights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement to determine \nwhen someone is a sexually violent predator. Currently, according to \nthe Department of Justice, 37 States would not meet this requirement.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is my understanding. States are given 2 years to \nestablish such a board.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is also my understanding the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is working with the Department of Justice to assure \nthat your proposed language in the bill before us would provide a \nwaiver for impacted States, such as Ohio, who for differing reasons, \nmay not specifically meet the requirements of having a special State \nboard. My State, as well as many others, however, have alternative \nmethods that fairly, efficiently, and scientifically make the \ndetermination when someone is a sexual predator. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Ohio is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Is it my friend from New Hampshire's intention that his \nlanguage would allow for States like Ohio and New Hampshire a waiver by \nthe attorney general in these types of situations?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. It is certainly my intention that the \nU.S. Department of Justice would be as flexible as possible in working \nwith States to determine compliance on this matter.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his fine work \nto ensure States have the administrative flexibility to meet the goal \nof the Jacob Wetterling law.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the $1,675,000 \nrequest for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive \nTechnology [EPSCoT] Program reported in the Senate appropriations bill, \nS. 1022. EPSCoT, which is part of the Commerce Department's Technology \nAdministration, is an important program for our Nation's rural States. \nIts aim is to help foster regional technology-based economic growth in \nthe 18 States that are traditionally underrepresented in Federal \nresearch and development funding.\n  EPSCoT evolved during the 104th Congress from a series of discussions \nbetween the Technology Administration and the Senate Subcommittee on \nScience, Technology, and Space which I chaired along with Senator \nRockefeller, the ranking minority member. Dr. Mary Good, who retired as \nthe Undersecretary of Technology in June, recognized the importance of \ninitiating, maintaining, and enhancing research development and \ntechnology in all States of this Nation. Using the highly successful \nNational Science Foundation Program to Stimulate Competitive Research \n[EPSCoR] as its model, EPSCoT was originated to serve as its technology \ncounterpart. The States are ready to proceed since they can use their \nexisting EPSCoR State network to now help build a strong technology \ninfrastructure throughout this country.\n  This program receives bipartisan support. While EPSCoT will be a \ncompetitive, cost-shared, merit-based grants program, the actual \ndetails are now being worked out through a series of public meetings \nwith representatives from State and local government, regional \norganizations, small businesses, and universities. In June, we held one \nof three regional policy forums in Billings, MT. We heard from the \npeople that will be participating in this program. They provided the \nfeedback and advice about how EPSCoT should be designed to meet their \nunique needs to develop and sustain a long-term technology-based \neconomic infrastructure in the region.\n  A successful EPSCoT program could also provide a mechanism to relieve \nsome of the concerns raised in opposition to the Advanced Technology \nProgram [ATP]. I believe that ATP plays an important role in the \ndevelopment of emerging and enabling technologies critical for \nsustaining a strong economy. However, it has been viewed as providing \ntoo much support to large companies and, as a result of the way \nindustry is now clustered, limiting the support to a few specific \nregions within the country. There is a strong call for wider \nparticipation and greater diversity of partnerships in the Department \nof Commerce.\n  In Montana, 98 percent of the businesses are considered small \nbusinesses. Generally, small businesses do not have the capacity or the \nresources necessary to undertake or maintain the research and support \nactivities which larger businesses and industries maintain as part of \ntheir on-going activities. To the extent that such support exists in \nthese States, it usually comes from local universities. EPSCoT is a \nvehicle to assist the largely rural States to develop regional \nclusters, spin-off companies, and other small high technology \ncompanies. It will help small businesses and industries which are \nemerging in Montana and other rural States to be successful and \nglobally competitive. This program, with sufficient support, will be \nsuccessful in stimulating technology development and transfer. EPSCoT \nwill foster the scientific and technological infrastructure necessary \nfor job creation and economic growth.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I strongly support the funds \nprovided to launch EPSCoT. This is an investment to spur economic \ngrowth in rural areas that are key to an overall healthy American \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to commend \nthe members of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor including $1,675,000 for the Experimental Program to Stimulate \nCompetitive Technology [EPSCoT] in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations \nrequest. This program model is based on the successful National Science \nFoundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research \n[EPSCoR].\n  EPSCoR has a strong track record in helping to promote quality \nresearch in States, like West Virginia, that are traditionally under \nrepresented in Federal research and development funding. EPSCoT is \nintended to promote similar activities for technology transfer.\n  This is a wise investment with bipartisan support. Senator Burns and \nI have discussed this concept and its potential, and we have sought the \ncomments of leaders in our states and regions.\n  Technology plays a vital role in economic growth. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, experts widely believe that \ntechnological progress is responsible for up to one-half of the growth \nof the U.S. economy and is one principal driving force in long-term \neconomic expansion and increases in our Nation's standard of living. \nGiven this compelling point, it is essential to ensure that technology \nis successfully transferred to business and industry in every region, \nincluding those regions which historically are under served. Our Nation \nwill not thrive if some regions are left behind in the key sectors of \nR or technology transfer.\n  The National Science Foundation's EPSCoR program has considerably \nhelped States enhance their capacity for research and development. The \nDepartment of Commerce is now looking to use this successful model for \ntechnology transfer. It is important to note that this initiative has \nbeen debated and considered for quite some time. Commerce officials \nhave worked closely with Governors and U.S. Innovation Partnership.\n  As a longstanding advocate for EPSCoR, I am enthusiastic about the \npotential for this new Commerce initiative, EPSCoT, to effectively \nbuild partnerships at the State level and promote technological \nadvances that will lead to long-term growth in regions of our country \nthat traditionally have been left behind. I am confident that West \nVirginia and other States can benefit enormously by such a targeted \nincentive program. This appropriations is a good start in the right \ndirection on technology transfer.\n\n\n               Funding of the Patent and Trademark Office\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just take a moment to discuss the \nimportant issue of the funding of the Patent and Trademark Office [PTO] \nthat is contained in the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nappropriations bill that the Senate will vote on later today. As my \ncolleagues know, Mr. President, the PTO has been entirely funded by \nuser fees for several years now. Not one cent of general taxpayer\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nmoney goes to the operation of that vital office. Thus, it is my belief \nthat all the money generated by the user fees should be available for \nuse by the PTO.\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years, increasingly large amounts of \nmoney have been diverted from the PTO. The patent surcharge, which was \ninstituted to make the PTO self-funding, has been the target of this \ndiversion. That is why I was very pleased when the surcharge, which is \nscheduled to expire after fiscal year 1998, was not renewed. I had \nadvocated that it not be renewed and, with the support of Senators \nDomenici and Lautenberg, the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, it was not.\n  In addition to the surcharge, this bill contains new PTO funding \nissues. First, the bill set aside $20 million to fund an office called \nthe Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property Policy, \nshould such an office be created. This office does not yet exist but is \nadvocated by the administration, which seeks to add it to my Omnibus \nPatent Act, S. 507. I am negotiating with the administration with \nregard to the possible creation of such an office. But one thing seems \nclear: if that office is created, it will not need a budget of $20 \nmillion. Thus, I cosponsored an effort by Senator Lautenberg to reduce \nthat amount.\n  I want to thank both Senator Lautenberg for his efforts and Senator \nGregg for agreeing to modify that provision. Instead of $20 million, \nthe bill now sets aside an amount up to 2 percent of the PTO budget. \nThat is a maximum of about $14 million. That is a more realistic \nnumber, and, I suspect that, should the office be created, it would not \neven need that much.\n  The second new issue raised by this legislation deals not with the \nsurcharge, but with the base fees. In the past, the PTO has been \npermitted to collect and spend whatever amount of base fees is \ngenerated in a given year. This is logical, since increased filings \nwill increase work for the PTO but also generate more money with which \nto do that work. But this bill sets a cap on the base fees that PTO may \nnot exceed, regardless of how much they collect. This is of serious \nconcern to me, Mr. President, as it risks leaving the PTO with an \nincreased workload but with insufficient funds to conduct proper patent \nexaminations and trademark registrations.\n  The House Appropriations Committee did not set a similar cap. Rather, \nthe House has continued the standard practice of allowing the PTO to \nspend whatever the base fees happen to generate. Mr. President, the \nlanguage in the Senate version risks leaving the PTO unable to perform \nits vital task of protecting the work of Utahns and all other American \ninventors. I urge the conference committee to adopt the House language \nand not impose a new cap on the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Mr. President, I led the fight for the balanced budget amendment. In \nbalancing the budget, it is unjust to force American inventors to bear \na greater burden than the ordinary taxpayer.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this morning I learned from the mayor of \nthe Village of Owego of a problem he is having with the village's share \nof the local law enforcement block grant. As we are concluding the \ndebate on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill today, I \nthought it might be appropriate to bring the matter to the attention of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina. I \nintend to pursue the matter with the Justice Department, but I may need \nto ask their help at some point.\n  Mayor Hogan informs me that after recently receiving a letter from \nthe director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance concerning the \napplication process for fiscal year 1997 funds, and while filling out \nthe fiscal year 1997 application, village officials discovered that \n1996 funds had been available to them. They had never been notified. A \nBureau official then told them that some requests for applications had \nbeen sent to incorrect addresses. Village officials contacted the \nsupervisor of the nearby Town of Owego, who remembered receiving the \napplication notice meant for the village. However, the application \ndeadline passed 9 months ago. The village lost out on $10,840 through \nno fault of its own.\n  Mr. President, $10,840 may not seem to be a large sum these days, but \nfor the Village of Owego it is. It constitutes three-quarters of 1 \npercent of the village tax base. If three-quarters of 1 percent of the \ntotal Federal receipts for 1998 were at stake, we would be talking \nabout $11.7 billion, and that would have our attention. I hope the \nSenators from New Hampshire and South Carolina will consider assisting \nin this matter if necessary.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would certainly like to be kept informed about the \nsituation, and I hope the Senator from New York will do so.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I too would like to know if the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance can help.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to express my congratulations \nto the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gregg, and Ranking Member, \nSenator Hollings, for a very thorough, fair, and bipartisan Commerce, \nJustice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill. \nIt is my understanding that Chairman Gregg was most respectful of his \nranking member's concerns in drafting this legislation. It is my \nfurther understanding that Chairman Gregg and his staff have embraced \nSenator Stevens' philosophy as chairman of our full committee that \nembodies open disclosure, full cooperation, and respect for the \ninterests of the members of both sides of the aisle. As a result, we \nhave before us an excellent bill, drafted in the spirit of \nbipartisanship with the best interest of our Nation at heart.\n  The appropriation bill before us provides $31.6 billion dollars for \nthe Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related \nagencies. This is an increase of $1.4 billion over current levels. It \nis about one-half a billion dollars below the President's request, \nexcluding the administration's request for advanced appropriations. \nAgain, the committee has demonstrated its commitment toward fighting \ncrime and supporting law enforcement initiatives by providing the \nDepartment of Justice with $17.3 billion in appropriations. When taking \noffsetting collections from fees into account, the Department's total \nresources made available in this bill are about $19.3 billion. Within \nthis amount many important programs are funded, including the \nPresident's COPS on the Beat Program, 1,000 more border patrol agents \nin the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a new block grant \nprogram to address juvenile crime and related programs, and an \nincreased budget for initiatives addressing violence against women. \nAlso included is $3.075 billion for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, an increase of $238 million above the current year. \nFunding increases are provided to complete the new forensics laboratory \nat Quantico, VA, and to combat child exploitation on the Internet. A \ntotal of $1.091 billion is provided for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and $332 million for the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a good bill that I will join \nSenators Hollings and Gregg in supporting. In closing, I commend the \nwork of committee staff. On the majority staff, I acknowledge and thank \nJim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, and Dana Quam for their \nprofessionalism and spirit of bipartisanship. On the minority side, I \nthank Scott Gudes and Emelie East for their many hours of work on this \nbill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I just wanted to thank Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings and their staff for their hard work on this bill and \nespecially for their efforts in the area of crime prevention. Since the \npassage of the Crime Act in 1994, I have worked here in the \nAppropriations Committee and on the Senate floor to provide funding for \nproven crime prevention programs and to maintain a reasonable balance \nbetween law enforcement and prevention. During that time, Senator Gregg \nand I have had our differences over the need for these programs. This \nyear, however, I was very pleased to work with Senator Gregg on this \nissue and these discussions resulted in a total of $75 million for a \nnew program that expands upon the Juvenile Justice Act's title V. This \nprogram gives local communities broad discretion to fund a variety of \ncrime prevention efforts, while guaranteeing that not all of our\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nanticrime effort goes to law enforcement alone. Consistent with this \ninitiative, the Judiciary Committee reauthorized title V in the \njuvenile crime bill reported out of committee last week.\n  While this is a large step in the right direction, some small but \neffective crime prevention efforts that were funded in last year's bill \nhave, unfortunately, been eliminated this year--including the \nPresident's Crime Prevention Council. I look forward to working with \nSenator Gregg and Senator Hollings to address these problems as we move \nforward with this bill.\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings for their support of significant crime prevention \nfunding. In communities across the Nation, their efforts will make a \ndifference in the lives of millions of young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8219-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FOREIGN AFFAIRS REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

I wanted to comment with respect to the usual smoke and \nmirrors of this year's budget. I wish, of course, our distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Stevens], was still in the Chamber because he \ninitiated the actual spectrum auctions discussion for the simple reason \nthat we have pretty well drained the pot there.\n  On our last auctions, billions were expected, but we only received \nmillions. Some of those bidding have now been put into receivership and \nhave not responded to their particular bid. So we know now that under \nthis particular agreement, when it calls for some $26.3 billion to come \nfrom spectrum actions, we will be lucky to get half of that amount. \nThere again is more smoke and another mirror.\n  Specifically, they who designed it agreed that it was smoke and it \nwas a mirror in that they then backed it up with the universal service \nfund provision. This, of course, is a private fund, gotten together by \nthe particular entities in communications where they measure each month \nthe amount of traffic that they have had and the amount necessary to go \ninto the universal service fund. It is a private fund, and there is a \nquestion legally whether you can even account for it. I don't know how \nCBO would score it, but we know that the agreement between the \nPresident and the leadership last evening leaves this space blank. \nBecause, whatever is needed and is not allowed by the Congressional \nBudget Office in its measurement with respect to spectrum auctions, \nthey then put into that particular blank space, whether it is $3 \nbillion, $4 billion, $5 billion or otherwise.\n  The entitlement cuts, of course, are back loaded with 75 percent of \nthe entitlement cuts to occur the last 2 years. And, of course, the \nmost smoke and the biggest mirror of all is using, if you please, \npension funds to make the budget appear balanced. Actually, we spend \nthe money out of the pension funds. We spend the money out of Social \nSecurity; we spend the money out of the military retirees' fund; we \nspend the money out of the civil service retirees' fund; we spend money \nout of the airport and airways trust fund; we spend money out of the \nhighway trust fund, and allocate that in the accounting to what they \ncall a unified budget to make it look or appear balanced.\n  That is the most smoke, that is the biggest mirror, that is the \nbiggest shibboleth that is accepted by the free press. I don't know \nwhether those in journalism ever had an arithmetic course, but the \nquestion is whether are you spending more than you are getting in each \nyear in Government. At the State level, we measured it more \nspecifically. We had to not only to balance the budget but also have \nreserves before Moody's and Standard & Poor's and other groups would \ngive us our AAA credit rating. We have that in my particular State, but \nno such approach is used here at the Federal level. They use, \ncontinually, the smoke, the mirrors, and the biggest one of all which \nis to include, by the year 2000, over $100 in trust fund surpluses to \nmake the budget appear balanced.\n\n  So I think this completes my comments on the reality of this \nparticular budget agreement that is called balanced when the very \nauthors themselves know there is no chance of it being balanced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8222-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

The pending business is amendment No. 1022, \noffered by the Senator from Alabama on behalf of the Senator from New \nYork, Senator D'Amato, to bill number S. 1048.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set that \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are now resuming consideration of the \nfiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill under a unanimous-\nconsent agreement reached last evening. I believe this is important \nlegislation that will have very significant effects on every State in \nthis Union. It sets a record-high obligation ceiling on Federal highway \nspending. It provides the resources for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the U.S. Coast Guard to operate our Nation's airways \nand waterways safely and efficiently.\n  Mr. President, it increases, again, our commitment to improving \nhighway safety in this Nation. We want to finish our deliberations on \nthis bill and pass it, if we can, and I ask now for the cooperation of \nall my colleagues in the Senate who have the option to offer amendments \nunder the consent agreement and have not yet brought them to our \nattention. I would like for them to come to the floor with their \namendments.\n  Later, I intend to seek a unanimous-consent agreement that all \namendments must be offered this evening, that we debate any amendments \non which there is disagreement this evening, and that we have a final \nvote tomorrow. Accordingly, I encourage all Members desiring to speak \non the bill on any of the amendments that they propose to come to the \nfloor as soon as possible.\n  Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments--we have a list of amendments and some of them we have \nworked out and will be stricken. If I could, I would like to go through \nthe list of the ones that we worked on and we will not have to \nconsider. First is the Hollings amendment on the list; the Graham \ntransit amendment; the Durbin amendment; two amendments by Senator \nEnzi; the Mack amendment; one of the Abraham amendments; the Bond \namendment--two of the Bond amendments. I believe that would take care \nof a number of them. Some of the other amendments still will be before \nus, we hope, in some form soon or will be disposed of in some way.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this has been cleared on this side. \nTherefore, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No objection is heard to the agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1048, the \nTransportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  The Transportation appropriations bill may be the most important of \nall the appropriations bills. It establishes the Federal investment \nlevel in our Nation's highways, airports, passenger, rail, and mass \ntransit systems. I have spoken many times on the Senate floor regarding \nthe importance of maintaining and improving the Nation's physical \ninfrastructure. Our economy is highly dependent on the efficient \nmovement of goods and people. Congestion and capacity constraints on \nour Nation's highways and delays at our airports cost the U.S. economy \nbillions of dollars each year in lost productivity. But while the \nestimated costs associated with congestion grow each year, our Federal \ninvestment in infrastructure has continued to decline significantly.\n\n  Indeed, since 1980, our national investment in infrastructure has \ndeclined, both as a percentage of our gross domestic product and as a \npercentage of our Federal budget. The bill before the Senate today \nseeks to reverse the destructive trend of Federal disinvestment. Most \nimportantly, as far as this Senator is concerned, the Federal aid \nhighway obligation ceiling will rise to a historic high of $21.8 \nbillion, an increase of more than $3 billion, or 17 percent. Our \nNation's airports will enjoy a 16-percent increase in Federal funding \nfor critical capital and safety improvement projects, an increase of \n$260 million.\n  Now, Mr. President, these additional highway funds are sorely needed \nin all States of the Nation. Indeed, the historic $3 billion increase \nis still only one-fifth the size of the increase that the Federal \nHighway Administration estimates would be necessary to cease \ndeterioration in the condition of our National Highway System. Put \nanother way, if we wanted to see a net improvement in the condition of \nour roads and bridges, we would be required to provide an increase in \nexcess of $15 billion in the bill, or a total of almost $37 billion. \nUnfortunately, the restrictions that have been placed on domestic \ndiscretionary spending through the Federal budget process preclude us \nfrom providing such an increase through this bill. But I still want to \ncommend the managers for making our Federal investment in highways a \npriority in the development of this bill.\n  These highway funds are not the only critical investments in this \nbill. The Transportation appropriations bill includes our entire annual \ninvestment in critical safety programs in all modes of transportation. \nThese include investments to maintain and modernize our air traffic \ncontrol system, programs for the prevention of drunk driving, funding \nfor rail safety inspectors and motor carrier inspectors, as well as \nprograms of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the \nNational Transportation Safety Board.\n  Mr. President, when one considers the costs to society in terms of \nthe thousands of lives lost each year through accidents involving our \ntransportation system, the devastation is great. Whether it be highway \ndeaths, or airline disasters, or train accidents, it matters little to \nthose who lose their lives, or to those who are permanently disabled, \nor to their families, as to which mode of transportation was involved. \nWe simply must do all that we can to reduce the death and the \ndestruction that occurs annually in our various transportation systems.\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\n  In doing so, we not only save lives, we also save the billions of \ndollars that these accidents cost the economy each year in terms of \nproperty damage and lost productivity, as well as the health care \ncosts--and they are often long-term--associated with these tragedies.\n  I believe it is necessary to point out, Mr. President, that it will \nrequire a two-step process for us to get increased highway construction \nfunding, as well as highway safety funding to our States. This \nappropriations bill is the first step, but it will be equally essential \nfor us to pass the surface transportation authorization bill in the \nvery near future. Our major Federal highway construction, highway \nsafety, and mass transit programs are set to expire in less than 10 \nweeks' time. As has been the usual convention, the annual \nappropriations bill sets an obligation limitation on these highway \nconstruction, highway safety, and mass transit programs.\n  But it is the responsibility of the authorizing committees--the \nCommittees on Environment and Public Works and Commerce and Banking--to \nprovide the necessary contract authority so that these programs will \ncontinue beyond September 30. I know it has been the stated desire of \nthe majority leader to bring such an authorization bill before the \nSenate as soon as possible. And I am one of many Senators who anxiously \nawait an opportunity to debate a new surface transportation \nauthorization bill on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Shelby for his excellent work in his \nfirst year as chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee. He held a \nthorough and informative set of hearings at the beginning of the year. \nI was pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in some of \nthem. And I also commend Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, who, as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, toiled diligently to ensure that the budget resolution \ntreated transportation as an important budget priority for the coming \nyear.\n  Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg have continued to act in the \ncooperative bipartisan fashion that has always characterized the \nworkings of the Transportation Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, these Senators, who act as managers of a bill as \nimportant as this is, put an immense amount of time into their work. \nThey conduct thorough hearings. They work with able staff. They conduct \nmarkups on the bill at the subcommittee level, and the bill is \ngenerally approved by the Appropriations Committee. The bill has \nusually emanated from the subcommittee, and seldom does the full \ncommittee make changes in those subcommittee actions that go into the \nformulation of the bill.\n  I know that Senator Shelby has worked hard, and he has done a good \njob, as did Senator Lautenberg when he was chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee. They are both highly dedicated to their \nwork, and they are both very well respected. And I want to commend both \nof these Senators. They are working in the best interests of the \nNation. They are working in the best interests of the States that make \nup the Nation. And they are working in the best interests of the future \nand the people who will depend upon adequate modes of transportation \ntoday and in the future.\n  I also want to thank the Presiding Officer. I note that he listens to \nwhat Senators are saying. And that is important. He is alert to what is \ngoing on, on the floor. He is alert to what is being said. He is not \nworking crossword puzzles. He is not signing his mail. He is not \nreading a book. He is busily engaged in the business of presiding. So I \ncompliment all of these whose names I have mentioned.\n  As I think of the work that is done by Senator Shelby and Senator \nLautenberg, I used to be the chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee a good many years ago. I was instrumental \nyears ago in helping to get the first appropriations for the \nmetropolitan transit system here. That was before most Senators were \nMembers of this body. But I saw the need for a transportation system in \nthe District of Columbia to serve the metropolitan area, and I \nsupported mass transit throughout the years. When I was chairman of the \nfull committee, I did not come to bury mass transit. I came to praise \nmass transit and to save mass transit and to help mass transit. I am \nsorry to say that I have not been accorded the same reciprocity toward \nhighways, especially from some of the Members of the other body. I \ndon't mention names because that is against the Senate rules.\n  But we are all working for the Nation. And when we work to improve \nthe transportation of the Nation, we work to build the Nation's \nprosperity. We work for the increased safety of those who travel, and \nwe work for the young men and women who will be the leaders of the \nNation in years to come.\n  It reminds me of a bit of verse by Will Dromgoole. One might think \nthat that author was a man. The name is Will, but it was a woman.\n\n     An old man traveling a long highway\n     Came at evening, cold and gray\n     To a chasm vast and wide and steep,\n     With waters rolling cold and deep.\n     The old man crossed in the twilight dim;\n     The sullen stream held no fears for him.\n     But he turned, when he reached the other side.\n     And he built a bridge to span the tide.\n\n     ``Old man,'' said a fellow pilgrim standing near.\n     ``You are wasting your strength in building here.\n     Your journey will end with the passing day,\n     And you never again will travel this way.\n     You have crossed the chasm deep and wide;\n     Why build you a bridge at eventide?''\n\n     The builder lifted his old gray head.\n     ``Good friend, in the path I have come,'' he said,\n     ``There followeth after me today\n     A youth whose feet must pass this way.\n     This chasm, which was but naught to me,\n     To that fair youth might a pitfall be.\n     He, too, must cross in the twilight dim.\n     Good friend, I am building this bridge for him.''\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I saw a very interesting article in \nFriday's Washington Times that has brought to surface the truth that is \nso often avoided around here concerning our state of readiness in our \nNation' defense system.\n  As the chairman of the readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I have had occasion to visit many, many of the \ninstallations around the country. I have been in the European theater, \nmost of the installations in England, Italy, Hungary, and, of course, \nseveral times to Bosnia, Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base; Fort Hood, TX; \nFort Bragg, NC; Corpus Christi Navy Air Base, and several others. What \nI am finding is that there are very serious problems they are facing.\n  Mr. President, I know you are aware, as chairman of the personnel \nsubcommittee, of some of these problems and how they are affecting our \nstate of readiness. One of the contributing factors, of course, is our \ncontingency operations. We have two serious problems with contingency \noperations. First of all, they are very expensive. We had occasion to \nnarrowly lose our resolution of disapproval in order to keep our troops \nfrom being sent over to Bosnia here back in December 1995--only by four \nvotes. And one of the determining factors was they said it would be a \n12-month operation, which we all knew better, but they also said that \nthe cost of the operation would not exceed $2 billion, it would be \nsomewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion. At that time we felt, with \nmission creep and the fact it was easy to go in and very difficult to \ncome out, that it would cost more.\n  Well, sure enough. We are up there now, close to $7 billion it is \ngoing to cost us.\n  Where does that money come from, Mr. President? It comes from our \nreadiness accounts. This has become a very serious problem.\n  The other problem is that it is using up our troops, keeping them \nfrom being\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nable to be trained properly should an emergency come along, should some \ntype of war operation become necessary to face. I have been going \naround, and they have been bringing out problems such as equipment is \nwearing out well before its projected lifetime, excessive usage of \nspare parts, pushing our people so hard they no longer have time to \ntrain. At almost every unit I saw maintenance personnel cannibalizing \nperfectly good, new equipment to keep other equipment working, which \nmay solve the problem for today but it is very labor intensive by the \ntime they get the machines working again.\n  An Air Force maintenance officer told me, ``Our lack of spares has \ncaused us to cannibalize perfectly good engines to keep others \noperating, requiring my maintenance troops to work even more hours to \nkeep our planes flying. Our normal workweek is now 50 to 56 hours a \nweek.''\n  With regard to OPTEMPO--when we talk about OPTEMPO, we are talking \nabout the tempo of operations--an F-18 squadron commander told me, \n``The high OPTEMPO at which our personnel are operating is definitely \ncausing a strain on our people's families and the strain also affects \nmy pilots' job performance.''\n  We know our retention is low. In my State of Oklahoma, we will \nspend--we actually save $86,000 a primary student. That is the savings. \nImagine what it costs to put someone in training. Right now the \nairlines are coming along and taking some of our very best. And the \nones I talked to, Mr. President, do not want to leave. They want to \nstay in. They are soldiers, they are fighters, but they have to do it. \nAnd their family situation is demanding that they do.\n  An Air Force F-16 squadron commander said, ``The number of days we \nfly to support Bosnia doesn't leave us with enough time to train. The \nonly areas where we get training from our Bosnia missions is in \nreconnaissance and close air support. The rest of our training areas \nare suffering.''\n  This goes on and on. An Air Force C-130 squadron commander told how \nthey are now up to 160 days in their TDY as opposed to their goal of \n120.\n  Now, what does this do? It is quite obvious. When you talk to the \nservices, you give them choices. You say, well, if you are going to \nhave to take money to put in these contingency operations, it is going \nto either have to come out of force strength, readiness, quality of \nlife, or modernization. Those are the only four areas over which we \nhave control. And I can tell you that each one of the chiefs has said \nwe cannot take any more money out of any of these areas.\n  Now, there is an assumption around here that somehow we have a state \nof readiness that would allow America to protect itself in two regional \ncontingencies. I can tell you right now that this is not the case. In \nfact, it has been stated by most of the chiefs now that we could not \nfight today the Persian Gulf war.\n\n  I will just read a couple excerpts from the article that came out \nFriday morning. It is the first time I have seen it in print. It was in \nthe Washington Times Friday morning. It said, ``The Air Force is \nsuffering from pilots who have lost faith in their generals, jet \nengines that still don't work after repairs, and maintenance depots \nwith little quality of work being produced. Pilots complain of poorly \nequipped fighter wings, too much time away from their families, and air \npatrol types of missions that do little to hone their air combat \nskills.'' And it goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks the article of Friday morning be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. In conclusion, Mr. President, right now I think we are \nfacing a very serious threat. I know there are people in this Chamber \nwho would like to believe that the cold war is over and that there is \nno longer any real serious threat out there when, in fact, as I have \nsaid several times before, I am not the only one who looks back \nwistfully at the days of the cold war; at least then we had two \nsuperpowers and we had an idea of what the Soviet Union at that time \nhad. We could predict what they were going to do. They have a more \npredictable type of personality. Our intelligence knew more about what \ntheir capabilities were. Today we have 25 or 30 nations out there, run \nby the type of people who murder their own grandchildren, and here we \nare in a position where we could very easily be challenged in two \ngeographic areas.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope as we progress here and as we follow \nthrough the rest of the year we can change some of the attitudes in \nthis Chamber and over in the other Chamber and in the White House as \nconcerns our ability to defend America.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nAir Force Leaders Lose Pilots' Faith--Pentagon Memo Details Low Morale, \n                              Shoddy Work\n\n                         (By Rowan Scarborough)\n\n       The Air Force is suffering from pilots who have lost faith \n     in their generals, jet engines that still don't work after \n     repairs and maintenance depots with ``little quality or \n     quantity of work being produced,'' according to an internal \n     Defense Department memorandum.\n       The draft memo, a copy of which was obtained by the \n     Washington Times, paints a troubling picture of the state of \n     American air power.\n       It says Air Force pilots are in the dumps, fleeing the \n     service at a rate higher than aviators in the Army, Navy or \n     Marines.\n       ``Many pilots expressed great distrust of the senior \n     leadership,'' said the memo prepared for Louis Finch, deputy \n     undersecretary of defense for readiness. The memo calls the \n     Air Force cadre of instructor pilots ``a very disgruntled \n     group.''\n       The memo didn't spell out why the senior leadership, \n     including Air Force Secretary Shelia Widnall and Gen. Ronald \n     Engleman, the chief of staff, has failed in the eyes of \n     pilots.\n       But the service has been hit by a series of public-\n     relations disasters, including the Khobar Towers terrorist \n     bombing that killed 19 service members and the attempted \n     court-martial of Lt. Kelly Flinn. Pilots complain of poorly \n     equipped fighter wings, too much time away from their \n     families and air patrol-type missions that do little to hone \n     air-combat skills.\n       ``Discussions with fighter pilots reveal a great deal of \n     dissatisfaction with the ongoing deployments,'' the memo \n     says. ``There is no training, they are not doing what they \n     are trained to do, they are simply `boring holes in the sky.' \n     Combining this lack of mission satisfaction with increased \n     airline hiring makes civilian life much more attractive.''\n       In what should be a troubling finding for safety officials, \n     the memo states that nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of \n     engines for the giant C-5 cargo jet are returning from repair \n     shops still malfunctioning.\n       It says two major depots in California and Texas are caught \n     up in the battle between Congress and President Clinton over \n     whether they should stay open. A nonpartisan base-closure \n     commission recommended closing the air-logistics centers in \n     Sacramento, Calif., and San Antonio and transferring the work \n     elsewhere.\n       But last year Mr. Clinton, making what critics say was a \n     political decision to garner votes in two large states, said \n     the bases would be handed over to civilian companies.\n       Said the Pentagon memo, ``Due to the ongoing political \n     contest regarding privatization, there is little quality or \n     quantity of work being produced. Both workers and plants are \n     underutilized. Further, the operational units are not \n     satisfied with the products received from the depots.''\n       It is the San Antonio depot that is sending out \n     malfunctioning C-5 jet engines, the memo states. ``Currently, \n     there is a 65 percent reject rate of the engines coming back \n     from [San Antonio],'' it states. ``The quality is getting \n     better though.''\n       Dated yesterday, the memo seems to bolster complaints from \n     pro-defense conservatives in Congress. They contend the \n     Clinton administration is underfunding the armed forces at \n     the same time it deploys troops at a high rate around the \n     world.\n       Robert Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said \n     the report shows the negative effects of cutting defense \n     spending by more than 30 percent the past five years.\n       ``The sad state of Air Force readiness can be blamed on the \n     Clinton administration, which treats the military as a toy to \n     be deployed for meals-on-wheels-type missions without due \n     consideration for its impact on readiness,'' said Mr. \n     Maginnis, an analyst at the conservative Family Research \n     Council.\n       ``Depots are caught in never-never land between \n     privatization, base closures and status quo,'' he said. ``The \n     results are devastating.''\n       Maj. Monica Aloisio, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the memo \n     is a ``trip report'' periodically done on all four branches. \n     The Pentagon readiness office uses such reports in making \n     budget recommendations.\n       The Air Force declined comment, saying the report is still \n     in draft form.\n       The report was based on site visits by defense officials in \n     June to warplane squadrons, repair depots, the Air Force \n     entry-level pilot school and an air-refueling unit.\n       It draws a particularly negative portrait of pilot morale \n     at the Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air \n     Force Base, Texas.\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n       The inspection report calls Randolph a ``poor training \n     ground for future pilots.''\n       ``The instructor pilots at Randolph are sick of high \n     `OPTEMPO' [operational tempo],'' says the memo. ``Most said \n     that they came to Randolph as a three-year break from being \n     gone from home too much on deployment. Most of the pilots \n     also said that they will be getting out of the Air Force as \n     soon as their commitment is over.\n       ``The pilots liked the quality of the mid-level leadership, \n     but totally disliked their senior leadership. They stated \n     that they did not trust senior leadership and that things are \n     getting worse. In general they felt they were lied to, \n     betrayed and treated very poorly.''\n       Officers at the 940th Air Refueling Squadron complained of \n     excessive training.\n       ``Everyone complained that the number of days of mandatory \n     training per year should be capped and purged of everything \n     that is not mission essential or job critical,'' the memo \n     said. ``All of the politically correct, brainwashing, \n     propaganda and white laboratory mouse training should be \n     purged from the curriculum.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, just a few thoughts about the budget \nagreement. There is still a lot of drafting going on, so to a certain \nextent I think all of us are at a little bit of a disadvantage in that \nwe have not seen all of the specifics, but I would like to raise a \ncouple of questions about this agreement, and I raise these questions \ngiven what I think is the important standard of fairness.\n  First of all, I hope that all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nwill have before them the distributional data, that is to say some \nunderstanding as to who will benefit from these tax cuts, before we are \nasked to vote on the tax-cut part of this bill. It seems to me this is \nkind of a prerequisite for good public policy. I remain very skeptical \nthat, indeed, these tax cuts, when you look at who is really going to \nbenefit with each passing year, will not disproportionately go to those \npeople who are least in need of any assistance. At the same time, I see \na tradeoff that seems quite unacceptable. Every single time it looks \nlike low-income and moderate-income families get the short end of the \nstick. I think we should set the bar at a higher level, and I think \nthose families should count. Let me just give but a couple of examples.\n  Mr. President, the child credit, we are now hearing from the White \nHouse, will go to families with incomes under $30,000 a year or under \n$28,000 a year, the argument being that, indeed, these families pay \nSocial Security taxes and they should receive a child credit as well as \nthose families with incomes over $30,000 a year. But, as it turns out, \nfamilies with incomes under $16,000 a year are not going to receive any \nchild care credit. I have had a chance to travel some around the \ncountry and visit with poor children, visit with low-income families. I \ndon't understand how in the world we could be talking about fairness \nif, in fact, those families are not going to receive any of the child \ncare credits, those families most in need.\n  Another example is on the higher education piece. I have said this \nover and over again, and I hope I am wrong, but I don't think I am. I \nwas a teacher for 20 years. I spent a lot of time at the community \ncolleges. Mr. President, if the tax credits are not refundable, then \nthose students or those families with incomes under $28,000 a year or \n$27,000 a year, that are not going to have any tax liability, they are \nnot going to receive any of the assistance. So when it comes to those \nstudents who have been least able to afford higher education, they are \nstill going to be waiting for some of this assistance.\n  Add to that some of the concerns that I think all of us have to have \nabout the cuts or reductions in payment in Medicare and medical \nassistance, in particular those of us--and I come from such a State--\nwhere we have strong rural communities. We have to worry about the \nnegative impact this is going to have on rural health care providers. \nIf we don't have hospitals or clinics, then we are not able to deliver \nthe care out in our communities. We have to have concerns about the \ndisproportionate effect this is going to have on our children's \nhospitals and public hospitals that have received a disproportionate \namount of medical assistance because they serve a disproportionate \nnumber of low-income and moderate-income people.\n  So, the question really becomes: Where is the standard of fairness if \nthe tax cuts still, in the main, go to the very top of the economic \npopulation and at the same time the benefits don't go to many, many \nhard-pressed families? We have not invested, in this budget agreement, \none penny in rebuilding crumbling schools. As it turns out, families \nwith incomes under $16,000, with children, receive no help by way of \nthe child credit. Those students from families with incomes $23,000, \n$24,000, $25,000 a year are not going to benefit from the Hope \nscholarship unless it's a refundable tax credit. We are not investing \nin the schools, and at the same time we don't even have the \ndistributional data on who exactly is going to benefit from these tax \ncuts.\n  So I count myself as a skeptical Senator. And if I was going to be \nvoting today, I would vote against this package. I do not think it \nmeets the Minnesota standard of fairness. I think we should do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays on the Kyl amendment No. 995 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my \nfriend from Arizona.\n  As a preliminary matter, I should say that I would have hoped that \nthis amendment would not be necessary. I do not believe there is any \nreal difficulty in reconciling the provision from last year's omnibus \nappropriations bill prohibiting the use of judiciary's funds to pay for \nspecial masters appointed pre-PLRA with the PLRA's requirement that \nmasters be paid only with such funds. I believe this can easily be done \nwithout violating the intent of the PLRA's authors, including my friend \nfrom Arizona and myself, that the PLRA's compensation and other \nrequirements be applied to pre-PLRA masters.\n  The way to reconcile them is clear: the court can either proceed \nwithout a special master, or it can appoint a new one--or reappoint an \nold one--in the manner specified by the PLRA, thereby making the master \neligible for payment under the terms of last year's rider. Indeed, in a \ndiscussion at the end of the last Congress, the distinguished chairman \nof the CSJ Appropriations Subcommittee and I agreed that this was the \nintended interpretation of the appropriations provision.\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n  Nevertheless, some courts have instead used this provision as one \nbasis for concluding that the compensation requirements, and even \nspecial masters provisions other than the compensation requirements, do \nnot apply to masters appointed pre-PLRA, or even in some instances to \nmasters appointed post-PLRA in pre-PLRA cases.\n  Let's look at the continuing saga of the Rikers Island jail in the \nBenjamin versus Jacobson case. The basic issue there is whether, as a \nresult of the PLRA, the court will allow Rikers to store its mops right \nside up or upside down, and whether the jail has to use Borax in a \nparticular concentration to clean certain public areas or whether it \nshould be allowed to use a different concentration, or even a different \ndetergent. Or to put the question a little more seriously, the issue \nthere is whether within the constraints of the Constitution, New York \nCity will be allowed to run its jail according to what it, rather than \nan unelected special master, believes is sound prison policy.\n  This year, Judge Baer--whose earlier handling of the central aspects \nof this case was frankly a model of judicial restraint--issued an order \nrequiring New York City to continue to fund the special master's office \nat approximately $275,000 a year, pay for office space, and provide a \ncar and a parking space. The order even specified that the car had to \nbe of a certain type and quality.\n  Judge Baer had earlier held that the PLRA required dissolution of the \nconsent decree that had been governing Riker's for years, but the court \nof appeals stayed that order pending appeal. Thus, the order retaining \nthe special master on the old terms was issued in a case that predated \nthe PLRA, but where it was clear by its own terms that the order \nappointing the master had expired. Moreover Judge Baer had previously \nupheld the constitutionality and retroactivity of the other provisions \nof the act.\n  For all these reasons one would have thought it clear that even if \nlast year's prohibition were construed to allow the court to impose the \ncosts of pre-PLRA-appointed masters on the States, the act's \nlimitations on special masters should be applied to the reappointment \nof this one. Nevertheless, without holding the special masters \nlimitations unconstitutional, Judge Baer simply declined to follow them \non the theory that the court of appeals stay of his original order \nupholding the other provisions of the PLRA was a mandate for him to \npreserve the status quo in all respects.\n  I think the real lesson of this and many other decisions regarding \nthe PLRA's limitations on prospective relief, as well as many of the \ndecisions concerning the new habeas provisions, is that judges, like \nother human beings, tend to resist change. What, after all, is the old \nmaxim that statutes in derogation of the common law shall be strictly \nconstrued, if not a fairly blunt statement that courts will construe \nany ambiguity in favor of their own ways of doing things?\n  By clearing up what may seem to some an ambiguity, the amendment of \nmy friend from Arizona removes one possible source of authority to \nwhich a court can turn in an effort to exercise broad powers through a \nspecial master while making the State or locality whose powers are \nbeing usurped foot the bill.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased to support his amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment applies to only a few States \nthat have been found liable for violations of civil rights or \nconstitutional rights of prisoners in their prisons before enactment of \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are about 35 special \nmasters supervising prison conditions that might be affected by this \namendment, although the Administrative Office of the Courts expects \nthat number to be reduced to 28 by October 1.\n  Why should Congress and Federal taxpayers be required to bail out \nthese few States for their poor prison conditions, unconstitutional \ntreatment, and history of noncompliance with their own consent decrees?\n  The Congressional Budget Office and Administrative Office of the \nCourts estimate that this amendment will cost the Federal Treasury \nabout $3 million this year. Why should U.S. taxpayers bail out a few \nStates for one of the costs of bringing their state prison conditions \nup to constitutional standards? Will we next be asked to pay for the \nother remedial aspects of the decrees that have been agreed to by State \nofficials? If States want flexibility to use some of the billions of \ndollars for prisons that the Federal Government has made available to \nthe States since passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994 to help defray these costs and expenses, I \nwould support that.\n  This amendment raise constitutional concerns because it retroactively \nand statutorily seeks to overturn consent decrees where States have \nagreed to foot the bill for a special master to monitor their poor \nprison conditions and implementing remedies to bring them up to \nconstitutional standards. Why should Congress overturn decrees already \nagreed to by the States involved in these lawsuits over poor prison \nconditions? Why should Congress intervene when these matters are \nalready being reviewed by newly assigned judges in these cases?\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act, which was included in last year's \nomnibus spending bill, has been construed by the courts not to be \nretroactive in order for it not to be held unconstitutional. This \namendment crosses that line and seeks to extend certain questionable \nprovisions of that law back in time and have them apply to cases that \nit was not designed or intended to cover. It will lead to additional \nconstitutional challenges.\n  This amendment would bail out a few States by taking money from the \nFederal Judiciary's administrative account. That account pays for \nimprovements in computers in courtrooms, teleconferencing, and other \nservices that make the administration of justice more effective and \nefficient. Why are we taking money away from improving the \nadministration of justice to bail out these few States?\n  Mr. GREGG.

Sense of the Senate with Respect to Slamming. (a) \n     Statement of Purpose.--The purposes of this statement of the \n     sense of the Senate are to--\n       (1) protect consumers from the fraudulent transfer of their \n     phone service provider;\n       (2) allow the efficient prosecution of phone service \n     providers who defraud consumers; and\n       (3) encourage an environment in which consumers can readily \n     select the telephone service provider which best serves them.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward \n     competition in the long distance market, consumers have \n     increasingly elected to change the company which provides \n     their long-distance phone service. As many as fifty million \n     consumers now change their long distance provider annually.\n       (2) The fluid nature of the long distance market has also \n     allowed an increasing number of fraudulent transfers to \n     occur. Such transfers have been termed ``slamming'', which \n     constitutes any practice that changes a consumer's long \n     distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent.\n       (3) Slamming is now the largest single consumer complaint \n     received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal \n     Communications Commission. As many as one million consumers \n     are fraudulently transferred annually to a provider which \n     they have not chosen.\n       (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of \n     these fraudulent switches threaten to rob consumers of the \n     financial benefits created by a competitive marketplace.\n       (5) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat \n     this problem by directing that any revenues generated by a \n     fraudulent transfer be payable to the company which the \n     consumer has expressly chosen, not the fraudulent transferor. \n     Recently the Federal Communications Commision has exercised \n     its proper authority to implement this rule. Eliminating the \n     financial incentive to slam will reduce this problem.\n       (6) While the Federal Communications Commission has \n     proposed and promulgated regulations on this subject, the \n     Commission has not been able to effectively deter the \n     practice of slamming due to a lack of prosecutorial resources \n     as well as the difficulty of proving that a provider failed \n     to obtain the consent of a consumer prior to acquiring that \n     consumer as a new customer. Commission action to date has not \n     adequately protected consumers.\n       (7) The majority of consumers who have been fraudulently \n     denied the services of their chosen phone service vendor do \n     not turn to the Federal Communications Commission for \n     assistance. Indeed, section 258 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 directs that State commissions shall be able to enforce \n     regulations mandating that the consent of a consumer be \n     obtained prior to a switch of service.\n       (8) It is essential that Congress provide the Federal \n     Communications Commission, law enforcement, consumers, and \n     consumer agencies with the ability to efficiently and \n     effectively prosecute those companies which slam consumers, \n     thus providing a deterrent to all other firms which provide \n     phone services.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Communications Commission should, within 12 \n     months of the date of enactment of this Act, promulgate \n     regulations, consistent with the Communications Act of 1934 \n     which provide law enforcement officials dispositive evidence \n     for use in the prosecution of fraudulent transfers of \n     presubscribed customers of long distance and local service; \n     and\n       (2) the Senate should examine the issue of slamming and \n     take appropriate legislative action in the One Hundred Fifth \n     Congress to better protect consumers from unscrupulous \n     practices including, but not limited to, mandating the \n     recording and maintenance of evidence concerning the consent \n     of the consumer to switch phone vendors, including a \n     requirement for third-party verification, establishing higher \n     civil fines for violations, approving the Federal \n     Communications Commission's exercise of its authority to \n     provide by rule for slammed consumers to be exempt from any \n     payment requirement, and establishing a civil right of action \n     against fraudulent providers, as well as criminal sanctions \n     for repeated and willful instances of slamming.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Department of Commerce and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n\n                        TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY\n\n                   Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For expenses necessary for the operation of the Supreme \n     Court, as required by law, excluding care of the building and \n     grounds, including purchase or hire, driving, maintenance, \n     and operation of an automobile for the Chief Justice, not to \n     exceed $10,000 for the purpose of transporting Associate \n     Justices, and hire of passenger motor vehicles as authorized \n     by 31 U.S.C. 1343 and 1344;

Berg's dedication to the United States \n     Government was further exhibited by his desire to become a \n     United States citizen, a goal that was achieved in 1981, 35 \n     years after he began his commendable service to the United \n     States; and\n       (3) Since 1949, John H.R. Berg has been employed by the \n     United States Embassy in Paris where he is currently the \n     Chief of the Visitor's and Travel Unit. And, this year has \n     supported over 10,700 official visitors, 500 conferences, and \n     over 15,000 official and unofficial reservations; and\n       (4) John H.R.

Berg has just completed 50 years of \n     outstanding service to the United States Government with the \n     United States Department of State.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--Therefore it is the sense of the \n     Senate that John H.R.

Sense of the Senate That the Federal Government \n     Should Not Manipulate Universal Service Support Payments to \n     Balance the Federal Budget. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds \n     that--\n       (1) it reaffirmed the importance of universal service \n     support for telecommunications services by passing the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996;\n       (2) the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the Federal \n     Communications Commission to preserve and advance universal \n     service based on the following principles:\n       (A) Quality services should be available at just, \n     reasonable, and affordable rates.\n       (B) Access to advanced telecommunications and information \n     services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.\n       (C) Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-\n     income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost \n     areas, should have access to telecommunications and \n     information services, including interexchange services and \n     advanced telecommunications and information services, that \n     are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban \n     areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \n     comparable to rates charged for similar services.\n       (D) All providers of telecommunications services should \n     make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the \n     preservation and advancement of universal service.\n       (E) There should be specific, predictable, and sufficient \n     Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \n     universal service.\n       (F) Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health \n     care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced \n     telecommunications services.\n       (3) Federal and State universal contributions are \n     administered by an independent, non-Federal entity and are \n     not deposited into the Federal Treasury and therefore not \n     available for Federal appropriations.\n       (4) The Conference Committee on the Balanced Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1997, is considering proposals that \n     would withhold Federal universal service funds in the year \n     2002.\n       (5) The withholding of billions of dollars of universal \n     service support payments may result in temporary rate \n     increases in rural and high cost areas and may delay \n     qualifying schools, libraries, and rural health facilities \n     discounts directed under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore, it is the sense of the \n     Senate that the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997 \n     should not manipulate, modify, or impair universal service \n     support as a means to achieve a balanced Federal budget or to \n     achieve Federal budget savings.\n       Sec. 615. For fiscal year 1998 and subsequent fiscal years, \n     in establishing the income or assets of an individual who is \n     a victim of domestic violence, under section 1007(a)(2) of \n     the Legal Services Corporation Act (42 U.S.C. 2996f(a)(2)), \n     to determine if the individual is eligible for legal \n     assistance, a recipient described in such section shall \n     consider only the assets and income of the individual, and \n     shall not include any jointly held assets.\n       Sec. 616. The Legal Services Corporation shall--\n       (1) conduct a study to determine the estimated number of \n     individuals who were unable to obtain assistance from its \n     grantees as a result of the enactment of section 504(a)(16) \n     of the Departments of Commerce, Justice,\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n     and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-134; 110 Stat. 1321-55), during the \n     six month period commencing with the enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (2) not later than 30 days thereafter, submit to Congress a \n     report describing the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n                         TITLE VII--RESCISSIONS\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n                         General Administration\n\n\n                          working capital fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading on \n     September 30, 1997, $30,310,000 are rescinded.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point, I certainly want to thank \nSenators for their cooperation on the passage of the Commerce, State, \nJustice bill. I, obviously, especially thank the Senator from South \nCarolina without whose expertise and input we could not have moved this \nbill in such an aggressive and bipartisan manner. He has a huge \ninstitutional knowledge, which he used in a most constructive and \neffective way in allowing us to pull together a bill that can work and \nthat has passed with an exceptionally strong vote. I thank him for all \nhis assistance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as we say at home, let the record speak. \nI have been with this bill 26 years and, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire said, it was the first time we ever passed the bill \nunanimously. I thank the Senator for his cooperation and wonderful help \non both sides.\n  Mr. GREGG. It could not have been done without the Senator's efforts \nand especially the assistance of the staff, which worked overtime on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I especially want to thank Scott Gudes, who is the minority staff \nleader, and his assistants, Emily East and Karen Swanson Wolf, for \ntheir exceptional work on our side of the aisle. We had a wonderful \nteam that worked literally hundreds of hours and did an exceptional \njob: Jim Morhard, who is the clerk, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Carl \nTruscott, Dana Quam, and Vasiliki Alexopoulos. I can't say enough about \nthe extraordinary effort that these people put in, and it certainly \nreflects in their expertise.\n  I would have to say that actually I am not sure we had a majority \nthat passed this bill at one point earlier this year. So, the fact that \nit was passed in this way reflects the fact that a lot of extraordinary \nwork went into it.\n  Again, I thank everyone for their participation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank again the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Gregg, from New Hampshire. He has worked these issues \nvery hard and studied these programs with great deliberation. He has \ndone a really, really superb job on this State, Justice, and Commerce \nbill. He has put this bill together in a bipartisan fashion, \nconsidering Members' interests from both sides of the aisle.\n  You know that is the way appropriations bills have worked in the \npast. Mr. President, that is the way they are supposed to work. It has \nenabled us to pass this bill through committee with overwhelming \nsupport. It has enabled us to quickly complete action in just a little \nmore than 1 day. And, I believe that this spirit of bipartisanship will \nbe reflected shortly in the vote on final passage.\n  Of course, I would also like to recognize the support and guidance \nfrom our new Committee Chairman Ted Stevens and his right hand man, our \ncommittee staff director Steve Cortese. They are getting the trains to \nrun on time. In fact, we are way ahead of the House, which hasn't even \ntaken up the State, Justice, and Commerce bill. Steve Cortese has taken \non the job of running our full Appropriations Committee as well as \ncontinuing to serve as staff director of the Defense Subcommittee. That \nis incredible. And, we, of course, very much appreciate the support of \nour leader, Senator Byrd and his staff director, Jim English. Senator \nByrd and Jim English know these 13 appropriations bills thoroughly. \nThey work tirelessly and continue to watch out for our committee and \nfor our Senate as an institution.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to recognize the \nsubcommittee staff. On the majority side they are led by Jim Morhard. \nJim is level headed and experienced. He knows appropriations and how to \nput together legislation and build consensus. I can tell you that \nChairman Stevens and Senator Gregg know they can rely on Jim's counsel. \nHis staff includes Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Dana Quam, Vasiliki \nAlexopoulos, and Carl Truscott, who is on detail from the U.S. Secret \nService. These individuals have been working night and day putting \ntogether this bill. They are all new this year to the subcommittee. Jim \nMorhard moved over from military construction appropriations; Paddy \nLink joined us from the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee; and Kevin Linskey worked for the distinguished former \nleader, Senator Dole. They each bring unique backgrounds and \nperspectives to their positions. And, they have each had to learn about \nthe agencies and programs in this very diverse and important State, \nJustice, and Commerce appropriations bill. They have had to be quick \nstudies. They have done a truly outstanding job, and they have done a \nreal service for the committee and the Senate.\n  I especially want to recognize Paddy Link for her dedication. I have \nknown Paddy for years. She was, of course, Larry Pressler's chief of \nstaff on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. She has \nexperience over in the House Science Committee and during the Reagan \nand Bush administrations Paddy was at Commerce and served as director \nof legislative affairs at NOAA. During the same week that this bill \nwent before the subcommittee, Paddy's father suffered a severe stroke \nand tragically passed away. Paddy continued to lend a hand even under \nsuch trying circumstances. I think she knows that all the Members' \nhearts go out to her and her family in their loss. She went far beyond \nthe call of duty to help out in the production of this bill. It is a \ntribute to her sense of public service and professionalism.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the staff on our side. Scott Gudes, our \nsubcommittee staff director, has been with me now for almost 7 years \nafter 4\\1/2\\ years on Defense appropriations. He has been with me so \nlong that I've got him automatically thinking of USC as meaning the \nUniversity of South Carolina instead of another institution in his \nnative southern California. Karen Swanson Wolf, who is on detail to us \nfrom the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has been \ndoing a great job for the subcommittee. She has been dealing with \njustice and judiciary issues, and has been working on patent and \ntrademark issues. And, finally, Emelie East who helps out this \nsubcommittee as well as the Defense, Military Construction and Foreign \nOperations Subcommittees. Senator Byrd has picked a winner there. Every \nsubcommittee, even the majority staff, keep putting in requests for \nEmelie to help out in markup, on the floor, and in conference. She is \nour utility player on the Appropriations Committee going from one bill \nto another. And, with this bill she will be seeing her fourth get \nthrough the Senate and be sent to the House of Representatives. Ms. \nEast is as professional as they get and we all appreciate the \noutstanding work she does day in and day out.\n  So Mr. President, I just wanted to recognize these fine public \nservants. We don't do that enough around here. I, for one, appreciate \ntheir hard work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8226-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8248-S8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2266\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING REAUTHORIZATION OF \n                   HIGHWAY AND MASS TRANSIT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on October 1, 1997, authorization for most of the \n     programs authorized by the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240), including mass \n     transit programs, will expire;\n       (2) States, local governments, and the national economy \n     depend on Federal investment in the transportation \n     infrastructure of the United States;\n       (3) it is the duty of Congress to reauthorize the programs \n     to ensure that the investment continues to flow and that \n     there is no interruption of critical transportation services \n     or construction; and\n       (4) the public and Congress should have a substantial \n     opportunity to review, comment on, and comprehensively debate \n     committee-reported proposals to reauthorize the programs well \n     in advance of their expiration to ensure that the programs \n     adequately reflect the needs of the United States and the \n     contributions of the States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this Act should not be considered to be a substitute for \n     a comprehensive measure reauthorizing highway and mass \n     transit spending programs and should not be interpreted to \n     authorize or otherwise direct the distribution of funds to \n     the States under expiring formulas under title 23 or 49, \n     United States Code, in fiscal year 1998.\n\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant sense of the Senate. It should help to dispel any concerns \nthat Members may have had regarding the Transportation appropriations \nbill and its potential effect on the ongoing reauthorization process \nfor highway and transit funding. This measure puts the Senate's \nintention on record that none of the funds in S. 1048 are to be \ndistributed according to the old, unfair formulas.\n  Mr. President, the State of Michigan has long been contributing more \ninto the highway trust fund than it receives in Federal money for \nhighways or mass transit, due to the old discriminatory formulas. The \nchanges to previous law included the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA] slightly improved Michigan's return. \nUnfortunately, it largely continued the decades-old unfair pattern of \nsending significantly more to small States than they contributed \nwithout any valid justification. My State's problem has been further \ncompounded by limitations on obligations through the appropriations \nprocess that reduce our total dollar return. As a result, our average \nratio of contributions to obligations for highway funding under ISTEA \nhas been approximately 80.5 percent, while mass transit has been even \nworse with an average ratio of 42.3 percent.\n  I am pleased that the committee's bill provides nearly a $3 billion \nhigher obligation limitation on highway spending. Unfortunately, a \nchart has been included in the Record at the beginning of debate on \nthis bill which implies that those funds will be distributed according \nto the old, expiring ISTEA formulas. That is incorrect and the \nsubcommittee chairman has stressed that the chart was for illustrative \npurposes only and not intended to direct these funds. I encourage \nMembers to ignore that distribution. Michigan would, because of the \nincreased obligation limitation, receive at least an additional \napproximately $100 million in fiscal year 1998, if ISTEA's average \nformula distribution was still in effect, over last year. It would be \ndifficult for any State not to get an increase when the obligation \nlimitation is raised, as it has been in the bill before us.\n  However, I encourage my colleagues not to focus on the formulas of \nthe past. There are at least five major reauthorization proposals to be \nconsidered for fiscal year 1998 and beyond. Of those five, Michigan \nwould do best under the Transportation Empowerment Act [TEA-2] and \ncould have approximately $175 million more in obligation authority \navailable in fiscal year 1998 assuming this bill's obligation \nlimitation than in fiscal year 1997. Next best would be the STEP-21 \nproposal providing about $141 million more in fiscal year 1998. ISTEA \ndoes not work for Michigan and many other States, and Members should \nanalyze these other proposals to determine whether they provide more \nfairness.\n  Mr. President, this sense of the Senate makes it very clear that S. \n1048 does not reauthorize highway or mass transit spending programs. \nThe Senate is still waiting for the Environment and Public Works, and \nthe Banking Committees, to produce fair bills that will allow the \ncontinued flow of infrastructure investment dollars to the States from \nthe funds provided in S. 1048. These bills need to be provided to the \nfull Senate well in advance of the October 1, 1997, authorization \nexpiration of these programs. No Member of the Senate or the public \nshould be precluded from the opportunity to fully and carefully review \nthe proposals reported by the committees.\n  Recently, I received a letter from the president of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials [AASHTO], who \nis very concerned that Congress' ``delay [in moving a reauthorization \nbill] will negatively impact our Nation's transportation system and our \neconomy.'' He is right to be concerned. There is no committee-reported \nproposal for the Senate to consider and we are about to recess until \nSeptember. Unless, by some miracle, a fair and equitable bill is \nreported the first day we return, Congress is very unlikely to meet the \nOctober 1 deadline. No Senator should be placed in the position of \nsupporting an unfair bill to meet that deadline because the Committees \nhave failed to act punctually.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1044\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for the development and operation of the \n           Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System)\n\n       On page 4, line 11, strike the numeral and insert \n     ``$2,435,400,000''.\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 3  . (a) As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, \n     acting for the Department of Transportation, may take receipt \n     of such equipment and sites of the Ground Wave Emergency \n     Network (referred to in this section as ``GWEN'') as the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines to be necessary for \n     the establishment of a nationwide system to be known as the \n     ``Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System'' \n     (referred to in this section as ``NDGPS'').\n       (b) As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may establish the \n     NDGPS. In establishing the NDGPS, the Secretary of \n     Transportation may--\n       (1) if feasible, reuse GWEN equipment and sites transferred \n     to the Department of Transportation under subsection (a);\n       (2) to the maximum extent practicable, use contractor \n     services to install the NDGPS;\n       (3) modify the positioning system operated by the Coast \n     Guard at the time of the establishment of the NDGPS to \n     integrate the reference stations made available pursuant to \n     subsection (a);\n       (4) in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, ensure \n     that the reference stations referred to in paragraph (3) are \n     compatible with, and integrated into, the Continuously \n     Operating Reference Station (commonly referred to as \n     ``CORS'') system of the National Geodetic Survey of the \n     Department of Commerce; and\n       (5) in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, \n     investigate the use of the NDGPS reference stations for the \n     Global Positioning System Integrated Precipitable Water Vapor \n     System of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration.\n       (c) The Secretary of Transportation may--\n       (1) manage and operate the NDGPS;\n       (2) ensure that the service of the NDGPS is provided \n     without the assessment of any user fee; and\n       (3) in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, ensure \n     that the use of the NDGPS is denied to any enemy of the \n     United States.\n       (d) In any case in which the Secretary of Transportation \n     determines that contracting for the maintenance of 1 or more \n     NDGPS reference stations is cost-effective, the Secretary of \n     Transportation may enter into a contract to provide for that \n     maintenance.\n       (e) The Secretary of Transportation may--\n       (1) in cooperation with appropriate representatives of \n     private industries and universities and officials of State \n     governments--\n       (A) investigate improvements (including potential \n     improvements) to the NDGPS;\n       (B) develop standards for the NDGPS; and\n       (C) sponsor the development of new applications for the \n     NDGPS; and\n       (2) provide for the continual upgrading of the NDGPS to \n     improve performance and address the needs of--\n       (A) the Federal Government;\n       (B) State and local governments; and\n       (C) the general public.\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nthe chairman of the Appropriate Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator \nShelby, for the work he has done on this bill. It is not easy to \nbalance the competing interests in any appropriations bill, but I think \nit is even more difficult on transportation appropriations. I would \nalso like to call attention to one area of the Senate's bill which is \nvery different than the House version.\n  The Federal Automated Surface Observing System [ASOS] program, which \nbegan in the late 1980's, is sponsored by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA], the National Weather Service [NWS], and the \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] and currently includes approximately 860 \nASOS units. For its part, the FAA has completed procurement of its 539 \nbaseline ASOS network. Of these units, 476 were installed, yet only 129 \nsystems had been commissioned as of December 21, 1996.\n  Specifically, the Senate bill would provide $24.85 million for the \nAutomated Surface Observing System [ASOS]. This amount is $10 million \nmore than the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] requested. \nAccording to the committee report, $14.85 million is to be used to \ncommission systems that have already been purchased.\n  The $14.85 million requested by the administration would pay for \ngetting these systems on-line, providing essential weather services to \nairports that now have them. The House language on this system is \nsimilar. I think it makes sense to do this. After all, the Federal \nGovernment purchase these units. They might as well be used.\n  Where the House and Senate language differ is in the use of the funds \nthat the administration did not request. The House bill would provide\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\n$7.5 million for procurement of additional weather observing systems \nand direct the FAA to compare costs and capabilities of similar systems \nand to purchase new systems only after full and open competition \nbetween all qualified vendors.\n  In contrast, the Senate report provides FAA with an additional $10 \nmillion to purchase 50 new ASOS units. If the past is an accurate \nindicator, these units will sit idle until FAA finds the funds to get \nthem running. In essence, what we are doing is purchasing technology \nwith great potential but fraught with high maintenance costs and \nunusable for a number of years for every airport that needs a weather \nobservation system, when many airports can use off-the-shelf technology \nthat can be used immediately.\n  In 1995, the General Accounting Office [GAO] released a report on \nASOS. I would like to highlight some of their findings. First, GAO \nfound that six of the eight sensors in the ASOS system do not meet key \nperformance specifications. Second, ASOS shortfalls are caused by \ncontractor failure to deliver products that meet specifications and \nGovernment failure to furnish sufficient equipment. Third, the NWS does \nnot have adequate personnel or integrated information systems for it to \nisolate and correct ASOS failures at FAA sites. Fourth, ASOS does not \nsatisfy the weather observational needs of many users. And, finally \nASOS users state that incorrect ASOS observations could risk aviation \nefficiently and safety. I don't believe that Congress should force the \nFAA to purchase more ASOS units until the problems with the ones they \nalready have can be worked out.\n  For this reason, I believe the House language on weather observation \nsystems is a better option for airports. I hope my friend from Alabama \nwill examine carefully the House approach on this issue and I urge him \nto opt for the House's approach to maximize airport safety.\n  Mr. Shelby. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I have \nlistened with interest to his remarks and recognize his concerns. The \nSenator from Ohio has raised very compelling arguments and I will \ncarefully consider his request during the conference committee \ndeliberations.\n\n\n                     child size crash test dummies\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to address the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee regarding the issue of funding for an \ninnovative research project aimed at developing a child size crash test \ndummy which will be undertaken by a collaborative private sector group \nthat includes several Pennsylvania universities.\n  The project will develop a new crash test dummy particularly suited \nfor research on automobile occupant safety because it will generate \ndata on children's unique biological features and the behavior of \nchildren under crash conditions.\n  I am advised that the House has provided $100,000 for this purpose \nwithin the budget for the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration. Would the distinguished chairman be willing to work \nwith me and our House counterparts to explore funding for this \nimportant safety initiative?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania correctly \nnotes that this will be an issue we address in conference with the \nHouse and I would be glad to work with him on exploring funding \npossibilities for an initiative which could protect our children from \ninjuries sustained in automobile accidents.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the \nchairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nShelby, in a brief colloquy regarding the Northeast Illinois Regional \nCommuter Railroad Corporation--Metra. I commend both Senators Shelby \nand Lautenberg for their tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's \ntransportation systems. And I congratulate them on bringing this bill \nto the floor.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Shelby knows, Metra is the second largest \ncommuter rail system in the country, carrying over 270,000 riders a \nday. Metra's 12 rail lines serve more than 100 towns and municipalities \nwith 238 stations and a stop at O'Hare International Airport. It \nmaintains a 97 percent on time performance while operating over 500 \nroute miles. In short, Metra is an effective, first-class transit \nsystem that fills an enormous commuter need in the Northern Illinois/\nChicago region.\n  Metra anticipates that by the year 2020, the population of its \nservice territory will grow by 25 percent and employment in that area \nwill increase 37 percent. In order to prepare for this growth and meet \nadditional needs, Metra plans to expand and upgrade service on three \nlines. Specifically, Metra plans to upgrade and expand North Central \nService and the Metra Milwaukee West Line; upgrade and extend the South \nWest Service to Manhattan, Illinois; and upgrade and extend the Union \nPacific line to LaFox and Elburn, IL. The total cost of this project is \n$301 million over 6 years.\n  The House included $5 million in the fiscal year 1998 Transportation \nappropriations bill for engineering and design on tracks, signals, \nbridges, and earthwork associated with this project.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Shelby if he considers \nMetra to be a priority new start transit project and if he and Senator \nLautenberg would be willing to work to include the House language in \nconference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Illinois. As Senator Durbin \nknows, the committee has worked with him over the years to fund various \nMetra expansion projects, most recently a new service line--the North \nCentral Service. I appreciate his leadership on this project.\n  Metra expansion is vitally important to the Chicago/Northern Illinois \nservice region. The Metra project is certainly a priority new start \ntransit project that is worthy of Federal funding.\n  I will work with Senator Lautenberg and our House colleagues in the \nconference committee to make sure that the Senator's interests in this \nimportant project are represented at the conference committee.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Durbin on this project in the \nyears to come.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nTransportation and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1998.\n  I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Shelby, for bringing his first transportation appropriations \nbill to the full Senate. I commend the chairman for bringing the Senate \na balanced bill.\n  As all Members know, transportation spending was a priority area \nwithin the bipartisan budget agreement. With passage of this bill, we \nbegin to increase funding for our Nation's infrastructure as we \npromised during negotiations on the balanced budget agreement.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $12.6 billion budget authority [BA] \nand $13.2 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department \nof Transportation, including Federal-aid highways, mass transit, \naviation activities, the U.S. Coast Guard, and transportation safety \nagencies.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments \nare taken into account, the bill totals $12.7 billion in budget \nauthority and $37.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  The reported bill is $0.2 billion in budget authority and $3 million \nin outlays below the subcommittee's section 602(b) allocation.\n  This spending is $0.5 billion in budget authority below the \nPresident's fiscal year 1998 budget request for the subcommittee, and \n$0.15 billion in outlays above the president's request.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $0.6 billion in discretionary BA and $0.2 \nbillion in outlays below the House version of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring on this bill be inserted in to the Record.\n  I support the bill and urge its adoption.\n\n            S. 1048, TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority............................................       --     11,957        --       698    12,655\n  Outlays.....................................................       59     36,890        --       665    37,614\nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................       --     12,157        --       698    12,855\n  Outlays.....................................................       59     36,893        --       665    37,617\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................      300     12,173        --       698    13,171\n  Outlays.....................................................      299     36,502        --       665    37,466\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................      300     12,217        --       698    13,215\n  Outlays.....................................................      299     36,855        --       665    37,819\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO--\nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................       --      (200)        --        --     (200)\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n \n  Outlays.....................................................       --        (3)        --        --       (3)\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................

Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to engage in \na discussion with the bill manager on an amendment that I filed \nyesterday. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for a question?\n  Mr. SHELBY: Yes, I will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator knows, I filed an \namendment yesterday that I hope will not be necessary. The issue \nconcerns truck weight limitations on interstate highways and potential \nsanctions on the States of New Hampshire and Maine.\n  Last year's appropriations legislation for the Department of \nTransportation included an amendment sponsored by Senators Cohen, \nSnowe, Gregg, and myself which established a moratorium on the \nDepartment of Transportation's authority to withhold highway funds from \nNew Hampshire and Maine because of their allowance of heavier trucks on \nInterstate 95. That moratorium is set to expire on September 1, 1997.\n  Under section 127 of our surface transportation law, States may not \nallow trucks over 80,000 pounds on the Interstate System without \nrisking the loss of highway funds, even though many State roads allow \n100,000-pound trucks, as is the case in New Hampshire and Maine. While \nI do not wish to get into a policy discussion on truck weights, there \nis a safety argument to be made in keeping these heavier trucks on the \nInterstate System, which is built to higher standards. That debate \nshould be appropriately reserved for ISTEA reauthorization, currently \nunder way in the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is there \nthat we will debate any proposed changes to Federal truck weight \nlimits.\n  Nevertheless, we are faced with the expiration of the sanctions \nmoratorium on September 1 and the fact that the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee has not yet dealt with this issue in ISTEA. It is for \nthese reasons that I now seek assurances from the Transportation \nDepartment that sanctions would not be imposed before ISTEA is \nreauthorized and fiscal year 1998 apportionments are released.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that the Department of \nTransportation would not have the authority to withhold highway funds \nfrom New Hampshire and Maine for the remainder of this fiscal year or \nuntil such time as the highway program is reauthorized and fiscal year \n1998 funds are apportioned to the States?\n  Mr. SHELBY: Yes, that is correct. There would not be an opportunity \nfor sanctions under section 127 of our surface transportation law until \nfiscal year 1998 highway funds are apportioned, which would not occur \nuntil Congress reauthorizes the surface transportation programs.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I want to thank the manager of this bill \nfor that clarification. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on the \nmatter of guidance for the distribution of fiscal year 1998 highway and \ntransit appropriations provided by the bill before us.\n  It is my understanding that S. 1048 would not, if it became law, \ndirect or otherwise assume that the allocation and apportionment of \nhighway obligation authority to the States from the highway trust fund \nshall be distributed under the expiring ISTEA formulas or any other \ndistribution scheme. Would the chairman confirm that understanding?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Michigan is correct. This bill simply \nprovides an overall limitation on States' highway obligations from the \nhighway trust fund of $21.8 billion and is completely silent on its \ndistribution among the States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So, just to be clear, there is no way to accurately \ndetermine what share or total that any State can expect to receive of \nthat $21.8 billion in fiscal year 1998. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Again, the Senator from Michigan is correct. That \ndistribution will be determined when Congress works out whatever \ntransportation law will replace ISTEA.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As a Senator from a donor State, I appreciate the \nSenator's remarks. I am looking forward to improving Michigan's return \non gas tax dollars contributed into the highway trust fund and wanted \nto be certain that Senate action on this bill did not preclude or \nprejudge that debate.\n  From my review of the mass transit provisions in the bill, it appears \nthat the committee has assumed the old distribution formulas and \nallocation method. This is a problem for Michigan, and perhaps the \nchairman's State too, since Michigan is a significant donor State in \nterms of receipts of transit grants versus contributions to the mass \ntransit account of the highway trust fund. In fact, the Michigan \nDepartment of Transportation calculates that Michigan's return at \napproximately $.53 on the gas tax dollar. According to the Community \nTransportation Association of America, Alabama receives approximately \n$.16 per gas tax dollar.\n  I am particularly concerned about section 49 U.S.C. 5309(m), which \ntreats bus and bus facilities very poorly in relation to other \ncategories. And, I believe that section 5307 and related sections \nshould be modified to more accurately reflect States' contribution into \nthe mass transit account. These expiring sections and others in title \n49 need to be rewritten to provide greater fairness to States that do \nnot have subways or major fixed guideway facilities.\n  Does the Committee's bill assume that funds appropriated in this bill \nfor mass transit grant and loan formulas and other mass transit program \nwill be distributed according to the authorizations in title 49 that \nexpire on October 1, 1997?\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have assumed current law with respect to transit \nprograms, until such time as a reauthorization bill is enacted. With \nrespect to formula and discretionary grants, the bill sets obligation \nlimitations on contract authority for both programs and appropriates \n$190 million for formula grants. It is our understanding that the only \nsignificant amount of contract authority for transit programs that is \nexpected to carry over into fiscal year 1998 is $392 million for \ntransit new start projects. In the absence of a reauthorization bill, \nthe only significant new funding for transit formula and discretionary \ngrant programs next year would be the amount appropriated for formula \ngrants in this bill and the amount remaining available for new start \nprojects. The Federal Transit Administration would apportion the \nappropriated funds for formula grants according to current formulas, \nand the new start funding would be distributed based on statutory \ndirection in this bill. Both those distributions would be revisited \nwhen reauthorization legislation has been enacted and, presumably, has \ncreated new contract authority for these programs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chairman for his willingness to clarify these \nmatters, though the mass transit situation is very unfortunate from an \nequity point of view. This is obviously not the best situation. We need \nto move an authorization bill for both highway and mass transit \nprograms before October 1, 1997. Debate and resolution of that matter \nis long overdue. I realize these are difficult and significant matters \nand that the balanced budget agreement has locked in a lower level of \nspending on transportation than most of us would have liked, but we \nwill need sufficient time to analyze and debate whatever bill that the \nSenate Environment and Public Works, and the Banking Committees report \nto the Senate. It would be very, very unfortunate, if there is an \nattempt to present a bill to the Senate without adequate time to \nconsider it before the October 1 deadline.\n\n\n                         saint lawrence seaway\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Let me take this opportunity to thank both the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senators Shelby and Lautenberg, and\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\ntheir staffs, for all their hard work in putting together the \ntransportation appropriations bill. Every Member of the Senate should \ngreatly appreciate the bipartisan and good faith manner in which they \ntackled the daunting task of meeting our Nation's infrastructure \npriorities.\n  There are many transportation programs and priorities funded by this \nbill that are important to my State of Wisconsin and the Great Lakes \nregion. I would like to take a moment to discuss one particular Great \nLakes priority, the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation \n[SLSDC].\n  Mr. President, since its creation in 1959, SLSDC has provided safe, \nefficient, and reliable commercial shipping and lockage services \nthrough the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Seaway serves as the gatekeeper \nfor all oceangoing vessel traffic coming to and from the Great Lakes. \nAs such, SLSDC's work is vital to the Great Lakes region, which is \nresponsible for nearly half of America's industrial and agricultural \noutput. That output translates into iron ore for America's steel miles, \nlow-sulphur coal for public utilities and Midwestern export grain for \nthe world market. Simply put, the economic viability of the Great Lakes \nand the country depends on the efficient operation of the Seaway and \nSLSDC. Of equal importance are the environmental and safety functions \nperformed through the Seaway.\n  As you know, the administration has proposed that SLSDC be \nrestructured as a performance-based organization [PBO]. I have endorsed \nthis proposal as a critical and innovative step in ensuring the long-\nterm stability of commercial shipping in the Seaway System and \nthroughout the Great Lakes region, and am currently working with other \nGreat Lakes' Senators to prepare the necessary authorizing legislation.\n  Last year, in the transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1997, the Senate included a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the \nCongress should consider such legislation in the 105th Congress. We are \nhopeful that the Senate will approve the PBO legislation before the end \nof this session, although we recognize that there's much work left to \nbe done.\n  As you know, one of the unique features of the PBO initiative is the \nfinancing mechanism, which would link SLSDC's funding level to \nperformance--that is, the annual funding level would be calculated \naccording to average tonnage figures through the Seaway. Thus, the PBO \ninitiative authorizing legislation will move SLSDC financing from \nappropriated funds to an automatic, annual, performance-based payment. \nThe administration's budget request reflected this distinction by not \nincluding a request for appropriated funds for SLSDC. I bring this up \nfor discussion simply to avoid confusion as to the appropriations level \nincluded in the Senate transportation appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I'm glad the Senate brought this matter to the attention \nof the full Senate. Although you and I discussed this matter during \ncommittee consideration of the bill, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to explain this matter to the rest of our Senate \ncolleagues. Many details of this new proposed agency performance based \norganization structure will have to be sorted out in the authorization \nprocess, including the funding proposal. In order to give the \nauthorizing committees as much time as possible before making a final \ndecision regarding this proposal, the Senate Appropriations Committee \ndid not include any appropriated funds or bill language for the SLSDC \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate your fair and unbiased assessment of the PBO \ninitiative, Mr. Chairman. We have every hope of moving the authorizing \nlegislation this session. However, as you and I both know, Congress can \nbe unpredictable. Sometimes we advance ideas quickly, and other times, \nour work is frustratingly slow. For this reason, I want to reiterate \nour understanding that if Congress does not enact PBO authorizing \nlegislation for SLSDC by the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the Senate \nwill ensure in conference with the House that SLSDC will be funded.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, the Senate will ensure that the SLSDC is adequately \nfunded and has the resources it needs to operate effectively and \nefficiently, whether or not the PBO legislation is enacted into law.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                         interstate 4-r program\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have a question for the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nconcerning discretionary funding for the Interstate 4-R Program. The \nreport accompanying S. 1048 includes language recognizing certain \nprojects that should receive priority attention when the Federal \nHighway Administration awards discretionary grants.\n  In Frederick, MD, there is a project to upgrade Interstate 70 at its \nconjunction with Interstate 270, U.S. 15, U.S. 40, and U.S. 340. The \ncomplicated interchanges of these two expressways and the other U.S. \nhighways have numerous ramp movements which need to be reconstructed \nand upgraded in order to provide efficient and safe access. The current \ninterchange forces traffic onto local streets jeopardizing safety for \nlocal residents.\n  I ask my colleagues whether they believe the upgrading of I-70 in \nFrederick would qualify as a project that might receive funds under the \nInterstate 4-R Program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, I believe that the project, as the Senator describes \nit, would be an excellent example of the type of work intended to be \nfunded under this program.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree, Mr. President. The I-70 interchange in \nFrederick, MD, is the type of project that is worthy of funding under \nthe 4-R Program.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, in endorsing the inclusion of I-70/I-270 in \nFrederick, MD, on the priority list for discretionary highway funding. \nAnyone who drives on I-70 or I-270 in Frederick knows what a serious \ntraffic and safety problem we have in this area. The highway narrows \nfrom 6 lanes to 4 lanes creating a bottleneck. There are missing \ninterchanges with I-270 and U.S. 15, forcing cars and trucks onto city \nstreets and adding to existing congestion; and the substandard \ncondition of the highway and resulting congestion means accidents and \ndelays for commuters, interstate truckers, tourists, businesses, and \nemployers alike. With traffic volumes in the area projected to more \nthan double in the next 20 years, there has been a clear need to \naddress this problem. I want to thank the distinguished managers of the \nbill for their assurances.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I also want to thank the managers for the courtesy and \ntheir leadership on this legislation.\n\n\n                    HARTSFIELD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Would the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation yield?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nGeorgia?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The city of Atlanta and Hartsfield International \nAirport have requested a $150 million letter of intent, commonly \nreferred to as an LOI, from the FAA in connection with the construction \nof a commuter runway. Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport is the \nsecond busiest airport in the country and a critical link in our \nnational air transportation system. A major airline headquarted in \nAtlanta alone has over 600 flights per day out of Atlanta. Over the \npast several years, there has been an increase in delays at the \nairport. When Atlanta has a problem with congested air traffic, the \neffects ripple throughout the national system. Delays at Hartsfield \ncreate waves of delay across the country. I strongly believe this \nproject should receive priority consideration from the FAA for an LOI \nand would ask the chairman and the ranking member, the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey, to support this request.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Would my colleague from Georgia yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The distinguished chairman was gracious enough to \nyield me time. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Georgia \nif it is acceptable to the chairman.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Certainly, it is my pleasure to yield to the junior \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman. I wholeheartedly agree with my \ncolleague from Georgia. Hartsfield is operating beyond its capacity \nduring peak departure and arrival times. This\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nproduces excessive delays, inconveniences passengers, disrupts flight \nschedules, and increases operational cost for Hartsfield's carriers.\n  Commuter, typically turboprop, and other prop aircraft operations \ncompose approximately 18 percent of the airport's activity. These \naircraft weigh much less than air carrier jets. During final approach, \nadditional intrail separation must be used when a turboprop is behind \nan air carrier jet due to wake turbulence. This additional separation \nimposes delay to aircraft behind the turboprop, delaying passengers and \nincreasing costs resulting from the downwind portion of flight. By \nremoving the vast majority of commuter aircraft from both the downwind \nand final approach segments of flight, delay is reduced for both air \ncarrier and commuter aircraft. Thus, an additional runway to handle \nturboprops and light commuter jets would provide many benefits to all \nHartsfield carriers.\n  I support priority consideration by the FAA and urge the FAA to issue \nan LOI for Atlanta. Would the chairman and the ranking member agree \nwith me and the senior Senator from Georgia that this project should \nreceive priority consideration by the FAA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, on behalf of the subcommittee, I would agree that \nthe efficiency of Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport is \nimportant to the Nation and vital to the Southeast. The FAA should \nissue an LOI for construction of a commuter runway at Hartsfield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I concur with my colleague and support the request. \nThis project is an important investment not only for Atlanta, but for \nthe national air transportation system.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the chairman's and ranking member's \nsupport for this project, which is vital to the city of Atlanta and \nHartsfield International Airport. Would you be willing to include \nlanguage in the conference report to the fiscal year 1998 \nTransportation appropriations bill which indicates that this project \nshould receive priority consideration by the FAA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, I would be happy to work with both Senators from \nGeorgia and try to include such language in the conference report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I also would be willing to work with the chairman and \nboth Senators from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to thank the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and my colleague from Georgia for their help in this matter. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I would also like to thank the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and my colleague from Georgia for their help. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           Structure Research\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the subcommittee \nchairman in a brief colloquy regarding a small, but important project \nunderway in Michigan. As he may know, the State of Michigan and the \nFederal Highway Administration are working together in the use of \nadvanced carbon and glass composites as reinforcements for concrete to \nreplace steel in the manufacture of prestressed bridge beams and bridge \ndecks. The House Appropriations Committee report encourages FHWA, \nthrough its structures research program, to assist the State in \ndesigning and deploying monitoring protocols and systems. I would hope \nthat the Senator from Alabama would be able to support that language in \nconference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am aware of the structure research that the Senator \nfrom Michigan has described and will work with him to ensure that his \ninterests are recognized during conference committee consideration of \nthis matter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for his assistance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. First of all, I would like to thank the Senator from \nAlabama for his hard work on this bill and to commend him for his \ndiligence in furthering this important legislation.\n  I would like to talk about a provision that is a part of the House \ncounterpart to this bill and which addresses issues related to the \nimpact in Wichita, KS, of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific \nmerger. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the report language \nincluded in the House bill be inserted for the Record.\n  Mr. President, the impact of this merger is of great importance to \nthe community of Wichita, KS. Since the railroad runs through the \ncenter of the city, the increased train traffic resulting from the \nmerger may affect significantly the flow of traffic through the city. \nVarious alternatives to mitigate this impact are currently being \nconsidered, including the building of grade separations through the \ncity or the building of a bypass around the city. The Surface \nTransportation Board is currently evaluating the feasibility of each of \nthe alternatives, and is expected to release its recommendations for \neasing the impact of the additional trains in early September. The \nlanguage that I am requesting to be included in the Record would simply \nstate that the STB should revisit its recommendations if any \nsubstantial changes are made in the assumptions used to complete this \nstudy. This would include assumptions in the number of trains that are \nexpected to pass through the city or the speed at which the trains \ntravel. I would also like to point out that not only will this \nprovisions not have any current budgetary impact, it will help to \nensure that the Federal Government will not finance costly bailout in \nthe future because of faulty planning.\n  I would like to get assurances from the Senator from Alabama that he \nwill pay close attention to the concerns of the community of Wichita \nduring the Conference Committee consideration of this issue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his interest in this \nissue. I understand that the impact of the Union Pacific-Southern \nPacific merger will continue to be a concern to the community of \nWichita. I assure the Senator from Kansas that I will work with him \nduring the House-Senate Conference Committee consideration of this \nissue.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate has now completed action on 9 \nof the 13 annual appropriations bills that fund the Government and we \nare now nearing the close of debate on the Transportation \nappropriations bill. We have completed action on those bills in record \ntime, for which I congratulate the managers of those measures.\n  These bills contain many good provisions and generally provide \nappropriate levels of funding to continue the necessary functions of \nthe Federal Government.\n  But, Mr. President, by my reckoning, in the process of acting on \nthese 10 measures, the Senate will have wasted almost $10 billion on \nwasteful, unnecessary, low priority, pork-barrel projects. This is an \nappalling waste of taxpayers dollars--almost a billion dollars for \nevery appropriations bill we have considered so far, and we still have \nthree more appropriations bills to go.\n  This bill is typical of the types of earmarks and set-asides that \nmembers add to the multi-billion-dollars bills.\n  This bill and report earmark billions of dollars for specific \nhighways, railroads, bridges, boats, hangers, and even a covered \nbridge. Yes, a covered bridge. The report earmarks $2 million of \nFederal highway funds to restore a covered bridge in Vermont.\n  The report directs the Coast Guard to buy twice as many coastal \npatrol boats from the Bollinger Machine Shop and Shipyard in Louisiana \nas were requested by the Coast Guard--at a cost of $68.1 million for 15 \nboats.\n  Another $4 million is earmarked to renovate a hanger at the Kodiak, \nAK Coast Guard facility, a project which was not included in the budget \nrequest.\n  The bill earmarks $26 million to repair three bridges in Hawaii, \nLouisiana, and Georgia.\n  But these are ordinary earmarks of relatively small amounts of money. \nLet me take a moment to highlight some of the larger set-asides in this \nbill.\n  All of the $76.65 million provided for testing of intelligent \ntransportation systems, none of which was requested, is earmarked; 24 \nprojects in 18 States are listed in the report to receive a share of \nthis $76 million.\n  A total of $300 million is earmarked for Appalachian development \nhighway systems--$100 million more than requested by the \nadministration.\n  All but $2 million of the $440 million for bus and bus facility \ndiscretionary grants is earmarked for specific projects in specific \nStates; 35 States\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nwill receive these grants, with Alabama, Missouri, New York, and West \nVirginia getting more than $25 million each.\n  All but $5.8 million of the $780 million for new mass transit \nfacilities is earmarked; 26 of the 40 projects for which funds are \nspecifically set-aside were not even requested by the administration. \nOf these unrequested projects, Washington State will receive $24 \nmillion for a commuter light-rail system; Orlando, FL, will receive \nanother $31.8 million for its light-rail system, in addition to the $2 \nmillion provided last year; and New York City will get $50 million for \nan East Side access project.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the $23.45 million earmarked \nin this bill for the Pennsylvania Station redevelopment project in New \nYork City will complete the Federal funding share of this project. I \nwould certainly hope that $100 million would be enough to ask the \nFederal taxpayers to contribute to this $300-plus million project. I \nstrongly suspect, however, that there will be unexpected costs and \nfinal details to be completed, and we will see another several million \nearmarked for this project in next year's bill.\n  Finally, the report contains language earmarking just $450,000 for a \n``transportation emergency preparedness and response demonstration \nproject on the threat of tornadoes in the Southern and Midwestern \nStates.'' The report also establishes a requirement that $400,000 of \nthis money is to be used to assist in the ``construction and \nestablishment of an underground emergency transportation management \ncenter utilizing satellite communications.''\n  This sounds to me like a good idea in general, but I am concerned \nabout two things. First, how can this center be established for just \n$450,000? And second, why did the Committee find it necessary to add a \nspecification that the center ``shall be located in a region that is \nsusceptible to tornadoes and at an elevation of over 1,300 feet above \nsea level * * * and be within reasonably close proximity to military, \nspace and/or nuclear facilities to provide rapid response time (but far \nenough away to be safe from disaster impacts).'' I wonder why the \nCommittee felt it was necessary to be so specific about the location \nfor the center. Why not just put in motion the process to establish a \ntornado emergency preparedness center, and allow it to be built at the \nbest site to carry out its mission?\n  These are only a few of the earmarks and special projects contained \nin this measure, but I will not waste the time of the Senate going over \neach and every earmark.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult for me to see the logic of wasting \n$9.9 billion in these 10 appropriations bills, and then hastening to \npass a Balanced Budget reconciliation bill to reduce Federal spending. \nIf we could just avoid pork-barrel spending in the first place, we \nwould not have to go through the painful process of eliminating it in \nlater years.\n  I hope my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will not bring \nappropriations bills back from conference with all of the earmarks and \nadd-ons of both Houses, or we may well find ourselves negating any \nprogress we have made in the reconciliation process toward a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions in \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Objectionable Provisions in Fiscal Year 1998 Transportation \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                            U.S. Coast Guard\n\n       Report earmarks $146,500 for the Marine Fire and Safety \n     Association, a private association (Columbia River area in OR \n     & WA).\n       Report provides $30.8 million more for acquisition of 7 \n     more coastal patrol boats than requested, which are built by \n     Bollinger Machine Shop & Shipyard in Louisiana.\n       Report earmarks $4 million to renovate a hanger at the \n     Coast Guard Kodiak, Alaska facility, which was not included \n     in the budget request.\n       Bill and report provide $26 million to repair 3 bridges \n     under the Truman-Hobbs Act: $5.0 million for the Sand Island \n     Road Tunnel in Honolulu, HI; $3.0 million for the Florida \n     Avenue Bridge in New Orleans, LA; and $18.0 million for the \n     Sidney Lanier Bridge in Brunswick, GA. These projects should \n     be funded from the FHWA discretionary bridge program, not the \n     Coast Guard.\n\n\n                    Federal Aviation Administration\n\n       Directs the FAA Administrator to meet the authorized \n     staffing levels for all air traffic control facilities in the \n     New York/New Jersey region by the dates identified in the \n     pending agreements with the pertinent employee organizations. \n     Directs the Administrator to inform the Appropriations \n     Committee immediately if it appears that those deadlines will \n     not be met.\n       Directs the FAA to study air traffic at the airports in New \n     Bern (NC), Hickory (NC) and Salisbury (MD).

Intends for the systems to be installed and \n     tested at regional airports that exhibit requirements for \n     improved economic development and safety of operation \n     including, but not limited to, the Pullman-Moscow Regional \n     Airport (WA), the Friedman Memorial Airport (ID), and at \n     rural airports in Brigham City (UT), Logan (UT), Wendover \n     (UT), and Tooele (UT).\n       Earmarks $5 million for the precision approach path \n     indicator (PAPI) navigational aid systems, with 10 directed \n     to be installed at remote Alaskan airport locations.\n       Earmarks $3.5 million for two wind profilers currently \n     leased at the Juneau (AK) airport along with new computers \n     and navigational aids, and to install anemometers, and for \n     the costs to calibrate the new equipment.\n       Earmarks $4 million to accelerate replacement of existing, \n     nonsupportable engine generators and to replace FAA's \n     electrical distribution system at Cold Bay (AK) with an \n     underground electrical distribution system.\n       Earmarks $18.9 million for FAA aircraft fleet \n     modernization, and directs the FAA to exercise the option \n     presently in place for the acquisition of one new modified \n     Learjet 60 flight inspection and airways calibration aircraft \n     under the contract presently in force between the FAA and E-\n     Systems.\n       Earmarks $750,000 for additional training equipment for the \n     Rocky Mountain Services Training Center (RMESTC).\n       Earmarks $1.25 million for the continued development of an \n     alternative explosives detection technology that uses a \n     neutron probe, which determines the number and ratio of \n     atoms of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in small \n     volumes throughout a suitcase and uses that information to \n     identify contraband substances such as explosives and \n     drugs.\n       Priority consideration for AIP discretionary

Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation for the excellent job he \nhas done on this bill, and in particular for the priority he has given \nto airports. The chairman has been very accommodating in looking out \nfor the interests of Washington State. There is one program, however, \nthat we did not address in this bill, and I would like to seek the \nchairman's assistance in seeing that the issue can be raised in \nconference. Paine Field in Everett, WA, is currently the third busiest \nairport in the State. In addition to being the airport from which \nBoeing tests its 747, 767, and 777 aircraft, I understand that a \ncommercial airline has indicated its interest in operating from Paine \nField. Despite the growing traffic, Paine Field does not have a radar \nsystem, and air traffic controllers currently use binoculars and \nreports from pilots to determine the positions of aircraft relative to \neach other.\n  I understand that while most radar air traffic control systems can be \nquite expensive, there is a new system that is far less costly and \ncould be appropriate for testing at airports like Paine Field. This \ntechnology, called the terminal automated radar display and information \nsystem, or TARDIS, essentially reproduces in the air traffic control \ntower, radar images generated elsewhere. In the case of Paine Field, \nthe data may be obtained from nearby Fort Lawton.\n  While it remains to be seen whether this TARDIS system is, in fact, \nappropriate for Paine Field, I would appreciate the chairman's \nassistance in revisiting this issue in conference with an eye to \nincluding report language urging the FAA to give full consideration to \ninstalling a TARDIS system at Paine Field.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the senior Senator from Washington for his kind \nwords, and assure him that I look forward to working with him during \nconference on the issue of TARDIS at Paine Field, and other issues of \ninterest to Washington State.\n\n\n                    appalachian development highway\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to raise \na matter that is of great concern to me and that is the inequitable \nrepayment policy of the Appalachian Development Highway System [ADHD] \nProgram. States like Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, and New \nYork, which have prefinanced Appalachian road projects, are reimbursed \nat a 70-percent Federal match, while States expending funds for new \nmileage receive an 80-percent match.\n  Unfortunately, this error will cost Kentucky at least $7 million if \nit isn't corrected. Kentucky is one of five States to prefinance \nAppalachian development highway projects. According to the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, this error will cost those States up to $30 \nmillion.\n  It is my understanding that this inequity is due to clerical error \nthat occurred during consideration of the Surface Transportation \nAssistance Act of 1978. Language amending subsection (f) regarding \nregular highway funding was included, but subsection (h) on \nprefinancing was inadvertently left out. Both the Carter and Reagan \nadministrations attempted to fix this inequity, but not of the efforts \nhave succeeded.\n  I have requested the assistance of both the bill managers in \ncorrecting the problem. I have also sought the advice of Senator John \nWarner, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, which has \nthe responsibility of authorizing this program. I appreciate their \nwillingness to assist me in finding a solution to this problem.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Shelby his views on this matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the committee is aware that States have \nprefinanced construction projects authorized under the Appalachian \nhighway program are reimbursed at 70 percent Federal share, while those \nStates expending funds for the new mileage receive an 80-percent \nFederal share. The committee recognizes that this provision treats \nthose States that have taken the initiative to prefinance these needed \nroad projects differently and urges the appropriate authorizing \ncommittee to consider correcting this funding inequity over the period \nduring which funds are made available to complete the ADHS.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Warner if \nhe agrees with my assessment of the problem and would help me correct \nthis error in the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, \nwhich is set to expire on September 30.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell, for his leadership in raising this matter. I \nagree that this inequitable reimbursement rate for States who \nprefinance construction projects should be addressed. As the chairman \nof the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, I will bring this matter to the \nattention of my committee colleagues and work to correct this problem \nin the\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nsurface transportation reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to expound upon a provision in the \nTransportation appropriations bill to forgive the State of Hawaii from \nits obligation to repay $30 million owed to the Airport Revenue Fund \nfor ceded land payments to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs [OHA].\n  Current law states that airport revenues can only be used for airport \npurposes. The U.S. Department of Transportation's inspector general \nfound in September of 1996, that the approximately $30 million in ceded \nland payments made from the Hawaii Airport Revenue Fund were not in \ncompliance with the law. In April of this year, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation affirmed the decision, and is seeking the repayment of \nthose moneys.\n  A continuation of the status quo--continued ceded land payments from \nthe Airport Revenue Fund--was not possible. It was counter to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation's position and policy. I did not have the \nsupport of my colleagues to legislate its continuation. At this time, \nforgiveness of the $30 million debt was possible and achievable. I \nthank my colleagues for allowing for the congressional forgiveness of \nan airport revenue diversion in order to aid the State of Hawaii and \nthe Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n  However, I would like to make clear that as a result of the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation ruling and the pending legislation, the \nremoval of the Airport Revenue Fund for use by the State of Hawaii as a \nsource of compensating the Office of Hawaiian Affairs for use of ceded \nlands upon which the airports sit, should not equate to a like \nreduction in the State's obligation to OHA under State law. This \nforgiveness provision should not be construed as a forgiveness of the \nState's obligation to OHA.\n  The airports continue to sit on ceded lands. The State's obligation \nto compensate OHA for the use of the land upon which the airports sit \nshould also continue. The only difference would now be the source the \nState will draw upon to satisfy its obligation. I have viewed my role \nas aiding in alleviating the accumulated debt to reduce the pressure, \nand thereby allow the State and OHA to return to the negotiating table \nto work toward a mutually acceptable course of action that accepts as a \npremise, the existence of an obligation.\n  To ensure that my intent is clear in this regard, I have requested \nthe inclusion of the following provision in section 335:\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any \n     existing statutes of the several states that define the \n     obligations of such states to Native Hawaiians, Native \n     Americans or Alaskan Natives in connection with ceded lands, \n     except to make clear that airport revenues may not be used to \n     satisfy any such obligations.\n\n  Mr. President, in light of the unique history of Hawaii's ceded lands \nand the obligations that flow from these lands for the betterment of \nthe native Hawaiian people, I believe that this is more than a fiscal \nmatter, this is a fiduciary matter--one of trust and obligation. \nSection 335 ensures that the State of Hawaii and OHA would not be \nrequired to return funds already in their possession. It is my \nexpectation that this will calm the waters and clear the way for \nreasoned negotiations as the State, in good faith, looks to satisfy its \nobligations from other sources.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate that Human Rights Watch, the International Labor Rights Fund, \nand Mexico's National Association of Democratic Lawyers have asked the \nU.S. National Administrative Office [U.S. NAO] to investigate reports \nof widespread pregnancy-based sex discrimination in Mexico's \nmaquiladora industry.\n  These organizations report that maquiladoras routinely administer \npregnancy exams to prospective female employees in order to deny them \nwork, in blatant violation of their privacy. Female employees face \ninvasive questions about contraceptive use, sexual activity, and menses \nschedules. In some cases, women who become pregnant after being hired \nare forced to resign. Maquiladora owners fear that pregnant women will \nreduce production standards and that legally mandated maternity \nbenefits will drain industry money. The report concludes that the \nMexican Government has failed to investigate these discriminatory \npractices in violation of their own laws and NAFTA.\n  The request for an investigation is the first of its kind that has \nbeen brought before the U.S. NAO. The case represents an important \nopportunity to convey to our trading partners and United States \ncorporations who have operations in Mexico that sex discrimination is \nintolerable, illegal, and in violation of NAFTA.\n  As we consider expanding NAFTA benefits to the Caribbean Basin and \nother South American countries, the United States should demonstrate to \nour trading partners that we take labor rights violations seriously. I \nhope the U.S. NAO will consider this case expeditiously and I look \nforward to its report. The priviledge of free trade and its economic \nbenefits should be conditional upon the trading partners abiding by the \nsame labor and environmental laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8258-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8258-S8259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE SHAW'S SUPERMARKET LABOR CONTROVERSY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past 2 days, 6,500 workers have \nbeen on strike at the Shaw's Supermarket chain in southeastern \nMassachusetts and Rhode Island. These workers are members of the United \nFood and Commercial Workers Union. For months, they negotiated in good \nfaith with their employer in an effort to reach a collective bargaining \nagreement fair to both sides.\n  But no agreement could be reached. The company insisted on cutting\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nhealth care benefits and requiring the employees to pay part of the \npremium. The company also proposed to reduce sick leave and cut back on \njob security protections. In addition, the company would not even \nconsider the wage increase that the workers are seeking.\n  The company left workers no choice but to go on strike when their \ncurrent contract expired--and at midnight last Sunday they did so.\n  Many of the affected employees earn less than $6 an hour. All of them \ncount on health benefits for themselves and their families. These \nemployees include Marilyn and Donnie Henderson, a husband and wife from \nMethuen, MA. They began working at Shaw's over 15 years ago, when the \ncompany was a family-owned business. Now it is owned by a corporation \nbased in Britain. Donnie Henderson suffers from emphysema. He needs the \nhealth insurance. So do the couple's children, one of whom is disabled.\n  The Hendersons and thousands like them are hardworking, dedicated \nemployees of Shaw's. They went on strike only as a last resort, because \nthey can't afford to take the cuts the company demanded.\n  Today, it appears that the company and union have reached a tentative \nsettlement of their dispute. Union members will vote tomorrow on \nwhether to ratify the agreement. Employees could be back on the job by \nthis weekend.\n  All of us agree that labor disputes are best resolved when the \nparties themselves can reach agreement. I am hopeful that this is what \nhas happened between Shaw's and its employees.\n  But, if the matter is not resolved, and workers are forced to \ncontinue to walk picket lines, I am concerned that the company might \nagain turn to the use of replacement workers. Shaw's used replacements \nfrom the beginning of this strike, and I regret that. This tactic is \nhostile to loyal workers like the Hendersons, and hostile to the \ncollective bargaining process. In strikes where permanent replacements \nare used, workers lost the most, but studies show that everyone else \nloses as well. Employers suffer, too, because strikes are prolonged.\n  According to a study of the period from 1935 to 1973, the average \nduration of a strike was seven times longer in cases where permanent \nreplacements were used.\n  Another study found that, where employers neither announced an \nintention to hire permanent replacements nor actually hired them, the \naverage length of strikes was 27 days, but it soared to 84 days when \npermanent replacements were hired.\n  The ability to hire permanent replacements tilts the balance unfairly \nin favor of businesses in labor-management relations. Hiring permanent \nreplacements encourages management intransigence in negotiating with \nlabor. That practice encourages employers to replace current workers \nwith new workers willing to settle for less--to accept smaller \npaychecks and other benefits.\n\n  This tradeoff is unacceptable for the 6,500 striking workers at \nShaw's Supermarkets, and it is unacceptable for working men and women \nacross the country. Therefore, if the tentative settlement between \nShaw's and its employees breaks down, and Shaw's tries to hire \nreplacement workers again, I intend to offer legislation to prohibit \nthis practice.

BRENNAN, JR., GUARDIAN OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, current Supreme Court Justice David \nSouter captured the legacy of jurisprudence left behind by William J. \nBrennan Jr., when he said: ``Justice Brennan is going to be remembered \nas one of the most fearlessly principled guardians of the American \nConstitution that it has ever had and ever will have.''\n  In an era when no institution is more embattled than the U.S. \nConstitution, we must make special note of the passing of such ardent \nguardians. In a manner that endeared him equally to friend and foe, \nJustice Brennan matched the importance of his decisions with literary \nacumen. With language that could be compared to the authors of the \nConstitution, Justice Brennan guarded the constitutional principles--\nmost especially the freedom to criticize one's government.\n  Madison's original version of the first amendment submitted on June \n8, 1789, provided that: ``The people shall not be deprived or abridged \nof their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and \nthe freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, \nshall be inviolable.'' Justice Brennan's identification of Madison's \ninviolable protection was crucial during the civil rights movement when \nmembers of the press were being figuratively gagged for their criticism \nof public officials. Thus, Brennan wrote in The New York Times versus \nSullivan:\n\n       We consider this case against the background of a profound \n     national commitment to the principle that debate on public \n     issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that \n     it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes \n     unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public \n     officials. * * *\n       A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to \n     guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions--and to do \n     so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount--\n     leads to a comparable ``self censorship.'' Allowance of the \n     defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the \n     defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be \n     deterred. * * *\n       Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may \n     be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is \n     believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, \n     because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of \n     the expense of having to do so. They tend to make only \n     statements which ``steer far wider of the unlawful zone.'' \n     The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of \n     public debate. It is inconsistent with the 1st and 14th \n     Amendments.\n\n  In 1789, James Madison warned that, ``If we advert to the nature of \nrepublican government, we shall find that the censorial power is in the \npeople over the government, and not in the government over the \npeople.'' Exactly 200 years later, Brennan expanded this underlying \npremise of constitutionally protected forms of free expression in the \ncase, Texas versus Johnson, 1989:\n\n       If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First \n     Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable. * * *\n       There is, moreover, no indication--either in the text of \n     the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it--that a \n     separate juridical category exists for the American flag \n     alone. Indeed, we would not be surprised to learn that the \n     persons who framed our Constitution and wrote the amendment \n     that we now construe were not known for their reverence for \n     the Union Jack.\n       The first amendment does not guarantee that other concepts \n     virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such as the \n     principle that discrimination on the basis of race is odious \n     and destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of \n     ideas.\n       We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception \n     to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment. \n     * * *\n       The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to \n     punish those who feel differently about these matters. It is \n     to persuade them that they are wrong * * * We can imagine no \n     more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's \n     own. * * *\n\n  Justice Brennan came to embody the defense of a Madisonian concept of \nthe first amendment. We shall not soon forget his legacy, nor the \ncritical mantle he has left behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an Editoral from the New York Times of \nJuly 25, and an article by Anthony Lewis of July 28, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Justice Brennan's Vision\n\n       William J. Brennan Jr., who died yesterday at the age of \n     91, brought to his long and productive career on the United \n     States Supreme Court a tenacious commitment to advancing \n     individual rights and the Constitution's promise of fairness \n     and equality. He served for 34 years, a tenure that spanned \n     eight Presidents.\n       Named to the Court in 1956 by Dwight Eisenhower, Justice \n     Brennan saw the law not as an abstraction but as an immensely \n     powerful weapon to improve society and enlarge justice. As \n     such, he was a crucial voice on\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n     the Warren Court of the 1960's, a body that boldly expanded \n     the role of the Federal courts and the Constitution itself to \n     protect individual liberties.\n       Yet even when the Court shifted in a more conservative \n     direction under Chief Justices Warren Burger and, later, \n     William Rehnquist, Justice Brennan was not content to play a \n     marginal role as an eloquent dissenter. Armed with a keen \n     intellect, a forceful personality and a gift for building \n     coalitions, he had surprising success in mustering narrow \n     majorities to keep alive the legacy of the Warren Court and \n     its core notion that the Constitution was a living document \n     that could and should be interpreted aggressively.\n       ``There is no individual in this country, on or off the \n     Court, who has had a more profound and sustained impact upon \n     public policy in the United States for the past 27 years,'' \n     said an article in the conservative journal National Review \n     in 1984, and it is hard to disagree with that assessment. \n     Justice Brennan was the author of 1,350 opinions, many of \n     them landmark rulings that altered the political and social \n     landscape.\n       He left his mark on a wide range of issues. Banker v. Carr, \n     in 1962, asserted the one-person-one-vote doctrine that \n     transformed democracy and, through reapportionment, the \n     composition of the nation's legislatures. His famous First \n     Amendment ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964 \n     reconfigured the law of libel to give ``breathing space'' for \n     free expression and the robust debate of public issues. In \n     Goldberg v. Kelly, a 1970 ruling of which he was particularly \n     proud, Justice Brennan initiated what turned out to be a \n     steady expansion of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due \n     process by ruling that a state could not terminate a welfare \n     recipient's benefits without a hearing.\n       Over all, Justice Brennan's greatness was rooted in his \n     vision of the law as a moral force and his understanding that \n     the ``genius of the Constitution'' would be betrayed if the \n     Court insisted on the narrow, static doctrine of original \n     intent, the notion that the Constitution can best be \n     interpreted through the eyes of the Framers. The unique \n     feature of the Constitution, he argued instead, was ``the \n     adaptability of its great principles to cope with current \n     problems and needs.''\n       That vision and driving passion are not thriving in today's \n     Court. Like Justice Brennan himself, they are sorely missed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             Abroad at Home\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n\n                           reason and passion\n\n       Minneapolis.--William J. Brennan Jr. once said, in \n     conversation, that every Supreme Court justice with whom he \n     had served was as committed as he was to the Constitution. It \n     was not just an idle remark. He meant that he respected his \n     colleagues' faith in their differing understandings of what \n     the Constitution requires.\n       Justice Brennan's extraordinary influence on the Court, his \n     ability to shape majorities, was often ascribed to his \n     personal charm and kindness. But those qualities would not \n     have persuaded men and women of strong views. I think, \n     rather, that his colleagues felt his respect for them--and \n     felt in him an intellectual force that was the stronger \n     because it was accompanied not by arrogance but by modesty.\n       Justice Brennan's character won him affection on the Court \n     across ideological lines. Justice Antonin Scalia, calling him \n     ``probably the most influential justice of the century,'' \n     said. ``Even those who disagree with him the most love him.'' \n     Justice David Souter, who was appointed to the Court on \n     Justice Brennan's retirement in 1990, was pressed at his \n     confirmation hearing to distance himself from the expansive \n     Brennan view of human dignity and freedom. He said:\n       ``Justice Brennan is going to be remembered as one of the \n     most fearlessly principled guardians of the American \n     Constitution that it has ever had and ever will have.''\n       Outside the Court, Justice Brennan's critics on the \n     political right denounced him in extravagant terms, calling \n     him an ``activist'' who invented constitutional protections \n     of liberty. But even in their own terms those critics missed \n     the point.\n       In the great decisions with which he is especially linked, \n     Justice Brennan was passionately faithful to the principles \n     that the Framers expressed in the spacious phrases of the \n     Constitution: ``the freedom of speech,'' ``due process of \n     law'' and the rest. What he did was to apply those principles \n     to changed conditions.\n       Thus James Madison, drafter of the First Amendment, \n     intended it to protect Americans' right to criticize their \n     rulers--however harshly, even falsely. At the time, civil \n     libel actions did not menace that freedom. But when Southern \n     politicians began using libel, in the 1960's, as a way to \n     threaten press reporting of the civil rights movement. \n     Justice Brennan saw that libel suits, too, must conform to \n     Madison's principle. That was the thrust of his majestic \n     opinion in New York Times v. Sullivan.\n       Again, the courts over many years kept hands off the issue \n     of legislative districting. But when state legislatures came \n     to be controlled by small numbers of voters in rural \n     districts, and the legislators in power refused to \n     redistrict, Justice Brennan grasped the challenge to \n     democracy. His remarkable opinion in Baker v. Carr in 1962--\n     one that no other justice could have made the Court's--opened \n     the way for a judicial scrutiny that is now universally \n     accepted.\n       More broadly, Justice Brennan saw that the Constitution's \n     guarantees must be applied to the reality of the vast \n     expansion of government in modern times. In Goldberg v. Kelly \n     in 1970, he wrote for the Court that government benefits--on \n     which so many now depend--could not be withdrawn without \n     notice and a hearing.\n       He ``translated from the level of principle to legal \n     reality,'' Justice Stephen Breyer said, adding: ``That is an \n     enormous contribution.''\n       We have a more conservative Supreme Court now, and it has \n     overturned some of Justice Brennan's opinions. But the heart \n     of his legacy remains. Part of that legacy is in the \n     institution itself.\n       Here in Minneapolis the other day, at the Eighth Circuit \n     Judicial Conference, Justice Clarence Thomas spoke movingly \n     of the Court and Justice Brennan. ``I don't think there was a \n     more decent or more brilliant human being,'' he said. He \n     described how well the justices get along today despite their \n     differences; he said he hoped Americans would get over ``the \n     presumption that all is wrong with our institutions'' and \n     realize that ``they are working and those in them deserve our \n     respect.''\n       Justice Brennan left us his vision of American freedom. \n     Just before his retirement he wrote the Court's opinion in \n     the second flag-burning case. ``We are aware,'' he said, \n     ``that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to many.'' \n     But ``punishing the desecration of the flag dilutes the very \n     freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth \n     revering.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8259-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8260-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ENTITLED ``U.S. ARCTIC RESEARCH PLAN, BIENNIAL REVISION: 1998-\n               2002''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 57\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the provisions of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of \n1984, as amended (15 U.S.C. 4108(a)), I transmit herewith the fifth \nbiennial revision (1998-2002) to the United States Arctic Research \nPlan.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Organic Act of Guam to provide \nrestitution to the people of Guam who suffered atrocities such as \npersonal injury, forced labor, forced marches, internment, and death \nduring the occupation of Guam in World War II, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      THE GUAM WAR RESTITUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, for nearly 3 years, the people of Guam \nendured war time atrocities and suffering. As part of Japan's assault \nagainst the Pacific, Guam was bombed and invaded by Japanese forces \nwithin 3 days of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. At that time, \nGuam was administered by the United States Navy under the authority of \na Presidential Executive order. It was also populated by then American \nnationals. For the first time since the War of 1812, a foreign power \ninvaded United States soil.\n  In 1952, when the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan, \nformally ending World War II, it waived the rights of American \nnationals, including those of Guamanians, to present claims against \nJapan. As a result of this action, American nationals were forced to \nseek relief from the Congress of the United States.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Guam War Restitution Act, which would \namend the Organic Act of Guam and provide restitution to those who \nsuffered atrocities during the occupation of Guam in World War II. \nThere are several key components to this measure.\n  The Restitution Act would establish specific damage awards to those \nwho are survivors of the war, and to the heirs of those who died during \nthe war. The specific damage awards would be as follows: First, $20,000 \nfor death; second, $7,000 for personal injury; and third, $5,000 for \nforced labor, forced march, or internment.\n  The Restitution Act would also establish specific damage benefits to \nthe heirs of those who survived the war, who made previous claims but \nhave since died. The specific damage benefits would be as follows: \nFirst, $7,000 for personal injury; and second, $5,000 for forced labor, \nforced march, or internment. Payments for benefits may either be in the \nform of a scholarship, payment of medical expenses, or a grant for \nfirst-time home ownership.\n  This act would also establish a Guam trust fund from which \ndisbursements will be made. Any amount left over in the Fund would be \nused to establish the Guam World War II Loyalty Scholarships at the \nUniversity of Guam.\n  A nine-member Guam Trust Fund Commission would be established to \nadjudicate and award all claims from the Trust Fund.\n  The United States Congress previously recognized its moral obligation \nto the people of Guam and provided reparations relief by enacting the \nGuam Meritorious Claims Act on November 15, 1945 (Public Law 79-224). \nUnfortunately, the Claims Act was seriously flawed and did not \nadequately compensate Guam after World War II.\n  The Claims Act primarily covered compensation for property damage and \nlimited compensation for death or personal injury. Claims for forced \nlabor, forced march, and internment were never compensated because the \nClaims Act excluded these from awardable injuries. The enactment of the \nClaims Act was intended to make Guam whole. The Claims Act, however, \nfailed to specify postwar values as a basis for computing awards, and \nsettled on prewar values, which did not reflect the\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\ntrue postwar replacement costs. Also, all property damage claims in \nexcess of $5,000, as well as all death and injury claims, required \ncongressional review and approval. This action caused many eligible \nclaimants to settle for less in order to receive timely compensation. \nThe Claims Act also imposed a 1-year time limit to file claims, which \nwas insufficient as massive disruptions still existed following Guam's \nliberation. In addition, English was then a second language to a great \nmany Guamanians. While a large number spoke English, few could read it. \nThis is particularly important since the Land and War Claims Commission \nrequired written statements and often communicated with claimants in \nwriting.\n  The reparations program was also inadequate because it became \nsecondary to overall reconstruction and the building of permanent \nmilitary bases. In this regard, the Congress enacted the Guam Land \nTransfer Act and the Guam Rehabilitation Act (Public Laws 79-225 and \n79-583) as a means of rehabilitating Guam. The Guam Land Transfer Act \nprovided the means of exchanging excess Federal land for resettlement \npurposes, and the Guam Rehabilitation Act appropriated $6 million to \nconstruct permanent facilities for the civic populace of the island for \ntheir economic rehabilitation.\n  Approximately $8.1 million was paid to 4,356 recipients under the \nGuam Meritorious Claims Act. Of this amount, $4.3 million was paid to \n1,243 individuals for death, injury, and property damage in excess of \n$5,000, and $3.8 million to 3,113 recipients for property damage below \n$5,000.\n  On June 3, 1947, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes \ntestified before the House Committee on Public Lands relative to the \nOrganic Act, and strongly criticized the Department of the Navy for \ntheir ``inefficient and even brutal handling of the rehabilitation and \ncompensation and war damage tasks.'' Secretary Ickes termed the \nprocedures as shameful results.\n  In addition, a committee known as the Hopkins Committee was \nestablished by former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in 1947 to \nassess the Navy's administration of Guam and American Samoa. An \nanalysis of the Navy's administration of the reparation and \nrehabilitation programs was provided to Secretary Forrestal in a March \n25, 1947 letter from the Hopkins Committee. The letter indicated that \nthe Department's confusing policy decisions greatly contributed to the \nprograms' deficiencies and called upon the Congress to pass legislation \nto correct its mistakes and provide reparations to the people of Guam.\n  In 1948, the United States Congress enacted the War Claims Act of \n1948 (Public Law 80-896), which provided reparation relief to American \nprisoners of war, internees, religious organizations, and employees of \ndefense contractors. The residents of Guam were deemed ineligible to \nreceive reparations under this Act because they were American nationals \nand not American citizens. In 1950, the United States Congress enacted \nthe Guam Organic Act (81-630), granting Guamanians American citizenship \nand a measure of self-government.\n  The Congress, in 1962, amended the War Claims Act to provide for \nclaimants who were nationals at the time of the war and who became \ncitizens. Again, the residents of Guam were specifically excluded. The \nCongress believed that the residents of Guam were provided for under \nthe Guam Meritorious Claims Act. At that time, there was no one to \ndefend Guam, as they had no representation in Congress. The Congress \nalso enacted the Micronesian Claims Act for the Trust Territory of the \nPacific Islands, but again excluded Guam in the settlement.\n  In 1988, the now inactive Guam War Reparations Commission documented \n3,365 unresolved claims. There are potentially 5,000 additional \nunresolved claims. In 1946, the United States provided over $390 \nmillion in reparations to the Philippines, and over $10 million to the \nMicronesian Islands in 1971 for atrocities inflicted by Japan. In \naddition, the United States provided over $2 billion in postwar aid to \nJapan from 1946 to 1951. Further, the United States government \nliquidated over $84 million in Japanese assets in the United States \nduring the war for the specific purpose of compensating claims of its \ncitizens and nationals. The United States did not invoke its authority \nto seize more assets from Japan under Article 14 of the Treaty of \nPeace, as other Allied Powers had done. The United States, however, did \nclose the door on the claims of the people of Guam.\n\n  A companion measure to my bill, H.R. 2200, was introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representative Robert Underwood. The issue \nof reparations for Guam is not a new one for the people of Guam and for \nthe United States Congress. It has been consistently raised by the \nGuamanian government through local enactments of legislative bills and \nresolutions, and discussed with congressional leaders over the years.\n  The Guam War Restitution Act cannot fully compensate or erase the \natrocities inflicted upon Guam and its people during the occupation by \nthe Japanese military. However, passage of this Act would recognize our \nGovernment's moral obligation to Guam, and bring justice to the people \nof Guam for the atrocities and suffering they endured during World War \nII. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit the leasing of mineral rights, in any case \nin which the Indian owners of an allotment that is located within the \nboundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and held trust by \nthe United States have executed leases to more than 50 percent of the \nmineral estate of that allotment; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n    oil and gas development at fort berthold reservation legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith my good friend and colleague Mr. Conrad. that will promote \neconomic development on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in our \nState.\n  Economic development must be among our top priorities in Indian \ncountry, and our Federal policies should support, not hinder, the \ncreation of new employment opportunities on our Nation's Indian \nreservations. This bill is aimed at addressing a provision in Federal \nlaw that is unnecessarily hampering the economic development efforts of \nThree Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota and has the support of the \nTribes' Business Council.\n  The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation has been working for years to \ndevelop partnerships with the oil industry to explore the development \nof oil and gas resources on its tribally owned or allotted lands. The \nFort Berthold Reservation covers about 1 million acres of land in the \nmiddle of the proven oil-rich Williston Basin. There has been active \noil and gas exploration and\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\ndevelopment on the lands surrounding the reservation, but Three \nAffiliated Tribes itself and its members have been able to participate \nin this activity in only a very limited way because of a Federal \nrequirement that 100 percent of all tribal members with ownership in an \nallotment agree to the leasing of that allotment. Some of the allotted \nland tracts on this reservation are owned by up to 200 individuals, and \nif even one of these owners will not sign the lease, the exploration \ncannot proceed. This outmoded 100-percent requirement makes it \nvirtually impossible for tribes and its members to pursue this kind of \neconomic development, even if a vast majority of allottees are \nsupportive.\n  This legislation, which is narrowly drawn and applies only to the \nFort Berthold Reservation, would allow a leasing agreement to go \nforward if more than 50 percent of those with an interest in specific \nallotted lands agree. By keeping in place a majority requirement for \nthe leasing of mineral rights, the rights of individual landowners \nwould still be protected. The Secretary of the Interior would also \nstill have to review and approve a proposed leasing agreement.\n  The economic implications of this legislation for Three Affiliated \nTribes are enormous. The drilling of just 1 well would create 50 to 100 \njobs, so clearly, this bill can help the Indian people on Fort Berthold \nReservation to move away from welfare dependency to economic \nindependence. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LEASES OF ALLOTTED LANDS OF THE FORT BERTHOLD \n                   INDIAN RESERVATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Approval by secretary of the interior.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     (including the Act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 783, chapter \n     263; 25 U.S.C. 396) and the regulations issued under that \n     Act), the Secretary of the Interior or a designee of the \n     Secretary may approve mineral leases of an allotment \n     described in paragraph (2) in any case in which the Indian \n     owners of that allotment have executed leases to more than 50 \n     percent of the mineral estate of that allotment.\n       (B) Benefits of leases.--At such time as mineral leases on \n     an allotment have been approved for all Indian ownership \n     interests pursuant to this section, all Indian owners of the \n     allotment shall be entitled to the benefits of the leases.\n       (2) Allotments.--An allotment described in this paragraph \n     is an allotment that--\n       (A) is located in the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, \n     North Dakota; and\n       (B) is held in trust by the United States.\n       (b) Rules of Construction.--This Act supersedes the Act of \n     March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 783, chapter 263; 25 U.S.C. 396) only \n     to the extent provided in subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota, legislation to increase \nopportunities for oil and gas leasing on the Fort Berthold Indian \nReservation in North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I understand the importance of increasing economic development \nin Indian country, in particular, development that creates high-paying, \nskilled employment. Members of the Three Affiliated Tribes at Fort \nBerthold have been working on a plan to create jobs and increase \nrevenue through oil and gas development on the Fort Berthold \nReservation, which lies within the oil-rich Williston Basin.\n  At present, there are only seven oil producing wells on land owned by \nthe Three Affiliated Tribes or tribal members. The Tribal Business \nCouncil is considering possibilities for development of oil and gas \nreserves of its tribally owned land and allotted lands of its members \nand is pursuing approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of an \nexploration and development agreement under the Mineral Development \nAct.\n  The fractionated ownership of allotted lands complicates the leasing \nand exploration process. The Bureau must approve tribal oil and gas \nleases, and in order for the Bureau to approve a lease of Indian lands, \nall who have an interest in the land must agree to the particular oil \nand gas lease. The number of people who have an undivided interest in \nvarious land allotments grows larger each year and now involves \nhundreds of people. Thus, for an oil and gas exploration to commence, \nhundreds of oil and gas leases for small allotments of land would have \nto be executed. If any one person with an interest--no matter how \nsmall--in the land objects, the lease agreement would fail. Present law \ncreates a nearly insurmountable barrier to this type of oil and gas \ndevelopment, even in the face of overwhelming support by allotted \nlandowners.\n  The legislation we are introducing today--which applies only to the \nFort Berthold Indian Reservation--would allow an oil and gas lease to \nbecome effective if those individual owners of 50 percent or more of \nthe interests in a particular tract of mineral acres agree to the \nlease. The bill also includes safeguards to ensure that all Indian \nowners of the allotments are entitled to the benefits of the leases.\n  This legislation is an important step for oil and gas development on \nthe Fort Berthold Indian Reservation; it is supported by the Tribal \nBusiness Council of the Three Affiliated Tribes. I believe the bill can \nalso serve as a model for addressing other problems in Indian country \nthat have arisen as a result of fractionated heirship, and a first step \ntoward a more comprehensive solution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \nprovide for the coordination and implementation of a national \naquaculture policy for the private sector by the Secretary of \nAgriculture, to establish an aquaculture development and research \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n   THE NATIONAL AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH, AND PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nAquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act. Senators Craig, \nLeahy, and Daschle have joined me in introducing the bill.\n  This legislation is not merely a reauthorization of an expiring law. \nIt will help establish a coordinated national aquaculture policy. It \nwill stimulate the fastest growing segment of U.S. agriculture.\n  The ever-growing demand for fish and fish products is a driving force \nbehind the decline of our fisheries. Aquaculture can help satisfy \ndemand for fishery products and, at the same time, reduce pressure on \nwild stocks. The bill will also provide a framework for sustainable \naquaculture development by encouraging best management practices for \naquaculture at the State level.\n  The National Aquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act \naddresses the most pressing needs of aquaculture farmers, such as \nresearch, aquacultural credit, and production and market data.\n  For too long aquaculture farmers have suffered from the absence of a \nconsistent and unified Federal policy to aid the development of \naquaculture. My bill promotes policies to allow our country to become \nmore competitive in the expanding global market for aquaculture \nproducts.\n  The world market for aquaculture is vast, and the United States has \nthe potential to lead future aquaculture production and technology. \nEfforts to expand the U.S. aquaculture industry will not go unrewarded. \nThe United States imports 60 percent of its seafood, which results in a \n$3.5 billion annual trade deficit for fish products. Reducing our \nseafood trade deficit by one-third through expanded aquaculture \nproduction would create 25,000 new jobs.\n  World production of aquaculture in 1995 was 21,300,000 metric tons. \nThe U.S. contributed less than 3 percent to world output, however.\n  With global seafood demand projected to increase 70 percent by 2025, \nand harvests from capture fisheries stable or declining, aquaculture \nproduction will have to increase by 700 percent, a total of 77 million \nmetric tons annually, to meet future demand. The important question is \nwhether U.S. aquaculture will share in this explosive growth.\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\n  This bill is about creating jobs, expanding food production, and \nachieving sustainable aquaculture development. America has outstanding \ninstitutions for conducting aquaculture research. A coordinated effort, \nwith appropriate Federal support, can advance aquaculture development \nand promote significant economic growth. Aquaculture has an important \nadvantage because it can be conducted successfully on lands that are \nmarginal for other forms of agriculture.\n  Aquaculture is a diverse industry that affects all regions of the \ncountry. More than 30 States produce at least two dozen commercially \nimportant aquaculture species. Yet the United States ranks 9th among \nnations in the value of its production. China, Japan, India, Indonesia, \nNorway, Thailand, and Korea all enjoy a larger share of the global \naquaculture market. In addressing the problem of our balance of trade, \naquaculture can be part of the solution.\n  Nowhere is the opportunity for aquaculture more promising than in \nHawaii. We have a skilled labor force, access to Asian and North \nAmerican markets, a climate that allows harvesting throughout the year, \nand a 1500-year tradition of aquaculture farming.\n  Aquaculture supports more jobs per acre than other forms of \nagriculture, so it can strengthen our employment base at a time when \nother areas of Hawaiian agriculture are declining. Our tradition of \naquaculture that operates in harmony with the environment will help \nassure that its growth and development is sustainable.\n  However, the legislation I have introduced today was not designed \nmerely to promote aquaculture in Hawaii. The bill was drafted with one \nbasic principle in mind: to assist all segments of the aquaculture \nindustry equally. It would be wrong to promote one segment of the \nindustry, whether it is marine or freshwater aquaculture, or a \nparticular species of fish or shellfish, over another.\n  The United States can be a world leader in aquaculture in the same \nway that it leads in agriculture. This bill is an important step in \nachieving that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and \nfriend from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in the introduction of the National \nAquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act of 1997.\n  This important piece of legislation is designed to help make the \nUnited States competitive in the expanding world market for aquaculture \nproducts. The United States is poised to become the world leader in \naquaculture, yet it remains far beyond other nations, including many \nwith fewer resources and less developed infrastructure.\n  Already there are more than 1,000 Idahoans whose jobs are either \ndirectly or indirectly connected to aquaculture. They represent a $92 \nmillion industry for my home State: An industry committed to a cleaner \nenvironment, a safer food supply, and community development.\n  However, much more lies ahead of us if the United States is to become \na world leader in this growing industry. Despite recent growth, \nAmerica's annual trade deficit in seafood remains stable at \napproximately $3 billion--a reduction of which could mean a stronger \ndomestic industry, more jobs, and less dependency on others for our \nfood supply.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons I am pleased to join my \ncolleague in introducing this measure today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1081. A bill to enhance the rights and protections for victims of \ncrime; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    The Crime Victims Assistance Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, during National Crime Victim Rights Week, \nI said that it was important to focus attention on the needs and rights \nof crime victims not just during that week of special ceremonies, but \nthroughout the year. I am, therefore, pleased to have this opportunity \nto introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy. Our Crime Victims Assistance Act represents the next \nstep in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to \nvictims of crime.\n  My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago \nwhen I served as State's attorney for Chittenden County, VT, and \nwitnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since \nto ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the \nrights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents \nadditional ordeals for those already victimized.\n  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution \nto provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 \nyears, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have \nincluded:\n  The Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; The Victims of Crime \nAct of 1984; The Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; The 1994 Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act; and The Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 1996.\n  Just this March, Congress passed the Victim Rights Clarification Act \nof 1997, which I cosponsored with Senators Nickles, Inhofe and Hatch. \nThat legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing \nthe fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony \nduring the sentencing phase of that trial.\n  As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all \nthose who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses \nto provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that \ntrial were able to do so.\n  Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.15, a youth \ncrime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a \nlegislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included \nprovisions for victims of juvenile crime\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\nso that their rights to appear, to be heard, and to be informed would \nbe protected. Those provisions have now been incorporated in the \njuvenile crime bill ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee last \nweek along with added protections against witness intimidation.\n\n  The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance \nAct, builds upon this progress. It provides for a wholesale reform of \nthe Federal rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and \nprotections for victims of federal crime. Particularly, the legislation \nwould provide crime victims with an enhanced: right to be heard on the \nissue of pretrial detention; right to be heard on plea bargains; right \nto a speedy trial; right to be present in the courtroom throughout a \ntrial; right to give a statement at sentencing; right to be heard on \nprobation revocation; and\n  Right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison.\n  The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that \nare currently before Congress by including: Enhanced penalties for \nwitness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance \npersonnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and \nofficers of the court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for \nnotifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; \nand the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims.\n  These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year \nwith a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not \novercome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to \namend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of \nimplementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of \ncrime victims.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the administration, victims \ngroups, prosecutors, judges, and other interested parties on how we can \nmost effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and \nState legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights \nover the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make \nadditional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice \nand rights that crime victims deserve.\n  In my State, Vermont, there are many individuals who have made a \ndifference by dedicating themselves to serving the needs of crime \nvictims. Individuals, such as Lori Hayes from the Vermont Center for \nCrime Victims Services, have joined in leading the Nation on issues \npertaining to crime victims. I congratulate Lori on the results of the \nJustice Department's recent site visit of Vermont's Victims of Crime \nAct programs. The Justice Department concluded that\n\n       Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to \n     under served populations and service coordination among \n     providers and allied professionals * * * Other States \n     interested in improving their services and advocacy for crime \n     victims would do well to study the model created by Lori \n     Hayes, her staff, and other victims advocates in Vermont.\n\n  Without the commitment of people like Lori, we would not be making \nthe progress that we are.\n  I would like to acknowledge several others who have been extremely \nhelpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: \nThe Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice Department, the National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence, the NOW Legal Defense Fund, the \nNational Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, Professor \nLynne Henderson from Indiana Law School, the National Organization for \nVictim Assistance, Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for \nConstitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, the National Victim \nCenter, and many others.\n  While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs \nand made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have \nmore to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue \nwill join Senator Kennedy and me in advancing this important \nlegislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of \ncrime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top \npriority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of \nthe year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, It is a privilege to join in \nintroducing the Crime Victims Empowerment Act. I commend Senator Leahy \nand Congresswoman McCarthy for their effective leadership on this \nimportant issue, and the many organizations who share our concern, \nespecially the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National \nClearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, and the NOW Legal \nDefense Fund.\n  Too often in the past, the victims of crime have been the forgotten \ncitizens in the criminal justice system. The legislation we are \nintroducing today is an attempt to redress the balance and to guarantee \nthat victims of crime are not victimized a second time by the criminal \njustice system.\n  First, the bill establishes new statutory rights for victims of \nFederal crimes, including expanded rights to participate in all phases \nof the criminal justice process, from trial through sentencing. \nExpanded rights are created for victims during trial proceedings.\n  Second, the bill includes a number of important measures to assist \nvictims of crimes under State laws. A key step here is to provide \nadditional training and resources to State officials. Although most \nState judges and prosecutors are conscientious, there are too many \ncases in which the rights and needs of victims are ignored.\n  Too often, for example, victims of assaults or other violent crimes \nlearn about developments in their case by reading the newspaper, or \nwatching the news on television. Victims should not have to learn about \nthe release of their assailants in these ways. Our bill offers \nresources to local authorities to take this step and other basic steps \nto ensure that victims are not left out of the criminal justice \nprovisions in obvious ways like this.\n  To take another example, there is a critical shortage of victim \nadvocates to provide services and support to crime victims. Our bill \naddresses this shortage by authorizing the hiring of additional \npersonnel.\n  These initiatives will not raise the deficit. They are financed by \ncivil penalties paid under the False Claims Act.\n  There is no need to amend the Constitution to protect the rights of \nvictims of crime. We can accomplish our goal by statute, and ensure \nthat victims are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I \nlook forward to early action on this legislation, and to taking the \nlong overdue steps to improve the quality of justice in our society by \nprotecting the rights of victims.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 1083. A bill to provide structure for and introduce balance into a \npolicy of meaningful engagement with the People's Republic of China; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n  the united states-people's republic of china national security and \n                         freedom protection act\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, just over 1 week ago, Congressman Chris Cox, \ntogether with many other Members of the House of Representatives, \nincluding Ben Gilman, Gerald Solomon, Duncan Hunter, Tillie Fowler, \nChris Smith, Ed Royce, Bill McCollum, Henry Hyde, and Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen introduced an 11-point legislative plan to address our \nNation's failure to truly engage the People's Republic of China. \nSenator Tim Hutchinson and I joined in the unveiling of the House \nproposals to show our support for the good work done by our House \ncolleagues and endorse the leadership of Congressman Cox. I also \npromised at that time to introduce companion legislation in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer that bill, the United States-\nPeople's Republic of China National Security and Freedom Protection \nAct. I am proud to say that Senator Hutchinson and Senator Ashcroft are \njoining me in introducing this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I also want to congratulate Senator Abraham for his \ninterest and work on developing a China policy. He has played an \ninstrumental role in advancing the debate on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I come to this discussion of China policy following my \n7 years of involvement with the people of Hong Kong and their \ncommitment to freedom and democratic reforms. As Senate cochair of the \ncongressional caucus on Hong Kong, I traveled to Hong Kong and China in \nlate March of this year with the Democratic cochair, Senator Joe \nLieberman.\n  I must confess that on this recent trip, my concerns for the people \nof China and the future United States-People's Republic of China \nrelationship increased. I was struck by the dichotomy between the \npeople and the leadership in China. People's Republic of China \nofficials expressed the view that people made governing difficult, as \nif the people exist for the benefit of the government. This \nfundamentally opposes my belief that people know what is best for \nthemselves, and that government is for the benefit of the people. The \nofficial People's Republic of China view puts people at odds with \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, in China, I attended church and visited with people at \nthe Forbidden City, and saw in the eyes of children and parents \nthroughout China the same thing I see here in America. I saw children \nfull of hope and wonder, and parents full of pride and ambition for \ntheir children.\n  I fear that these differences between the United States and China \nwill lead us toward conflict unless we have a sound policy for which we \ncan actively work toward improving relations. The administration calls \ntheir policy ``strategic engagement.'' I call it appeasement. Any \npolicy which does not allow Americans to address their concerns with \nthe People's Republic of China will prove irresponsible. I am \nintroducing this bill today so that the children of China and the \nUnited States can grow up in peace, benefiting from each others' \nfreedom and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, this bill takes root in a belief that our China policy \nmust contain five essential elements.\n  First, United States policy should seek liberalization of the \nPeople's Republic of China Government, responsible behavior by the \nPeople's Republic of China, and integration of the People's Republic of \nChina into the community of nations. United States interests are best \nserved in China, as they are everywhere, when they are defined by the \nUnited States national security strategy: in the proliferation of \ndemocracy and the liberalization of authoritarian forms of government.\n  Second, United States policy should continue to maintain a strong \npresence and commitment to leadership and involvement in the Asian \nPacific region. The policy should be regionally and globally \nintegrated. The United States shares a stake in China's future with the \npeople of China, the region, and the world.\n  Third, United States policy should encourage friendship between our \nnations while protecting national interests and acting on national \nvalues. The People's Republic of China does not today, and will not for \nthe foreseeable future, pose a direct military threat to the United \nStates. The People's Republic of China is not an enemy of the United \nStates and should not be made out as such.\n\n  Fourth, United States policy toward China should contain resolute and \nstraight-forward toughness. United States policy toward China must not \npaper over issues which make China feel uncomfortable, but these issues \nshould not dominate the relationship either. United States policy \nshould seek to overcome these differences with the People's Republic of \nChina. The People's Republic of China expects the United States to act \nhonestly and directly, and the American people require a foreign policy \nwhich is honest and direct.\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\n  And finally, United States policy should be a policy of meaningful \nengagement which includes the mechanisms of this act. In order to \nfulfill a meaningful policy with respect to the People's Republic of \nChina, more tools are needed to address American interests beyond those \navailable in the current policy.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides a broad and positive context for \ndealing with the People's Republic of China and encouraging China's \ndemocratic development.\n  It is divided into three main sections: national security, human \nrights, and trade. It uses targeted sanctions and increased diplomacy \nas its primary tools. Economic sanctions are imposed against the \nPeople's Liberation Army, which is banned from operating commercially \nin the United States. Political sanctions are imposed against human \nrights violators by denying entry into the United States to those \nresponsible for religious persecution, coercive family planning \npractices, and political oppression. The act also calls for military \nsanctions as provided for in the Gore-McCain Nonproliferation Act.\n  The sanctions are complemented by additional advocacy and reporting \nrequirements placed upon United States diplomatic and customs officers \nin the People's Republic of China. The act provides for additional \nauthorizations to meet these requirements, as well as to improve the \nbroadcasting effectiveness of Radio Free Asia. To demonstrate support \nfor Taiwan and clarity in our Taiwan policy, the Act requires a \nbilateral study assessing the need for and feasibility of providing TMD \nto Taiwan.\n  The bill concludes with a title calling for review of the mechanisms \ncalled for in this act based upon China's behavior.\n  Mr. President, perhaps within our lifetimes, and almost certainly in \nthe lives of our children, China will become a premier Asian power. \nWhether that is a threat or a promise depends in large part on whether \nwe rise to the occasion by asserting our values and interests while at \nthe same time helping China meet its new responsibilities. Continuing \ndown a policy track which offers choices only between inadequate \nengagement or quixotic containment is a journey that will end as it \nbegan, in frustration without alternatives. We cannot allow that to be \nour legacy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1085.

concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 45\n\n       Whereas Dr. Hans Blix is nearing the completion of 16 years \n     of distinguished service as Director General of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency is retiring from that \n     position;\n       Whereas Director General Blix has pursued the fundamental \n     safeguards and nuclear cooperation objectives of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency with admirable skill and \n     professional dedication; and\n       Whereas Director General Blix has earned international \n     acclaim for his contributions to world peace and security: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress, on behalf of the people of \n     the United States--\n       (1) commends Dr. Hans Blix for his untiring efforts on \n     behalf of world peace and development as the Director General \n     of the International Atomic Energy Agency; and\n       (2) wishes Dr. Blix a happy and fulfilling future.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit and speak on behalf \nof my proposed concurrent resolution to honor Dr. Hans Blix, who will \nsoon be retiring after 16 years of service as the Director General of \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].\n  Unfortunately, it is probably true that many Members of Congress do \nnot fully understand what the IAEA is, what it does, and how it serves \nour national security interests. I think it is appropriate, therefore, \nto take just a few minutes to describe the agency that Dr. Blix has \ndirected over these many years of distinguished service.\n  I would like to begin by discussing what the IAEA is not. The agency \nis not an organization that specializes in public relations or \nadvertising to herald its achievements. Its officials tend not to be \nflamboyant. It is not any appendage or puppet of the U.S. Government, \nthough it surely does serve the national security and foreign policy \ninterests of the American people. It is not a police force. It has no \narmy. It has no clandestine intelligence service. It has no ability to \nfinance its operations by raising tax revenues. Indeed,\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nit has absolutely no guarantee that adequate funds will be available to \npay for the agency's complex and ever-growing responsibilities. And \nlike many other international organizations composed of diverse \nmembers--including some countries that do not even exchange diplomatic \nrelations--it is not an agency that is immune to political conflict or \ncontroversy.\n  So what then is the IAEA?\n  The IAEA is a highly specialized agency in the United Nations system. \nIt was created back in 1957, largely as a result of the Atoms for Peace \ninitiative launched by President Dwight Eisenhower. Since its \nestablishment, the IAEA has performed two basic tasks. First, it \nimplements a system of safeguards over the peaceful uses of nuclear \nenergy around the world. These safeguards consist of inspections, \naccounting measures, and material verification controls intended to \nensure--in the words of the IAEA statute--``* * * that special \nfissionable and other materials, services, equipment, facilities, and \ninformation made available by the agency or at its request or under its \nsupervision or control are not used in such a way as to further any \nmilitary purpose''.\n  After the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT] \nentered into force a quarter of a century ago, the parties to that \ntreaty established a system of nuclear safeguards whose objectives were \n``* * * the timely detection of diversion of significant quantities of \nnuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture of \nnuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes \nunknown, and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early \ndetection'' (IAEA, INFCIRC 153, para. 28).\n  After the war in 1991 to expel Iraq from Kuwait, the UN Security \nCouncil gave the IAEA the responsibility of ensuring that Iraq was \ncomplying with the Council's resolutions concerning the dismantling of \nIraq's nuclear weapons capability, a mission that the agency continues \nto perform today.\n  But the agency does not just implement safeguards. Its second key \nmission is to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in such \nfields as agriculture, medicine, nuclear safety, and the generation of \nelectricity. Today, more than 90 countries receive nuclear technical \nassistance from the IAEA. This assistance typically comes in the form \nof equipment, expert services, and training activities. Funding for \nthese activities comes primarily from member states' voluntary \ncontributions. The United States, which played such an essential role \nin the creation of this agency, contributes about a quarter of the \nIAEA's regular budget, which in 1996 came to $63 million of the \nagency's $219 million budget.\n  Now having just described what the Agency is not, and having reviewed \nbriefly what the agency is, it should be quite apparent that any \nindividual who can lead such an organization for 16 years, win numerous \nreelections, inspire the confidence of members of the world community--\nsome of whom are not even talking to each other--enhance the technical \ncompetence of the agency, and accomplish all of the above on a limited \nbudget, is no ordinary individual indeed. And that describes Dr. Blix \nabout as best as I can describe him. He is a remarkable public servant.\n\n  I would like to add on a personal note that I have had the privilege \nof meeting with Dr. Blix many times during his frequent trips to this \ncountry. I know the kinds of political, organizational, and funding \nproblems he has had to handle over his long tenure of office. I \nappreciated both his candor and his extensive knowledge about the \nworkings of the agency that has done more than any other to protect the \nworld community against the nightmare of loose nukes. I will miss both \nhis good humor and his wise counsel about the challenges facing the \nagency as it grapples with some of the world's most difficult \ninternational security problems.\n  Though I wish Dr. Blix well in his retirement, I also look forward to \nworking with his successor as Director General, Dr. Mohamed El Baradei. \nAnd as I prepare for my own retirement next year, I hope that all of my \ncolleagues with responsibilities in the field of international nuclear \naffairs will miss no opportunity to educate themselves about this \nimportant international agency and the vital contributions it makes to \nthe security of all Americans and, indeed, to the security of the world \ncommunity as a whole.\n  It is important for us all to understand not just where this agency \nhas been but where it may be heading in the years ahead.\n  We must recognize that safeguards do not implement themselves and \nwill never suffice as a permanent guarantee against the illicit uses of \nnuclear materials. We must face the fact that some nuclear activities--\nsuch as large-scale reprocessing of plutonium or commercial uses of \nhighly-enriched uranium--are probably unsafeguardable in the strict \nsense of the term and should therefore be discouraged internationally \nor, if economic reason and security considerations are allowed to \nprevail, phased out all together.\n  We must acknowledge that nuclear power offers no panacea for either \nthe Greenhouse Effect or the world's ever-growing demand for \nelectricity.\n  We must beware of efforts in the world community to expand the \nmissions of this agency without also giving it the resources it needs \nto perform those responsibilities.\n  We must understand that IAEA member countries that comply with their \nsafeguards agreements and international nonproliferation treaty \nobligations are entitled to receive technical assistance from the \nagency--and that the United States has ample foreign policy tools \navailable to influence its adversaries rather than turning the IAEA \ninto a diplomatic playing card, a punching bag, or an arena for \ngladiatorial combat.\n  If we recognize the strengths and limitations of the agency, I \nbelieve it will continue to serve the positive roles it has played over \nmany decades in the service of world peace, security, and prosperity. \nAnd if the legacy of Dr. Blix continues to inspire the leadership of \nthat agency in the years ahead, as I have every reason to believe it \nwill, then the future of the IAEA will be bright indeed.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Dr. Blix \nfor his long and dedicated service in the pursuit of a safer world. Let \nus salute him and his agency for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8277-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8278-S8280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  THE DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND \n        RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                GREGG (AND HOLLINGS) AMENDMENT NO. 1024\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Hollings) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (S. 1022) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 77, line 16, strike ``$1,995,252,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,999,052,000''.\n       On page 77, line 16, after ``expended'', insert the \n     following: ``, of which not to exceed $3,800,000 may be made \n     available to the Secretary of Commerce for a study on the \n     effect of intentional encirclement, including chase, on \n     dolphins and dolphin stocks in the eastern tropical Pacific \n     Ocean purse seine fishery''.\n       On page 77, line 26, strike ``$1,992,252,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,996,052,000''.\n       On page 100, line 24, strike ``75,000,000'' and insert \n     ``105,000,000.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        GREGG AMENDMENT NO. 1025\n\n  Mr. GREGG proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1022, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law and pursuant to \n     the fiscal year 1997 Emergency Supplemental Act (Public Law \n     105-18) Subsection 2004, funding for the following projects \n     is to be made available from prior year carryover funds: \n     $200,000 for the Ship Creek facility in Anchorage, Alaska; \n     $1,000,000 for the construction of a facility on the Gulf \n     Coast in Mississippi; and $300,000 for an open ocean \n     aquaculture project and community outreach programs in \n     Durham, New Hampshire.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COVERDELL AMENDMENT NO. 1026\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Coverdell) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1022, supra; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT \n                   PAYMENTS TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET.--\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (A) it reaffirmed the importance of universal service \n     support for telecommunications services by passing the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996;\n       (B) the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the Federal \n     Communications Commission to preserve and advance universal \n     service based on the following principles:\n       (1) Quality services should be available at just, \n     reasonable, and affordable rates;\n       (2) Access to advanced telecommunications and information \n     services should be provided in all regions of the Nation;\n       (3) Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-\n     income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost \n     areas, should have access to telecommunications and \n     information services, including interexchange services and \n     advanced telecommunications and information services, that \n     are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban \n     areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \n     compared to rates charged for similar services;\n       (4) All providers of telecommunications services should \n     make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the \n     preservation and advancement of universal service;\n       (5) There should be specific, predictable, and sufficient \n     Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \n     universal service; and\n       (6) Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health \n     care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced \n     telecommunications services;\n       (C) Federal and State universal contributions are \n     administered by an independent, non-Federal entity and are \n     not deposited into the Federal Treasury and therefore not \n     available for Federal appropriations;\n       (D) the Conference Committee on the Balanced Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1997, is considering proposals that \n     would withhold Federal universal service funds in the year \n     2002; and\n       (E) the Withholding of billions of dollars of universal \n     service support payments may result in temporary rate \n     increases in rural and high cost areas and may delay \n     qualifying schools, libraries, and rural health facilities \n     discounts directed under the Telecommunications Act of 1996:\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997 should not \n     manipulate, modify, or impair universal service support as a \n     means to achieve a balanced Federal budget or to achieve \n     Federal budget savings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  McCAIN (AND KYL) AMENDMENT NO. 1028\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. McCain, for himself and Mr. Kyl) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 1022, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the section in title I regarding the ``WAIVER \n     OF CERTAIN VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS'', insert the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(b) Report.--The Attorney General, in conjunction with \n     the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and State, shall \n     report to Congress within 6 months of the date of enactment \n     of this Act on how to establish an enforcement program to \n     ensure that immigrants who receive waivers from the \n     immunization requirement pursuant to section 212 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act comply with the requirement \n     of that section after the immigrants enter the United States, \n     except when such immunizations would not be medically \n     appropriate in the United States or would be contrary to the \n     alien's religious or moral convictions.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BIDEN AMENDMENT NO. 1029\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Biden) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1022, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a \nbill, S. 1072, that corrects an unintended loophole in the Plant Patent \nAct of 1930 dealing with the coverage of plant parts. The 1930 act \ncovers the whole plant but did not address plant parts, resulting in a \nloophole whereby some growers, particularly in foreign nations that do \nnot have plant breeders' rights laws, are reproducing U.S. patent-\nprotected varieties without authorization. They then export the \nharvested materials--plant parts--such as flowers and fruits, to the \nUnited States. The loophole has been created by new production and \ntransportation capabilities unforeseen 67 years ago.\n  As a result, American plant breeders are losing royalty income that \nsupports continued research and breeding of new and improved varieties. \nDomestic growers who are paying legitimate royalties are also finding \nthemselves at an unfair disadvantage to foreign growers producing \npatented varieties illegally.\n  The Plant Patent Act of 1930 has historically offered a strong \nincentive for research and breeding activities, which is the foundation \nfor a progressive and growing U.S. horticultural industry.\n  This legislation amends the Plant Patent Act to expressly cover \nplants and plant parts by inserting at the end of 35 U.S.C. 163, the \nwords ``or any parts thereof.'' This solution provides relief to U.S. \nbreeders and growers, and would help ensure that the United States \nremains an international leader in the development of new and useful \nplant varieties. It will enable plant and patent holders the \nopportunity to protect their patent rights and continue investing in \nresearch and development. S. 1072 is also consistent with the 1991 \nInternational Union for the Production of New Varieties of Plants, \nwhich extends plant breeders' rights protection to harvested material.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Plant Patent Amendment Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The protection provided by plant patents under title \n     35, United States Code, dating back to 1930, has historically \n     benefited American agriculture and horticulture and the \n     public by providing an incentive for breeders to develop new \n     plant varieties.\n       (2) Domestic and foreign agricultural trade is rapidly \n     expanding and is very different from the trade of the past. \n     An unforeseen ambiguity in the provisions of title 35, United \n     States Code, is undermining the orderly collection of \n     royalties due breeders holding United States plant patents.\n       (3) Plant parts produced from plants protected by United \n     States plant patents are being taken from illegally \n     reproduced plants and traded in United States markets to the \n     detriment of plant patent holders.\n       (4) Resulting lost royalty income inhibits investment in \n     domestic research and breeding activities associated with a \n     wide variety of crops--an ares where the United States has \n     historically enjoyed a strong international position. Such \n     research is the foundation of a strong horticultural \n     industry.\n       (5) Infringers producing such plant parts from unauthorized \n     plants enjoy an unfair competitive advantage over producers \n     who pay royalties on varieties protected by United States \n     plant patents.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clearly and explicitly provide that title 35, United \n     States Code, protects the owner of a plant patent against the \n     unauthorized sale of plant parts taken from plants illegally \n     reproduced;\n       (2) to make the protections provided under such title more \n     consistent with those provided breeders of sexually \n     reproduced plants under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 2321 et. seq.), as amended by the plant Variety \n     Protection Act Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103-349); and\n       (3) to strengthen the ability of United States plant patent \n     holders to enforce their patent rights with regard to \n     importation of plant parts produced from plants protected by \n     United States plant patents, which are propagated without the \n     authorization of the patent holder.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO TITLE 35, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       (a) Rights in Plant Patents.--Section 163 of title 35, \n     United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 163. Grant\n\n       ``In the case of a plant patent, the grant shall include \n     the right to exclude others from asexually reproducing the \n     plant, and from using, offering for sale, or selling the \n     plant so reproduced, or any of its parts, throughout the \n     United States, or from importing the plant so reproduced, or \n     any parts thereof, into the United States.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to any plant patent issued on or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8282-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WIPO IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, Jim Gaupp was a fine American \nwhose life touched many people. He was devoted to his family, and \ncommitted to his community. The following is an excerpt from the \nprogram at Jim's funeral, held at the Pinecrest Presbyterian Church in \nHendersonville, NC:\n\n                               Psalm 121\n\n     I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh \n           my help.\n     My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.\n     He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth thee \n           will not slumber.\n     Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor \n           sleep.\n     The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right \n           hand.\n     The sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night.\n     The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve \n           thy soul.\n     The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from \n           this time forth, and even for evermore.\n\n  James Louis Gaupp was born in Elk City, OK. In time, Jim moved to \nColumbus, OH, where he worked for Williams & Co., the metals warehouse. \nDuring his 47 years with Williams, Jim worked his way through the ranks \nand retired as a district manager and vice president. Jim Gaupp's \ncommitment was to be a ``Christian businessman and father.''\n  In Columbus, OH, Jim Gaupp was very active in community service. He \nwas very active in his church, in the chamber of commerce, and in the \nKiwanis Club.\n  Jim and Betty Gaupp moved to Hendersonville in 1982, and quickly \nbecame vital parts of the Pinecrest Church. At Pinecrest, Jim served as \nan elder, Sunday school teacher, and faithful member.\n  In the Kiwanis Club of Hendersonville, Jim Gaupp was faithful; 51 \nyears of perfect attendance at various Kiwanis Clubs was a record \nattained by Jim.\n  Jim Gaupp was an outstanding Christian gentleman. Jim was an ardent \nstudent of the Bible--entrusting large portions of Scripture to memory. \nJim was a great man of prayer. As much as anything else, Jim Gaupp was \na great example and model for the sake of Christ\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nin our midst. In many ways, Jim Gaupp will be missed.\n  Jim Gaupp is survived by his devoted wife, Betty, two daughters, one \nson, and several grandchildren.\n  Jim's life was an example to all, and he deserves a great deal of \nrecognition. He has enriched our lives with his many contributions to \nour community. Jim will certainly be missed. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8282-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO JERI WARE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Washington State lost a visionary \nleader, a passionate advocate, and a remarkable woman with the passing \nof Jerline Ware. As a citizen activist and as a public servant, Jeri \nWare worked tirelessly for social justice and to ensure a brighter \nfuture for our community's children.\n  Jeri Ware may best be remembered as the chairwoman of the Seattle \nHuman Rights Commission. This position gave her the opportunity to do \nin an official capacity what she had done her entire life: fight \nagainst discrimination and for equality and human rights. She never \ngave up believing in a just society and never shied away from speaking \nout for those who had been wronged. Just last December, the Seattle \nHuman Rights Commission honored Jeri for her tireless commitment and \ndedication.\n  Jeri's other passion was our community's young people. She recognized \nthat the future well-being of our community depended on our having a \nshared sense of responsibility for all our children and giving them the \nbest possible start in life. She put this conviction into action by \nworking in the tutorial program at the University of Washington and as \na parent coordinator at Seattle's Leschi School.\n  We will miss not only Jeri Ware the activist and community leader, \nbut also Jeri Ware the friend. She was a woman who was always willing \nto open her heart and home.\n  Jeri leaves her husband of 49 years, John, sons Anthony Muhammed and \nJohn Ware, daughters Joan Ware and Falicia Green, six grandchildren and \ntwo great-grandchildren; to whom our thoughts go out.\n  Jeri Ware's passing at the all-too-young age of 73 leaves a great \nvoid. However, her courage, commitment and unending faith in a just \nsociety will continue to be an inspiration to all those who share her \nvision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8283-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, our Nation has an obligation to its \ncitizens and to the world community to be a leader in working toward \nimprovement of the global environment. Coming from an agricultural \nState, I am particularly concerned about the potential impacts of \nglobal climate changes on our ability to produce the food that is so \nvitally needed, both at home and abroad. However, if we are going to be \neffective in achieving our goals for a better global environment, we \nnot only have to do what is necessary to reduce emissions here in our \nown country, we must also take the lead in negotiating agreements that \nwill require the reduction of greenhouse gases in other countries \naround the world.\n  Frankly, I am deeply concerned over the negotiations related to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in which the \nUnited States and other countries are discussing the reduction of the \nemission of greenhouse gases. These negotiations are currently headed \nin a direction that will ask those who have already made great progress \nin reducing emissions to reduce them even further, while at the same \ntime allowing those who have made no serious attempt to reduce the \nemission of greenhouse gases to do virtually nothing to comply.\n  I'm proud to say that my State, North Dakota, was the first State in \nAmerica to comply with the Clean Air Act. We have taken the \nresponsibility of reducing emissions in my home State and throughout \nthese United States very seriously. Even though we have doubled our use \nof energy in the past 20 years in this country, we now have cleaner \nair. Have we done all we could? No, we can do more and we will. But, \neverybody needs to do their fair share.\n  The question in these negotiations is an issue of fairness. Is it \nfair to our economy to impose stringent controls that will cost \nsubstantial money to get a small margin of additional environmental \nbenefit, when other have not even really started? Is it fair when we \nhave already made significant strides in reducing emissions to exempt \nother countries, whose economies are competing with ours, from any \nmeaningful compliance?\n  In recent trips to China, I have observed the degradation of that \ncountry's air shed because of the lack of meaningful laws or \nenforcement restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases. Yet, these \nnegotiations would effectively allow China, India and other countries \nin similar situations a free ride. They would have virtually no \nsignificant requirements to clean up their act in any reasonable time \nperiod.\n  I refuse to accept negotiations that impose a burden on ourselves \nthat we are unwilling to require of others, particularly when we have \nmade progress and others have not. This reminds me of our negotiations \non international trade in which we unilaterally have opened our markets \nto foreign goods, while allowing foreign markets to remain closed to \nour goods. While we bear the burden, others reap the profits. \nUnfortunately, we have not been willing to require other countries to \ntake the reciprocal actions to achieve fair trade.\n\n  I see exactly the same mentality in these negotiations on the \nreduction of air emissions. Our country once again appears willing to \nimpose burdens on our own economy that we will not require of others. \nEven if we were not competing with these other economies, this would \nnot make good sense.\n  I want to make it clear that I think our country has done the right \nthing by insisting that part of the costs of producing a product \nincludes the costs associated with reducing pollution and preventing \nthe degradation of our air or water. I am proud that our country has \nbeen a leader on these environmental issues.\n  As we move forward in establishing and developing compliance with \nglobal environmental standards that will protect the Earth's \nenvironment, we must do so in a fair and evenhanded way that does not \nput America at a significant disadvantage with its trading partners.\n  For example, if we are competing with the Chinese in the production \nof goods and we are required to assume a burden in compliance with \nemissions standards that the Chinese are not required to follow, then \nwe are imposing a penalty of fewer jobs and slower economic growth on \nour own economy. I think that's unfair to this country.\n  The administration should not mistake the concern that we have in \nCongress about this issue as one of weakness on environmental issues. \nThat is simply not the case. In fact, the Congress has demonstrated its \nstrong support for environmental cleanup for more than two decades.\n  If the administration intends to negotiate global requirements for \nenvironmental compliance, then this Congress will insist that these \nrequirements are fair. We will insist that the negotiations do not \nimpose burdens on our own country, while other countries are exempted \nfrom their enforcement responsibilities. This is a matter of fairness \nand doing what is right for our Nation and our planet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8283-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8283-S8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHESTER HOSE COMPANY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nChester Hose Company on their 85th anniversary. On September 7 they \nwill be honored by the town of Chester and the Chester Historical \nSociety with a Chester Hose Company Day celebration.\n  For the past 85 years this dedicated group of men and women have \nstrived to ensure the safety of the community of Chester, CT. Their \ndedication is evident in their unshakable commitment to self-sacrifice \nfor the security of their friends, families, and neighbors. Indeed, \nsome have given the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives while trying \nto protect their fellow citizens.\n  This organization's dedication and commitment to the town of Chester \ncan be seen not only through the company's actions, but also in the \ngreat confidence and respect the residents of Chester place in these \nmen and women. These are ordinary citizens asked to\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\nperform extraordinary tasks, and never asking what was in it for them. \nThe community's faith in their company has not wavered in its first 85 \nyears and will undoubtedly continue through the next century.\n  The Chester Hose Company has been an important stone in the \nfoundation of the town of Chester. The people of Connecticut thank them \nfor their service, dedication, and contribution to their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8283-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  URGING APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE ABUSES\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to \nthe request for a special prosecutor to look into the campaign finance \nabuses of the last election.\n  It comes as a shock to me that I even have to give this speech. It is \nso clearly necessary to have a nonpartisan, noncoercible investigator \nlooking into these issues that the failure to appoint one in itself \nlooks suspicious. The current troubles over election funding are just \nthe sort of situation the special prosecutor idea was created for. The \nproblem is a far reaching, bi-partisan scandal involving two branches \nof Government. It is also a scandal where those being investigated have \nthe ability and possibly the desire to curb or even block efforts to \nfully unearth all the relevant facts.\n  And let me make this clear--it is not a potential scandal, Mr. \nPresident, it is a scandal. It is a scandal we see unfolding on TV, in \nthe papers, and in the Hart Committee room with Senator Thompson's \nhearings.\n  And by the word scandal, I don't mean it's a little bit of gossip the \nmedia can pick over, but a scandal in that the situation is an illegal, \nunethical, and glaringly blatant violation of what the American people \nexpect from their elected officials. There needs to be a full scale \ninvestigation into the entire finance problem, and a special prosecutor \nis the best way to accomplish this.\n  I admire Senator Thompson. I admire what he is doing. I have the \nutmost respect for his investigatory powers, and I truly believe he can \ndo what he says he is going to do. His committee is fairly and bravely \nshining the public light of inquiry into the darker corners of election \nfunding, and for that he deserves all the kudos he can be given. But \nthe fact remains that a special prosecutor is needed.\n  Senator Thompson's hearings should serve as the springboard from \nwhich a special prosecutor's investigation is launched. He has called \nattention to the problem, he has let our colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle have a chance to look into the abuses of fund-raising and \nsoft money, and he has helped greatly to awaken the American people to \nthe travesties done in an attempt to win their votes. Now, from this \nsolid base, a solid legal case can be built against those who have \nabused our--admittedly--easily abusable system.\n  A special prosecutor investigation has more mobility, more leeway and \nmore time than a Senate committee. It also is not troubled with \npartisan bickering and posturing. I know that Senator Thompson has done \nhis best to curtail any partisanship, and he has done an excellent job, \nbut the special prosecutor was created for just this reason--to avoid \nthe clash between parties in a wide ranging investigation.\n  Honestly, how can there be any doubt that we need a special \nprosecutor in this case?\n  Not only the chairman, but also the ranking member of the committee \nlooking into campaign finance abuses, Senator Glenn, admits that the \nevidence before the committee supports the conclusion that attempts \nwere made by foreign powers to buy our elections.\n  There are those who say that the Justice Department could handle any \nillegalities associated with campaign abuse, if indeed any are found. \nWell, the Justice Department faces a conflict of interest trying to \ninvestigate up its chain of command. Anyone who thinks differently is \nkidding themselves. The Justice Department lawyers looking into this \nare careerist, and they report to political appointees.\n  For instance--the FBI claims they have not been able to find Charlie \nTrie, but Tom Brokaw was not only able to find him, he was able to \ninterview him. I know that the American media are good, but better than \nthe combined powers of our Federal police forces? More likely, there is \na restraining force on the Justice Department. They are not to blame. \nNobody should have to investigate their boss, and nobody should have to \ninvestigate the people who find them.\n  A special prosecutor has not been appointed because the Attorney \nGeneral says that there is not enough proof to warrant one. I am not \nsure, exactly, where to begin to refute that idea. The abuses we have \nbeen made aware of are so glaring and so blatant and so widespread that \nI am almost thinking that the Attorney General is kidding. She herself, \naccording to the press, has created a tax force inside the Justice \nDepartment and convened a grand jury to look into allegations.\n  Now, the special prosecutor's system has taken some hits lately. But \nwe can insure that any prosecutor appointed is given a clear, \nspecialized and fixed mandate to investigate the election funding \nissue. We can set guidelines that do not curb the power of the \nprosecutor, but insure a very narrow and specific investigation.\n  I urge the appointment of a special prosecutor. I urge the \ninvestigation of the election fundraising abuses. I urge a fair and \njust conclusion to this stain on our democratic election \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/29/senate-section/article/S8284-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8284-S8285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-16 AND TREATY \n                          DOCUMENT NO. 105-17\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of Cyprus (``the Treaty''), signed at Washington on June 17, \n1996.\n  In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the \nreport explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make \na significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted is the report of the Department of \nState with respect to the Treaties.\n  These Treaties are in the best interests of the United States. They \nensure that international copyright rules will keep pace with \ntechnological change,\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\nthus affording important protection against piracy for U.S. \nrightsholders in the areas of music, film, computer software, and \ninformation products. The terms of the Treaties are thus consistent \nwith the United States policy of encouraging other countries to provide \nadequate and effective intellectual property protection.\n  Legislation is required to implement certain provisions of the \nTreaties. Legislation is also required to ensure that parties to the \nTreaties are granted, under U.S. copyright law, the rights to which \nthey are entitled under the Treaties. That legislation is being \nprepared and is expected to be submitted shortly.\n  I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances \nand Phonograms Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification, \nsubject to a declaration under Article 15(3) of the WIPO Performances \nand Phonograms Treaty described in the accompanying State Department \nreport.\n                                                  William J.
