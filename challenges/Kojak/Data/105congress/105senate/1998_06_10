On this vote the yeas are 43; \nthe nays are 55. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill remain in status quo until 12 noon, for the \npurpose of debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just say that may even go until \n12:30. The problem is the amendment we had agreed to take up next--that \nwould have been Senator Gramm, Senator Domenici, and Senator Roth--they \nhave not completed the language so the other side is able to examine \nthis language, which is a courtesy, obviously, that is expected around \nhere. But we do expect to move forward with the Gramm amendment and \ndebate on it either within a half-hour or an hour.\n  Mr. President, let me just say again, it is my understanding that \nSenator Hatch had a substitute he wanted considered, that Senator Gramm \nand Senator Domenici had a substitute, and there is also the very \nimportant issue of the farmer aspect of this bill to which the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Senator Ford, is obviously very involved in and \ncommitted. There is also the issue of attorneys' fees that would be the \nsubject of an amendment.\n  I also am aware that there are several hundred, maybe, other \namendments that have been--quote--filed. Those are amendments which I \nknow in the view of the sponsors are important amendments, but I have \nto say I do not believe that they are vital to the progress of this \nbill. Many of them we could accept. Many of them I think could be \ndispensed with in a short period of time.\n  After the disposition of the Gramm amendment, which I understand \nthere will be a time agreement on, I hope then that would be an \nappropriate time to determine not only where we go for the rest of the \nday, but for the rest of this bill. We are in the middle of the third \nweek of consideration of this legislation. I thought the passage of the \ndrug amendment yesterday was important. A tax cut, as we may enact \ntoday--although there certainly are some concerns I have about the size \nof it--if it passes, then I think it is important for us to determine \non both sides of the aisle as to where we want to go after that.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield at any time to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend. When you go to the marriage penalty \namendment, or at least the minority has an opportunity to visit with \nit, and then you indicate that you want to go maybe to the substitute--\nyou have at least one, possibly two--would it take a unanimous consent \nagreement to set aside the pending amendments, then, in order to go to \nthe substitutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding, if I could respond to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, that we have been conducting this whole procedure on a \nsort of agreement basis. I would like to say in response to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I understand what he is getting at here. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky wants the issue of the farmers in his State, and \nthroughout America----\n  Mr. FORD. And I prefer it not to be under cloture, when my time is \nlimited.\n  Mr. McCain. I understand. I think it is important the Senator's \nconcerns be satisfied. I think the Senator from Massachusetts and I, \nalong with the leaders, should sit down with him and try to address \nthis very important concern that he has.\n  Mr. FORD. I will be more than happy to do that. As the majority \nleader set out the sequence of getting this bill out of here, that we \nwould have to pull a bill from the calendar in order to have a tax bill \nto put this one on to get it back to the House, there are a lot of \nslips between the lip and the cup before this bill will leave the \nChamber as it relates to the farmer question.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCain. As I mentioned yesterday, after we passed the drug bill \nand had an agreement to move forward with tax cuts, I felt a lot more \nlike Bob Hope felt----\n  Mr. FORD. He is alive.\n  Mr. McCain. In that the bill is alive, than I did some sense of \nexhilaration.\n  So I also am very aware of how difficult this agriculture--tobacco \nfarmer issue is to the Senator from Kentucky. He and I have worked \ntogether for many, many years on many, many issues. I know the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I have such a relationship that he will not be \nmistreated, given the consideration which he deserves on this issue.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend. I will not mistreat him until I tell him \nI am going to.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could just add to the list the Senator from Arizona \njust ran through, in addition to the amendments that he mentioned is \nalso an amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, on \nadvertising, and there is an amendment of mine, joined with a number of \ndifferent colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on the issue of \nchildren. So those are two other issues. Time agreements on both of \nthem, however, will be easily arrived at, and they should not delay us \nas I think most of the issues the Senator listed will be subject to \ntime agreement. Obviously the issue of the Senator from Kentucky is \nmore contentious, and one we need to work on over the course of the \nnext days. And we will.\n  With that said, we are waiting for the language from Senator Roth to \nadd to the language from Senator Gramm. Then, hopefully, we will be \nable to proceed. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2152 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we speak, there is work going on on \nredrafting the Gramm-Roth amendment to add what I think is a vitally \nimportant provision to provide tax relief through full deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self-employed. To me that is another very, \nvery significant step that we should take for the purpose of fairness, \nthe purpose of assuring that all people in this country have health \ncare, to ensure that those who may suffer illnesses or disability as a \nresult of the use of tobacco have adequate care when they become ill.\n  The revised amendment has not yet been offered, but I rise in strong \nsupport of the Gramm-Roth amendment, because it will return a portion \nof the revenues raised from the tobacco tax to taxpayers who are \nbearing the burden of this tax increase. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor.\n  The objective is to discourage use of tobacco by raising the price, \nand certainly tax increases will do that, but the purpose of the bill \nshould not be to raise the taxes and produce massive\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nnew Government spending. I think it is appropriate that we use this \nbill to provide tax relief to the people who are going to be paying \nincreased taxes on tobacco.\n  The amendment's phaseout of the marriage penalty for couples with \nincomes of less than $50,000 is a solid first step to eliminating the \nmarriage penalty completely. We should be encouraging people to marry \nand raise their children in a marriage.\n  Under current law, many two-income wage earners, particularly if they \nare both earning good wages, are penalized by paying higher taxes as a \nresult of being married than they would be paying if they were single. \nIn addition, I think it is fitting that part of the tobacco tax \nrevenues will be used to ease the burdens of the tax increase which \nwill be borne by Americans in the lowest tax brackets.\n  I am also extremely pleased that part of these revenues will be used \nto eliminate another inequity in the Tax Code--the deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self-employed. This amendment will finally--\nfinally--make full deductibility a reality beginning next year.\n  Again, it is fitting to use tobacco revenues for this purpose since \ntwo-thirds of families headed by a self-employed individual with no \nhealth insurance earn less than $50,000 a year. That is from a March \n1997 Current Population Survey. I don't have in hand the statistics on \nthe number of those people who may be tobacco users, but I suspect that \nit is a significant number who would be taxed by the increased cost of \ncigarettes who would find it difficult to make commitments, like buying \nhealth insurance, if they don't have this relief.\n  Today, while the self-employed, as a result of our actions in the \nlast couple of years, which I led and strongly supported, can deduct 45 \npercent of their health insurance costs, they are still not on a level \nplaying field with large businesses which can deduct 100 percent.\n  While the self-employed are slated to have full deductibility in \n2007, and I am very grateful to the Members of this body who supported \nour efforts to get that goal, what self-employed person or family \nmembers can wait 9 more years to get sick? It just isn't going to \nhappen. Nobody is willing to wait 9 years to get their health \ninsurance, and we should not wait 9 years to give them fair tax \ntreatment for buying health insurance for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  An immediate increase in the deduction to 100 percent would make \nhealth insurance more affordable and accessible to 5.4 million \nAmericans in families headed by self-employed individuals who currently \nhave no health insurance. Full deductibility will also help bring \ninsurance to 1.5 million children who live in households headed by \nself-employed individuals where there is no health insurance.\n  Coverage of these self-employed individuals and their children \nthrough the self-employed health insurance deduction will enable the \nprivate sector to address the health care needs of these individuals \nrather than having an expensive, intrusive, and burdensome Federal \nbureaucracy to do it.\n  It has long been my goal that the self-employed have immediate 100 \npercent deductibility of health insurance costs. I have sought every \nopportunity to achieve that goal.\n  In 1995, my amendment to the Balanced Budget Act, which President \nClinton vetoed, would have increased the health insurance deduction for \nthe self-employed to 50 percent.\n  In 1996, I worked with Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy to \ninclude in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act an \nincrease in the self-employed health insurance deduction incrementally \nover 10 years to 80 percent.\n  In 1997, provisions of my Home-Based Business Fairness Act were \nincluded in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, finally increasing the \ndeduction to 100 percent in 2007 and accelerating the phase-in over \nexisting law.\n  This year, I and others who have been strong supporters, on a \nbipartisan basis, of this measure worked with Chairman Domenici to \ninclude language in the budget resolution calling for funds to be \navailable to accelerate the 100-percent deductibility of health \ninsurance by the self-employed.\n  If this tobacco bill is signed into law without full deductibility, I \nintend to be back--and I will be back as many times as it takes--to \nfinish the job. Right now, full deductibility is available in 2007. I \nintend to be here to see it move up to an immediate deductibility to \nend the glaring unfairness of the discrimination against people who \nhave to buy their own health insurance who are not provided health \ninsurance by their employer.\n  The goal of providing full deductibility of health insurance costs \nfor the self-employed has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support. My \ncolleague who was just on the floor has long championed it. We do have \nsupport on both sides of the aisle. We have support from small \nbusiness, we have support from agriculture, because it is right, it is \nnecessary.\n  We are talking about health care. We are talking about eliminating a \npenalty, a tax penalty that discourages people from being able to \nacquire their own health insurance for themselves and their families.\n  Let us continue the spirit of bipartisanship by adopting this \namendment and not miss an opportunity to help the self-employed get the \ninsurance coverage they need and deserve. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this amendment when it comes to the floor. I \nintend to be a cosponsor. And I trust that we will have a strong \nbipartisan majority for the amendment when it is offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HORMEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak again--and I \nshall be relatively brief--about the nomination of James C. Hormel to \nbe United States Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n  I point out to colleagues that it has now been more than 8 months \nthat his nomination has languished, awaiting an opportunity for us to \nconsider this on the Senate floor. I have spoken on the floor before \nabout Mr. Hormel.\n  Let me just make one point. We in fact have voted before on Mr. \nHormel when we made the decision as to whether or not he would be a \nrepresentative to the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General \nAssembly. As I look at his qualifications, he has had a tremendous \namount of success as a businessman, a tremendous amount of success as a \nlawyer, a tremendous amount of success in philanthropy, a tremendous \namount of success from the point of view of very, very moving, very \npersonal testimony by his former wife, his children, his family \nmembers, people who really know him well--and, I say to the Chair, \npeople who know him not from the point of view of formal credentials, \nnot from the point of view of any political fight, but from the point \nof view of kind of measuring the character of a person.\n  My feeling is, colleagues can have different views about this \nnomination, but I believe it is extremely important that this \nnomination be brought to the floor. I've said it before. I have spoken \nany number of different times on the floor about Mr. Hormel. What I \nhave said is that if there is a debate about his qualifications, that \nis quite one thing. If so, then let us have that debate.\n  But I do not want the Senate to deny a nomination to anyone because \nof their sexual orientation. I think that would be discrimination. It's \nnot just that I think that would be discrimination; it would be \ndiscrimination. And I think it is terribly important that the Senate \ntake a long, hard look at itself and, at the very minimum, we have the \ndebate. I think to be silent about this\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nis a betrayal of what the Senate stands for, which is a fundamental \nrespect for the dignity and worth of each and every person.\n  The reason I come to the floor is just to say, colleagues, we have \nthe tobacco bill before us. And we have had a number of amendments. We \nhave still got a long ways to go. I do not know that I will bring an \namendment to the floor on this bill or not, in any case. But certainly \nif not the tobacco bill, on the next bill--or the next appropriate \nvehicle, as soon as possible; the sooner the better--I will have an \namendment which in some way puts a focus on this whole question of \njudging a person by the content of his or her character, judging them \nby their qualifications, judging them by their leadership, and in no \nway, shape, or form making any kind of judgment based upon any form of \ndiscrimination.\n  Understand me, because I am talking--and a friend of mine is \npresiding, a good friend, someone whom I disagree with, but whom I \nreally like a lot. And I hope it is mutual. I am not arguing that \ndifferent people can't have different views, and I am not arguing that \nthere are some who in very good faith may oppose this nomination. \nAbsolutely not. But I just think that there are some big questions to \nbe resolved here.\n  It is terribly important we not just block this. It is terribly \nimportant we have an honest discussion and an honest debate and we have \nan up-or-down vote. I think my role as a Senator is to bring some \namendments to the floor on pieces of legislation to put this into very \nsharp focus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6003-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6004-S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRIVATIZATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also, if I could, want to take just a \nfew minutes to speak about Social Security, about its future, and about \na campaign under way to trade it in for a privatized system like the \none we have in Chile.\n  President Clinton has called for a nationwide debate on Social \nSecurity for the balance of this year, to be followed by a White House \nconference in December and legislative action early next year. I think \nit is time--perhaps well past time--for the defenders of Social \nSecurity to speak up and be heard.\n  As far as I am concerned, Social Security is one of America's \nproudest accomplishments of the 20th century. It has given retirement \nsecurity to Americans of all ages and has rescued millions of seniors \nfrom the scourge of poverty. Everyone says they want to protect and \npreserve this remarkably efficient and effective program which is so \nbeloved by the American people. But you would never know it, judging \nfrom the direction the debate is taking.\n  The premise of the debate is that Social Security is on the verge of \nbankruptcy and must be transformed in order to survive. I strongly \ndisagree. Social Security is not in crisis. It is not broke. It is not \nfacing bankruptcy. It may need some modest adjustments, but the \ngreatest dangers facing Social Security today are the many misguided \nproposals to ``fix'' it.\n  You can hardly open a newspaper these days without reading about the \nimpending collapse of Social Security. This is nonsense. Social \nSecurity is now taking in $101 billion more each year than it pays out \nin benefits.\n  In April, the Social Security trustees reported that the trust funds \nwill be able to cover benefits for the next 34 years, until the year \n2032. After that, without any changes to the system, it will still be \nable to pay out 70 to 75 percent of the promised benefits, virtually \nindefinitely without any change whatever in the system. There is no \nreason why Social Security should come to an abrupt end in 2032 or any \ntime thereafter.\n  Some would seize upon this projected funding imbalance decades from \nnow as an excuse to undermine the program. They want to replace Social \nSecurity with a privatized system in which retirement security depends \nsolely on success in playing the financial markets. But why would we \nwant to get rid of a program that has worked so well? Why should we \nwant to ``end Social Security as we know it?'' In fact, that's what I \nthink some of these proposals should be called--``ending Social \nSecurity as we know it.''\n  If we really want to protect and preserve Social Security, we should \nbe guided by two principles. First, we should focus all of our energies \non the real problem, which is a possible imbalance in the trust funds \nafter the year 2032. Second, under no circumstances should we allow \nfunding for Social Security to be squandered on the fees, commissions, \nand overhead of Wall Street middlemen.\n  There are a number of ways to go about this. Several prominent \neconomists have come forward with detailed reform packages that would \nguarantee long-term balance of the trust funds. Other proposals will be \ncoming out soon. These are relatively minor adjustments to the current \nsystem. They are not radical surgery.\n  Privatization, on the other hand, is radical surgery. And it doesn't \neven solve the problem. In fact, it actually takes away money from the \ntrust funds.\n  How could that be? The answer is so-called ``transition costs.'' They \nare really going to be a huge problem. Right now, over 80 percent of \npayroll taxes are used to pay benefits for current retirees. Under a \nprivatized system, those payroll taxes would be diverted into \nindividual retirement accounts. But younger workers would still have to \npay payroll taxes to fund benefits for current retirees. In effect, \nthey would be paying twice. There is no way of doing that without \nincreasing taxes, cutting benefits, or depleting the trust funds.\n  Here is an idea: Instead of paying unnecessary transition costs, what \nif we used that money to restore the trust funds? The same goes for the \nmore modest steps toward privatization now being discussed in Congress. \nSome members have proposed diverting 1, 2 or 3 percent of the 12.4-\npercent payroll tax into new individual accounts. Others would use a \nbudget surplus to do the same thing. Instead of setting up private \naccounts, we could just as easily use that money to shore up the trust \nfunds. That is the problem we are supposed to be fixing, isn't it? It's \nhard to explain how you are saving the trust funds when you're taking \nmoney out instead of putting money in.\n  The important thing, Mr. President, is to stay focused. As our \nguiding principle, we should insist that any legislation purporting to \nsave Social Security actually live up to its billing. It should reserve \nfor the trust funds any new savings or revenues. We shouldn't let some \nspeculative shortfall, 34 years from now, be used as an excuse to force \nthrough a very different--and, I would add, a very radical--agenda.\n  Why are we getting sidetracked with individual accounts and \nprivatization schemes that don't actually solve the problem? The reason \nis simple--money. Wall Street money, and lots of it. Mutual fund \ncompanies, stock brokerages, life insurance companies and banks are all \nsalivating at the prospect of 130 million potential new customers \ncoming their way. Privatization of Social Security could bring them \nuntold billions of dollars in extra fees and commissions. That is why \nthey have invested millions of dollars in a massive public relations \ncampaign promoting privatization, and they are doing a heck of a good \njob of it. That is one reason why they have contributed so heavily to \ncongressional and Presidential campaigns. The heavy hitters, the big \ngivers, they are heavily involved in this campaign.\n\n  Let me read from a story in the Washington Post on September 30, \n1996. The headline says, ``Wall Street's Quiet Message: Privatize \nSocial Security.''\n  It reads:\n\n       Wall Street is putting its weight behind the movement in \n     Washington to privatize Social Security . . .\n       Lobbyists for Wall Street are trying to stay behind the \n     scenes as they argue for privatization because they and their \n     firms so obviously stand to profit by the changes they are \n     promoting, according to financial industry executives. \n     Representatives of mutual funds, brokerages, life insurance \n     companies, and banks are involved in a lobbying effort to \n     have the government let Wall Street manage a slice of Social \n     Security's money . . .\n       Representatives of investment firms have begun lobbying \n     Capitol Hill and the White House to advance their agenda, \n     according to financial service industry executives . . .\n       Wall Street officials want to avoid or at least deflect \n     accusations that they are seeking to transform Social \n     Security to line their own purses.\n\n  And, I might add, their own purposes.\n  There has been some very good reporting in the Post, in the Wall \nStreet\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nJournal, and elsewhere on exactly who is paying how much money to whom.\n  It is absolutely unbelievable the way in which these Wall Street \ninterests have hijacked this debate. It is time for those of us who \nwant to protect this system to stand up and begin to speak out and \nfight back against these very radical efforts to privatize a social \ninsurance program that has been such a huge success, not just for \nsenior citizens, but for our parents and our grandparents.\n  I think it would be a tragedy if we stood by and let the trust funds \nbe squandered by Wall Street--and squandered on Wall Street. In Chile, \nwhere they privatized Social Security in 1981, an estimated 19 percent \nof worker contributions gets skimmed off the top by pension companies. \nThat's 19 percent skimmed off the top by the middlemen.\n  Social Security in our country, by contrast, has administrative costs \nof less than 1 percent with no fees, no commissions. One percent \nadministrative costs, no fees, no commissions, not going to the big \nWall Street interests. And now we have these efforts to privatize the \nsystem and turn over a large part of the surplus to Wall Street? \nUnbelievable.\n  Champions of privatization like to brag about higher returns on the \nstock market as compared to Social Security. I think those claims are \nexaggerated. But even if they were true, you don't need individual \naccounts managed by Wall Street campaign contributors to capture the \nhigher yields. You would get the same average returns if Social \nSecurity did the investing itself. And that way, seniors would still be \nguaranteed a monthly benefit indexed for inflation.\n  I'm not saying we should do that, necessarily. Stock markets go down \nas well as up. With all the financial turmoil in Asia and Russia right \nnow, we might want to think twice about betting the future of the trust \nfunds on go-go emerging markets. But whatever we do, we should insist \nthat the trust fund money not be siphoned off to Wall Street middlemen.\n  I want to say that again to my colleagues. We might want to think \ntwice about betting the future of the trust funds on go-go emerging \nmarkets. But whatever we do, we should insist that this trust fund \nmoney not be siphoned off to the Wall Street middlemen, which is \nactually what the privatization proposals do.\n  Our immediate focus should be on fixing the problem at hand--a \nprojected shortfall in the trust funds 34 years in the future. We \nshould not be diverting resources to half-baked schemes that would only \nmake the problem worse.\n  We should not let Wall Street campaign contributors push through a \n``reform plan'' that would only give them a slice of the trust funds. \nPrivatization is a phony solution to a phony crisis.\n  Social Security has been phenomenally successful for over a half a \ncentury--60 years. It ensures millions of Americans against disability, \ndeath of a spouse, and destitution in their old age. Compared to \nprivate retirement plans, it is a very good deal. And it is the most \nsuccessful antipoverty program America has ever devised.\n  It is simple. You reach the age of 62 or 65, you get older, you are \nno longer working, your earnings decline. There was a time when \nprobably half of the poverty population in our country were the \nelderly. That was a national disgrace. That is no longer the case. This \nis a very successful program.\n  While all of us should be saving more, the fact is that there will \nalways be millions and millions of Americans who depend solely on \nSocial Security for their retirement security. In fact, as fewer and \nfewer Americans have employer-provided pensions and as businesses are \nrapidly shifting from defined benefit plans to defined contribution, we \nneed Social Security now more than ever. This is no time to end \n``Social Security as we know it.''\n  We now have proposals, privatization schemes, to ``end Social \nSecurity as we know it.'' That is what this is all about. I am amazed \nthat we have not had more discussion about how to modify and support \nSocial Security as opposed to the privatization schemes that dismantle \nSocial Security.\n  I will give some of my colleagues credit. They have been able to \ntake, 34 years in the future, a potential shortfall and reduce it to an \nagenda that dismantles the Social Security system as we know it.\n  We need to have a major discussion and debate over this. In the \ncoming weeks and months, I plan to be talking at great length about how \nwe can correct the projected shortfall 34 years from now without ending \nSocial Security as we know it. Right now, friends of Social Security \nare generating a number of proposals that do not amount to radical \nsurgery. Those ideas deserve to be heard. Advocates for the \nprivatization plan favored by Wall Street should not have a monopoly \nover this debate. If we have a fully informed discussion and all \noptions are really on the table, I am very confident that the American \npeople will support a progressive solution that does not end Social \nSecurity as we know it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been concerned over the last few \ndays to hear growing attacks against the so-called e-rate--the program \nCongress created just 2 years ago to help schools, libraries and \nhospitals connect to the information superhighway.\n  I am concerned because of the timing of these attacks. Only last \nmonth, the Senate approved a bill increasing immigration quotas for \nhighly skilled workers from other countries. Why? Because there are not \nenough American workers with the technological skills to meet the needs \nof our economy. If that is not an acknowledgment that we need to do a \nbetter job of teaching technological skills in this country, frankly, I \ndon't know what is. I supported raising the quotas for skilled workers, \nbut that was a one-shot emergency response to a crisis.\n  By the year 2000, 60 percent of all jobs in our country will require \ntechnological skills that only a fraction of Americans now have. In the \nlongrun, the only way we can keep America's economy growing is by \ngiving our own workers the skills to compete and win in a high-skills \neconomy. That is why the sudden course of criticism of the e-rate is so \nalarming.\n  Today, only 27 percent of the classrooms in America are connected to \nthe Internet. In poor communities, rural and urban, only 14 percent of \nclassrooms are linked to the Internet. If we don't take the opportunity \nnow to address this problem, we simply will not have enough skilled \nworkers to retain America's position as the world's strongest economy. \nWe will also consign our children to two very different futures, \nseparate and unequal.\n  It seems like every week we hear more and more talk about the year \n2000 problem. What about the ``year 2010 problem''?\n  That is when--if we do nothing--children who are in kindergarten now \nwill be graduating from high school without the technological skills \nthey need to get a decent job or get a good college education. We \nsimply can't allow that to happen. We can't do that to our economy, and \nwe can't do that to our kids.\n  Congress understood that two years ago. That's why we created, on a \nstrong bipartisan basis, the e-rate program as part of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n  The e-rate program gives crucial discounts to schools and libraries \nto establish or upgrade Internet connections. The steepest discounts \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nthe neediest communities. All commercially available telecommunications \nservices are eligible for discounts.\n  Across the country, 30,000 schools and libraries have already applied \nfor help from the e-rate program to establish or upgrade Internet \nconnections.\n  In my own state of South Dakota, 280 schools have already applied.\n  Educational technology is critical in rural states like ours, Mr. \nPresident. Through teleconferencing and other kinds of long-distance \nlearning, students in South Dakota can take all kinds of classes they \nnever would have had the chance to take.\n  If we pull the plug on the e-rate, we will slam the doors to \ncountless educational opportunities--not just in South Dakota, but all \nacross America.\n  The United States is the most prosperous nation on earth. We are \ncurrently enjoying incredible economic growth. It is a travesty to say \nwe can't afford to give our children access to the tools they need to \nshare in this economic miracle.\n  Yet, if we kill the e-rate program--as some would clearly like--that \nis exactly what we will be saying to children in poor rural and urban \ncommunities.\n  How have we reached this sad state?\n  In a nutshell, some telecommunications companies are not playing \nstraight with the American public. They are trying to use \nschoolchildren as an excuse for costs they themselves choose to pass on \nto consumers.\n  Mr. President, the big long-distance companies have reaped a $3 \nbillion windfall in the last 18 months.\n  That is $3 billion!\n  That's how much long-distance carriers saved in reduced access \ncharges they paid to local telephone companies in the past year and a \nhalf. Because of the direct actions of the FCC, these companies have \nreceived more than enough money to pay for the entire e-rate program.\n  Over that same period, they have been asked to collect only $625 \nmillion for the e-rate.\n  But the long-distance carriers want to retain the $3 billion in \nsavings and insist consumers should pay for connections for schools and \nlibraries.\n  They would have us believe that the e-rate is driving up the cost of \nlong-distance phone service.\n  They say they intend to add a new line-item to their customers' bills \ntelling them just that.\n  The strategy is clear: Opponents know they can't attack the e-rate on \nits merits--because Americans care deeply about their children's \neducation.\n  So they call the e-rate a new tax--and hope people get so mad about \nanother tax that they demand an end to it.\n  The problem with their rhetoric is: it's not true.\n  The FCC is not requiring long-distance phone carriers to line-item \nthe costs of the e-rate program on to their customers. The carriers \nmade that decision themselves.\n  In addition, only a small part of the amount the carriers want to \ninclude in that line item actually goes to schools and libraries.\n  Most of it is used to provide phone service to rural America and \nother hard-to-reach customers. This is not a new responsibility. Phone \ncompanies have had that legal obligation for 60 years. It's called \n``universal service.''\n  In 1996, Congress expanded universal service to include schools and \nlibraries. We should keep our word--and keep the e-rate program.\n  That's why I have asked the Chairman of the FCC, Bill Kennard, to \nrequire strong truth-in-billing standards for long-distance companies. \nThose that choose to place line-item charges on their phone bills \nshould also tell their customers about savings they have reaped from \nreduced access charges. We should not allow these companies to mislead \ntheir customers by charging for certain costs without disclosing \nsavings they gain from other governmental actions.\n  This issue has sparked an important debate in Congress and the FCC \nabout the future of universal service. The FCC's top priority must now \nbe to secure the long-term viability of the high-cost fund as well as \nthe e-rate.\n  Learning how to use the basic tools of modern communications is not a \nluxury for our children. It's not a frill. It is a necessity.\n  The e-rate was created with strong bipartisan support. It deserves \nour continued bipartisan support. And I hope it will receive it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nbrief question.\n  Does the Senator remember the debate on the telecommunications \nlegislation where at least there was an understanding that the major \ncarriers were going to be favorably disposed, as a result of the \ncompetitiveness, to give those assurances to schools, to libraries, and \nto rural public health settings around the country?\n  Telemedicine is extremely important, I know, in many regions of the \ncountry. It provides extraordinary upgrading of quality health in terms \nof diagnosis and treatment and care for many of those who live in \nremote areas, whether it is in urban areas that might benefit from the \nmuseums and libraries or educational centers, or those kinds of \nfacilities that exist in rural America, or the public health \nfacilities, small clinics, that provide in many instances life support \nservices for people who live in those communities. It seems to me that \nmany of us were under the understanding that there was an agreement to \nprovide for those kinds of services.\n  I am just wondering whether the leader shared my impression that this \nwas something they had every reason to expect to go into effect, that \nthey had planned on it and made provisions for it, and in many \ninstances are very dependent upon these kinds of services.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts makes a very important point in his question. I believe \nthat not only people all over the country made that assumption but many \nof us in the Senate did as well, as we contemplated our vote on that \nbill. That was not an easy vote, as I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts remembers. That was a very, very difficult vote. I \nultimately decided that, on balance, this bill merited my support. I \ngive great credit to many Senators who put a lot more time in bringing \nthat product to the Senate than I did. But I voted for it in part \nbecause of the assumptions that we made about the opportunities and \nservices it would provide to people across this country, especially in \nimproving education and information in schools, libraries and rural \nhealth care centers.\n  So the Senator is right. We made some promises. We made some \ncommitments. We also made a deal that said as a result of all of this, \nthe long distance carriers would ensure proper collections for the \nschools and libraries program. They knew they were going to see some \nreduced costs. Indeed, according to figures I have been provided, $3 \nbillion in reduced access charges has already been achieved. Now all we \nhave done so far with regard to the e-rate is collect about $625 \nmillion, a fraction of that $3 billion. Some of these companies have \nnow indicated that they are fighting a small increase, the amount that, \nas the Senator says, has been assumed would be available for the \nschools and libraries across this country to improve the technological \nskills of every child in our schools.\n  I hope they will come forth with an explanation. If they are going to \nput in this new line item indicating the e-rate cost to people across \nthis country, why aren't they going to show equally the $3 billion in \nreduced costs they have already reaped? There has to be some fairness \nhere. There has to be truth in billing.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts has made a very important \npoint. We made a commitment when we passed that bill, and I hope it can \nbe realized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, it seems to me that \nwe have been talking about whether it has been in the area of \neducation, the area of health care, about partnerships. We have \nunderstood that we don't have all the resources given the budgetary \nconsiderations, but we are talking about the partnership that exists \nbetween the public and the private sector.\n  We also listened, I thought with very strong approval, to the \nexcellent presentation that the President made up in my own State of \nMassachusetts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  I see the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. If I could \nyield for\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nwhatever interventions he would like to make, I see an outstanding \nguest who honors us and who made a wonderful speech that many of us had \nthe chance to listen to a short time ago. It is a great pleasure to \nyield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to request 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has been considering the comprehensive \ntobacco legislation offered by Senator McCain for three weeks.\n  In fact, since the Senate began to debate the tobacco bill on May 18, \n69,000 children have begun to smoke, and 23,000 will die prematurely \nfrom a smoking-caused disease.\n  In the past day, however, we have made significant progress in moving \nforward in a bipartisan manner to resolve our differences and bring \nthis bill to final passage.\n  The Senate should once and for all reject the dilatory tactics of the \nopponents of this legislation, who care more about protecting the \nprofits of Big Tobacco than they do about protecting the health of the \nnation's children. They have used every strategy in the book to delay \nand obstruct this important legislation while thousands of children \nbegin a lifetime of nicotine addiction and smoking-caused illness. But \nthe pressure is starting to build in every corner of this nation, and \nthe American voters are demanding that the Senate take quick and \ndecisive action to bring this bill to a vote.\n  The stakes have rarely, if ever, been higher on any public health \nissue. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and \ndisability in the nation. Of the 48 million smokers in the United \nStates today, it is estimated that 20 million adults and 5 million \nchildren will die prematurely from a tobacco-induced disease.\n  In fact, tobacco products are responsible for a third of all cancers, \nand 90% of all lung cancers. 170,000 new cases of lung cancer are \nexpected in 1998. 90,000 men and 65,000 women are expected to die of \nthe disease in this year alone.\n  Tobacco use is also linked to a wide variety of other illnesses. \nSmoking by children and adolescents is associated with higher \ncholesterol levels which can significantly increase the risk of early \ndevelopment of cardiovascular diseases.\n  New research also indicates that tobacco use is a risk factor in \nalcoholism, depression, hearing loss, and vision loss among the \nelderly.\n  The use of smokeless tobacco products is associated with cancers of \nthe mouth, gum disease, and tooth loss.\n  The dangers of secondhand smoke are also becoming increasingly clear. \nIt is linked to low birthweight, respiratory distress syndrome, and \nsudden infant death syndrome. A recent report by the Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research says that secondhand smoke is responsible for \nas many as 60% of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young \nchildren.\n  It is also clear that smoking-related illnesses impose an enormous \nburden on the United States economy. According to the Department of \nTreasury, smoking will cost society $130 billion this year, of which \n$45 million is attributable to medical costs due to smoking-caused \ndiseases.\n  Smoking during pregnancy, which results in increased costs from \ncomplicated deliveries, medical care of low-weight babies, and \ndevelopmental disabilities, adds up to a $4 billion loss for the U.S. \neconomy.\n  The damage resulting from smoking-caused fires is $500 million a \nyear, which does not even account for the 2,000 lives lost in these \ntragic accidents.\n  $500 million is attributable to lost productivity, since smokers miss \n50% more work days than nonsmokers. In addition, smokers tend to die \nyounger and retire sooner, which costs society an astounding $80 \nbillion in lost output and wages.\n  Much higher priority is obviously needed for smoking cessation \nprograms and tobacco prevention initiatives, which are among the most \ncost-effective means available to reduce health care costs while, at \nthe same time, improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  The pending amendment by the Senator from Texas seeks to divert \napproximately $47 billion over the next ten years away from smoking \nprevention, away from smoking cessation, away from medical research, \nand away from reimbursing states.\n  When we add the combined impact of the pending Gramm amendment and \nthe Coverdell amendment which was approved yesterday, no funds would be \nleft for programs which are essential to reducing youth smoking and to \nhelping current smokers quit. In fact, the Gramm amendment alone would \nresult in roughly 4 million fewer Americans served by smoking cessation \nprograms, 20 million fewer people discouraged from smoking by \ncounteradvertising campaigns, and 48 million fewer children \nparticipating in school-based smoking prevention activities.\n\n  These numbers speak for themselves. Reasonable marriage penalty \nrelief makes sense. But the Gramm amendment goes too far. It would \ndestroy the underlying smoking prevention legislation.\n  All of the money raised by the cigarette price increase contained in \nthe legislation is currently earmarked for smoking related purposes: 22 \npercent is directed to smoking prevention and cessation, 22 percent is \nto be used for medical research, 16 percent is for transitional \nassistance for tobacco farmers, and 40 percent is to compensate states \nfor the cost of medical treatment of smoking related illnesses.\n  Which of these smoking related initiatives would the Senator from \nTexas eliminate? Does he propose to eliminate all compensation to the \nstates for their tobacco related health costs? After all, it was the \nstate lawsuits which provided the genesis for this legislation and \nwhich exposed the most dramatic evidence of industry wrongdoing. That \nwould not be fair. Even if every dollar intended for the states was \ntaken to fund the Gramm amendment, it would not be enough to cover the \ncost.\n  Does he propose to eliminate all transition assistance for tobacco \nfarmers and communities? It would not even cover one-third of the cost \nof the Gramm amendment.\n  All of the remaining dollars are directed to smoking prevention, to \nsmoking cessation, and to medical research. These initiatives are the \nheart of the legislation, yet both the pending Gramm amendment and the \nCoverdell amendment approved yesterday will deny needed resources to \nprevent teenagers from beginning to smoke. If we are serious about \nstopping children from smoking and saving lives from tobacco-induced \ndiseases, we have to make these investments.\n  These programs work. Let me give you a few examples:\n  Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nwoman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care \nfor low birth weight babies. In addition, smoking cessation programs \nhave an added benefit of reducing tobacco use among children. According \nto Michael Fiore, Director of Tobacco Research at the University of \nWisconsin Medical School, children who smoke have twice the risk of \nbecoming smokers than children of nonsmokers have. By helping parents \nto quit, the risk of children becoming smokers is reduced as well. The \neffect of the Gramm amendment would be to reduce funds for these \nprograms, and that makes no sense.\n  The Gramm amendment would deny funds needed to help states and \ncommunities conduct educational programs on the health dangers of \nsmoking. The tobacco industry spends $5 billion a year--$5 billion--on \nadvertising to encourage young people to smoke. Shouldn't we spend at \nleast one tenth of that amount to counteract the industry's lethal \nmessage?\n  Counteradvertising is a key element of an effective tobacco control \nstrategy. We know that children are easily swayed by the tobacco \nindustry's marketing campaigns, which promise popularity, excitement, \nand success for those who take up smoking. We can use \ncounteradvertising to reverse the damage by deglamorizing the use of \ntobacco among children.\n  Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that paid \ncounteradvertising can cut smoking rates. It helped reduce cigarette \nuse in Massachusetts by 17 percent between 1992 and 1996, or three \ntimes the national average. Smoking by junior high students dropped 8 \npercent, while the rest of the nation has seen an increase. In \nCalifornia, a counteradvertising campaign also reduced smoking rates by \n15 percent over the last three years.\n  The Gramm amendment also would take money from law enforcement \nefforts to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though \nyoung people currently spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products \nillegally. According to Professor Joseph DiFranza of the University of \nMassachusetts Medical Center, ``if $1 billion in illegal sales were \nspread out evenly over an estimated 1 million tobacco retailers \nnationwide, it would indicate that the average retailer breaks the law \nabout 500 times a year.''\n\n  The Gramm amendment will diminish funding for medical research on \ntobacco-related diseases, which kill 400,000 Americans each year and \nincapacitate millions more. Given the damage that smoking inflicts on \nthe nation's public health, it makes little sense to deny funds that \nshould be directed to finding a cure for cancer and other tobacco-\ninduced illnesses.\n  In essence, the Gramm amendment would destroy much of the public \nhealth benefit this legislation is designed to achieve. The goal of \neliminating the marriage penalty for low and moderate income families \nis a worthy one. It is shared on both sides of the aisle. However, it \nmust be accomplished in a way that does not imperil our primary goal--\npreventing youth smoking and helping smokers overcome their addiction.\n  The Daschle amendment, which offers relief from the marriage penalty \nwithout imperiling our smoking prevention efforts, will cost far less \nthan the Gramm amendment, and it does a much better job of targeting \ntax relief to those most in need.\n  The Daschle amendment will cost only $27 billion over the first ten \nyears. That is the most which can be accommodated without damaging our \nability to achieve the legislation's core anti-smoking purposes. The \ncost of the Gramm proposal mushrooms after the fifth year. Thus, over \nten years, the cost of the Daschle amendment is approximately $20 \nbillion less than the Gramm amendment. This is the difference between \npreserving a viable youth smoking reduction effort and destroying it. \nThat is the difference between helping millions of smokers quit and \nleaving them at the mercy of their addiction. That is the difference \nbetween advancing medical research that can cure tobacco induced \ndiseases and indefinitely delaying it.\n  Because it is carefully targeted, the Daschle amendment actually \nprovides more tax relief to those two income families earning $50,000 a \nyear or less who currently pay the marriage penalty. By contrast, more \nthan half the tax relief provided by the Gramm amendment would go to \nfamilies that are not subject to the marriage penalty. Senator \nDaschle's proposal will do more to achieve tax fairness at a much lower \ncost.\n  Once this issue is decided, there is little excuse for further delay. \nThe remaining amendments can be considered in a few days if we move \nconscientiously forward. There is no valid reason why the Senate cannot \nvote on final passage soon. If we do not, the American people will know \nwhy. A small group of willful defenders of Big Tobacco will have \nsucceeded in obstructing the work of the Senate on this vital issue of \npublic health. On an issue of this importance, our constituents will \nnot tolerate such obstruction. Now is the time for the Senate to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6007-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOLDING CONGRESS TO ITS TAX CUT PROMISE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few brief remarks \nabout tax cuts and the budget, and the promises that have so tightly \nentwined the two.\n  The House passed its budget resolution last Friday by a vote of 216 \nto 204. The House budget plan would cut $101 billion in government \nspending over the next 5 years. It would also repeal the marriage \npenalty tax, which has unjustly punished 21 million couples just for \ngetting married.\n  However, the House-passed budget plan failed to provide \nreconciliation instructions for achieving this tax relief, and failed \nto provide clear guidance on how to use any budget surpluses.\n  While the efforts by our colleagues in the House represent a move in \nthe right direction, Congress must do better by the taxpayers. It now \nfalls to the conference committee to ensure we keep our promise to \noffer meaningful tax relief to working Americans.\n  That promise must provide the framework for the budget resolution \nproduced by this Congress.\n  Thanks to the exceptionally healthy economy, our short-term fiscal \ncondition has greatly improved in the past few years, not because of \nwhat Congress did--in spite of what Congress did. But it is the \neconomy.\n  In fact, we will soon see a unified budget surplus for the first time \nsince 1969.\n  On May 26, President Clinton announced that this year's budget \nsurplus would be $39 billion.\n  His figure is significantly less than the $43-to-$63 billion surplus \nforecast by the CBO and contradicts the President's own Treasury \nreport, which revealed that through April, revenues were surging into \nthe Treasury even faster than CBO thought.\n  Treasury officials forecast that the surplus could be as large as \n$100 billion if the revenue flow follows last year's pattern. According \nto some estimates, the budget surplus could reach $1.34 trillion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  The question is, what do we do with the surplus? Basically, what \nWashington has done is overcharged our American workers and industry.\n  I would just like to show in the Washington Post, yesterday's \nedition, June 9, it says: Virginia Power Agrees To Rebates.\n  Why is this similar? I would like to read this. It says:\n\n       Virginia's largest power company agreed today to $920 \n     million in refunds and rate cuts for 2 million residential \n     and business customers who have been overcharged for \n     electricity, the biggest rate adjustment in State history \n     [and that is under a] deal with utility regulators.\n\n  If a company overcharges its consumers, the Government steps in and \nsays: You have to pay it back. You took a surplus. You have to pay it \nback to the customers. Also, you have to drop the rates so we do not \nhave surpluses in the future.\n  But what does Washington do when it has a surplus? It starts to make \nplans on how to spend it. There is nobody that tells Washington you \nhave to give it back, and they should.\n  Comparing these numbers with the $100 billion tax cut, when we talk \nabout\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\na projected budget surplus, there could be as much as $1.3 trillion or \nmore; or if we even look at just this surplus, it would be less than 10 \npercent of that projected surplus. I can assure you, there are plans \nalready being made around this Congress of what to do and how to spend \nthe other 90 percent.\n  Americans, I believe, should be outraged, and a growing number are. \nThey do not want Washington to grow even bigger--they want their money \nback.\n  Mr. President, regardless of all these different surplus estimates, \none thing is clear: it is not any action by the Federal Government that \nis producing this budget surplus. We must credit that turnaround to the \nworking men and women who are fueling the robust American economy. \nThese unexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans \nthrough taxes paid by corporations, individuals, and investors. This \nmoney belongs to the people. Washington should not stand first in line \nto take this money. It is only moral and fair to return it to them. \nWashington again, has no right to spend it on their behalf.\n  With total taxation at an all-time high, it is critical that Congress \ncut taxes for working Americans. Taxes consumed about 19 percent of GDP \nwhen President Clinton took office. It now stands at 21.5 percent, the \nhighest rate since World War II. This means every American, not just \nthe rich, are paying more in taxes today than they did just 5 years \nago.\n  As proof of just how heavy the tax burden has become, taxpayers did \nnot mark the arrival of Tax Freedom Day this year until May 10.\n  That is the day on which working folks stop punching the clock just \nto pay Uncle Sam and begin working for themselves, and that is a full \nweek later than when President Clinton took office. We all gave the \nGovernment another week of our time and money in the last 5 years to \npay those higher taxes. This year, the taxpayers had to work 129 days \nbefore they could count a single penny of their salary as their own. In \nfact, it marks the latest-ever arrival of Tax Freedom Day.\n  And that is not the whole picture, because if the cost of complying \nwith the tax system itself were included in the calculations, Tax \nFreedom Day would be pushed forward another 13 days.\n  As proof of just how far we have traveled--in the wrong direction--\nTax Freedom Day in 1925 arrived on February 6. This year it was May 10.\n  After 16 major tax increases over the past 30 years, the need for tax \nrelief has never been more pressing.\n  Do I need to remind my colleagues that Republicans gained control of \nCongress in 1994 and retained control in 1996 because we were the \nchampions of the taxpayers, the champions of the American workers?\n  Did not the taxpayers elect us with the expectation that the new \nCongress would seize every opportunity to lessen the tax burden on \nAmerica's families and shrink the size of Government?\n  They did not elect a new majority expecting that Congress would be a \ncollaborator in the President's tax-and-spend policies, that Congress \nwould build a bigger, more expensive Government at the first chance it \ngot and completely give up on its promise of significant tax relief.\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what Congress did. And if we do not \nslow it down now by providing some larger tax cuts, the Federal \nGovernment is going to explode in both size and cost. Again, that is \nnot what I believe working Americans are asking for.\n  Last year, after spending by the way, the $225 billion unexpected \nrevenue windfall and busting the 1993 spending caps, Congress cut a \ndeal with President Clinton and delivered tax cuts only one-third as \nlarge as what we had promised and worked for in 1994.\n  The tax relief amounted to less than one cent of every dollar the \nFederal Government took from the taxpayers.\n  With its measly $30 billion in tax cuts over five years, this year's \nSenate-passed budget resolution is no better.\n  It spends more taxpayer dollars while continuing the path of the \nflawed budget deal struck between the Congressional leadership and \nPresident Clinton last year.\n  Tax relief I believe is the right solution because it takes power out \nof the hands of Washington's big spenders and puts it back where it can \ndo the most good and that is with America's families and job providers.\n  When the much-bragged about Clinton tax increase of 1993 was passed \nby the Democrats, again, no Republican votes, but with this much-\nbragged about tax increase no one was out there asking working \nAmericans how they were going to survive with less money in their \npaychecks. They were evidently going to have to try to do more with \nless, or go without. Congress did not go out and ask working Americans, \nif we raise your taxes, how are you going to do with less money? \nAmericans were expected to do more with less or go without.\n  But now, when we talk of even taking one penny for every $10, \nCongress says ``We cannot go without.'' To borrow a phrase from Ohio \nCongressman Traficant, ``Beam me up, Scotty!''\n  I am proud that during this year's budget debate, five Senators, \nmyself included, reached agreement with the Senate leadership to \ninclude more tax relief in the budget for hardworking Americans.\n  We agreed to take the higher tax relief number in either the House or \nSenate-passed resolution. We also agreed there should be reconciliation \nlegislation to achieve those tax cuts.\n  Carrying out these principles will improve the FY 1999 budget \nresolution, and it will help to forge a compromise between those who \nwant massive tax relief and those who want massive spending.\n  This will eventually help us not only to balance our budget and keep \nit balanced, but to reduce the size of the government and also let the \nAmerican taxpayers keep a little more of their own money. With our \nimproved fiscal condition and a large budget surplus, it should not be \nhard to achieve these goals.\n  Then why is tax relief such a battle?\n  Mr. President, there is a special interest group to represent every \ndisgruntled, oppressed, and persecuted group of Americans to plead \ntheir case in the media and in the Halls of Congress.\n  But where is the special interest group that represents the \ntaxpayers? Where is the chorus of voices speaking up for the \ndiscontented multitude? Who will come to the Senate floor and plead the \ncase of the taxpayers?\n  I submit, Mr. President, that the American taxpayers are poorly \nrepresented by their Congress. Not only are the taxpayers heavily \nburdened, but their burden has been imposed by their own Government.\n  Congress takes the taxpayers' precious dollars and spends them \nlavishly, at times recklessly. Congress demands more and more with \nlittle consideration for the sacrifices of those it taxes. Congress \nnever seems to be satisfied.\n  So is it any wonder that when the opportunity arises to give \nsomething back to the taxpayers, Congress balks? The taxpayers fuel the \nfire of government spending, and Congress demands that the furnace \nremain fully stoked.\n  These are real people we are talking about, not faceless Social \nSecurity numbers. Yet Congress chooses not to see the faces of the \nfamilies it taxes.\n  By a single vote, this Congress can tell working Americans that it is \ngoing to take even more, and you can either work more--both spouses, \novertime, two jobs--or go without, without money for your children's \neducation, without health care insurance or child care, without a \nfamily vacation, without a night out.\n  ``But wait,'' you can just hear Congress say, ``maybe we can create a \nnew government program to help you. By the way, we will have to raise \nyour taxes a little to pay for it.''\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I who demanded that tax relief be an \nintegral part of the Senate budget must not and will not back off from \nour commitments.\n  We made those commitments in good faith, not only to each other, but \nmost importantly, to America's taxpayers. Senators Ashcroft, Brownback, \nInhofe, Smith, and myself are prepared to vote against any budget that \nfails to provide the full $101 or more billion in tax relief called for \nin the House budget resolution.\n  We have made our intentions known to the Senate leadership. It is \ntime that this Congress delivers on its promises to the taxpayers. We \nmust not forget the lessons we learned in the past.\n  In the 1950s, the Republican Party leadership deviated from the basic\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nprinciples that distinguish us from the Democrats by adopting a fiscal \npolicy of ``Republican austerity.''\n  This slowed the economy and therefore, the voters tossed out the \nRepublican Congress and declined to elect a Republican president. The \nAmerican people instead chose John F. Kennedy, a Democrat who promised \ntax cuts--and kept that promise.\n  President Ronald Reagan also promised tax relief, and he delivered by \nproposing tax cuts totaling $747 billion. That equals $1.6 trillion in \ntoday's dollars. These massive tax cuts propelled the economy forward. \nPresident Reagan stood with Republican principles, and today we are \nstill benefiting from his sound economic policy. This was done while \nthe Congress faced deficits, not surpluses that we are enjoying today.\n  In 1990, President Bush, unfortunately, reached a budget compromise \nwith the Democrats to spend more and tax more. As a result, the \nAmerican voters tossed him out for abandoning his promise not to raise \ntaxes.\n  Finally, history is a mirror. If we cannot keep our promise to the \nAmerican people, we will lose a Republican Congress, and more \nimportantly, a unique opportunity to create a sustainable economy, \nincrease real income, and improve the living standard for working \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by the \nreluctance of the Congress and the congressional leadership to provide \nsubstantial tax relief, despite projections of huge surpluses. Nothing \nI believe, can justify this.\n  This Senator intends to stand firm on his promise to work for lower \ntaxes that allow the working men and women of Minnesota and the 49 \nother states to keep more of their own money. I urge our leadership to \nfollow.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at 2 o'clock, we should have distributed \nour amendment to both sides of the aisle. We will have given everybody \nan opportunity to look at it. We are in the final stages of getting the \namendment done by legislative counsel. We went over it this morning \nwith Senator McCAIN's staff.\n  I think probably the best part of valor is to get it over here in a \nfew minutes, distribute it widely, get everybody to look at it, and \nthen be ready to begin at 2 o'clock. At that time, it will be my \nobjective to offer the amendment. There is an open spot on the tree. I \nwill offer the amendment. Hopefully, we will have support from both \nsides, it will be adopted, and we will take a major step toward \nrepealing the marriage penalty and giving tax equity to the self-\nemployed on health insurance.\n  This is a good amendment.

I am agreeable to a time agreement on this amendment, yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I think it \nis an important amendment as well. I hope we can negotiate time and \nmove forward on this amendment and others throughout the remainder of \nthe day. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you. I want to talk about the \ntobacco bill in the context of where we started and where we are now.\n  I was on the Commerce Committee, and although I thought the bill had \nflaws in the Commerce Committee, nevertheless there was a balance to \nthe bill. Our purpose in the tobacco bill is to try to keep teenagers \nfrom experimenting and getting hooked on cigarettes before they have \nthe full judgment to understand that nicotine is addictive.\n  That has been everyone's stated purpose. The President said that. \nEvery Member who makes a speech on the floor says that. Everyone \nagrees. What we came out of the Commerce Committee with was a bill that \nI felt had a good chance of reaching the goal of severely limiting the \namount of teen smoking in this country.\n  Here is what the bill did, in a broad generalization. It had an \nagreement from the tobacco companies that they would not advertise. \nThat is a key component to curbing youth smoking, not making it seem \nattractive to smoke. If you are not advertising with the Marlboro Man, \nit may not be nearly as appealing to smoke. So the tobacco companies \nvoluntarily agree that they are not going to advertise provided a huge \npart of the balance of this bill.\n  The second part, and what the tobacco companies needed, I suppose, or \nasked for in order to give up a major right that we could not take away \nfrom them--their constitutional right under the first amendment to \nadvertise. Congress could not pass a law saying they could not \nadvertise. We had to have something to which they would agree. What \nthey wanted was some limitation on the liability in any 1 year.\n  So in the bill that came out of committee, there was a limitation of \nabout $8 billion. And if someone sued, and it was above that limit, \ntheir claim would not be thrown out but it would roll over until next \nyear. I thought that was a fair balance because it would allow us to go \nfor the target of stopping teenagers from starting to smoke because of \nadvertising, which we now know has been targeted toward them, in return \nfor having what I think is a huge liability limit. Nobody at this point \nhas even come close in this country to $3 or $5 billion in any year \nfrom a lawsuit on liability. So I thought we had a balance.\n  What has happened on the floor is, I think--a combination of people \nwho had different purposes in addition to stopping teen smoking, \nremoved all the liability limits, therefore, you lose the tobacco \ncompanies agreeing to give up their constitutional right to advertise. \nI think we lost track of the major target.\n  In the meantime it was also decided that we would tax the people who \nlegally smoke, at least $1.10 a pack, so that the price of a pack of \ncigarettes would go toward $5 a pack. So now you have what I think is a \nterrible principle; and that is, that you are taxing one sector of the \npopulation to have new programs that may or may not be effective in \ncurbing teen smoking.\n  So now we have an amendment that is going to be offered in the next \nhour that would say, ``Well, we've got this huge tax increase and I \ndon't like where the spending is going, so let us give it back in tax \ncuts to somebody else.'' I do not like that principle. I do not want to \ntax a working person who is making $20,000 a year in order to give \nmoney back to a working family making under $50,000. I do want to give \nmoney back to the working family that is making under $50,000, but I \nwant to do it in the context of our budget, like we do every other tax \ncut or every other tax increase, for that matter.\n  This bill violates both principles that we would tax or give tax cuts \nwithin a budget and that we would tax one person to give it to someone \nelse.\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\n  I am the sponsor of the bill that would eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty. It is my bill. Senator Faircloth and I are cosponsoring this \nbill together because we believe the highest priority for tax cuts in \nthis country should be eliminating the marriage tax penalty.\n  So given the choice that I am going to have before me of not wanting \nto tax one person in order to give it to someone else, but my choice \nbeing we are going to have the tax increase, what do we do with it? Go \nspend money on new Government programs or give it back to people who \nmake under $50,000, I am going to choose the latter. I am going to \nchoose to try to start eliminating the marriage tax penalty by giving a \nhigher level of exemption before you have to start paying taxes.\n  So I am going to make the tough choice in favor of giving money back \nto the people who work for it. But I do not like this bill. And I hope \nand I urge my colleagues not to continue to try to put this bill in \nshape but instead to go back and start all over. I think we can pass a \nresponsible bill in this Congress that would severely limit the number \nof teenagers who start smoking. That is a worthy goal.\n\n  I also think in this Congress that we should pass the elimination of \nthe marriage tax penalty because it hits people who make $30,000, \n$40,000, $50,000, couples who get married, who want to make that \ndownpayment on their first home; and when they do, they are hit with a \n$1,000 or $2,000 tax increase just because they got married.\n  So I want to do both of these things. I do not like the choices that \nwe are looking at in the bill before us. And I do not like the choices \nbeing given to us by the amendment. But as the lesser of two evils, I \nam certainly going to support a tax cut when we already have a tax \nincrease on the floor. But what I would suggest is that we scrap the \nwhole thing and try to do this right.\n  Doing it right means two things: It means, first of all, eliminating \nthe marriage tax penalty in the budget; and, secondly, coming back with \na balanced bill that will have the purpose of stopping or severely \ncurtailing teen smoking, but not on the back of a person who is working \nfor a living, not making much money, and is smoking, unfortunately, but \nnevertheless by his or her own choice. That is a choice that a person \nmakes. I do not think that we should be taxing someone at this level--\nit is a regressive tax--when we are not sure that the purpose is going \nto be achieved.\n  So I hope my colleagues will look at this issue, step back--first of \nall, pass Senator Gramm's amendment because at least we can take the \nfirst step towards eliminating the marriage tax penalty--then I hope we \nwill bring this bill down and start from scratch and try to put forward \na bill that will stop teen smoking or at least put a big dent in it. I \nthink we can do that with the balance that we had in the original bill \nbefore it got worked over by the U.S. Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am puzzled. In the last week or so, we \nhave seen U.S. Customs' agents wrap up one of the most successful \nundercover operations in history. This effort, Operation Casablanca, \nhas nailed a bunch of international bankers, mostly in Mexico, who have \nbeen laundering drug money. These white collar drug thugs have violated \nUnited States law, Mexican law, and international law. They have \nviolated their trust. They have abetted one of the nastiest businesses \non the planet. And they have conspired to do all of this to make an \nillegal dollar. Drug traffickers are bad enough. But their financial \nadvisers and bankers are truly despicable. Thus, the Customs' \nundercover operation that exposed some of these low lifes is to be \ncelebrated. My hat is off to the agents and informants that risked \ntheir lives to help defend our institutions and bring these pinstripe \nbandits to justice.\n  But I am still puzzled. What has me scratching my head is the \nreaction of the Mexican Government to this event. Instead of joining \nhands in congratulating efforts to protect the integrity of our \ninternational banking institutions and our shared concern to stop drug \ntrafficking, what have they done. The Foreign Minister of Mexico has \ncalled the law enforcement people the criminals. She has raised the \nbanner of so-called national sovereignty to provide cover to criminal \nactivities of Mexican nationals. Mexico has called for the extradition \nof the law enforcement people in this operation, claiming they have \nviolated Mexican law. What is wrong with this picture? Let me count the \nways.\n  First, money laundering is the illegal act we are talking about. It \nis, by its nature, an activity without borders. It is also illegal in \nevery legitimate country on the planet.\n  Second, the bankers in Mexico who engaged in laundering drug money, \ndid so with knowledge of the illegality of their acts. They did so in a \nmanner aimed at avoiding detection. They did so in defiance of bank \nregulations and Mexican law.\n  Third, these bankers engaged knowingly in using their expertise to \nviolate United States law. And they provided the facilities of their \nbanks to move money around the globe in violation of international law.\n  Fourth, we know they did this because it's on tape. We know they did \nit knowingly because the indictments spell it out.\n  Fifth, they used their expertise to try to improve the ease with \nwhich the money was laundered. They provided advice on how to avoid \nMexican law.\n  They acted with criminal intent and used the interconnectivity of the \nmodern banking system to hide their acts. They committed these acts in \nthis country, in Mexico, and elsewhere, either in person or by using \ncomputers.\n  Now, the Foreign Secretary in Mexico would have it that in exposing \nthese activities and in tracking the process, United States agents \nviolated Mexican sovereignty and law. It would seem, in her view, that \nthis means the undercover operatives committed criminal acts by \nengaging in money laundering. But in this country and most others, a \ncriminal act involves intent. There is no criminal intent involved here \nby U.S. law enforcement. Just the reverse. Thus, law is not offended.\n  As to sovereignty, well, if we insist on this point, whose \nsovereignty is violated? Sovereignty is not meant to be a shield for \ncriminality. It would be a fine world if that were the principle. It is \nnot. I can think of few more useful tools for drug traffickers, money \nlaunderers, and thugs of every description than to find a safe haven in \nsome country willing to use its sovereignty to harbor international \ncriminality. What has happened here, is that bankers have violated the \nlaws of this country by using the international banking system to \nfreely commit crimes. They have done this in person in this country and \nthey have done it electronically across borders. These are the \ncriminals, not the law enforcement people who have corralled this gang \nof crooks.\n  But according to the Foreign Secretary of Mexico, it is the law \nenforcement folks who are to be labeled villains. In some of the most \nintemperate rhetoric I have seen from a senior government official, the \nForeign Secretary not only castigates the good guys, but is calling for \ntheir extradition. I find this situation outrageous. I am equally \nconcerned about the response from our own State Department. I have a \nletter here that our Secretary of State has sent to the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. I will submit this for the Record. Instead of \ncongratulating the law enforcement effort and joining hands with \nSecretary Rubin, Secretary Albright complains about inadequate \nconsultation with Mexico. What is wrong with this picture?\n  Given the important steps Mexico and the United States have taken to\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nimprove bilateral cooperation and to go after the real thugs in the \nstory, I hope we can get past this case quickly. I hope the Foreign \nSecretary of Mexico and Secretary of State of the United States wake up \nand smell the coffee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nAlbright to Secretary Rubin be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert Rubin,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n       Dear Mr. Bob: I know that both you and Attorney General \n     Reno are aware of the negative reaction in Mexico to the \n     announcement of Operation Casablanca and have had contact \n     with Mexican officials about this. I spoke May 21 with \n     Foreign Secretary Rosario Green who expressed her \n     government's deep resentment for not having been informed of \n     the operation prior to the public announcement. Other Mexican \n     officials have voiced concern that the activities undertaken \n     by U.S. agents in Mexico may have been illegal under Mexican \n     law or contrary to understandings between the United States \n     and Mexico.\n       Mexico's reaction is a product of many factors, not least \n     of which is great sensitivity within the Zedillo government \n     to preexisting charges from the opposition that it is \n     attempting to bail out a corrupt banking system. However, I \n     am concerned about the negative tone this development \n     introduces into the relationship and that Mexican cooperation \n     on several fronts, particularly counternarcotics, may be \n     affected.\n       We might have achieved more favorable results if we had \n     brought Attorney General Madrazo and a few others into our \n     confidence a few days before the public announcement. In this \n     regard, I believe State should have been consulted. We would \n     have been able to offer some advice that could have \n     ameliorated the negative reaction.\n       I would appreciate being kept personally informed of \n     developing investigations in Mexico and other foreign \n     countries that could have a significant foreign policy \n     fallout. I do not wish to interfere with your law enforcement \n     work, but I do believe we need to do a better job of \n     coordination.\n       It is essential that in the coming days you find ways in \n     your public statements and private contacts with Mexican \n     officials to indicate that we are actively working to avoid \n     similar difficulties in the future. I hope to discuss this \n     with you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Madeleine K. Albright.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues that it took \nso long to get this amendment together. We were trying to do several \nthings, to bring together several provisions of different Members into \none amendment. We also were trying to deal with a concern that the \nauthors of the bill have\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\nabout their trust fund and how much money we will take out of the trust \nfund in each ensuing year as a result of the amendment. We are still \nlooking at some of those provisions.\n  The net result is that we have the amendment together. What I would \nlike to do in offering it is to outline the problem with the existing \nbill in terms of the impoverishment of blue-collar workers who dominate \nthe ranks of smokers in the country.\n  I would like to talk about the need to rebate some of the tax money \nwe are getting, in an effort to raise the price of cigarettes, to the \nvery people who are going to be impoverished by this confiscatory tax. \nI would like to talk about why the marriage penalty is a good choice \nfor that tax rebate. I would like to then talk about how this marriage \npenalty repeal works and how the numbers work out in terms of the \nbudget. And that will constitute the relevant information in offering \nthe amendment.\n  First of all, the problem. We have heard now for weeks and weeks a \nrunning debate about tobacco companies and their conspiracy to induce \npeople to smoke. With just cause, those tobacco companies have been \ndenounced on the floor of the Senate over and over again. However, \npeople have become so fixed on these tobacco companies, they have \ntotally lost sight of the fact that a giant bait and switch has \noccurred. In reality tobacco companies are not paying taxes under this \nbill, consumers are paying taxes under this bill. In fact, the \nprovisions of this bill make it illegal for a tobacco company to refuse \nto pass the price through to the consumer. So they are held harmless in \nterms of the tax, but blue-collar Americans who smoke are devastated \neconomically by this tax.\n  So the problem with the bill is that, in the name of raising the \nprice of cigarettes to discourage smoking, we are, if this bill goes \nunamended, imposing one of the most regressive taxes in American \nhistory. And ``regressive tax'' means that poor people pay an \nincreasing share of the tax burden.\n  Why do I say that? Well, I say it basically because in America \nsmoking is primarily a blue-collar phenomenon. Obviously, people at all \nincome levels smoke, but if you look at who will pay this tax, it \nreally brings home the fact that in our country most of the people who \nsmoke are moderate-income, blue-collar workers.\n  Of all of the tax collection that will occur under this bill, in an \neffort to drive up the price of cigarettes, 34 percent of those taxes \nwill be paid by Americans who make less than $15,000; 47.1 percent of \nthese taxes will be paid not by tobacco companies but by Americans who \nmake $22,000 a year or less; 59.1 percent of these taxes will be paid \nfor by Americans in families with incomes of $30,000 a year or less.\n  So whether it is the intent of the underlying tobacco bill or not, \nthe net result is that this bill imposes no taxes on tobacco companies \nwhatsoever. It shields tobacco companies by requiring that they pass \nthe tax through to their consumers, and it squarely hits moderate-\nincome, blue-collar workers right in the wallet and in the pocketbook.\n  Those who favor this bill have said over and over again that their \nobjective in this bill is, not to raise money so they can spend it, but \ntheir objective in the bill is to drive up the price of cigarettes to \ndiscourage smoking. So recognizing the problem, that while the \nproponents of the bill vilify the tobacco companies, in reality they \nare taxing blue-collar workers. While they say they are not imposing \nthe tax to get money to spend, in truth they are spending all the \nmoney. I have offered this amendment with Senator Domenici, Senator \nRoth, and others, to achieve what the bill proponents claim they want \nto do. My amendment gives a part of the money that is collected in this \ntax back to the very people who are going to bear the burden of this \ntax.\n  Let me give some examples. In my State of Texas, we have 3.1 million \nTexans who smoke. If this bill drives the price of a pack of cigarettes \nup by $2.78, which is the general estimate that is given, a Texan who \nsmokes one pack of cigarettes a day would pay $1,015 in new Federal \ntaxes and would see their Federal tax burden grow by over 50 percent as \na result of this tobacco tax.\n  Under this bill if a moderate-income family made up of two blue-\ncollar workers, one might be a local delivery person and one might be a \nwaitress, each smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and are earning less \nthan $30,000 a year, they are going to pay $2,000 in additional Federal \ntaxes.\n  So Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, other Senators and I, have offered \nan amendment that says: Let us target people who make $50,000 or less \nbecause they are going to pay some 75 to 80 percent of these taxes, and \nlet us take a portion of the taxes, roughly a third, and give that \nmoney back to the people who will be paying the taxes in the form of \nrepealing the so-called marriage penalty.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree with the Senator that some people who pay the \nmarriage penalty will also buy cigarettes, but I am sure the Senator \nhas to acknowledge, and would acknowledge, would he not, that some \npeople who will buy cigarettes, who are called sort of the ``victims'' \nhere, will not get a benefit by this necessarily and some people who do \nnot smoke will get a benefit by this? Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me reclaim my time to say it is true that moderate-\nincome Americans who do not smoke will benefit from this tax cut, if \nthey are married. It is true that high-income people who smoke will \nbear a burden from the bill, and they will not get a benefit from this \ntax cut. But it is also true that Americans who pay 80 percent of the \ntax that will be imposed in the name of discouraging smoking, they are \nin families who earn less than $50,000 a year, and they will get a \nbenefit from this bill. There is no way we can target it just to \nsmokers, nor does anybody want to.\n  The point that we are making is, if we are trying to raise the price \nof cigarettes to discourage consumption, that is one thing. But many of \nthe critics of the bill have viewed this as a tax and spend bill, and \nwith great justification, in my opinion. Therefore if we are raising \nthe price of cigarettes to fund tens of billions of dollars of new \nGovernment spending, then why not give part of it back? There is no \nperfect tool in giving it back. The best we have found is to repeal the \nmarriage penalty and to make health insurance tax deductible for the \nself-employed.\n  Let me explain how the marriage penalty works and how our amendment \nwill work.\n  Many Americans are surprised when they learn that we have roughly 31 \nmillion families in this country who pay higher taxes because they are \nmarried than they would have paid had they remained single. In fact, \nthe average tax burden that is incurred by these couples is about \n$1,400 a year higher. They pay the Federal Government $1,400 a year for \nthe privilege of being married rather than continuing to file as single \nindividuals. In fact, during a Finance Committee hearing, we actually \nhad the startling testimony from a young woman who said she was living \nwith her boyfriend and would like to get married but, because of the \nburden of the marriage penalty, they had delayed that decision.\n  I think we all understand that the family is the most powerful \ninstitution for progress and happiness in history. Strong families, I \nthink we would all agree on a bipartisan basis, represent the solution \nto everything from drugs and gangs and violence, and for the \nperpetuation of the basic values that we all treasure as Americans. And \nso I think anyone would want to get rid of a provision of tax law that \ndiscourages people from getting married.\n  Our amendment does not try to get into a position of discriminating \nfor or against couples based on the decisions they make about whether \nboth parents or just one of them work outside the home. Some people \nhave criticized our amendment, and perhaps will do it today, by saying \nthat this marriage penalty provision will benefit families where only \none of the couple works outside the home. But our objective is to have \na provision that corrects the marriage penalty but doesn't do so in \nsuch a way as to discriminate against stay-home parents. A vast \nmajority of the time, that is stay-home moms. We don't believe the Tax \nCode should treat people differently based on whether they decide to \nstay home and raise\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\ntheir children or whether they decide to work in the marketplace.\n  My mama worked my whole life because she had to. My wife has chosen \nto work the whole life of our children because she wanted to. But we \nbelieve, those of us who are authors of this amendment, that it is not \nthe business of the Government to try to dictate through the Tax Code \nthat very important personal family decision. We want to be sure that \nfor those who do choose to give up the income by having one parent stay \nat home and raise the children, that we don't see them discriminated \nagainst in the Tax Code.\n  So here is how our provision works: What our provision will do is \ngive every couple who makes less than $50,000 a year relief from the \nmarriage penalty. We chose $50,000 a year because we really are \nrebating part of the revenue from the cigarette tax back to those \npeople who pay 80 percent of the taxes. It is my goal, in the tax cut \nthat I believe will flow from the budget, to repeal the marriage \npenalty for every American, no matter what their income. But we have \ntargeted $50,000 and below here because that is where the smokers in \nAmerica are, in the middle- and moderate-income range. We are using \nthis to rebate part of the money collected in this bill due to the \nincrease in the price of cigarettes to them.\n  What we will do for every married couple is, compared to the tax \nreturn they filed last year, they will get a $3,300 deduction above the \nline, before they calculate what their income is for taxation purposes. \nThis will repeal the marriage penalty. In addition, it will save the \naverage family about $1,400 a year in taxes. For low-income people who \nare still working to try to get ahead and trying to become self-\nsufficient, we will let them deduct this $3,300 from their income \nbefore they calculate their eligibility for the earned-income tax \ncredit. As Senator Domenici knows, some of the heaviest tax penalty \nburden falls on moderate-income people who are getting an earned-income \ntax credit if they stay single, but if they get married, which is part \nof the solution to their problem in terms of helping to put together a \nstrong family, they end up losing their earned-income tax credit. So \nunder our amendment we will give a substantial tax cut to the very \nAmericans who are bearing the burden of this increased price of \ncigarettes.\n  Finally, we deal with a problem related to the self-employed by \nimmediately making health insurance deductible for the self-employed. \nIf I work for General Motors and they buy my health insurance, it is \nfully tax deductible. But if I quit working for General Motors and go \ninto business for myself, not only do I have to pay both sides of my \npayroll tax, but my insurance is not tax deductible and I have to pay \nit with after tax money. We have started the process of phasing this \nout over an extended period of time. What this bill will do is it will \nimmediately give full tax equity to those Americans who are self-\nemployed.\n  So the net result of our amendment will be to give back $16 billion \nin the first 4 years, to give back $30 billion over the ensuing 5 \nyears, to the very people who pay 80 percent of the cigarette tax under \nthis bill. We will give about a $1,400 tax break to working couples in \nthat income category by repealing the marriage penalty, and we will \nmake health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed.\n  We have crafted the bill carefully so that we take about a third of \nthe revenues that flow from the tax that is collected on cigarettes. \nQuite frankly, in the final bill I believe this number should be \nbigger. This is a number we picked when we introduced the amendment. We \nhave tried to structure it to stay with that through the end of the \nbudget cycle, which will terminate in 2007, and we tried to stay \nfaithful to that agreement in the drafting of the amendment.\n\n  I think this is an important amendment. I believe that it does \nprovide some degree of tax relief for the people who are going to pay \nthis confiscatory tobacco tax. I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will support this amendment. I do believe that we have gone \nto great lengths to try to make the amendment fair. We have listened to \nthe concerns that have been raised by our colleagues who are in support \nof this bill. I think this is a good amendment. I commend it to my \ncolleagues.\n  It does not correct the many wrongs in the bill that is before the \nSenate. It does not eliminate the marriage penalty for all Americans. \nIt is a major step in that direction. This is not the end of the \nmarriage penalty debate. This is the beginning of it.\n  By the end of this year we will have repealed the marriage penalty \nfor every American family. This will allow us to do it immediately in \nthis bill for those in moderate-income areas who pay the bulk of the \ncigarette tax. We will do it for the rest of Americans in the budget, \nin my opinion. I commend this amendment to my colleagues.\n  I want to thank Senator Domenici for his leadership in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't intend this afternoon to repeat \nmuch of the explanation which was made by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Texas but I just will emphasize it as I see it.\n  First of all, it is very important to me that when we articulate an \nAmerican policy and say we are for this or we are for that, that \nsooner, rather than later, we look at what our laws are and see if we \ncan make them match the policy that we would like for our country.\n  No. 1, everybody on the Senate floor, it seems to me, from time to \ntime has been concerned about families in America. Obviously, the \nmarriage tax penalty works against families, because if a married \ncouple with two or three children are penalized to the extent of $1,400 \na year in taxes that they pay--just because they are married, which \nthey would not pay if they had their exact same earnings and filed \nseparately or were not married--that is clearly an American policy out \nof step with a profamily position of the United States and certainly of \nthis Senator and most Senators I associate with in the U.S. Senate.\n  Secondly, maybe it isn't articulated as precisely as the previous one \ntenet of philosophy, but I say we, as a nation, ought to espouse \nmarriage and we ought to look with favor upon the relationship that is \ncalled marriage historically and traditionally.\n  As my friend from Texas says, of all the institutions around, it \nseems to be that marriage is the one that has endured. It also seems to \nbe one that when marriage does not endure or work properly it causes a \nlot of other problems within a family and throughout society. So to put \nan extra tax on that institution is wrong.\n  In the United States of America, 24 million married couples have \nendured and paid through the nose because of this marriage penalty.\n  I don't think they really thought when they said, ``I do,'' that they \nwere also saying, ``and we shall pay.'' I don't believe that is what \nthey thought they were doing when they took their marriage vows.\n  The average penalty is about $1,400. I think everybody knows what an \naverage means. Plenty of couples are paying much more. Obviously, there \nare plenty paying somewhat less.\n  In my State of New Mexico, 203,00 New Mexican families will be helped \nby this change. We are a State with just a little bit over 1,600,000 \npeople. That is a pretty significant benefit we are passing on to \npeople who are married and raising families, and both spouses are \nworking.\n  By way of an aside, the second portion of our bill has to do with \nbusinesses that are self-employed people. Let me just give you that \nnumber. In New Mexico, 222,000 businesses are going to find that health \ninsurance is going to be available to them now and be more affordable \nbecause under this provision they are going to be able to deduct the \nentire health cost, as do corporations and as do many others that are \nnot self-employed.\n  So if anybody is interested in how we got into this mess with the \nmarriage penalty, I will put in some facts about it later.\n  Obviously, this has come about with each major change we have made in \nthe Tax Code, either to phase something out or to phase something in. \nThere are about 63 provisions in the code, where couples are penalized \nfor being married. The standard deduction and the progressive tax \nbrackets are two of the major contributors to the marriage\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\npenalty. So many of these provisions in the code vary, as I indicated, \nwith marital status. The provision that primarily is responsible for \nthe marriage penalty, the standard deduction for married filing \njointly, is not two times the standard deduction for filing if you are \nsingle. That is the major reason that we have a problem.\n  Having said that, I want to relate this proposal to the bill that is \nbefore us. Every time we discuss a budget of the United States, or the \neconomy of the United States, somebody talks about--and quite \nproperly--what the level of taxation on the American people is. It is \nrelevant to America's future, in my opinion and in the opinion of most \neconomists looking at our country, that our tax on the American people, \nthe total tax, be at the lowest possible level. Now, this bill before \nus, whatever its other interests are, is a very large tax imposition on \nthe American people. Although it is not paid by everybody, you add it \nto the myriad of other taxes, and then you find out America is paying a \nhigher total tax level than it was before this bill was passed.\n  So, to me, it is very simple. If this is a tax bill--and clearly \nthere are many people who want to spend every penny of it on some kind \nof program. In spite of a budget that said we would not spend any more, \nthere are scores of programs on which people would like to spend money. \nIt seems to me that the forgotten people would be the taxpayers who \nwould get no benefit unless we reduce taxes and charge the reduction to \nthe tax income coming under this bill.\n  I think it is very logical and very reasonable--$16 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, $30 billion in the second 5 years, coming from the taxes \nraised in this bill from cigarettes. It will ultimately come from \nconsumers. People think the tobacco companies are paying, but actually \nit will be added to the price of cigarettes and consumers will pay it.\n  We are saying give $16 billion back to the taxpayers and $30 billion \nback in the form of these two tax reductions over ten years. That is a \nthird of the tax take in the first 5 years and about 37 or 38 percent \nin the second 5 years. Under the bill, about 40 percent of the program \ngoes to the States. I am not sure I favor that much going to the \nStates, but we are not amending that provision here. That is to be \nconsidered at another time if the Senate wants to consider it. But so \nlong as the states are expected to get 40 percent of the overall trust \nfund, Senator Gramm and I have agreed we won't offer any more tax cuts. \nBut if indeed that 40 percent is reduced and we attempt to take some of \nthat money back to the Federal Government and spend it, then obviously \nwe reserve the right to offer some additional tax rebates or reductions \nor reforms at that time.\n\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will adopt this amendment. There may be \nother tax measures, but I think essentially we are going to be \nseparating Senators into two groups--Group One: Those Senators who want \nto spend all the money and group two who are Senators who want to give \nsome of it back to the people. That is the issue. Do you want to give \nsome of this back to the people, or do you want to spend it all for one \nprogram or regime or another that costs money, or a series of programs \nby which we give money back to the States for them to spend it?\n  I think the American people are going to judge us very, very \nprecisely on this and I don't think the judgment is going to be a \ndifficult one. They are pretty astute. When we have just crowed about a \nbalanced budget with caps on expenditures and we come and say now we \nfound a new source of revenue, all those ideas about keeping Government \nunder control can go out the window. We will spend all of this on new \nprograms. I think they will understand very easily. They will focus \nquickly that those who vote no on this amendment will be saying they \nwant to spend all the money; those who vote yes on this amendment are \nsaying we ought to give some of it back to the American taxpayer--in \nthis case, to that huge number of Americans who are married, with both \ncouples working, wherein they are being penalized by the adverse effect \nof our tax laws, and that they must pay a penalty for being married and \nfor earning a living and filing jointly.\n  I am rather confident this is the right approach. Why do we stop at \n$50,000 worth of wage earnings? I will agree that is just an arbitrary \nnumber. But we can't fix everything in one bill. If there is a tax bill \nthis year--and there probably will be one--I would think high on the \nlist would be to repair the marital tax problem so the higher brackets \nof earners are entitled to receive that benefit also. I thank Senator \nGramm for his untiring efforts on behalf of this. It is a privilege to \nwork with him. I believe we will have a victory today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin with some comments about where \nwe find ourselves, and then I will come back a little bit later and go \ninto greater detail about it.\n  At the outset of the presentation of the amendment as originally \nfiled by the Senator from Texas to repeal the marriage penalty, I and \nSenator McCain and others said at that time that we were prepared, \nbecause we are supportive in principle of the notion of reducing the \nmarriage penalty--we said we are prepared to embrace in this bill a \ncomponent of marriage penalty reduction, provided that it doesn't strip \naway so much money that we are unable to accomplish the other purposes \nof the bill. And we have gone through a long week now--maybe a little \nbit more than a week--and the Senate has essentially been in a \nstalemate position as we have negotiated around the concept of how much \nis appropriate and how do you arrive at how much is appropriate.\n  During the course of that week, the Gramm amendment as originally \nfiled has undergone several changes. We are very pleased with that. I \nthink there has been a bona fide effort here to try to arrive at some \nkind of sensible approach to the marriage penalty issue. The original \nGramm amendment presented us with an estimated cost of $113 billion \nover 10 years. That would have represented over that 10-year period 80 \npercent of the costs of all of the tobacco revenues. In other words, \nall of the tobacco revenues that would have come in, 80 percent of them \nunder Gramm I, as we should call it, would have gone out to the \nmarriage penalty rebate as he had designed it at that time.\n  Last week, at the end of the week, Senator Gramm revised his proposal \nto what we would call Gramm II. Gramm II made mostly some sort of \ncosmetic changes that took the full measure of the cost, the $113 \nbillion I have just described, the 80 percent of the revenues, and \nrather than have them all show up within the first 10 years, it took \nthose revenues and pushed a significant portion of them outside of the \n10-year budget window. In other words, we look at the budget of the \ncountry in these 5-year periods, and we are looking at a 10-year budget \nwindow within which we have an ability to measure what we are doing. \nBeyond that, it becomes relatively more speculative.\n  Under Gramm II, the Senator from Texas would have still spent nearly \n80 percent of the tobacco revenues in years 11 through 25 of the bill. \nSo there would have been a reduction for the years 1 through 10 within \nthe budget process, and outside of that, knowing that we are looking at \na 25-year revenue stream as we measure the tobacco bill, that would \nhave then taken the better part of the 80 percent. So you would have \ntaken funds that were intended for public health, research, farmers, \nand the States, and that would have been significantly reduced. That \nclearly was also unacceptable. So we stayed locked in sort of a status \nof essentially negotiating with not a lot happening.\n  We then responded. We responded with an alternative that would have \nreduced the marriage penalty for most families. But it would have been \ndone at a fraction of the cost of both Gramm I and Gramm II, which \nbrings us now to Gramm III. Gramm III is what we were presented with \njust a few moments ago as we began this debate when the Senator filed \nthis particular amendment. Under Gramm III, there is now an expenditure \nof approximately one-third of the funds under the tobacco funding. So \nit has been significantly reduced in the road that we have traveled as \nto tobacco funding.\n  In other words, from the revenues raised, if and when this bill \npasses, no\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\nmore than a third of that can be taken for the purposes of reducing the \nmarriage penalty. But that is only half the story, because what the \nSenator from Texas does is maintain a level of benefits. In other \nwords, he has geared his marriage penalty reduction in a way that there \nare still significant resources necessary in order to fund the benefits \nthat he wishes to give, and he chooses not to take them all as part of \nour negotiating process from the tobacco bill.\n  But the question then has to be asked, Where does the Senator from \nTexas take them from? I respectfully submit that as a result of the \nfact that he has left in the breadth of generosity of benefits that he \nseeks to return in the form of the marriage penalty, while not taking \nit from the tobacco bill, he nevertheless seeks to fund it and take it \nfrom the other available funds of the Federal Government. That means \nthat he will have to tap a new source of revenue; i.e, the general \nbudget surplus of the country.\n\n  That means that the Senator from Texas will now look to Social \nSecurity, which is where we had originally designated that those funds \nwould go. We have said as a matter of budget policy that we are going \nto preserve the budget surplus to take care of Social Security. But \nsince the Senator is agreeing that only one-third of this revenue will \ncome from the tobacco bill, the rest of it can only come from the \nsurplus, unless, of course, the Senator has a bunch of offsets he is \nwilling to offer up to suggest where that funding is going to come \nfrom.\n  A vote for the Gramm amendment in its current form, Mr. President, is \na vote to take $90 billion to $125 billion of surpluses away from \nSocial Security. This is $90 billion to $125 billion that will not be \navailable for the long-term reform of Social Security, because once \nthis tax cut of the Senator becomes law, assuming it does, it is law \noutside of the budget process. The Tax Code is not part of the budget \nprocess. That is then a right that has been created, an expectation as \nto what people will pay. And it has to be funded. The only place you \ncan turn to fund it is to the general revenues and, therefore, to the \nsurplus.\n  That is one side of what is being offered here. But I want to speak \nabout another side.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues whether or not it is possible to \ntake away the label ``Democrat and Republican,'' take away the \ncontentiousness of this bill, and just look at these two alternatives \nas a matter of good public policy and of common sense in terms of the \nbudgeting of the country. The alternative that Senator Daschle and \nothers of us on our side are offering, and we would hope with good \ncommon sense apply to the analysis that a number of colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle would say is really better policy--and I \nwill say why I believe it is better policy--the fact is that the \nalternative we will offer provides a greater marriage penalty relief \nthan the Senator from Texas, but it does so with less cost to the \nFederal Treasury and to the tobacco bill. I want to repeat that. The \nalternative that we offer will give more marriage penalty relief than \nthe Senator from Texas, but it will do so with less damage to the \ncapacity of the tobacco legislation to be able to provide for public \nhealth for research for the States, and so forth.\n  The question is obviously, How do you do that? How do you avoid--is \nthat some kind of a shell game and flimflam artistry, or is it real? I \nwill tell you why it is real. The Senator from Texas, by his own \nadmission, has agreed that he will reward those people who do not \nsmoke. Or let's talk about the targeting. He says it is impossible to \ntarget this to accomplish a goal where you would actually wind up \ntargeting nonsmokers versus smokers. I would agree with that. He is \nabsolutely correct. That is pretty hard to do. But you can easily \ntarget this marriage penalty reward so that it is actually dealing with \nthe marriage penalty. If the purpose of this is to fix the marriage \npenalty, then it is possible to target this benefit in a way that it \ngoes to the people who pay a penalty, not paid to the people who get a \nbonus.\n  The Congressional Budget Office will tell you that 51 percent of \nAmerican married taxpayers get a bonus. And there is absolutely nothing \nin the approach of the Senator from Texas that limits them from getting \nrewarded above the bonus. There is no practical policy here given the \ndifficulties we face of taking from the Social Security surplus, or \ntaking from the tobacco bill, which we have now agreed we don't want to \ntake more than a third from--there is no rationale for coming in and \nrewarding those people who already get a bonus. So what we have done is \nguarantee that we are going to give the tax relief to the people who \nare actually penalized. Senator Gramm's amendment costs 50 percent more \nthan the Democrat alternative, and it gives less marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  The reason is that we have focused on giving about 90 percent of our \ntax cut to those families that are actually penalized, whereas Senator \nGramm is only 40 percent--90 percent versus 40 percent. Sixty percent \nof the people who are going to get a reward under Senator Gramm's \napproach don't even pay a marriage penalty. It is not even fixing the \nmarriage penalty. It seems to me as a matter of public policy what we \nought to do is guarantee that we reach the maximum number of people who \npay the penalty with the maximum amount of dollars back to those \npeople.\n  Our alternative would provide a 20-percent deduction against the \nincome of the lesser-earning spouse. The way the marriage penalty \nworks, as I think most people know by now, is that either on a standard \ndeduction or on the earned-income tax credit or on the marginal rate \nyou pay more or less according to what the income of both members of \nthe household, both married partners pay. But it depends. The vagaries \nof the Tax Code are such that you could be a married couple with one \nperson working, earning a big salary, one person not working at all, \nand you won't be affected the same way; you would actually have a bonus \nversus the two married partners who are both working, both earning sort \nof a similar amount of money. So if you have two income earners each \nearning about $25,000, they wind up paying a penalty versus the high-\nincome earner, single earner within the family and the other partner \nwho is not, and there are other aberrations like that as you go through \nthe various levels of income earning.\n  It makes no sense to jeopardize this legislation and to place \npressure on the surplus, which we have now decided we ought to reserve \nto save Social Security in order to reward people who are already \nrewarded. There is simply no matter of public policy of common sense in \ndoing that, and that is why there is a very significant difference \nbetween the two approaches here.\n  Let me give as an example a couple making $35,000. Let us split the \n$35,000, $20,000 to the husband or vice versa, $15,000 between the two \nspouses--you have 20 to one and 15 to the other, making $35,000. Under \nthe Gramm approach, that couple would receive an average additional \ndeduction of about $1--$1. By comparison, under the 20-percent, second-\nearner deduction alternative that we propose, the couple would receive \nan additional deduction of $3,000--$3,000 deduction versus $1 under \nSenator Gramm, 20 percent of the $15,000. That represents about twice \nas large a tax deduction, and it would provide twice as much actual tax \nrelief without any of the negative downside that is carried with the \nproposal of the Senator from Texas.\n  Let me give you another example. For a couple making $50,000, let's \nsplit it evenly between both spouses--$25,000 husband, $25,000 wife. \nAnd that is a very realistic, very realistic division in the kind of \ntwo-person income of the families that we are trying to reach. Again, \nunder Gramm, the couple would receive an average additional deduction \nof $1.\n  By contrast, under the 20-percent, second-earner deduction \nalternative that we propose, the couple would receive an extra $5,000 \ndeduction representing more than three times as much tax relief.\n  So that is the choice here, Mr. President. You can have a reward to \npeople who are already getting a benefit by getting married, which is \nnot a marriage penalty fix at all; you can structure it so that you \nwind up having to take the money from the general revenues, from the \nsurplus; or you can come in with much greater tax relief that goes to \nthe people who really need it, and you can do so without the negative \nimpact on Social Security and\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\nwithout the negative impact on the tobacco bill itself.\n\n  I think the choice is very clear. The difficulties presented to the \noverall budget situation by Senator Gramm's current approach are very \nsignificant. It was the understanding, we thought, that we were not \ngoing to take more than one-third of the revenues in total, in whatever \nform they were going to come, that the Senator was going to structure \nhis benefits so that no more than a third was represented in them.\n  What is happening here is the Senator is giving the guarantee that no \nmore than a third comes out of the tobacco bill, but he goes elsewhere \nto look for the rest of the larger sum of money that he is going to \ngive back by not structuring the benefits downwards. So, in other \nwords, it is essentially outside of the notion that you have an \nagreement that is going to restrict the total benefits of the marriage \npenalty to one-third of the level of the tax bill.\n  Now, he can come back and argue: Wait a minute; we are just taking \none-third of the tax bill.\n  Well, that is true, except that in total for the marriage penalty \nthey are looking to one-third, significantly more than one-third from \nthese other sources, which is a very different consideration from that \nwith which I think most of us thought we were going to be presented.\n  The bottom line is that the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nTexas costs 50 percent more in the first 10 years than the Democrat \nalternative--that is $46 billion total in the first 10 years--versus \nabout $31 billion. But it delivers far less in marriage penalty tax \nrelief.\n  Finally, at this point--I would reserve some time later--but at this \npoint in time, if you have $30 billion taken out of this bill in the \nfirst 10 years--9 years, 10 years--added to the 40 percent that goes to \nthe States, and add to that the component of the drug plan that came \nthrough yesterday, which takes 50 percent of the public health money, \nand we all know this bill is not leaving the floor of the Senate unless \nthere is some kind of fix for the farmers, and we are going to look at \nsomewhere between $9 and $18 billion--that is what you have, $9 \nbillion; $18 billion, Senator Lugar, I believe; $9 billion, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  All of a sudden the question has to be asked: Where is the money to \nstop kids from smoking? Where is the fundamental notion that this is a \nbill directed at children in order to stop those kids from smoking? And \neveryone has come to understand that you need counteradvertising, \ncessation, professional training, and other kinds of things in order to \ndo that. So it is simply unacceptable that suddenly all of the \nfundamental purpose of the legislation could be stripped away in a \nmanner that would be unacceptable.\n  Now, obviously, if this were to pass, I think everyone knows it is \nnot going to be able to stay that way. There is no way. So the choice \nbefore the Senate is very clear: Do we want to make good policy about \nthe marriage penalty, which I support fixing, but I have said all along \nit has to be done within the confines of reasonableness as to how much \nis available in this overall package so that we can still accomplish \nthe fundamental purposes of the legislation. We are going to have to \nclearly visit that a little more over the course of the afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the pending amendment begins to address tax \nrelief in two important areas. The first is the marriage penalty that \nexists in the code. The second is health care costs. This amendment \nbegins to give back to the people some of the money that is raised \nthrough the tobacco tax in the bill. And for these reasons I intend to \nsupport the pending amendment.\n  Personally, I think the spending is still too high in the tobacco \nbill. More of the revenue should be returned to the taxpayer.\n  In addition, there are many measures that the Finance Committee \nrecommended which are not adequately included in the final bill. For \nexample, the tobacco bill is inconsistent with the work of the Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Medicaid program. The \ntobacco bill also re-opens the Balanced Budget Act by increasing \nspending beyond the $24 billion we have already provided for the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Another aspect of the overall bill \nwhich concerns me is the way that the international trade provisions \nare drafted.\n  Mr. President, there have been media reports that the tobacco bill is \nin trouble because the managers have to accommodate so many factions \nwithin the Senate and that today they have to accommodate the tax-\ncutters to make progress on the bill. I take exception with the \nsuggestion that tax relief is just another nuisance to be accommodated. \nMy perspective on this bill is quite different.\n  It is repeatedly asserted that this bill's purpose is to reduce teen \nsmoking. That is a very desirable goal. I support that goal. However, \nin the bill I find only two policies that bear on that goal.\n  The first one--the tax increase--is said to bring in $65 billion over \n5 years. The second one--under $1 billion in the President's budget--is \na cessation program for teenagers.\n  In my opinion, we have accomplished the goal with $64 billion left on \nthe table. That money should be returned to the people, not be used as \na slush fund to make government bigger. Making government bigger is not \nthe goal of this legislation. But it seems to be the effect.\n  In my opinion, the debate on this bill should center on how we rebate \nexcess revenues to the people not on how we can fund government \nspending increases that cannot survive the traditional discipline of \nthe budget and appropriations process. I support this amendment because \nit is philosophically the only legitimate course, in my opinion, for \nthe Senate to take.\n  The pending amendment provides tax relief in two specific ways. \nFirst, it partially reduces the inequity of the marriage tax penalty.\n  As my colleagues know, this penalty places an unfair burden on two-\nearner married couples.\n  According to a recent Congressional Budget Office study, a married \ncouple filing a joint tax return in 1996 could face a tax bill more \nthan $20,000 higher than they would pay if they were not married and \ncould file individual tax returns. The same study estimated that \naccording to one measure of the marriage penalty more than 21 million \nmarried couples paid an average of nearly $1,400 in additional taxes in \n1996 because they filed jointly. Marriage tax penalties totaled $29 \nbillion in 1996.\n  Let me take a few minutes to describe the history of the penalty--\nwhich has been around for almost 30 years. Before 1948, all taxpayers \nfiled as single individuals. In that year, Congress gave taxpayers the \nability to file jointly--meaning that a couple had the benefit on \nincome splitting. The tax bracket for married couples was double the \nbracket for single individuals. Because of complaints that singles were \nbeing unfairly penalized, in 1969, Congress devised a special rate \nschedule and standard deduction amounts for singles. This new rate \nschedule created a marriage penalty for some taxpayers.\n  Because of changing demographics and the prevalence of two-earner \ncouples in America, the marriage tax penalty has become an even greater \nconcern. Moreover, after being reduced during the 1980s, the tax \nincreases and creation of additional tax brackets in 1990 and 1993 have \nmade it much worse today.\n  In the current tax code, there are over 65 examples of provisions \ncausing the marriage tax penalty. The most obvious and dramatic one is \nthe rate structure itself.\n  But there are numerous others, all of which can have a significant \neffect on the pocketbook of a married couple. The penalty provisions \nare built into deductions, exemptions, credits, and other facets of the \ncode.\n  What the pending amendment does is take a step toward providing some \nrelief for this inequitable condition. It provides a deduction, up to \nan amount of roughly $3,400, for married couples. This deduction is \nphased in over 10 years. It will partially alleviate the burden, and \ntoward doing this, I am a strong advocate. However, I regret that this \nrelief does not go far enough.\n  The phased-in deduction is only available to couples with an adjusted \ngross income of less than $50,000. In other words, Mr. President, \nsomeone\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nwho works in the Chrysler or GM plant in Delaware and whose spouse is a \nschool teacher would have too high an income to qualify for marriage \npenalty relief. That doesn't seem fair. I would have liked to see us \ngive relief from the marriage penalty to many more Americans. Frankly, \nI would like to see us get rid of the marriage penalty altogether.\n  The second major component of tax relief in this amendment is in the \narea of health care. The amendment provides self-employed individuals \nnext year with a 100 percent deduction for their health insurance. This \nis long over-due. It will help farmers, small business people, and \nothers who buy their own health insurance. Because of this amendment, 3 \nmillion taxpayers and their families will have more affordable health \ncare, and you cannot overstate how important this is.\n  This is a good first step. But I want to be clear that I do not \nconsider it to be everything we must do. There are 18 million other \nAmericans who lack health insurance, some are unemployed, others are \nelderly, and many have jobs. Simply put, I would like to see these \nindividuals receive an above-the-line deduction for the cost of their \nhealth care. This is something I have worked on for some time.\n  When the Finance Committee marked up the tobacco legislation I placed \nbefore the committee a two-part proposal in the area of health care.\n  The first part was an immediate increase to 100 percent deductibility \nfor health insurance for the self-employed. The second part provided \nthe same benefit to the other 18 million Americans who need health \ninsurance. This attempt was a natural follow-on to my successful \nefforts in 1995 to raise the deductible percentage from 25 to 30 \npercent and to make it permanent. Unfortunately, this time my tax cut \nproposal was not approved by the Finance Committee.\n  I intended to offer the same tax cut amendment on the floor, and I \nwas pleased that several members--Republicans and Democrats--agreed to \nsupport it.\n  This proposal was also supported by farmers and small business, and I \nam pleased that it is reflected in the amendment before us now. Though, \nagain, I want to go further. This is a good start, but I hope that in \nthe future we revisit this with a mind to making health insurance more \naffordable for millions more of American workers.\n  It is the same with the marriage penalty. It is egregious that \nmarried couples are penalized by our tax code. I believe this sends the \nwrong message in more ways than one, and it must be addressed. We have \nattempted to do this in the past. For example, in 1995, in the Balanced \nBudget Act, Congress approved a proposal to phase out the marriage \npenalty in the standard deduction. Our legislation was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  I realize that at this point we are constrained by financial \nlimitations and other priorities, and I compliment my colleagues for \nmoving as far as they have with this bill. But I want all of my \ncolleagues to agree with me that this should be seen as only the \nbeginning. There is no justification for a married couple to be \npenalized just because they are married.\n  Mr. President, though it is not perfect, and while it does not go as \nfar as I would like, I intend to support this amendment. It sends the \nright message.\n  It does provide partial relief. And it is a step in the right \ndirection. I encourage my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I think somewhere I heard the old saying, \n``No good deed goes unpunished.'' In trying to see if we might find \nsome consensus on this issue, I tried to write our marriage penalty \nrepeal amendment in such a way as to limit the amount of resources that \nit took from the underlying bill.\n  I did it recognizing that the underlying bill is as full of fat as \nany bill could possibly be. It is a bill that provides funding for a \nNative American antismoking campaign that will spend $18,615.55 per \nNative American who will be served. It is a bill that pays trial \nlawyers $92,000 an hour. It is a bill that pays tobacco farmers $23,000 \nan acre, and they can keep the land and go on farming tobacco.\n  With all of these gross expenditures, our colleagues say that if we \ntake more than a third of the money we are raising in taxes--which they \nsay they are not increasing the tax to raise money--but if we take any \nmore than a third of it and give it back, then somehow the bill is \ngoing to collapse.\n  Then I try to adjust the amendment to keep it within those \nconstraints, and our dear colleague from Massachusetts accuses me of \ntaking money from Social Security. And it goes on and on and on. ``No \ngood deed goes unpunished.''\n  I have the ability to modify my amendment. I want my colleagues to \nunderstand that if we don't work out something on this amendment pretty \nsoon, I am going to modify my amendment, and I am going to take every \npenny of this money out of this larded bill. So I can solve all of \nthese problems. I tried to help somebody. I tried to work out a \nconsensus, and now we are not able to do it. But I can fix that \nproblem. I can fix the problem by taking the money out of this bill, \nand I am prepared to do that. I am not going to do it right now. I am \ngoing to wait and see if we can work something out. But I am prepared \nto do it. I have a modification. I have a right to modify my amendment, \nand I will modify my amendment at some point if we don't work something \nout.\n  Madam President, I want to address a number of issues that our \ncolleague from Massachusetts raised.\n  Our colleague from Massachusetts says, ``Well, I have a marriage \npenalty correction device, but mine doesn't cost as much and gives more \nrelief.''\n  So the question is, How is that possible? Well, the answer is that it \ngives no relief to one particular kind of family. That is a family \nwhere one of the parents decides to stay at home and work within the \nhome--one of the hardest and most difficult jobs in America and one of \nthe most important jobs in America.\n  We have not seen their amendment, but the way our Democrat colleagues \ncould give a marriage penalty for so much less money is that it is a \nmarriage penalty correction that you get only if both parents work \noutside the\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nhome. That is not the way we have done it. We have not done it that way \nbecause I do not want the Government to be making the decision as to \nwhether a parent works outside the home or works inside the home.\n  Let me say, it is a tough decision for people to make. Some people \nmake it based on economics; some people make it based on their careers. \nAnd I think families need to make it, not the Government. My mama, as I \nhave said earlier, worked all my life because she had to. My wife has \nworked all my children's lives because she chose to. She had a career. \nShe wanted to do it. But the point is, the Tax Code should not \ndiscriminate against parents who choose to make an economic sacrifice \nto have one of the parents stay home and raise the children.\n  So the magic in this Democrat alternative, if such an alternative \nexists, is they can do it for less but the way they do it for less is, \nthey say if you have a stay-at-home parent, you get no relief from the \nmarriage penalty.\n  They are going to complicate this issue. But, fortunately, I \nunderstand this issue. So let me try to straighten it all out before \nthey waste all the time trying to complicate it, because I can answer \nit and will save everybody time.\n  There is something called a marriage bonus. If there has ever been a \ntotally fraudulent concept, it is the marriage bonus. This thing that \nwe call in the Tax Code a marriage bonus is, if you marry--and let me \njust speak from the point of view of a male--if you marry a lady and \nshe comes and lives with you in marriage, you get to take her personal \nexemption and you also get an adjustment to your standard deduction.\n  So I am sure that people will laugh at this, but since our colleagues \nare going to go to great lengths to talk about it, let me just destroy \nit, and we will not waste our time.\n  Something is called a marriage bonus when--let us say you have John \nand Josephine who fall in love. And Josephine is just getting out of \ncollege. Her father and mother have been taking a personal exemption \nfor Josephine. She marries John. And John is already working. Josephine \nis getting ready to go into the labor market. They went to the \ngraduation and she got her diploma. Then they walked down the aisle and \nsaid, ``I do.'' And sure enough, John gets to declare $2,700 on his tax \nreturn for her personal exemption. And John gets $2,850 added to his \nstandard deduction. But does anybody believe that John can feed, \nclothe, and house Josephine for $5,550? Some bonus. That is no bonus.\n  Let me show you what has happened. In 1950, the Tax Code of America \nwas such that for the average family of four--husband, wife, two \nchildren--75.3 percent of their income was totally shielded from any \nFederal income tax. This meant that by the time they took their \npersonal exemptions--and they got four of them--that shield was 65.3 \npercent of their income. Then they got their standard deduction, and \nthat shielded 10 percent of their income, for a total of 75.3 percent.\n  So in 1950, the cold war had heated up, we were going into Korea, \ndefense spending was rising, but we still shielded 75.3 percent of the \nincome of the average family of four in America from any income taxes \nbecause of the personal exemptions and the standard deduction.\n  The personal exemption was $500 in 1950. To be the same level today, \nthe personal exemption would have to be $5,000. But it is $2,700. So \ntoday, the same family of four, making the average income in the \ncountry in 1996, has only 32.8 percent of their income shielded. Every \nbit of the additional income is being subject to income taxes.\n\n  So what happened between 1950 and 1998? What happened between 1950 \nand 1998 is that the real value of the standard deduction and the \npersonal exemption declined dramatically because it did not keep pace \nwith inflation. So whereas in 1950, 75.3 percent of the income of the \naverage working family in America was totally shielded from income \ntaxes, now the average family in America, family of four, making the \naverage income, has only 32.8 percent of their income shielded from \ntaxes.\n  So since 1950, what has happened? Rich people paid a lot of taxes in \n1950, and rich people pay a lot of taxes today. Poor people paid no \nincome taxes in 1950, and they do not pay any income taxes today. What \nhappened to the tax burden between 1950 and today? It almost doubled. \nWho paid it? Middle-class families. Today, the number that just came \nout showed that 20.4 percent of all income earned by all Americans is \ntaken by the Federal Government, and when you take State and local \ntaxes, the tax burden today is at the highest level in the peacetime \nhistory of the United States of America. No American has ever lived \nwith a peacetime tax burden higher than today. Even though we won the \ncold war, tore down the Berlin Wall, cut defense by 50 percent, we \nstill have the highest tax burden in American peacetime history because \nof passing bills like the one that is before us today.\n  What is the amendment that I have offered with Senator Domenici and \nSenator Roth trying to do? What it is trying to do is address the \nproblem, shown on this chart, where working families end up paying more \nand more of their income. When you have a working spouse today, that \nworking spouse is paying 60 percent of their income in taxes that did \nnot exist in 1950.\n  What Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and I are trying to do is to \ncorrect that. We are trying to take a first step to correct this \nmarriage penalty, which is basically a penalty that falls on 31 million \nAmericans where they actually pay an average of $1,400 a year more \nbecause they are married than they would pay if they were single. We \nwant to give them an additional $3,300 deduction. We want to put it \nabove the line so it applies to the earned-income tax credit. And our \nDemocrat colleagues say, ``No, we don't want to do it that way.''\n  Let me tell you what they want to do. No. 1, they want to say that if \na family chooses to have one of the parents stay at home with their \nchildren, that that parent is worthless and therefore they should get \nno correction for the marriage penalty at all.\n  What Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and I are trying to do is to not \ntilt the Tax Code against stay-at-home parents.\n  I am not trying to make a judgment. In the two families I have had \nthe privilege to live in my parents'; and now my own family--both \nparents have worked. I am not trying to stand in judgment on whether \nboth parents should work or they should not work. Families should do \nwhat works for them. But we should not have a Tax Code that penalizes \npeople who give up income in order to have one parent stay at home with \nthe children. That is the proposal that the Democrats are making.\n  The second proposal they are making is, do not give any of this to \nmoderate-income people. I did not hear anything in their proposal about \nmaking it a rebate to people who are getting the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  Let me tell you why that is so important. You have a lady who is \nwashing dishes and you have a man who is a janitor in a school. They \nmight be about as well off on welfare as they are working, but they are \nproud, they are ambitious, they want to be self-reliant. So every \nmorning they set the alarm for 6 o'clock. When the alarm clock goes \noff, their feet hit the ground. They get up, they get dressed, they go \nto work. They often work more than one job. They meet and fall in love. \nIt looks like their dream has come true because together they can have \nmore.\n  But under the existing Tax Code each of them making very low income \nqualifies them for an earned-income tax credit. They lose the earned-\nincome tax credit if they get married. So they face a huge penalty, \noften more than $1,400 a year if they get married.\n  In our amendment, we apply the correction to this perversion in the \nTax Code called the marriage penalty so that even people that are \ngetting the earned-income tax credit can deduct this $3,300 before they \ngauge their eligibility. Why? First of all, we are for love. Secondly, \nif a lady washing dishes and a man who is a janitor in a school fall in \nlove, we want them to get married. What society would want to \ndiscourage that from happening? They may get married, have a child, \ntheir child may become President of the United States.\n  The alternative being offered is so much cheaper. One of the reasons \nit is cheaper is that it doesn't apply to these very low-income people. \nWe thought it should apply to very low-income people. The reason is 34 \npercent\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nof the money they are taking out of the pockets of working Americans \nthrough this tobacco tax come from people that make $15,000 a year or \nless. They should not be excluded from this provision.\n  To sum up the points I wanted to make, I want the marriage penalty to \nbe corrected. I want this tax deduction to apply to families, whether \nthey both work outside the home or whether they decide they will \nsacrifice, take less income, and one of them will stay home and raise \ntheir children. I am not trying to make a judgment as to whether that \nis better or worse. I think it depends on the people and what they \nwant. But I don't think the Tax Code should treat people differently \nbased on that decision. Our colleagues who supposedly are offering an \nalternative think it should. Our colleagues say, look, if you don't \nwork outside the home, you don't work. If you don't work outside the \nhome, you are not due any correction for this penalty.\n  Then as the final absurdity they say, after all, John, by marrying \nJosephine, he already got $5,550 tax deduction by getting her personal \nexemption and part of her standard deduction. But who can live on \n$5,550? What kind of bonus is that? It just shows you the absurd \nlanguage we have developed to defend a provision in the Tax Code which \nis absolutely indefensible.\n  I want, in this amendment, to give at least a third of the money we \nare taking from working Americans back to them. Our colleagues try to \nget us to focus on these terrible tobacco companies and forget about \nthe fact that tobacco companies are paying no taxes at all under this \nbill. In fact, this bill makes it illegal for the tobacco companies not \nto pass through the tax to consumers. Who is paying this tax? A \nmajority, 59.1 percent of this tax is being paid by families that make \nless than $30,000 a year. So I have made the modest proposal to give a \nthird of the money back to moderate-income families so that those who \nwere in favor of the bill can say, well, we raised tobacco prices. \nHopefully, that will discourage children from smoking. Hopefully, it \nwill discourage other people from smoking. Just don't impoverish blue-\ncollar workers in America who smoke and who, paradoxically, are the \nvictims of this whole process.\n  The incredible, unthinkable, virtually unspeakable truth about this \nbill is it doesn't penalize the tobacco companies. It penalizes the \nvictims. We tell everybody you have been victimized by the tobacco \ncompanies. They knew you would get addicted to nicotine, and they \nconspired to get you to smoke. Then this bill says we are going to do \nsomething about it; we are going to tax you, not the tobacco companies.\n\n  Always seeking to do good, I had this modest amendment to take a \nthird of the money and give it back to moderate-income families in \nrepealing the marriage penalty and making health insurance tax \ndeductible for the self-employed. I tried to do it in such a way as to \nprotect some of their huge trust funds. Now they say, no; you can't do \nthat. So at some point, if we don't work this out, I am going to modify \nmy amendment and I am going to take all the money out of the bills \ntrust fund.\n  The truth is we should be giving back about 80 percent of this money \nin tax cuts. We should be using the other 20 percent--10 percent of it \non antismoking, 10 percent of it on antidrugs, and that ought to be it.\n  In any case, if we are going to debate this issue, I think our \ncolleagues are going to be a long time explaining why, if mom or dad \ndecides to stay at home, they are discriminated against under this Tax \nCode. I don't think people are going to be in favor of that and I hope \nsomething can be worked out.\n  Finally, at the end of the budget cycle in the year 2007, we have a \nchoice: We can repeal these marriage penalty provisions and take all of \nit out of this trust fund, or we can set a portion of it out of this \ntrust fund. I can do it either way.\n  I am beginning to be convinced, as my dear colleague from Arizona has \nbeen convinced throughout this debate, that no good deed goes \nunpunished, even when you try to do what you believe is a good work. If \nyou try to do something good and you try to be reasonable and you try \nto make things work, something is going to happen to punish you for it. \nI think that is a shame for the process.\n  I wanted my colleagues to be aware, when we are talking about giving \na $3,300 tax deduction for working families, that you have to wonder \nwhy is that reasonable? Well, in 1950, 75.3 percent of their income was \ntotally shielded from income taxes because of the standard deduction \nand the dependent exemption. Because of inflation since that time and \nbecause the personal exemption has not been raised to equal inflation, \nnow only 32.8 percent of their income is shielded from taxes.\n  I am not going to apologize for trying to let working families keep \nmore of what they earn. Nor am I going to apologize for having a \nprovision that says to parents you can get this tax deduction if both \nof you work or you can get it if one of you works and you have to make \nthe decision about what works for you and your family. I don't think \ndoing it any other way is going to be successful. I hope we can work \nthis out. But it may be preordained somewhere at a higher level than we \nare and maybe for some good purpose that this can never work out and \nthis might never be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment and then spend a \nmoment to visit with the Senator from Arizona.\n  Let me correct one thing the Senator from Texas said. The Senator \nknows just a little while ago I was talking to him and I offered him a \ncompromise which includes the capacity to raise the level of benefit to \nthe spouse--working mom or pop--who stays home with kids.\n  But what the Senator is ignoring also is that under the marriage \npenalty, so-called, the mother who stays home, or father who stays home \ntoday and isn't working and that he wants to reward, is, in fact, \nalready rewarded because the structure of tax is such that with a \nsingle earner and one parent staying home, they get a marriage bonus.\n  So we have a tax structure that already rewards the very person the \nSenator from Texas is talking about. In addition to that, I suggested \nto him that we ought to be able to work out some way to augment that a \nlittle bit. I think that is reasonable. So let's not get into a notion \nthat somehow people want to be more protective of mom and pop who want \nto stay home with the kids. This debate is about whether or not we are \ngoing to be able to have enough money to do the things this tobacco \nbill must do, which is to reduce the number of kids smoking.\n  You never hear the Senator from Texas talk about how we are going to \nsave lives in America. We hear him talking about saving taxes, but not \nsaving lives. We never hear him talk about the 400,000 people a year \nwho die because they smoke. You also don't hear him refute the tobacco \ncompany's own memoranda, which talks about how they know that when the \nprice goes up, the number of people who buy their cigarettes goes down. \nThat is tobacco company fact; it is not made up on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  So let's begin to deal with the reality here. The reality is that if \nyou don't have the ability to affect the behavior of our kids in this \ncountry, we are not doing the job on this legislation. And while it is \nall well and good to want to restore some money back to people to take \ncare of the marriage penalty--and I am for that--we want to do that in \na way that is reasonable within the other obligations of this \nlegislation. That is what we are fighting for here--to maintain common \nsense in this.\n  I am happy to work out some kind of compromise with the Senator. I \nthink it is important to understand that has to be fair. If we take 80 \npercent of this bill in order to rebate people who are already getting \nbenefits, we will have departed from all common sense and fairness.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am interested to see that at a time \nwhen the tobacco bill is on the floor of\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\nthe Senate, we are debating the marriage tax penalty. It is unique, I \nsuppose, that in the U.S. Senate one does not have to talk about the \nsubject that is on the Senate floor at that time. We experienced, \nearlier in this session, the majority leader bringing to the floor a \npiece of legislation which created a parliamentary situation where no \none could offer any other amendments except those he would prefer to \nhave offered because he was afraid someone on this side of the \npolitical aisle would offer an amendment not related to the subject. So \nwe had a legislative logjam on a number of pieces of legislation. That \nwas his right, and I complained about it at the time. And at the same \ntime, the majority leader was complaining that somebody might offer an \namendment that had nothing to do with the bill on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Well, here we are. We have a tobacco bill on the floor of the Senate \nand what have we been talking about now for a number of days? The \nmarriage tax penalty. We had a tax bill on the floor of the Senate some \nlong while ago and we debated that. But now, on the tobacco bill, we \nare talking about the marriage tax penalty.\n  I don't think the Senator from Texas will get anybody to swallow the \nbait here that a marriage tax penalty is justifiable. The Congress has \nworked on the marriage tax penalty attempting to fix it, to reduce it, \nto abolish it, and to otherwise change it for a long, long time. Long \nafter this debate is over, there will be discussion about this so-\ncalled marriage tax penalty. Should it be abolished, should it be \nfixed? Of course, it should. Easier said than done, but we ought to do \nit.\n  But we are now on a tobacco bill. I bring this discussion back to the \nreason that we have a bill on the floor of the Senate dealing with \ntobacco. I want to read again, for some of my colleagues and those who \nare interested, what persuades those of us in the Senate who support \nthis tobacco legislation and think this legislation is necessary.\n  I was on the Senate Commerce Committee when we passed the legislation \nout of the committee. I voted for it, and I supported it. Senator \nMcCain was the principal author of the bill, and Senator Conrad, my \ncolleague from North Dakota, has also written a piece of legislation \nwhich found its way, or at least in large part, into the McCain \nlegislation. I compliment both of them, and others, including the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and a number of others who have worked hard \non this legislation.\n  But why tobacco legislation? Because many of us believe that it is \ninappropriate in this country to allow the tobacco industry to continue \nto try to addict America's children to nicotine. Some say, ``Well, gee, \nthat is not what has been happening.'' Of course it has been happening. \nSeveral court cases have now unearthed the memoranda and the \ninformation from the bowels of the tobacco companies that they didn't \nwant to disclose but were required to disclose. This information showed \nexactly what their strategies were in recent decades to try to addict \nAmerica's children to tobacco.\n  Almost no one reaches adult age and discovers that what we really \nwanted to do and have failed to do is start smoking. Does anybody know \na thoughtful adult who scratches their head and says, ``Gosh, what have \nI missed in life? I know what it is. I need to start smoking. That is \nwhat I am missing. That is what will enrich my life.'' Did you ever \nhear of anybody doing that? I don't think so. The only way you get new \nsmokers is to get kids to smoke.\n  On Friday, I described for my colleagues some of the data and the \nmemoranda that were in the files of the tobacco companies. I want to \nread some of them again, because I want us to be talking about the \nsubject of tobacco on the floor of the Senate.\n  But why do we want to do something to tell the tobacco industry they \ncan't addict America's children to nicotine when it is legal to smoke, \nand it will always be legal to smoke. It is an adult choice. But it is \nnot legal, and ought not be legal nor morally defensible for anyone to \nsay we are going to try to addict 15-year-old kids, or 13-year-old \nkids, to our cigarettes in the name of profit.\n  So let me proceed to describe some of the documents, that we have \nunearthed in various court cases and elsewhere, that describe what the \ntobacco industry has done. At the end of that, I will ask my colleagues \nif they think this behavior is defensible. If you don't, then we ought \nto pass this kind of legislation and stop talking about other subjects.\n  In 1972, Brown & Williamson, a tobacco company: ``It is a well known \nfact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered.''\n  In 1972, they are talking about adding honey to cigarettes. Why? \nBecause kids like sweet products. Does that sound like a company that \nis trying to addict kids to cigarettes? It does to me.\n  In 1973, RJR, a tobacco company, says: ``Comic strip type of copy \nmight get a much higher readership among younger people than another \ntype of copy.''\n  They are talking about advertising. Does this sound like a cigarette \ncompany that is interested in trying to get kids to smoke? It does to \nme.\n  In 1973, Brown & Williamson: ``Kool''--\n  This is a quote. The cigarette brand Kool:\n\n       Kool has shown little or no growth in the share of the \n     users in the 26 and up age group. Growth is from 16- to 25-\n     year-olds. At the present rate, a smoker in the 16- to 25-\n     year-old age group will soon be three times as important to \n     Kool as a prospect in any other broad age category.\n\n  This is a company that is talking about 16-year-olds and how \nattractive it is that 16-year-olds are using their cigarettes.\n  Philip Morris, 1974: ``We are not sure that anything can be done to \nhalt a major exodus if one gets going among the young.''\n  ``This group''--now speaking to the young, according to Philip \nMorris--``follows the crowd, and we don't pretend to know what gets \nthem going from one thing or another. Certainly Philip Morris should \ncontinue efforts for Marlboro in the youth market.''\n  Is this a company looking at selling cigarettes to kids? I think so.\n  In 1974, R.J. Reynolds, they write, speaking of kids: ``They \nrepresent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14- to 24-age group \nmatures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette \nvolume for at least the next 25 years.''\n\n  This is a company talking about the 14-year-old smoker.\n  In 1975, a researcher for Philip Morris writes: ``Marlboro's \nphenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part \nto our high market penetration among young smokers 15 to 19 years old. \nMy own data, which includes younger teenagers, even shows higher \nMarlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-olds.''\n  Does anybody who reads believe after reading this that the tobacco \ncompanies weren't vitally interested in selling cigarettes to these \nkids? Of course they were.\n  In 1975, RJR-Nabisco talks about increasing penetration among the 14- \nto 24-year-olds: ``Evidence is now available to indicate the 14- to 18-\nyear-old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR \nTobacco must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if \nour position in the industry is to be maintained.''\n  In 1976, that is RJR saying about 14- to 18-year-olds that we have \ngot to get a new cigarette out there to attract these people if we are \ngoing to retain our position.\n  In 1978, the Lorillard Cigarette Company said the following: ``The \nbase of our business is the high school student.''\n  ``The base of our business is the high school student!'' This from a \ntobacco company.\n  In 1979: ``Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger category \ncapturing over 50 percent of the market,'' Philip Morris writes \nproudly.\n  In the name of profit, they say: Our cigarettes dominated the 17-year \nand younger category. We capture over 50 percent of the market.\n  They make it sound like a county fair, don't they? A blue ribbon--a \nfat steer gets a blue ribbon. We were able to get 15-, 16-, and 17-\nyear-old kids to smoke. We win.\n  Now tell me that this industry doesn't target young kids to smoke.\n  Marlboro Red, a derivative of Marlboro, I guess--I have not seen a \nMarlboro Red cigarette. But a Marlboro Red in 1981, a Philip Morris \nresearcher\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nwrites: ``The overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke \nwhile in their teens. At least part of the success of our Marlboro Red \nduring its most rapid growth period was because it became the brand of \nchoice among teenagers who then stuck with it.''\n  I think maybe ``stuck with it'' is a misnomer. I think maybe ``who \nwere addicted to it'' rather than ``stuck with it.'' The whole purpose, \nof course, is you attract a 15-year-old to start smoking and you have \ngot a customer for life.\n  Smoking is legal in this country, and it will always be legal. Adults \nhave the right to make the choice to smoke. Three hundred thousand to \nfour hundred thousand people a year die in this country from choosing \nto smoke, from smoking and smoking-related causes. Three hundred \nthousand to four hundred thousand people a year die from having made \nthat choice. You have heard the statistics: every day, 3,000 kids will \nstart to smoke; 1,000 of them will die from having made that choice.\n  The question for us is, will we as a country continue to sit on our \nhands and say to the tobacco industry, ``It is all right, we understand \nyour future customers are our children; it is all right, our sons and \ndaughters are available to be a marketing target for you? Should it be \nall right to say that you can advertise to them; you can make pitches \nto them; you can provide all kinds of subtle approaches to our kids \nthat smoking is cool, smoking is something you ought to do, smoking \ntastes good, smoking feels good, your peers smoke so you ought to \nsmoke''? Is that something this country wants? Is that something this \ncountry is going to allow to continue? I don't think so.\n  Let me continue.\n  The tobacco industry in 1983, says Brown & Williamson, will not \nsupport a youth smoking program which discourages young people from \nsmoking. In 1983, you heard all of the references that I used about the \npitches that were made by the industry to the children and the \nimportance they placed in having those children as their customer base.\n  And then in 1983 they say this tobacco company ``will not support a \nyouth smoking program which discourages young people from smoking.''\n  Well, I guess that is because they knew who their customers were. \nThey knew where their future profits would come from.\n  ``Strategies and Opportunities,'' a memorandum, 1984, from R.J. \nReynolds, and I quote:\n\n       Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the \n     growth and decline of every major brand and company over the \n     last 50 years. They will continue to be just as important to \n     brands [and] companies in the future for two simple reasons: \n     The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-\n     old smokers. No more than 5 percent of smokers start after \n     age 24. . . . Younger adult smokers are the only source of \n     replacement smokers. . . . If younger adults turn away from \n     smoking, the industry must decline, just as a population \n     which does not give birth will eventually dwindle.\n\n  Let me read again what the tobacco industry understood.\n\n       No more than 5 percent of the smokers start after the age \n     24.\n\n  If you don't get them when they are kids, you are not likely to get \nthem. If you don't addict someone in childhood to nicotine, you are not \nlikely to be able to addict them when they become adults.\n  In 1986, R.J. Reynolds--they were talking about their advertising for \nCamels:\n\n       [Camel advertising will create] the perception that Camel \n     smokers are non-conformist, self-confident, and [they] \n     project a cool attitude, which is admired by their peers. . . \n     . [They aspire] to be perceived as cool [and] a member of the \n     in-group is one of the strongest influences affecting the \n     behavior of [young adults].\n\n  It is pretty clear. And this is just a smidgeon of the evidence that \nhas come from the tobacco industry about what they have been doing over \nthe years to appeal to a customer base coming from our children.\n  Now, they have always insisted they have not been doing this. In \nfact, until a couple of years ago the CEOs of tobacco companies \ninsisted that nicotine was not addictive. Nicotine was not addictive. \nThey are the last Americans, apparently, to be willing to testify under \noath that nicotine was not addictive. But, of course, now most of them \nadmit they understand nicotine is addictive. And we raised the question \nin a piece of tobacco legislation whether this country wants to \ncontinue to countenance this behavior. Smoking is legal, but should we \nallow tobacco companies to target children to become addicted to \nnicotine? The answer clearly ought to be no, and the answer ought to be \ndelivered with some urgency on the floor of the Senate.\n  We have a tobacco bill that was brought to the floor of the Senate \nwhich had a number of very important goals, the most important of \nwhich, in my judgment, was to interrupt, intercept, and stop the \ntobacco industry from appealing to our children. Among other things, it \nwill raise the price of a pack of cigarettes. But what will happen as a \nresult of that price increase and the revenue that comes from it will \nbe a range of programs such as smoking cessation programs, so that \nthose who are now addicted to cigarettes and want to get off of that \naddiction will have the opportunity, the resources, and the wherewithal \nto do that.\n  Also, the bill had a prohibition on advertising directed at children \nand a prohibition on vending machines in areas that are available to \nchildren. The smoking cessation programs will be supplemented by \ncounteradvertising programs. Counteradvertising programs that tell \nAmerica's children that smoking does not make sense, smoking can injure \nyour health, smoking can cause death, smoking is a contributing factor \nto causing heart disease and cancer and more. Counteradvertising will \nbe very helpful, it seems to me, to warn kids away from cigarettes.\n  Additionally, the resources will be used to invest in the National \nInstitutes of Health where research occurs every single day to try to \nrespond to the health consequences of not just the addiction to \ncigarettes, but cancer and heart disease, and a range of other problems \nas well. I cannot think of anything that gives me more pride than to \ndecide that we are going to take substantial new resources and invest \nthem in the National Institutes of Health which will result in \nexciting, wonderful, and breathtaking new changes in health care and \nmedicines.\n\n  That is the subject for the Senate: Do we want to stop the tobacco \nindustry from trying to addict our children? Do we want to put together \nan approach that does all of these things, counteradvertising, smoking \ncessation, investment in the National Institutes of Health, and a whole \nrange of things? I think most people would say, absolutely, this \nlegislation makes a great deal of sense?\n  And so the bill comes to the floor of the Senate, and to describe the \npace in the Senate as a glacial pace is to describe a condition of \nspeeding. I mean, glacial doesn't begin to describe the pace of the \nSenate when we have a bunch of people who are determined to slow \nsomething down. Glaciers at least move forward by inches. You bring a \ntobacco bill to the floor of the Senate and then we have somebody who \nwants to speak for 46 hours on the Tax Code. Well, God love them, they \nhave every right under the rules of the Senate to talk about whatever \nthey want. We could talk about almost anything that anybody wants to \ncome and talk about on the floor of the Senate, and so today we are \ntalking about the marriage tax penalty.\n  The Tax Code is a fascinating subject, and if ever there was anything \nin need of reform it is America's Tax Code. It seems to me that there \nis a time and a place for us to work together in a thoughtful way to \nreform the Tax Code, to fix the marriage penalty, and to do a whole \nrange of other things that decrease its complexity, make the code much \nmore understandable, and much fairer. But I wonder if we ought not keep \nour eye on the ball this afternoon and see if we can't pass the tobacco \nbill, see if we can't do what this piece of legislation that we \ndesigned will do, and that includes the five or six steps I have just \ndescribed.\n  If one thinks they are unimportant, I suppose you can conceive of a \ndozen other things that you want to do to change the subject. We could \nhave a discussion, I suppose, this afternoon about the space station. \nGee, that is a controversial subject. You could have an amendment here \nand we could debate the space station for the next 4 or 5 hours. Or we \ncould have a discussion about the nutrition of canned soup\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\nfrom the grocery store shelves or our trade problems with Australia.\n  There is no end to the subjects if somebody wants to change the \nsubject. There is no end to the other things to ruminate about or talk \nabout if one doesn't like the subject of this bill, which is producing \na piece of legislation that deals with the tobacco issue the way I have \njust described it.\n  Let me go back to where I started. After having read the evidence and \ninformation that comes from the files of the tobacco industry, if \nanyone does not yet believe that these companies were targeting \nchildren because they knew the only opportunity for them to profit in \nthe future would be to get a customer base among young people, if \nanyone doesn't yet believe that, they are not prepared to believe \nanything about this subject.\n  The evidence is clear. It is not debatable. It is in black and white. \nThe industry didn't want to give it up. They were forced to. And this \ncountry now should make a decision: is this behavior tolerable or \nshould we stop it? I hope at every desk of this Senate when the roll is \ncalled and the Senator is named, I hope they would stand up and say \nthat we ought to stop it. No company in this country has the right to \ntry to attract a 14-year-old son or daughter in an American family to \nbecome addicted to tobacco. No company has that right. Tobacco is a \nlegal product for those age 21 or over. It ought not be right for any \ncompany to try to addict our children to tobacco.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not about the marriage tax \npenalty. It is not about the space program. It is not about Food for \nPeace. It is not about the Food Stamp Program. It is not about any of \nthat. It is about the tobacco issue.\n  I am as patient as anybody. I can be here 2 weeks from now and we can \nbe talking about new discoveries in the habits of earthworms or \nwhatever it is somebody wants to talk about 2 weeks from now.\n  But in the end, this Congress will have to deal with this bill. Are \nwe going to pass a tobacco bill? And to those who do not want to pass \nit, those who do not want to vote for it, I would say: Just give it \nyour best shot and then stand up and vote against it. If you don't like \nit, vote against it. But don't thwart the will of the American people \nto pass legislation that will stop the tobacco companies from addicting \nour children. Don't do that. You will be on the wrong side of history \non this question.\n  Ten years from now, 5 years from now, you will look back at that \nvote, you will look back at this debate, and you will have to ask \nyourself, if you vote the wrong way--How on Earth could I have been so \nout of step with common sense? How on Earth could I have been so out of \nstep with what this country needed to have done at that time?\n  I notice my colleague from North Dakota is on his feet, waiting \npatiently to speak. I have only 25 more minutes--I am, of course, only \nkidding. Senator Conrad from North Dakota has been a principal author \nof a piece of legislation that has become a part of the bill that is \nnow on the floor of the Senate. I mentioned the role that Senator \nMcCain and Senator Conrad and others have played. I think it has been \nvery important. I know there are people outside this Chamber who watch \nthis debate and whose teeth you can hear gritting a mile away, they are \nso upset about what is going on here. Tough luck. Just tough luck. \nTimes have changed.\n  With Senator Conrad's help and Senator McCain's help and the help of \nothers who have done, I think, remarkable work on this kind of \nlegislation, we will in the end--whether the opponents like it or not--\npass this tobacco bill. There will be enormous pressure on the House of \nRepresentatives to pass a similar piece of legislation. We will have a \nconference. I predict we will have a new law in this country before the \nend of this session of Congress that does something that we can be \nproud of and should be proud of on behalf of our children.\n  So as I yield the floor, let me compliment my colleague, Senator \nConrad, for the work he has done for so many months on this \nlegislation. And, as I do, let me also pay a compliment to the chairman \nof the committee on which I serve, Senator McCain, who similarly has \ndone some wonderful work on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nhis strong advocacy, because this is an important issue. It is an issue \nthat is going to affect the lives of the American people for years to \ncome. We all know the statistics--over 400,000 people a year die in \nthis country from tobacco-related illness. As we have held hearings all \nacross the country, we have heard from the people affected by those \ndeaths very moving testimony. I still remember very clearly in Newark, \nNJ, hearing from a coach, Pierce Frauenheim, a big, tough, strong guy \nwho is a football coach and assistant principal.\n  When he testified, you could barely hear him talk. He described how \nafter a lifetime of smoking he was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx, \nand he described to us the terror that he felt when the doctor told him \nthat his life was threatened and that the only hope for him was a \nlaryngectomy in which his larynx would be taken out. He went through \nthat procedure, and thank God it did save his life. But he is left now \nas somebody who can barely talk. You can barely hear him. He told us of \nhow much he hoped his message would influence others and that perhaps \nby his experience and his suffering others could avoid the fate that he \nhad experienced. How often we heard that story.\n  Most recently, when the task force met we heard from a former Winston \nman. He would go around to parties and events, representing Winston. \nNow he has lung cancer. He described to us what it is like to be under \na death threat.\n  And we heard from a woman who was a model for Lucky Strike, who has \nalso had a laryngectomy, and also had other forms of cancer. She was \nrequired by the terms of her contract to smoke. She took up the habit \nas a very young woman and now describes the pain and suffering she has \nexperienced.\n\n  So many of these witnesses have actually broken down and cried at our \nhearings, moved by the emotion of what they have experienced. I wish my \ncolleagues could have been there through every hour of what we heard, \nbecause I don't think there is a Member of this Chamber who could have \nremained unmoved. But we know the history of this industry.\n  We had a representative of the industry come and see me and tell me \nwe are unfairly vilifying this industry. I said to him, frankly, this \nindustry has done a great job of vilifying itself. They came before \nCongress. They said under oath their products didn't cause these \ndiseases. They said their products were not addictive. They said they \nhad not targeted kids. They said they had not manipulated nicotine \nlevels to foster addiction.\n  We now know each and every one of those statements was false. We do \nnot know it by somebody else's words, we know it by the industry's own \nwords, because we have now seen the documents. I have read hundreds of \npages of these documents that reveal how this industry testified \nfalsely, knowing full well what they were saying was untrue.\n  I was kind of struck by this cartoon by Herblock that was just in the \nWashington Post on May 27. The headline is, ``Have I Ever Lied To \nYou?'' It is a picture of the tobacco companies. This man in the fancy \nsuit has a button on saying ``tobacco companies.'' He is a \nrepresentative of the tobacco companies. Here is a person who is \nreading a tobacco industry ad and watching a tobacco message on taxes \non television, all with the headline, ``Have I Ever Lied To You?'' We \nknow the tobacco industry has lied to us. They have done it repeatedly. \nI regret to say they are doing it in this debate.\n  I would like to focus now on the question that is before us, the \namendment of the Senator from Texas, because during the budget debate \nthe Republicans on the Budget Committee repeatedly said: The tobacco \nfunds should go to Medicare and should not be used as a piggy bank for \nunrelated spending or tax priorities. That was the position they took \nin the Budget Committee.\n  The Senator from Texas serves on the Budget Committee. Now he is \nsponsoring an amendment that uses the\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nmoney substantially in a way that is at variance from what he said in \nthe Budget Committee. He said, and I quote:\n\n       The fundamental issue is going to be that we want to \n     dedicate the tobacco settlement to saving Medicare, and the \n     minority wants to spend the money on a myriad of programs, \n     many of which have absolutely nothing to do with the tobacco \n     settlement.\n\n  That is what the Senator from Texas said in the Budget Committee. He \nsaid all of the money ought to go to Medicare. Now we look at his \namendment--not a dime of the money goes to Medicare. My, what a change \na few months has made. We in the Budget Committee debated this issue \nfor an entire day, and over and over and over the Senator from Texas \nsaid: All of the money ought to go to save Medicare. Now he offered an \namendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate and guess what? There is not \none penny for Medicare. What happened? We were supposed to be using \nthis money, he said in the Budget Committee, to save Medicare. Now all \nof a sudden Medicare gets nothing.\n  Under the bill I introduced, Medicare got a chunk. We also gave a \nsubstantial chunk to the States because they are the ones that brought \nthe suits that are before us. We also used the money for health \nresearch and for public health care campaigns--countertobacco \nadvertising, smoking cessation, smoking prevention. Under the amendment \nof the Senator from Texas, not only is there no money left for \nMedicare, which he said all the money should go to just a few months \nago, but you know what? There is no money left for public health \nprograms--none--zero. This is a bill that is supposed to be protecting \nthe public health. There is no money left for public health and there \nis no money for Medicare, which just a few months ago he said was the \nabsolute priority.\n  This chart shows the effect of the Gramm amendment which really does \nturn the tobacco bill into a piggy bank for unrelated matters that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were decrying during the \nBudget Committee deliberations. Look what has happened here: 35 percent \nof the money, if we agree to the Gramm amendment, goes for an unrelated \ntax cut. We have the Coverdell amendment that takes 13 percent of the \nmoney, so now half the money is for matters that are unrelated to \ntobacco legislation--half the money.\n  There is no money for Medicare. Research will get 13 percent of the \nmoney. Veterans will get 4 percent. Farmers will get 9.8 percent. The \nStates, boy, they are going to be in for a big surprise. The States \nwere going to get 40 percent of the money. They are the ones who \nbrought the lawsuits. They were given 40 percent of the money because \nthat is the amount of the money they got in the settlement with the \ntobacco industry. If we adopt the Gramm amendment, they are going to \nget 24 percent of the money.\n  Tobacco control and public health gets zero. Medicare gets zero, \nwhich they argued in the Budget Committee hour after hour ought to get \nall the money and now gets no money. And public health gets no money--\nnothing for smoking cessation, nothing for smoking prevention, nothing \nfor countertobacco advertising.\n  I thought this was a public health bill. I thought that is what this \nwas about. Our friends on the other side said it was a bill to help \nsave Medicare. That is when we were in the Budget Committee. Now they \ncome up with nothing for Medicare, not a penny. What a difference a few \nmonths makes.\n  The Gramm amendment, in conjunction with the Coverdell amendment, \nwill spend tobacco money on programs that have nothing to do with the \ntobacco settlement.\n  Frankly, I am in favor of using some of the funds for drug control. I \nam in favor of using some of the money to address the marriage penalty. \nBut the way they have done it, there is nothing left for Medicare and \nthere is nothing left for public health. I just don't think that makes \nsense. I don't think that can stand the light of day. I don't think \nthat can stand scrutiny. I think our colleagues are going to have some \nexplaining to do if these amendments are adopted.\n  Every single public health expert has testified that if we are going \nto be serious about protecting the public health and reducing youth \nsmoking, then we have to have a program that is comprehensive in \nnature, and part of that has to be smoking prevention programs, smoking \ncessation programs to help those who are addicted get off the products, \nand we also need countertobacco advertising to warn people of the \ndangers of using these products, to warn them of the cancer risks, to \nwarn them of the risks to their heart, the risks of heart disease, the \nrisks of emphysema and the other diseases which cost so many people in \nour country their lives.\n  I can remember very well a young woman who came and testified at our \nhearing, again, in New Jersey, a young woman named Gina Seagrave. She \ntold about her mother who took up smoking at a young age and died at a \nvery young age from a smoking-related illness. This young woman broke \ndown and cried. She described to us the devastating effect this had on \nher whole family, because losing their mother really hurt the entire \nfamily. It hurt it very badly. She described what they had been through \nsince their mother had passed away.\n  In every town and in every State I have gone to, to listen to \nwitnesses, they have described to us the trauma that they have \nexperienced because of the addiction and disease caused by the use of \nthese products.\n  I grew up in a household where my grandparents raised me. My \ngrandfather was a smoker. It probably shortened his life. I think of \nall those families we have heard from who told us of what it meant to \nhave a father taken, a mother lost, a brother who died because of the \naddiction and disease caused by these products. This is the only legal \nproduct in America, when used as intended by the manufacturer, that \naddicts and kills its customers. Those are pretty harsh words, but it \nis the truth, and it is the reason we have a challenge and an \nopportunity. The challenge is to overcome the power of this industry \nthat wants nothing done. The opportunity is for us to act and to make a \ndifference in the lives of the people we represent.\n  The Senator from Texas talks a lot about this being a huge tax on \nlow-income Americans. He doesn't tell the other side of the story. The \nother side of the story is that there is a huge tax already being \nplaced on low-income Americans, and it is because of the use of these \nproducts. There is a massive shift that is going on in this country \nbecause of the costs of this industry.\n\n  Mr. President, $130 billion a year is the consensus calculation on \nwhat this industry costs Americans--$60 billion in health care costs, \n$60 billion in lost productivity, $10 billion in other costs. Nobody \ngets hurt worse by those facts than low-income Americans. Low-income \nworkers' payroll taxes are paying about $18 billion a year in Medicare \ncosts.\n  Our friends on the other side talked about that incessantly in the \nBudget Committee, that it is costing Medicare $18 billion a year and \nthat all of the money ought to go to protect Medicare. That was their \nargument in the Budget Committee. Now they come out here on the floor \nand offer an amendment that gives zero for Medicare. How do they \njustify that? What caused this dramatic transformation? What caused \nthis incredible change from being the defenders of Medicare to now not \ncaring about Medicare at all? I don't know what happened. It is amazing \nwhat occurs in this body, the inconsistency. One month, Medicare is the \npriority; in fact, it is the only priority. The next month, it matters \nnot at all. What a difference a few months makes.\n  The fact is, smoking is a huge tax on low-income Americans. The \naverage pack-a-day smoker will spend $25,000 on cigarettes over his or \nher lifetime. The average pack-a-day smoker is being affected in many \nways. Not only are they paying $25,000 for cigarettes, but they are \npaying $20,000 in medical costs over their lifetime--$25,000 for the \ncigarettes, $20,000 for medical costs. That is $45,000 tobacco use is \ncosting the average pack-a-day smoker. We talk about a heavy economic \nimpact on low-income folks; that is the heavy impact. It dwarfs \nanything that is being done here to counteract it.\n  Mr. President, the biggest tax cut we could give low-income Americans \nis to reduce that cost. The McCain bill will cut smoking by about one-\nthird. That will produce a savings of $1.6 trillion over the next 25 \nyears. That is the\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nsmart way of helping low-income Americans.\n  When we look at the Gramm proposal with respect to the so-called \nmarriage penalty, we see that he is not really just addressing the \nmarriage penalty. In fact, a lot of folks are benefited in the Tax Code \nby being married. Maybe we can put that next chart up that shows what I \nam talking about.\n  This is something we know with great certainty, because we can study \nmarried couples and we can see who would benefit by filing as single \nindividuals, who gets helped and who gets hurt by filing as a married \ncouple. What we find is, for adjusted gross incomes of under $20,000, \nthe significant majority of people get a bonus by filing as a married \ncouple. We see a very small group--those are in red--who are actually \npenalized. A little over 10 percent of couples with combined income \nunder $20,000 have a penalty by being married. The significant majority \nof people, almost two-thirds, receive a bonus by filing as a married \ncouple, those who have adjusted gross incomes of under $20,000.\n\n  If we go to AGIs--adjusted gross incomes--of $20,000 to $50,000, over \n50 percent benefit. They pay less filing as a married couple than they \nwould pay filing separately. About 40 percent have a marriage penalty.\n  From adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, more of those, as \na percentage, are penalized. About 50 percent have a marriage penalty; \nabout 40 percent have a marriage bonus.\n  That is also true of those with adjusted gross incomes of over \n$100,000. About 50 percent have a penalty; about 40 percent have a \nbonus.\n  Given this information, it is relatively easy to put together a \nremedy that delivers the relief directly to those who actually have a \nmarriage penalty. That is what the Democratic proposal does.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the approach of the Senator from Texas. He \nhas opted instead to take a scattershot approach that benefits equally \nthose who are helped and those who are hurt. The result is, those who \nare hurt get less help than they really deserve. That is why the \nDemocratic alternative is superior for those who really have a marriage \npenalty.\n  I believe that this is unfair. We ought to give those who actually \nexperience the marriage penalty the help they really need to overcome \nit. It does not make sense to me to give the help to those who are \nbenefited by being married in the same way that you help those who are \nbeing hurt. The result is, you do not give enough to those who are \nbeing hurt. That is not fair. I just do not know what sense it makes.\n  The Senator from Texas has told us on the floor that the average \nfamily would save about $1,400 in taxes under his proposal. Let us look \nat an example. A couple earning $25,000 is in the 15 percent tax \nbracket. Under the Gramm proposal, this couple would get a $3,300 \nabove-the-line deduction, but only when fully phased in. In actual tax \nsavings, this couple would realize 15 percent of that deduction, or \n$495. That is a far cry from the $1,400 advertised on the floor of the \nSenate. A couple earning $50,000, in the 28 percent bracket, would get \na savings of $924--again, a far cry from the $1,400 advertised here on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Bear in mind that those calculations are based on the $3,300 \ndeduction being fully phased in. The $25,000 couple waiting to realize \nits $495 savings is going to have to wait until the year 2008, because \nthat is when it is fully phased in. What they will get next year, under \nthe Gramm plan, is not the $1,400 that has been advertised, but $125. \nThat is what they are going to get next year, not $1,400; they are \ngoing to get $125. For the year 2002, that savings goes up to almost \n$150. Well, that is a whole lot less than $1,400. By 2007, the savings \nis up to $297.\n  So millions of families, who think of themselves as average hard-\nworking people, are going to be wondering where their $1,400 of savings \nare. The fact is, they are not going to see it, because it has been \noverstated here on the floor of the Senate what the savings actually \nwill be.\n  I am hard pressed to decide what is the worst feature of the \namendment of the Senator from Texas: The reckless reductions it will \nrequire in public health programs or the downright stinginess of the \nremedy it purports to deliver to couples who actually incur a marriage \npenalty.\n  If we are going to do something about the marriage penalty, we ought \nto focus the benefit on those who are being hurt. That would be dealing \nwith the marriage penalty. But to spread it around to people who are \nhelped and hurt by the marriage penalty denies those who are actually \npenalized from getting the help they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I think what we have before us is an important choice. \nThe Democratic alternative focuses its relief on those taxpayers who \nare actually being penalized. By contrast, the proposal offered by the \nSenator from Texas dilutes that relief to provide for couples paying a \nmarriage penalty as well as those who are actually receiving a marriage \nbonus.\n\n  You hear a lot of talk about the marriage penalty. We do not hear \nmuch talk about the marriage bonus. But the fact is, at many income \nlevels many more are being benefited by the marriage bonus than are \nbeing affected by the marriage penalty. Because the Democratic \nalternative is targeted to low- and moderate-income couples, we can \nmake their relief much greater. I think that makes sense for those who \nare actually experiencing a marriage penalty.\n  In addition, we can save money to use to promote the public health. \nAfter all, that is what this bill is supposed to be about. I must say, \nI have viewed with some concern the developments on the floor over the \nlast week, because now we have an amendment before us that, amazingly \nenough in a public health bill, provides no money for public health.\n  And after the arguments of our friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat were so strenuous in the Budget Committee--they said we had to \ntake every dime of this money and use it for Medicare--now we are about \nto vote for an amendment that does not give one dime to Medicare. What \na transformation. They have gone from 100 percent of the money going to \nprotect Medicare to none of the money going for Medicare. While they \nare at it, there is not going to be a dime of money to protect public \nhealth, either, in a public health bill.\n  Let us defeat the Gramm amendment and stay on course with a public \nhealth bill that addresses the real concerns and the real challenges \nfacing the American people.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I thought I would \njust go through what I call the top 10 tobacco ``tall tales'' that we \nhave heard from the tobacco industry during this debate.\n  Tall tale No. 1 was that tobacco has no ill-health effects. Remember \nthat? They came up to the Capitol, and they put up their hands, and \nthey swore under oath that these products did not cause ill-health \neffects. But then we got the documents. We got them because of court \naction. We got access to the documents, and we found out, in the \nindustry's own words, what the truth is.\n  Here is the truth on that claim that tobacco has no ill-health \neffects:\n\n       Boy! Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to \n     produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the \n     competition.\n\n  This is from a mid-1950s Hill & Knowlton memo quoting an unnamed \ntobacco company research director.\n  That is tall tale No. 1.\n  Tall tale No. 2 is, again, tobacco has no ill-health effects. Again, \nwe have an industry document that reveals the falsity of that claim. \nThis is from a 1978 Brown & Williamson document that says: ``Very few \ncustomers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive \nnature and that nicotine is a poison.''\n  Again, that is not from the public health community. That is from the \ntobacco industry's own documents.\n  Tall tale No. 3: Nicotine is not addictive.\n  The truth, from a 1972 research planning memo by RJR Tobacco: \n``Happily\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nfor the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in \nits variety of physiological actions.''\n  This industry, I tell you, these guys come up here, they don't come \nwith a lot of credibility because they have told a lot of tall tales.\n  Tall tale No. 4, again, the claim that nicotine is not addictive.\n  This is from a 1992 memo from the director of portfolio management \nfor Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business: ``Different people smoke \ncigarettes for different reasons. But, the primary reason is to deliver \nnicotine into their bodies . . . similar organic chemicals include \nnicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine.''\n  Now, again, this is the industry--their documents--revealing what \nthey know and what they think of their own products. They say it is not \naddictive and yet they say it is the same as cocaine, the same as \nmorphine, the same as atropine.\n  Tall tale No. 5: The tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine \nlevels.\n  The truth, again, from an industry document, a 1991 RJR report: ``We \nare basically in the nicotine business . . . effective control of \nnicotine in our products should equate to a significant product \nperformance and cost advantage.''\n  Tall tale No. 6: Tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine \nlevels.\n  This is from a 1984 British-American Tobacco memo: ``Irrespective of \nthe ethics involved,''--that is an interesting statement--\n``Irrespective of the ethics involved, we should develop alternative \ndesigns which will allow the smoker to obtain significant enhanced \ndeliveries [of nicotine] should he so wish.''\n  They have been manipulating nicotine levels for a long time.\n  Tall tale No. 7: Tobacco companies don't market to children.\n  This is from a 1978 memo from a Lorillard Tobacco executive: ``The \nbase of our business are high school students.''\n  They didn't market to kids? They didn't target kids? Here you have a \nmajor tobacco company executive saying the major business is high \nschool kids, the same kids tobacco companies don't market to--children.\n  This is from a 1976 RJR research department forecast: ``Evidence is \nnow available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old age group is an \nincreasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a \nsuccessful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is \nto be maintained over the long term.''\n  Well, I don't know how it can be more clear.\n  Tall tale No. 9: Tobacco companies don't market to children.\n  This is from a 1975 report from a Philip Morris researcher: \n``Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable \nin large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . \n15 to 19 years old . . . my own data . . . shows an even higher \nMarlboro market penetration among 15-17-year-olds.''\n  You wonder what they thought when they went home at night.\n  Tall tale number 10, again, the claim tobacco companies don't market \nto children.\n  This is from ``apparently problematic research,'' a Brown & \nWilliamson document:\n  ``The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting, their \nbrand preferences, as well as the starting behavior of children as \nyoung as 5 years old . . . the studies examined . . . young smokers' \nattitudes toward addiction and contain multiple references to how very \nyoung smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, only to \nlater discover, to their regret, that they are.''\n\n  That kind of sums it up. That is the issue before the Senate. Are we \nhere to protect kids or are we here to protect the bottom line of the \ntobacco industry?\n  The Wall Street analysts that came before my task force indicated \nthat, indeed, if this legislation were passed, it would reduce the \nprofits of the industry, but not dramatically. In fact, the industry \nwould still enjoy very, very high profit levels. Remember, this \nindustry has a profit margin that is three times the profit margin of \nmost companies that are in packaged good industries in America. They \nhave a profit margin of 30 percent. Other package goods average a \nprofit margin of 10 percent. They would still enjoy dramatic profits, \neven if we passed this legislation according to the analysis of the \npeople who should know best, the Wall Street analysts that report on \nthis industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  With this amendment we are debating today, which is a critical \namendment, we will bring the last significant aspect of our Federal Tax \nCode that is of particular concern to Idahoans, and I think really all \nAmericans, and that is the marriage tax penalty.\n  I ask myself one fundamental question before I make up my mind on any \nissue we deal with on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is, Does this \npolicy make sense for the American people?\n  Let's apply this question to our current Federal Tax Code which, \nquite simply, penalizes a working couple for getting married. Should \nfolks pay more tax because they are married? Absolutely not.\n  The marriage tax penalty raises revenue for the government--no \nquestion about that. It raises revenue. But it is bad public policy. It \nmost often raises taxes on lower and middle-income families who claim \nthe standard deduction. Now, that is wrong. We must strengthen the \nbonds of family to strengthen the fabric of our society. If we believe \nin family, we believe in marriage. So why in the world do we have a \npublic policy on the books that somehow creates a penalty for being \nmarried? That is totally counterproductive to our values of this \nsociety, of this Nation.\n  Before 1969, marriages were treated by the Federal Tax Code like \npartnerships, allowing husbands and wives to split their income evenly. \nIn 1969, however, this practice of income splitting was ended, and thus \nwas created the marriage tax penalty.\n  Since that time, with our Nation's progressive tax rates, tax laws \nhave meant that working married couples are forced, forced to pay \nsignificantly more money in taxes than they would if they were both \nsingle. Currently, 42 percent of married couples suffer because of the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  Let me provide an example. A single person earning $24,000 per year \nis taxed at a 15 percent rate. Now, if two people, each earning \n$24,000, get married, however, the IRS, by taxing them on their \ncombined income, taxes them in the 28 percent bracket, not the 15 \npercent that they would be taxed as individuals, but 28 percent because \nthey have joined in holy matrimony.\n  It is also important to be aware that the marriage tax penalty hits \nthe American people not only at the Federal level but also on their \nState taxes. Idaho generally conforms its State tax code to the Federal \nlaw. If the Federal Government alters its standard deduction levels, \nfor instance, Idaho most likely will as well. While the focus of ending \nthe marriage tax penalty has been primarily at the Federal level, we \ncannot discount the fact that this is, in essence, a double hit for \nworking American couples who are trying to fulfill what this country \nbelieves in.\n  I think that we can all agree that the Federal Government should not \nbe penalizing marriages, a sacrosanct institution and the bedrock of \nour social structure. It is time for the Federal Government to end this \ninjustice to the American family.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm. I commend him for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, just to reiterate, we think about this society and we \nthink about all the problems and challenges that are facing America \ntoday. Senator Frist of Tennessee was chairman of a task force on \neducation in America. He pointed out many of the statistics, many of \nthe problems that we are having with regard to our children. He pointed \nout how many of these children, more and more, are coming from families \nwhere there is not both a father and a mother. That is a significant \nproblem--a significant problem.\n  How do we respond with public policy? Well, if you are married, there \nwill be a penalty. I happen to be the chairman of the Military \nPersonnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. We are starting \nto have problems with recruitment of young people\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\nto the military services. We need 176,000 young people every year to \njoin the military--the finest military in the world. At one of the \nhearings, I asked the generals and admirals testifying this: ``Tell me, \nis there something about this issue of values that we are hearing \nabout?'' And they said: ``Yes, there is; there is very much a problem \nwith values among all people.'' In fact, all branches of the military \nservices have now added 1 week to the basic training to try to somehow \ninstill in them core values--knowing right from wrong. A three-star \ngeneral of the Marine Corps said, ``We now have a new category of young \nperson; we just call them `evil,' and there is nothing we can do with \nthem.''\n  As the occupant of the Chair knows, it used to be that if you had a \ntroubled youth, in all likelihood if you could send them off to the \nmilitary, they would be straightened out. That is not the case anymore. \nI mention these challenges because it comes back. Do any of us believe \nthat 1 week of basic training with 17- and 18-year-olds is somehow \ngoing to instill in them the values they should have learned many, many \nyears ago, that they should have been raised upon, knowing right from \nwrong? That comes from a family environment, a family environment where \na mother and father are there, where mother and father will tuck the \nchild into bed, where mother and father will listen to their prayers--a \nmother and father, a married couple.\n  Yet, we have public policy on the books today that penalizes married \ncouples. That is wrong; that is flawed public policy. It is time that \nthis Nation correct that. That is why I am proud to stand in support of \nthis amendment that will correct this. It is a clear signal, a loud \nsignal, that we are going to reclaim this society and the fabric of \nthis society by affirming that marriage is positive; we will not \npenalize those who choose to go into marriage.\n  So, again, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment by the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to some comments. I was \nover in a conference on the IRS reform bill when several of our \ncolleagues came over to comment on the pending amendment. I want to try \nto address briefly some of the issues that they raised.\n  Let me begin by trying to delineate between the marriage penalty that \nis pending in the amendment before us and some of the alternatives that \nappear to be supported by opponents of this amendment.\n  The principal feature of the amendment before us is an effort to give \nback roughly a third of the money that is collected in the cigarette \ntax embodied in the bill before us. A tax that is very regressive in \nits impact. As I noted earlier, 59.1 percent of the taxes are collected \nfrom people who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  This amendment gives a rebate to moderate-income Americans, who will \nbe devastated by this bill which will raise the tax by $1,015 per year, \nfor the average smoker who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. If the \nobjective of the tax is to discourage smoking, if we hope to get a 50-\npercent reduction in smoking among teenagers as a result of raising the \ntax, if the objective is to discourage smoking and not to take money \naway from blue-collar workers to give to Government to spend, then the \nlogic of the amendment that is now pending is that we should take \nroughly a third of the money we collect and give it back to people and \nfamilies who make less than $50,000 a year by repealing the marriage \npenalty.\n  Some of our colleagues have come to the floor with very pretty charts \nwith my name on them. I appreciate the free advertising. I hope my \nmother saw them. They were beautiful charts. But they refer to \nsomething called a marriage bonus, and I think what is happening is \nthis whole debate is getting skewed by people who do not want to focus \non the issue. So let me explain what we are doing. Then I want to say a \nlittle bit about this marriage bonus, and then talk about why doing the \nmarriage penalty in the way that is being suggested by the minority \nwill discriminate against stay-at-home parents.\n  First of all, under the current Tax Code there are 31 million \nfamilies that end up paying an average of $1,400 a year more in income \ntaxes because they fall in love and get married than they would pay if \nthey stayed single. I think it is a uniform position in the country as \na whole and in the Senate in particular that it cannot be prudent tax \npolicy, even in the economy of the greatest nation in the history of \nthe world, to have a tax policy that discourages people that fall in \nlove from getting married.\n  I think our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree with \nthe premise that the family has been the most powerful institution in \nthe history of mankind in terms of promoting progress and happiness. \nThose are two important things. So what I am trying to do in this \namendment is to repeal that marriage penalty so we do not discourage \npeople who fall in love from getting married and forming families and \nachieving the stability and the happiness and the fulfillment that \ncomes from being married.\n  Now, I think there is a general view that we should do that. Not \neverybody wants to pay for it. Not everybody supports the fact that I \nam taking a third of the money from this bill which was going to things \nlike paying lawyers $92,000 an hour, or paying farmers $23,000 an acre \nwhen they do not have to give up the land and do not have to stop \nfarming tobacco, or paying $18,615.55 for smoker cessation programs for \nevery Native American who smokes. They would rather spend the money on \nthose things than to correct the marriage penalty. But I do not think \nphilosophically anybody objects to the thesis that a tax policy that \ndiscriminates against marriage is counterproductive, in this Nation or \nany other nation.\n  Now, there are two issues that have been raised by opponents. One \nissue has been that we could do it cheaper if we excluded couples where \none of the parents does not work outside the home. That is, if we only \ngave the marriage penalty correction to those couples that make roughly \nthe same income.\n  Now, when we put our amendment together, we looked at that. We \nthought about it for about a microsecond, and we rejected it because if \nyou do it the way the minority wants to do it, you end up giving a tax \nbreak only to those couples where both have roughly equal incomes. But \nfor families that make a decision to sacrifice so that one of them can \nstay home and work in the home, which is real work, maybe the most \nimportant work on the planet, for those who choose to do that they \nwould be discriminated against by the provision that the minority is \nproposing to offer.\n  Under our amendment, you get $3,300 of deductions whether or not both \nparents work outside the home.\n  Now, why did we do that? We did it because we do not believe the tax \npolicy of the country should discriminate against people based on \nwhether or not they both work outside the home. And let me make it \nclear. I am not trying to tilt the Tax Code one direction or the other. \nMy mother worked all my life because she had to work. My wife has \nworked all our children's lives because she wanted to work. And I am \nnot making a judgment about whether it is better for both parents to \nwork or one parent to stay at home. I think that is something each \nfamily has to make a decision on based on what they want for \nthemselves, their children and what they can afford. But the point I \nwant people to understand is that the amendment that is before us \ntreats couples exactly the same whether they both work outside of the \nhome or whether one works outside the home and one stays home to be a \nhomemaker, to raise the children. I do not believe the Tax Code should \ndiscriminate against people based on the decision they make about \nwhether to work inside or outside the home.\n\n  The way we have written the bill we do not discriminate. You get the \nbenefit if both parents work and you get the benefit if only one parent \nworks because we give a $3,300 tax deduction.\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\nWe do it above the line so you get to deduct it before you calculate \nwhat your taxable income is.\n  So that very modest-income people who get an earned tax credit, but \nwho still work, can still take the credit. For example: a lady who is \nwashing dishes and a man who is a janitor are both working. They are \ntrying to get ahead, they are trying to be self-sufficient, they both \nget an earned-income tax credit, and they each have two children. They \nmeet and say, ``I have found the solution; I am going to form a \nfamily.'' They find if they get married, they lose the earned-income \ntax credit and they suffer a substantial decline in income. So they \ndecide not to get married.\n  Well, one of the things we wanted to do in our amendment was to \nassure that we made this adjustment so that people at very low-income \nlevels who in many cases are penalized most by the marriage penalty \nwould get the relief. That is why we did our amendment the way we did, \nand it does cost more to do it that way. But if you do not do it that \nway, you discriminate against families where one parent stays at home \nand works at home, and you discriminate against very low-income people \nwho are working and often working two or more jobs, but are still \ngetting some assistance in the earned-income tax credit.\n  I think when our colleagues criticize this they do not really \nunderstand that what they are saying is if you stay home and raise your \nchildren, you should be discriminated against. I think when people \nunderstand the distinction they are not going to be for doing it their \nway.\n  The second issue I wanted to address because it did come up while I \nwas gone is the so-called misnomer of a marriage bonus. If there has \never been a fraudulent concept in the history of American taxation, it \nis the so-called marriage bonus.\n  Now, let me define this marriage bonus. You have a guy named John, \nand he has a job, and he is out working. He is a sales representative, \nand he is traveling all over the country selling school supplies. And \nyou have a girl named Josephine, a young lady who is graduating from \nhigh school. Now, she graduates from high school and then the next day \nshe and John walk down the aisle and get married.\n  What the minority is calling a tax bonus is that Josephine's father \nwas taking a dependent exemption because he was supporting Josephine \nwhile she was living in the family home, going to school. He was paying \nher expenses, and he got to write off on his income taxes every year or \ndeduct $2,700.\n  Now, what is being called a marriage bonus is that by marrying \nJosephine and forming this family, before Josephine goes out next year \nand gets a job herself, John is going to be able to write off $2,700 in \na dependent exemption. He is also going to be able to raise his \nstandard deduction, because he is married, by $2,850. So that he is \ngoing to get a deduction by marrying Josephine of $5,550.\n  I want to pose this question to our colleagues who think that is such \na terrible thing and that anybody who is getting that should not get \nthe benefit of eliminating the marriage penalty. How many fathers go to \nthe wedding and when they get to the point where they say, ``Is there \nanybody here who objects?'' Bill, Josephine's father, stands up and \nsays, ``Wait a minute, I object to this marriage, because if Josephine \ngets married, I'm going to lose $2,700 of deductions and, as a result, \nit is a bad deal for me''? I never heard of that happening.\n  How many people rush out to get married because, by marrying someone \nwith no income, you get $5,550 of deductions? That is not that much \nless in taxes; that is just the amount you get to deduct. Does anybody \nbelieve that you can feed, clothe, and house a spouse for $5,550?\n  But to listen to our colleagues talk, you get the idea that this is \nsome big bonus, that this is some unfair provision in the Tax Code, \nbecause by John marrying Josephine and forming a couple and filing \njointly, his deductions go up by $5,500, and that is a ``marriage \nbonus.'' Some bonus. Does anybody believe that John can pay for having \na wife for $5,550? No. It is not a bonus; it is simply the way the Tax \nCode works.\n  Why should we give more protection to family income? This chart \nreally tells the whole story. This chart shows 1950 and 1996, the last \nyear when we have complete data on how much of the income of average-\nincome working families with two children was shielded from Federal \nincome taxes by personal exemptions and by the standard deduction. \nBasically, what this chart shows is that in 1950 the personal exemption \nand the standard deduction for a family of four making the average \nincome in the country shielded 75.3 percent of their income from any \nFederal taxes. In fact, in 1950 the average family with two children \nwas sending $1 out of every $50 it earned to Washington, DC; $1 out of \nevery $50. Because of inflation not keeping up with the rise in real \nincome and because the standard deduction and personal exemption didn't \nkeep up with inflation, today they shield only 32.8 percent of the \nincome of the average family of four. So, whereas in 1950 the average \nfamily making the average income, with two children, was sending $1 out \nof every $50 it earned to Washington, today the average family with two \nchildren is sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to Washington, DC.\n  Under these circumstances, is it obvious that one of the things we \nneed to do is to shield more family income from Federal taxes? That is \nwhat this amendment is about. In 1950, rich people paid a lot of taxes. \nToday, rich people pay a lot of taxes. In 1950, poor people paid no \nincome taxes. And in 1996, poor people pay no income taxes.\n  How did the tax take double? How did taxes, as a percentage of the \neconomy, double the Federal level between 1950 and 1996? It doubled by \nraising the burden on families with children from $1 out of every $50 \nto $1 out of every $4. So, under these circumstances, it makes \nperfectly good sense to me that we would want to do something to help \nworking families shield more of their income and, in doing so, end the \nstarvation of the one institution in America that works, and that is \nthe family. We are feeding Government, and we are starving families.\n  What the amendment I have offered, with Senator Domenici and Senator \nRoth, tries to do is to give some of this money that is being taken \nfrom working families in this confiscatory excise tax back to working \nfamilies. So while raising the price of tobacco products and hopefully \ndiscouraging people from using it, we do not impoverish people who are, \nin this case, the victims by having become addicted to tobacco \nproducts.\n  That is what this debate is about. So I hope people do not get \nconfused about this silly business about a marriage bonus. The idea \nthat somehow you are getting a bonus when you take a spouse, by the \nfact that your tax deductions go up by $5,500 ridiculous. Nobody ever \ngot married thinking that they were going to benefit with a $5,500 is \ndeduction when they have to pay for the expenses of their spouse. That \nis not a bonus. In fact, that is inadequate. That is outrageous. It \nought to be higher.\n  Finally, to suggest that we want to fix the marriage penalty but only \nif both parents work is ludicrous. I want to fix the marriage penalty, \nbut I don't want to tilt the Tax Code against families where one parent \ndecides to stay at home. That is really what the debate is about.\n  I hope reason will prevail here. Sometimes it does; sometimes it \ndoesn't. But, I hope it will in this case. And I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I oppose the Gramm amendment. It is \nan attempt to distract the Senate's attention from what should be the \nfocus of our attention. It is a thinly veiled ploy to kill this bill, \nthe only vehicle this body has had to address the epidemic of teen \nsmoking and the disastrous effects on the health and well-being of \ngenerations of Americans who were lured into smoking by tobacco \ncompanies.\n  This amendment has no place as a part of this bill, and because of \nthe way it is financed, it has no place in any bill. I strongly agree \nwe ought to face the marriage penalty issue as soon as possible, and I \nalso would like to accelerate full deduction of health insurance \nexpenses for the self-employed. I do not think, however, that we can \naddress these issues by adding to one of the greatest problems facing \nour country's future economy--the solvency of the Social Security \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n  Just two months ago, this body agreed that the budget surplus should \nbe reserved for reforming our Social Security System. It was a wise \ndecision, for no one can honestly deny that the Social Security Trust \nFund faces long-term problems. Based on information from the 1998 \nSocial Security Trustees' report, it appears that, by the year 2013, \nSocial Security benefit payments will begin to exceed the payments into \nthe Social Security Trust Fund from employers and employees. By the \nyear 2032, the Trust Fund will have used up its accumulated surpluses \nand will be unable to fully meet its obligations to American retirees. \nIn order to guarantee the viability of the Trust Fund for our children \nand grandchildren, we must focus on its long-term future and begin the \nprocess of making necessary changes.\n  Workers, the very workers that Senator Gramm seeks to help under his \namendment, pay into the Trust Fund all their lives and expect--\nrightfully so, I might add--Social Security to be there for them when \nthey retire.\n  Because Congress has not yet acted to preserve the long-term \nviability of Social Security, I cannot support any proposal that would \nexacerbate the financial difficulties facing the Social Security Trust \nFund. This amendment, however, will do exactly that. I cannot, in good \nconscience, vote for this amendment.\n  I want to be clear that I am extremely troubled that some married \ncouples are being taxed at a higher rate than they would be if they \nwere single filers. I find it appalling that 20.9 million couples, some \n42% of all American couples paid penalties totaling $28.8 billion just \nlast year alone. Senator Gramm's right--we ought to fix this problem. \nBut it is wrong to do it at the expense of further damaging a \nretirement security component that is so vital to the American people.\n  Fortunately, we have another option. The Democratic alternative would \naddress the marriage penalty problem without further endangering Social \nSecurity. This alternative targets more tax relief directly to the \ncouples who are actually penalized by the tax code. The Gramm \namendment, on the other hand, would not only provide less relief to the \n42% of couples who currently pay a penalty, but would also provide a \nwindfall to the 51% of married couples who currently receive a bonus \n(on average of $1,380 per couple) under our tax code. In addition, the \nDemocratic alternative addresses the need to accelerate the health \ninsurance deduction for the self employed in an manner that is sensible \nand sound.\n  Overall, the Democratic alternative is a more thorough, more \ntargeted, and more sound proposal, and in any event, it is better tax \npolicy.\n  I do not believe that it is wise to try to solve one problem by \ncreating another, and I believe that the Democratic alternative avoids \nthat pitfall, whereas the Gramm amendment does not. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote against the Gramm amendment, and for the Democratic \nalternative.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, anyone who has been listening to this \ndebate on the Senate floor in the last few weeks is now familiar with \nthe painful but very real statistics. Each day, 3,000 young Americans \nbegin smoking and eventually 1,000 will die. I can think of no issue on \nthe floor of this Congress which could more directly affect the lives \nof Americans for a generation to come to finally deal with the reality \nof tobacco and its assorted dangers.\n  Legislation offered by Senator McCain, which I enthusiastically \nsupport, makes a contribution in several important ways to dealing with \nthis problem: First, it requires a warning label and restricts \nadvertising designed to attract children to smoking cigarettes; second, \nit grants broad authority to the Federal Drug and Food Administration \nto regulate tobacco products, their advertising, and their \ndistribution; third, it establishes a national tobacco trust fund for \nsmoke cessation programs, health research, and compensation for States \nand farmers as a result of tobacco smoking and the program; and, \nfinally, it also penalizes companies up to $3.5 billion per year if \nthey fail to meet their targets to reduce youth smoking.\n  There is, however, a less addressed but equally significant impact of \nthis legislation that also needs to be addressed. It has been raised by \nthe Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and now by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Daschle, that there are unintended tax \nconsequences of this legislation. I am relieved that my colleagues \njoined in the judgment not to raise the tobacco tax to $1.50 per pack \nbut cast their votes, as I did, to keep this tax $1.10. It is, \nnevertheless, the reality that this taxation upon cigarettes could be \nthe most regressive tax ever passed in American history. This tax \nburden is falling disproportionately on the working poor and, indeed, \non poor families themselves.\n  It has been noted that the total tax burden of families who earn \nunder $10,000 a year would increase by 40 percent as a result of this \ntobacco tax. Indeed, three-quarters of the tax would be paid by \nfamilies who earn under $50,000 per year. This would add a tax burden \nto an American population that is already excessively taxed.\n  I understand that it is President Clinton's priority that a new \nFederal surplus be used primarily to deal with the future obligations \nof Social Security. I support him in that initiative, as I believe \nthere are important initiatives of education and health care that are \nunaddressed in our country. But the tobacco legislation brings into \nfocus another reality: The average American family is still paying too \nmuch taxation. Indeed, the CBO reports that taxes on the American \npublic have recently reached 20 percent of the gross domestic product. \nNot since the Second World War has the total tax burden on the American \npeople, as a percentage of our economy, been so high. According to the \nJoint Committee on Tax, Americans earning $30,000 and less will pay 59 \npercent of this new tobacco tax, which is being added on this already \nheavy burden.\n  The answer of the Senator from Texas is to primarily deal with this \nnew burden by dealing with what is known as the marriage penalty. \nIndeed, in 1996, 21 million couples encountered an average penalty \nbecause of their joint filings as a result of their marriage of $1,400. \nThat represents 42 percent of the American people--married couples--are \npaying more as a consequence of their marriage.\n\n  A proposal by Senator Gramm combines a phase-in of tax relief for the \nmarriage penalty, with tax credits for the self-employed to purchase \nhealth insurance, for costs of upwards of $16 billion during the first \n5 years, and $30 billion in years 6 through 10.\n  Responding to criticism that earlier versions of his amendment would \nhave completely drained the public health funds in this bill, Senator \nGramm now proposes to limit the use of the tobacco trust fund from one-\nhalf to one-third of the revenues in the outyears for dealing with this \nelimination of the marriage penalty. He does so, however, by using the \ngeneral revenues of the Federal Government. The consequences of using \nthese general revenues for the admittedly important objective of \neliminating the marriage penalty is that it contradicts President \nClinton's goal of first using Federal surpluses to deal with Social \nSecurity.\n  Indeed, on a bipartisan basis, I could not understand and it would be \ndifficult to accept that this Congress would not want to first deal \nwith ensuring the financial safety of Social Security before dealing \nwith other admittedly important tax objectives. Specifically, the Gramm \namendment potentially would remove $90 to $125 billion worth of Federal \nrevenues that the President has designed to deal with the future \nsecurity of Social Security, specifically for the baby boom generation.\n  I think Senator Daschle has a better idea. He offers an alternative \nwhich allows this Congress to remain focused on securing Social \nSecurity for the next generation while dealing with this admittedly \nhigh tax burden and the unintended consequence of regressivity of the \ntobacco tax.\n  First, Senator Daschle would ease the tax burden on American families\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nby providing full deductibility for health insurance premiums for the \nself-employed. No issue could be more important for people starting \ntheir own businesses, for middle-income families, than dealing with \nthis full deductibility of health insurance.\n  Second, it maintains the integrity of the tobacco bill and still \nprotects Social Security. So the programs now envisioned in the tobacco \nbill would remain--dealing with public health, tobacco farmers, \nreimbursement to the States--while at the same time allowing us to \nprovide this tax relief.\n  The difference, of course, between Senator Daschle's proposal and \nSenator Gramm's proposal is that Senator Gramm did not simply deal with \nthe marriage penalty--because only 40 percent of all married couples \nare paying a marriage penalty, he was providing tax relief beyond this \nand thereby causing this financial strain. The alternative offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, deals simply with those \nfamilies who are actually paying the marriage penalty and thereby \nallows us to do so in a more responsible fashion.\n  This, I believe, is the better alternative, but I hope the Senate \ndoes not simply deal this year with the question of the tax burden on \nthe American people by only addressing the question of the marriage tax \npenalty. That will suffice for the tobacco legislation. I hope and I \ntrust by the time the Senate is finished dealing with tobacco \nlegislation that we have dealt with deductibility for the self-employed \nof their health insurance and the elimination of the marriage penalty.\n  Before yielding the floor, I hope that the Senate would follow the \ndebate that has now begun as a consequence of the important analysis \noffered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, on both the overall \nnational tax burden and its regressivity by dealing with other tax \nissues in the remainder of this session.\n  First, if not in this legislation, then before this session adjourns, \nthe Senate should deal with the fact that there are too many Americans \nof modest means who are finding themselves in the highest tax bracket. \nToday, a single individual is paying a 28 percent Federal income tax \nwith a salary of $25,300, and a married couple with only $42,350 in \nincome is paying a Federal tax of 28 percent in income taxes. \nTherefore, we are applying the highest rate to people of genuinely \nmodest means.\n  I believe we would make a real contribution to tax fairness in the \nSenate in this year if the 15 percent bracket could be expanded to \n$35,000 for individuals and $70,000 for married couples. This would \nmove more than 10 million Americans from the 28 percent tax bracket to \nthe 15 percent tax bracket and genuinely ensure that middle-income \npeople are able to take advantage of a lower 15 percent bracket. No \nsingle proposal would grant tax relief on a broader, more comprehensive \nbasis to middle-income Americans.\n  Second, before this Congress adjourns this year, I hope the Congress \nwill return to the issue of capital gains simplification. I have joined \nwith Senator Mack and Senator Breaux to encourage that savings and \ninvestment income be restored to a 12-month holding period in order to \navail ourselves of the lower capital gains tax rate that was instituted \nby this Congress on an earlier date.\n  Third, return again to the issue of estate taxes by building on the \n$1 million exemption from the estate tax in last year's tax bill by \nslashing the estate tax rate by 25 percent. We made real progress last \nyear by raising the exemption to a $1 million, but the Federal tax rate \nand the State tax remain confiscatory at an unbelievable 55 percent.\n  Fourth, and finally, I hope this Congress, before concluding its work \nthis year on the Federal Tax Code, will return to the incredibly poor \nsavings rates in this Nation. The United States now suffers from the \nlowest savings rate in nearly 60 years. I believe this Senate should \nexempt the first $500 in interest from taxation, ensuring that any \nfamily in America that saves $10,000, whether in equity or bonds or \nsavings accounts, would not pay taxes on that first $10,000. Nothing \nwould do more for Americans to prepare for their own retirement, to \nprovide security for American families, than transforming every $10,000 \nin savings in America by every family instantly into a tax-free \naccount. This could be done simply by exempting the first $500 in \ninterest. For those 60 percent of American families that have no \nequity, no savings other than their house, and live in the dangerous \nposition of paycheck-to-paycheck, this, for the first time, would \nprovide a real incentive for those families to save money.\n  Mr. President, my purpose today primarily was to draw attention to \nthe worthwhile objective of providing some tax relief in the tobacco \nlegislation for those families, primarily of low and moderate means, \nwho will disproportionately be shouldering this burden of increased \ntobacco taxes. But I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity both \nto demonstrate the relative advantage of Senator Daschle's proposal, to \nprovide this tax relief within the tobacco bill, thereby not \njeopardizing the revenues available to deal with providing some safety \nfor Social Security, but also to point out to the Senate that, beyond \ndealing with the tax burden of families because of the tobacco \nlegislation and thereby providing relief in the marriage penalty and \nthe self-employment full deductibility on health insurance, the Senate \nshould be setting its sights on other areas as well in the remainder of \nthis year--an encouragement in savings, general income tax relief for \nmiddle-income families, and on the inheritance tax. The Senate has a \nlarger obligation of easing the tax burden, and I believe the debate \nthat has begun in the Senate has begun to outline the possible \ncomponents, beyond the tobacco legislation, of broader tax relief for \nthe American families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to explain this particular \namendment because I believe it is very important that everyone \nunderstand the juxtaposition of the Democratic amendment and the so-\ncalled Gramm amendment.\n  A vote for the Gramm amendment was a vote either to take about $120 \nbillion of budget surpluses away from our effort to shore up Social \nSecurity or to drain 80 percent of the money out of the tobacco trust \nfund, money that would otherwise be going to States' antismoking \nefforts, medical research and farmers. That is the choice presented by \nthe Gramm amendment from 2008 through 2022.\n  That was the problem we had with the Gramm amendment. In the out \nyears, after 2008, it either took so much money out of Social Security \nand out of the surplus, or it took 80 percent of the tobacco money. We \nwere not satisfied with this choice. We were not supportive of, first, \nthe overall amount of money to be taken, and, secondly, the pots from \nwhich it was to be taken.\n  That is only the first problem--where the money to fund the tax cut \nwould be drawn from in the out years. The second problem is that, in \nthe first ten years, the revised amendment costs 50 percent more than \nthe Democratic alternative; that is, $46 billion versus about $31 \nbillion. But, here is the catch: it actually delivers far less marriage \npenalty tax relief. So while it costs more, it does far less with \nregard to the marriage penalty itself. The reason for that is about 60 \npercent of the Republican tax cut goes to couples who have a marriage \nbonus in the sense that they pay less if they are married than if they \nfiled single returns.\n  Keep in mind that today about 52 percent of those who are married get \na marriage bonus. There is actually an incentive built into the Tax \nCode to be married. The other 48 percent incur a marriage penalty. \nSixty percent of the Gramm amendment goes to those who have a marriage \nbonus. So, in addition to the current marriage bonus, they will get a \nGramm bonus. In our view, given the fact that this additional bonus \ncosts so much and comes from either Social Security or tobacco, the \nadditional Gramm bonus does not make a lot of sense.\n  The Democratic alternative, by contrast, focuses about 90 percent of \nits tax cut on families who are actually penalized by providing a 20% \ndeduction against the income of the lesser-earning spouse, phased out \nbetween $50,000 and $60,000 of family income. If the Republicans were \ngenuinely interested in the marriage penalty relief problem as Senator \nGramm and others have proclaimed, they would vote for the Democratic \namendment. It would provide a bigger cut in the marriage penalty for \nmost couples than the Gramm amendment over the next 10 years.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. A couple making $35,000, with \nincome split $20,000 and $15,000 between the two spouses, would see the \nfollowing circumstances if this amendment were to pass. In the year \n2002, under Gramm the couple would receive an average additional income \nof about $1,000. By comparison, under our 20-percent second earner \ndeduction alternative, the couple would receive an additional reduction \nof $3,000, that is, 20 percent of $15,000.\n  Mr. President, that represents about three times as large a tax \ndeduction and would provide nearly three times as much tax relief--\nthree times more tax relief under the Democratic amendment than under \nthe so-called Gramm amendment. Next, take a couple making $50,000, \nsplit $25,000 and $25,000 between the two spouses. Again, under the \nGramm amendment the couple would receive an average additional \ndeduction of about $1,000 in 2002. By contrast, our amendment would \nprovide an extra $5,000 deduction, representing five times the amount \nof relief as under the Gramm amendment.\n  So because we target our benefit to those who are actually penalized \nby the penalty rather than spread it across those who now enjoy a tax \nbonus for being married, we are able to deal with the penalty in a far \nmore consequential way over the next ten years.\n  To recap, the Gramm amendment costs 50 percent more over the first 10 \nyears than the Democratic alternative and gives far less marriage \npenalty relief during this period. It makes more sense to redirect the \nadditional $15 billion that Senator Gramm spends on bigger marriage \nbonuses to the original purposes of this bill--to public health, to \nresearch, to state programs, and to farmers.\n  That in essence is the difference between our two approaches. Let's \nspend and invest those resources on the things that this bill is \ndesigned to do. Let's do as Senator Gramm suggests, focus on the \nproblem he has described, that is, the marriage penalty, and try to \ndeal with it as effectively as we can. By following that counsel, by \ntaking that approach, we should pass the Democratic amendment, we \nshould ultimately accept this compromise and the balance that it \nreflects, a balance between investments in public health and tax \nreductions. This is a prudent balance that recognizes the importance of \nthis tobacco legislation as it was originally intended.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, 35 years ago, President Kennedy took the \nbold first step to secure equal pay for women. Although there has been \nmuch progress since 1963, women continue to earn less than men. That is \nwhy we mut take action to improve and strengthen President Kennedy's \nlandmark law and ensure that America's working women and families are \npaid the wages they deserve.\n  In 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act prohibiting \nemployers from paying women less than men for the same job. Knowing \nthat the legislation was merely a first step in the right direction, \nPresident Kennedy noted that ``much remains to be done to achieve full \nequality of economic opportunity.''\n  While the Equal Pay Act prohibited discrimination against women in \nterms of wages, substantial pay disparities continue to exist. Women \nstill earn, on average, only 74 cents to a man's dollar.\n  That's why fair pay continues to be a major issue for American women \nand working families. In fact, the dramatic increase in the number of \nwomen in the work force and the number of families who depend on \nwomen's earnings make fair pay a matter of justice and necessity now \nmore than ever. My state of South Dakota has the highest percentage in \nthe nation of working mothers with children under the age of 6. These \nfamilies need and deserve both parents to be paid fairly for an honest \nday's work. Now is the time to take another step toward fair pay and \nequal treatment for all people.\n  Last year, I introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the \nglaring inequities between men's and women's earnings. The bill seeks \nto eliminate the wage gap by beefing up enforcement of the Equal Pay \nAct, increasing penalties for pay discrimination, and lifting the gag \nrule imposed by many employees who forbid employees from discussing \ntheir wages with their co-workers. The bill would also ensure that \nemployers who make real strides in establishing fair and equal \nworkplaces would be recognized and celebrated.\n  As we commemorate the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Equal \nPay Act, I join my colleagues, the President, and the Vice President in \ncalling on Congress to schedule a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act, \nand renew our efforts to advance the principles of equal pay for equal \nwork. Through the Paycheck Fairness Act, Democrats honor and continue \nPresident Kennedy's legacy of equality for a better workplace economy, \nand country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6033-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6033-S6034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF McCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize a milestone in \nNevada history. This weekend, Nevadans will celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of McCarran International Airport and on Monday the opening \nof the new ``D'' gates.\n  Seventy-eight years ago, in 1920, pilot Randall Henderson landed his \nplane on a makeshift dirt runway marking Las Vegas' first flight. I am \nsure that Mr. Henderson had no idea that some 78 years later the \nMcCarran International Airport would be one of the fastest growing \nairports in the country.\n  That runway was later used by such famous people as Amelia Earhart, \nClarence Prest, and Emery Rogers and came to be named Rockwell Field.\n  Rockwell Field was sold in 1929. Fortunately, P.A. ``Pop'' Simon \nbought the land northeast of Las Vegas, the site of today's Nellis Air \nForce Base, and built the Las Vegas Airport. It was later named Western \nAir Express Field. In 1948, Clark County purchased an existing airfield \non Las Vegas Boulevard South and established the Clark County Public \nAirport.\n  That year, the airport was renamed McCarran Field, after Nevada's \nsenior Senator, Senator Pat McCarran, who authored the Civil \nAeronautics Act and played a major role in the development of aviation \nnot only in Nevada but in the country. McCarran Airport was at that \ntime already servicing 12 flights a day, by four airlines. Later, the \ngrowth of Las Vegas necessitated the move of the airport terminal from \nthe Las Vegas Boulevard South location to Paradise Road, and the \npresent McCarran Field Terminal was opened in 1963. At this time the \nairport was serving nearly 1.5 million passengers. Three short years \nlater, the annual passenger volume exceeded the two-million mark for \nthe first time in the airport's history. By 1978, tourism to the Las \nVegas area had increased dramatically, and the McCarran 2000 master \nplan was established to respond to the burgeoning tourism industry. \nThis plan brought the addition of more terminals, parking, runways, and \npassenger assistance facilities. After Phase I of the McCarran 2000 \nproject was completed, the size of the airport quadrupled, adding 16 \nmore gates. Later, a fourth runway was added along with major \nrenovations to the runways and terminals, and in 1994, a 1,400-foot \nextension was added, making it one of the longest civilian runways in \nthe United States.\n  This Monday, McCarran will celebrate the opening of the new ``D'' \ngates, which will ultimately consist of 48 gates throughout four \nconcourse wings. The completion of the ``D'' gates will enable the \nairport to serve a total of 55 million passengers per year, nearly \ndouble the current capacity.\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\n  The growth of Las Vegas is a fact that has been recorded on many \noccasions. It has been dramatic. That growth could not have occurred if \nMcCarran International had not kept pace and indeed anticipated the \nphenomenal tourism growth in southern Nevada. We salute McCarran on the \n50th anniversary of its establishment. It has become an international \ngateway to the entertainment capital of the world. We are sure it was \nthe farsighted leadership that has been provided in the past and its \npresent expansion that will allow McCarran to continue to enjoy another \n50 years of service to the community and to the millions of people who \narrive by air each year making Las Vegas their destination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6033-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

It would place the nuclear powers in a \n     position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \n     hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of \n     nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n\n  In the weeks that followed, President Kennedy secured one of the most \nimportant of successes of his New Frontier--the signing of the Limited \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  But, today, 35 years later, we still have not achieved the larger \ngoal of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Especially in the wake of the \nrecent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, we need to do all we can to \nachieve the rapid ratification of this important treaty.\n  The arguments in favor of the CTBT are stronger and more important \nthan ever. The recent tests are a reminder that the greatest threat to \nhumanity is still the danger of nuclear war.\n  The end of the Cold War has presented us with a unique opportunity to \nstep back from the nuclear brink and end nuclear testing worldwide. A \nComprehensive Test Ban now would also end the current discrepancy \nbetween the world's recognized nuclear states which are permitted to \ntest and the rest of the world's countries which are not. The Senate \ncan take the lead in creating a more secure world by putting the United \nStates in the front of the international effort to achieve a \nComprehensive Test Ban.\n  This is the right time for the CTBT. We no longer need to develop \nmore powerful or more accurate nuclear weapons to deter the nations of \nthe former Soviet Union, or any other nuclear-capable state. Through \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program, we are learning more each day about \nhow to keep our nuclear arsenal safe and reliable without testing.\n  One-hundred and forty-nine nations around the world have already \nsigned the CTBT, including all five of the recognized nuclear states. \nThe United States signed it in September 1996, but the Senate has not \nyet ratified it.\n  President Kennedy said it best 35 years ago when he told the students \nat American University, ``. . . in the final analysis, our most basic \ncommon link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe \nthe same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all \nmortal.''\n  I urge the Senate to act on the ratification of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. The most important single step we can take today to \nreduce the dangers of nuclear war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6034-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1635.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Tennessee; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 132\n\n       Whereas, This General Assembly acknowledges the importance \n     and emerging dependence of business, government and society \n     on the Internet as a growing part of our system of \n     communications and commerce; and\n       Whereas, The members of this legislative body also \n     recognizes that the Internet as a medium of free speech \n     contains, in addition to its many salutory features, \n     potential dangers for society and especially our youth, in \n     that it can provide uncontrolled and instantaneous access to \n     obscenity, child pornography and other adult-oriented \n     materials that are harmful to youth; and\n       Whereas, in 1996 Congress attempted to place restrictions \n     on the Internet to curb these dangers by the passage of the \n     Communications Decency Act of 1996, which was declared \n     unconstitutional in part by the United States Supreme Court \n     in the case of Reno v. ACLU; and\n       Whereas, The Internet is in a developing stage and software \n     developments and other market forces may eventually allow \n     Internet providers to provide clean Internet services or \n     products that will protect children from the harms of the \n     Internet and permit users to block out offensive materials \n     and services without compromising the beneficial aspects of \n     the Internet; and\n       Whereas, The technology currently exists to more readily \n     control these problems by the use of a designated top-level \n     domain site for web sites that contain pornographic and \n     adult-oriented materials and services which, if employed, \n     will expedite and facilitate the development of clean \n     Internet materials and services by the lawful classification \n     of web sites; and\n       Whereas, In October of this year, the United States \n     Department of Commerce plans to set up a private not-for-\n     profit corporation whose directors will create five new top-\n     level domains that will register web sites by subject type; \n     and\n       Whereas, A federal requirement that an adult-oriented \n     domain site be created and that all adult-oriented web sites \n     be registered to such domain would greatly aid Internet \n     users, parents and teachers in shielding America's youth from \n     the harms of pornography and adult-oriented materials and \n     services that are available and proliferating on the \n     Internet, and\n       Whereas, The states are somewhat limited in the regulation \n     they can provide in this area because of the federal Commerce \n     Clause; and\n       Whereas, Congress and the Executive Branch are the \n     appropriate governmental branches to provide leadership in \n     this area and may lawfully act to resolve quickly this issue \n     in a responsible manner that comports with the ideals of the \n     First Amendment; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One-Hundredth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That this Body hereby \n     urges the United States Congress to establish and maintain a \n     uniform resource locator system that contains a top-level \n     domain for all Internet web sites providing pornographic or \n     adult-oriented materials or services so as to facilitate and \n     assist Internet users, service providers and software \n     developers to manage the problem of uncontrolled access to \n     obscenity, child pornography and other adult-oriented \n     materials and services via the Internet. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That this Body respectfully urges the \n     President and Vice President of the United States and the \n     Secretary of the Department of Commerce to use their offices \n     and considerable influence to bring about the aims of this \n     resolution by the means of executive order or department \n     regulation, or the promotion of federal regulation, as they \n     deem appropriate. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate deliver \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to each member of the \n     Tennessee delegation, to the United States Senate and the \n     United States House of Representatives, to the Chairmen of \n     the United States Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \n     Committee and the United States House Commerce Committee, and \n     to the President and Vice President of the United States and \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-453. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, Housing credits are the primary state-federal tool \n     for making affordable rental housing available for low-income \n     people. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated housing \n     credits that have helped finance nearly 900,000 apartments \n     for low-income families; and\n       Whereas, The cap on the amount of housing credits was set \n     ten years ago. Over the past decade, less and less housing is \n     becoming available. As a result of the impact of inflation, \n     demand for this highly successful program exceeds supply by a \n     three-to-one ratio; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States is considering \n     two bills that would rectify the problem of inadequate \n     housing credits by adjusting the cap to reflect inflationary \n     growth. These bills, H.R. 2990 and S. 1252, will reopen doors \n     to more low-income housing. In Michigan, it is estimated that \n     the legislation will result in enough credit authority to \n     create another 1,000 units of much-needed housing. Another \n     key to the bills is a provision to index the cap for housing \n     credits to reflect inflationary change. This is an \n     appropriate strategy to ensure the continuing availability of \n     low-income housing; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to increase the cap on low-income housing \n     credits; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-454.

That effort is \n     equivalent to a ``staff'' of 3 million people working full \n     time, year round, just on taxes; and\n       Whereas, Taxes are too high, but any steps to lower taxes \n     by modifying the existing tax code would make it even longer \n     and more confusing; and\n       Whereas, A proposal to abolish the Internal Revenue Code by \n     December 31, 2001, embodies a prudent method and provides \n     adequate time for developing a new tax code; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to abolish the \n     Internal Revenue Code by December 31, 2001, and replace it \n     with a new method of taxation.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 65\n\n       Whereas, The California Legislature and the Governor, on a \n     bipartisan basis, enacted Assembly Bill 1126 and other \n     conforming legislation to establish the Healthy Families \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, The Healthy Families Program embodies the \n     Governor's vision of providing private insurance to the \n     children of working parents whose employers do not provide \n     dependent health insurance coverage and whose family income \n     is insufficient to purchase private health care coverage for \n     their children; and\n       Whereas, It was the Legislature's intent, in enacting the \n     Healthy Families Program, that children of low-income parents \n     who work receive the same beneficial treatment, with regard \n     to income disregards, as families applying for Medi-Cal; and\n       Whereas, The state government expressly requested the use \n     of income disregards to establish eligibility for the Healthy \n     Families program, similar to the disregards applied to low-\n     income persons applying for Medi-Cal coverage for their \n     children; and\n       Whereas, The federal government accepted the plan developed \n     by the administration, including the provisions of the plan \n     which protect against crowd out; and\n       Whereas, The delay and potential elimination of families \n     who want and need to participate in the program, since they \n     do not have the means to purchase insurance without financial \n     assistance, would place a great hardship on these families \n     and their children; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the federal Health Care Financing \n     Administration, and the Congress and the President of the \n     United States to preserve the state plan to implement the \n     Healthy Families Program in its current approved form; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-456.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United Stated to support, and urges and \n     requests the United States Secretary of Agriculture to \n     incorporate, Option 1A as the pricing procedure in all \n     federal milk marketing orders in his final decision on \n     consolidation and reform of these orders. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America, each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation, and the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Agriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6035-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JEFFORDS, from the Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       H.R. 2614.

A bill to establish a program to provide credit and other \nassistance for encouraging microenterprises in developing countries, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n              microcredit for self-sufficiency act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today which is \ncosponsored by at least 20 of my colleagues in the Senate, a bipartisan \noffering on an issue which I came to be familiar with over 10 years \nago. I traveled to the country of Bangladesh. It is not exactly on the \nitinerary of favorite congressional trips because it is a country \nwhich, although it is large and very interesting, has had its share of \nmisfortune. It seems whenever any natural disaster would strike in the \nworld it would stop in Bangladesh. We, of course, conjure an image in \nour mind of people who have suffered through typhoons and tornadoes and \nflooding and all sorts of deprivation. It is a very poor country.\n  Then Congressman, the late Mike Synar, and I went to Bangladesh. One \nof the reasons we went was to explore an issue which we had heard a lot \nabout. There is an institution created in Bangladesh known as the \nGrameen Bank. Grameen means ``people's bank.'' It is an extraordinary \ninstitution because it is an unusual bank; it is\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\na bank designed to provide very small loans to very poor people. So \nCongressman Synar and I joined with people from the American Embassy \nand got in our four-wheel drive vehicle and drove out from Dakar into \nthe countryside until the road ended, and then our four-wheel vehicle \ncould go no further and we got out and started hiking a few miles into \nthe brush and came upon a tiny little village. In this village we were \ninvited to a bank meeting, a meeting of the board of directors of the \nGrameen Bank, in this tiny, obscure, almost nameless Bangladesh \nvillage. The bank meeting was unlike any meeting of any board of \ndirectors one would ever imagine.\n  Seated in a little shelter were about 30 or 40 women, all dressed in \nbrightly colored saris, with a third eye in their foreheads, many of \nthem holding babies in a typical Asian squatting position and looking \nup at these visitors who had come to see them.\n  Our host, a professor from a university in Bangladesh who was \nfamiliar with the program, Dr. Huk, introduced us to the women in the \naudience. He said at one point, ``Is there anyone here who has ever \nheard of the United States of America?'' Not one of them had. And here \nwe were, these two Congressmen standing before them, looking like \ncreatures from some other planet I am sure, wanting to know more about \nthis little bank.\n  This bank has grown in size and scope in an effort to provide \nmicrocredit, small loans, to some of the poorest people in the world. \nWhat does $100 mean to an American? For us, it might be a nice trip \nshopping or a trip to a restaurant. But for a woman living in \nBangladesh, $100 might mean that she can buy some tools and develop a \nskill and a craft to feed her family; $100 might mean that she can buy \na milking cow that she can then use, not only to feed her family, but \nto sell the products and to make some money for her future.\n  How does this work, that people who are so poor, with literally no \nearthly possessions, can be debtors, can borrow money from a bank? It \nworks because the concept is that when they undertake this debt, \nseveral other villagers will sign up with them, cosign the note, if you \nwill, in a guarantee that the payment will be made because, you see, \nthe cosigners cannot get a debt of their own until the original debt is \npaid off. So they look very carefully to make sure that the debt is \nrepaid on a monthly basis. The payback rate on Grameen Bank is over 95 \npercent.\n  Why in the world would I raise this question here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate in the great country that we live in, with all of our \nwealth and opportunity? Because I, frankly, think that this is a model \nthat we should encourage and follow around the world. We do not spend \nan extraordinarily great amount of money on foreign aid compared to \nother nations, but we do spend billions of dollars. The bill that I \nintroduce suggests that we should take a portion of that money each \nyear and dedicate it to microcredit projects, projects like the Grameen \nBank around the world.\n\n  Many Americans might say, ``Well, Senator, it sounds like a great \nidea, but why should we worry about a woman in Bangladesh?'' One of the \nwomen in this meeting I attended came up to me afterwards and, with an \ninterpreter--she had a baby in her arms --she told me her life story.\n  She was 18 years old. The baby she was holding was her third child. \nShe told me, quite proudly, that she was not going to have any more \nchildren. She was practicing birth control. She said, ``My other two \nchildren are alive.'' Now, that is an amazing statement in the United \nStates. You think, ``Well, of course, why would you bring that up?'' \nBut in a developing country, it is a very serious concern: Will my baby \nsurvive? Do I need to have another baby? That is why many of the \ndeveloping countries have such high birth rates.\n  She had decided that because of good health techniques, which the \nUnited States and United Nations had encouraged, that her babies had a \nchance to live, and with the Grameen Bank, she had a chance to improve \ntheir livelihood. She said, quite proudly, ``I'm going to have a family \nof three and that is all we need and Grameen Bank has really helped to \nmake this possible.''\n  A tiny loan of $100, a family planning program, some public health \ntechniques and this woman is going to limit her family to three. Is \nthat important to us in the United States? It is, because in Asia, in \nAfrica and around the world, the problem of overpopulation is one that \nis not local or regional, it is a global problem.\n  Overpopulation leads to many problems--economic instability, \npolitical instability, environmental degradation. Look at the nation of \nIndia today. India is in the headlines because of its recent nuclear \ntest, its fears of China and Pakistan. Yet, India is going to be in the \nheadlines in a few years because it will be the most populated nation \nin the world. It will pass China. As that teeming population grows and \ncreates political pressures, it becomes a concern in the United States.\n  I hope we will make modest investments in those foreign aid programs \nthat really can improve the quality of life in developing countries and \ncan really cope with some of the problems such as overpopulation. \nMicrocredit enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  An organization known as RESULTS, which is nationwide but has a very \nsignificant chapter in Chicago, has encouraged me to introduce this \nlegislation, which I am happy to do. There are many people who are \nstrong supporters of this. One of them is well known to many of us who \ngrew up watching ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' Her name is Valerie \nHarper, also known as Rhoda.\n  For some reason, this has become a passion for her, a commitment to \nhelping women around the world receive basic credit so that they can \nlift their lives and improve their families. I salute Valerie Harper \nfor her leadership on this. Microcredit encourages entrepreneurship and \nfree market economic development.\n  The repayment rates on these loans are over 95 percent, and it is \nfound that $1 million put into microcredit can generate $15 million in \nsmall loans over 5 years as people get better off and start building \ntheir own livelihoods. It gives poor people, and especially women, the \nmeans to meet the needs of their family in areas of health, education, \nand nutrition.\n  Our First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke in Chicago a few years \nago, and I thought she made a very important observation. She said, if \nyou will look at the underdeveloped nations and wonder if they have a \nchance to move toward democracy or toward a free market economy, the \nfirst place you should look is how they treat women. Are women given an \nopportunity to be educated? Are they given an opportunity to work \noutside the home and develop their skills? How are they treated? I \nthink we are finding in countries where microcredit is becoming an \nimportant part of the program that women are given that chance.\n  This bill in particular requires the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to spend $160 million for fiscal year 1999 on its \nMicroenterprise Assistance Program, with at least 50 percent of that \namount dedicated to serving the poorest in the world with microcredit \nloans under $300. We know that these loans are repaid, and we know that \nthey are recycled, so we are creating a stock, a basic pool of money \nthat can be reinvested in nations around the world to bring them up to \nhigher living standards.\n  One-fifth of the world's population lives in extreme poverty. \nMicrocredit is one of the most effective antipoverty tools in \nexistence. I talked to one of my colleagues and asked him to cosponsor \nthis bill the other day and he said, ``You know, I like this bill. \nThere are so many things we do in foreign aid that end up creating more \nbureaucracies and agencies and studies; this is real, this gives to \npeople who need a helping hand the kind of help that they really \nneed.''\n  Unfortunately, AID has had this program, even though it has not been \nspecifically authorized, and they have not funded it at levels that I \nthink are adequate. So this legislation will set a standard for how \nmuch we invest in this program each and every year. Many of my \ncolleagues have joined me on this legislation. I hope that others who \nhave not will take a look at it. I think they will find that this is a \nreasonable approach, a successful approach, and one where the \ninvestment in America's foreign aid dollars will not only be in our \nbest interest, but in\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nthe best interest of people around the world who just need a helping \nhand and opportunity. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Microcredit for Self-\n     Sufficiency Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 1,000,000,000 people in the developing world \n     are living in severe poverty.\n       (2) According to the United Nations Children's Fund, the \n     mortality for children under the age of 5 is 10 percent in \n     all developing countries and nearly 20 percent in the poorest \n     countries.\n       (3) Nearly 33,000 children die each day from malnutrition \n     and disease which is largely preventable.\n       (4)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads \n     and less access to educational and economic opportunities \n     than their male counterparts.\n       (B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially \n     women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only \n     on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health, and \n     education, since women tend to reinvest income in their \n     families.\n       (5)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly \n     women, generally lack stable employment and social safety \n     nets.\n       (B) Many women turn to self-employment to generate a \n     substantial portion of their livelihood.\n       (C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty \n     because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to \n     build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-\n     employment activities.\n       (D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as \n     high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\n       (6)(A) On February 2-4, 1997, an international Microcredit \n     Summit was held in Washington, D.C., to launch a plan to \n     expand access to credit for self-employment and other \n     financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's \n     poorest families, especially the women of those families, by \n     2005.\n       (B) With an average of 5 people to a family, achieving this \n     goal will mean that the benefits of microcredit will reach \n     nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute \n     poor.\n       (7)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their \n     businesses dramatically when they have access to loans at \n     reasonable interest rates.\n       (B) Through the development of self-sustaining microcredit \n     programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against \n     hunger and poverty.\n       (8)(A) Nongovernmental organizations such as the Grameen \n     Bank, Accion International, and the Foundation for \n     International Community Assistance (FINCA) have been \n     successful in lending directly to the very poor.\n       (B) These institutions generate repayment rates averaging \n     95 percent or higher.\n       (9)(A) Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty, \n     but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.\n       (B) Interest income on a credit portfolio can be used to \n     pay recurring institutional costs, assuring that the long-\n     term development is sustained.\n       (10) Microcredit institutions leverage foreign assistance \n     resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits \n     to program participants.\n       (11) The development of sustainable microcredit \n     institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize \n     domestic savings, are critical to a global strategy of \n     poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.\n       (12)(A) In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative \n     in consultation with Congress.\n       (B) The Initiative was committed to expanding funding for \n     AID's microenterprise programs, provided funding of \n     $137,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, and set a goal that, by \n     the end of fiscal year 1996, half of all microenterprise \n     resources would support programs and institutions providing \n     credit to the poorest with loans under $300.\n       (C) In fiscal year 1996, total funding for microenterprise \n     activities fell to $111,000,000 of which only 39 percent was \n     used for programs benefiting the poorest with loans under \n     $300.\n       (D) Increased investment in microcredit institutions \n     serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit \n     Summit's goal.\n       (E) AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the \n     developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of \n     microcredit institutions in the developing world.\n       (13) Providing the United States share of the global \n     investment needed to achieve the goal of the Microcredit \n     Summit will require only a modest increase in United States \n     funding for international microcredit programs, with an \n     increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.\n       (14)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest \n     with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate \n     successful microcredit institutions.\n       (B) Microcredit institutions need assistance in developing \n     their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap \n     commercial sources of capital.\n       (15) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations have \n     demonstrated competence in developing networks of local \n     microcredit institutions that can reach large numbers of the \n     very poor, and help the very poor achieve financial \n     sustainability.\n       (16) Since AID has developed very effective partnerships \n     with PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations, AID should \n     place a priority on investing in PVOs and other \n     nongovernmental organizations through AID's central funding \n     mechanisms.\n       (17) By expanding and replicating successful microcredit \n     institutions, AID should be able to assure the creation of a \n     global infrastructure to provide financial services to the \n     world's poorest families.\n       (18)(A) AID can provide leadership among bilateral and \n     multilateral development aid agencies as such agencies expand \n     their support of microenterprise for the poorest.\n       (B) AID should seek to improve the coordination of efforts \n     at the operational level to promote the best practices for \n     providing financial services to the poor and to ensure that \n     adequate institutional capacity is developed.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide for the continuation and expansion of AID's \n     commitment to develop microcredit institutions;\n       (2) to make microenterprise development the centerpiece of \n     the overall economic growth strategy of AID;\n       (3) to support and develop the capacity of United States \n     PVOs, and other international nongovernmental organizations \n     to provide credit, savings, and training services to \n     microentrepreneurs; and\n       (4) to increase the amount of assistance devoted to \n     providing access to credit for the poorest sector in \n     developing countries, particularly women.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be the lead cosponsor of \nthe Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998. This bipartisan \nmeasure is an excellent means of fighting poverty and allowing the \nworld's enterprising poor to escape it.\n  Microcredit programs extend small loans to very poor people for self-\nemployment projects that generate income to allow them to care for \nthemselves and their families. These loans are provided without \ncollateral to poor people so they can start or expand small businesses. \nMicrocredit encourages entrepreneurship and productivity among the \npoorest people in the world and allows them and their families to \nescape from poverty with dignity.\n  I have always believed that the foreign assistance expenditures made \nby the United States should provide the maximum benefit in a cost-\nefficient manner. Microcredit meets this most important test. \nMicrocredit loans are repaid by borrowers at commercial interest rates \nor higher, and repayment rates reach 95% and above. The money invested \nin microcredit programs is continually recycled, allowing lenders to \nreach more people over time.\n  This assessment is borne out by the Foundation for International \nCommunity Assistance (FINCA) which is a non-governmental organization \nworking in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the United States. It \nestimates that, over 5 years, $1 million invested in one of their \nmicrocredit programs generates $15 million in new loans.\n  The microcredit concept has been a great success. Around the world, \nsmall investments have allowed an estimated 10 million poor people to \nbegin self-employment ventures as opposed to relying on government \nhandouts. Far more families could benefit from microcredit, but do not \nyet have access to such opportunities as this type of lending is not \ntypically done by most financial institutions. It is microcredit \ninstitutions that will undertake such opportunities to provide a poor \nwoman in Bangladesh, for example, with the funds to buy an extra cow or \ngoat to increase her modest farming output.\n  Indeed, one real-life illustration of the success of this program has \nbeen the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. In 1976, a man named Muhammad \nYunus conducted an innovative research endeavor to examine the \npossibility of designing a credit delivery system to provide banking \nservices to help the rural poor. These are individuals who want to \nescape poverty but find that conventional sources of lending are \nunavailable to them because they lack the collateral to get a loan.\n  The Grameen Bank Project began with the goals of extending banking \nfacilities to poor men and women, and creating opportunities for self-\nemployment. It also aimed to reverse the vicious cycle of low income, \nlow savings, and low investment by providing these individuals with \ncredit that would yield greater investment and income.\n  Today, the Grameen Bank is the largest rural credit institution in \nBangladesh. It has over two million borrowers--94 percent of whom are \nwomen. The Grameen Bank covers more than half of all villages in \nBangladesh and the repayment of its loans, which average $160 in United \nStates dollars, is over 95%. The Bank has also helped train \napproximately 4,000 individuals from about 100 nations over the last 10 \nyears. There have been 223 Grameen style programs replicated in some 58 \nnations in the last decade. This success story demonstrates what an \nindividual is capable of when given the opportunity to help himself or \nherself escape poverty.\n  Take the instance of Amena Begum, who in 1993, lived in poverty with \nher family in a village in Bangladesh. She and her family survived by \nliving as squatters and earning money as day laborers or by operating \nmicro-businesses in constant debt to loansharks. That same year, she \nconvinced her husband to move the family to another village and joined \nthe Grameen Bank. A neighbor told her ``We're all poor--or at least we \nall were when we joined. I'll stick up for you because I know you'll \nsucceed in business.''\n  Well, she was elected secretary of her Grameen Bank group and repaid \na loan she received to start a chicken and duck raising business. \nGrameen then gave her a second loan and, today, her business is growing \nand providing for her family's basic needs.\n  A continent away in Ethiopia another woman, Alemnesh Geressu, her \nlandless husband, and their seven children were also struggling. For \nseveral years, she bought grain from a trader and sold it in the local \nmarket. However, most of her profit went back to the lender who charged \nmore than 10 percent interest per month. With loans from a Catholic \nRelief Services Program, she was able to buy grain at a lower price \nfrom nearby farmers and make higher profits. Her business grew \ndramatically and she now sells a local beverage, grows vegetables and \neven raised a cow--all in addition to her grain marketing activities.\n  Alemnesh now pays back her loan at a commercial rate that is ten \ntimes less than she used to pay to the local money lenders. She has \nenough to feed her family well and to send two of her children to \nschool. Alemnesh says she now has ``more confidence and skills in \nmyself and I wish the program could accommodate more women to improve \ntheir lives.''\n  More families need to be touched by such programs. Just last year, at \nthe 1997 Global Microcredit Summit, donor nations and international \ninstitutions established the goal of reaching 100 million of the \nworld's poorest families,\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\nespecially the women in those families with microcredit loans by the \nyear 2005. I believe that this bill, the Microcredit for Self-\nSufficiency Act of 1998, puts the United States on track to provide its \nshare of funding to help achieve this worthwhile goal.\n  This bill authorizes not less than $160 million in Fiscal Year 1999 \nfor the United States Agency for International Development's \nmicroenterprise program. To ensure that microcredit assistance goes to \nthose most in need of assistance, the bill targets at least half of \nthese resources to institutions serving the world's poorest families, \nwith loans under $300. Further, the bill channels a larger proportion \nof microcredit assistance through effective nongovernmental \norganizations that promote the development and expansion of microcredit \nprograms worldwide.\n  Mr. President, microcredit programs enjoy broad bipartisan support \nnot only because they help millions to work their way out of poverty \nbut because they also recycle foreign aid dollars through loan \nrepayments. Microcredit programs are self-sustainable, can be \nreplicated, and are powerful vehicles for social development.\n  This bill would increase the number of families that have access to \nsuch programs. Microcedit programs would be raised to a higher priority \namong our nation's foreign aid initiatives. And the investments called \nfor in this bill will help bring the possibility of financial \nindependence to millions of potential entrepreneurs who struggle to \nsurvive on less than $1 a day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2153. A bill to require certain expenditures by the Federal \nReserve System to be made subject to congressional appropriations, to \nprohibit the maintenance of surplus accounts by Federal reserve banks, \nto provide for annual independent audits of Federal reserve banks, to \napply Federal procurement regulations to the Federal Reserve System, to \nreform the pricing practices of the Federal Reserve System for services \nprovided to the domestic banking system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         THE FEDERAL RESERVE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Reid and I are introducing \nlegislation to help address a number of budgetary excesses and \naccountability lapses at the Federal Reserve Board.\n  When the General Accounting Office (GAO) released its comprehensive \nand historic report about the management of the Federal Reserve \nsystem--which took over two years to assemble --we learned about \ndisturbing financial practices and management failures within the \nFederal Reserve system. The report is packed with examples of where the \nFed could substantially trim costs, and it makes specific \nrecommendations for changes in Fed operations. Unfortunately, the \nFederal Reserve dismissed most of the GAO's recommendations as \nirrelevant or unnecessary.\n  The GAO report shows that during the late 1980s and early 1990s, \nFederal Reserve expenditures jumped by twice the rate of inflation, \nwhile the rest of the federal government has been downsizing. This \nrunaway spending is remarkable given Chairman Greenspan's advice about \nthe need for belt-tightening in the rest of government.\n  The gold-plated hood ornament of the Federal Reserve System's \nquestionable practices is, in my judgment, its huge cash surplus \naccount that's funded with billions of dollars in taxpayer money to \nprotect against losses, despite the fact that the Fed hasn't suffered a \nloss for more than 80 consecutive years. When the GAO's report was \nreleased a couple of years ago, the Fed had squirreled away some $3.7 \nbillion into the surplus account, which was up some 79% from its level \nin the late 1980s. Now the Fed has increased the surplus account by \nanother 40% to about $5.2 billion--even though the GAO concluded that \n``it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will ever incur sufficient \nannual losses such that it would be required to use any funds in the \nsurplus account.''\n  Our bill, the ``Federal Reserve Fiscal Accountability Act of 1998,'' \nincludes many of the changes recommended by the GAO. It would do the \nfollowing:\n  First, the Federal Reserve is required to immediately return to the \ngeneral fund of the federal Treasury the $5.2 billion of taxpayer's \nmoney that has unnecessarily accumulated in the Fed's surplus fund. In \naddition, the bill asks the GAO to determine the extent to which the \nFed's future net earnings should be transferred to the federal Treasury \neach year.\n  Second, the GAO, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, will \nidentify and report to Congress a list of the Federal Reserve System \nactivities that are not related to the making of monetary policy. After \nthe report is completed, all non-monetary policy expenditures, as \nidentified by the GAO, would be subject to the congressional \nappropriations process.\n  We do not intend to inject politics into monetary policy with this \nprovision. However, over 90 percent of the Fed's operations have \nnothing to do with interest rate policy according to the GAO. And there \nis simply no good reason why the Fed's non-monetary expenditures are \nimmune from the same kind of oversight and review required of other \nfederal agencies.\n  Third, the regional Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors \nwill be subjected to annual independent audits. This provision merely \ncodifies what the Federal Reserve has been doing for the most part in \nrecent practice. The detection of any possible illegal acts must be \nreported to the Comptroller General.\n  Fourth, the Federal Reserve will be required to follow the same \nprocurement and contracting rules that apply to other federal agencies. \nThese rules should help to prevent the examples of favoritism \nhighlighted in the GAO report and increase competition among contract \nbidders with the Fed. This requirement ought to substantially reduce \nprocurement costs on a system-wide basis.\n  Finally, we've made some changes to require the Fed to compete more \nfairly with the private sector in providing a variety of payment system \nservices, such as check clearing and transportation to banks and other \nfinancial institutions.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this much-needed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from North \nDakota to introduce legislation which we believe will improve fiscal \nmanagement within the Federal Reserve System and will allow private-\nsector competitors to compete fairly in ``priced services.'' We assure \nyou that nothing in this bill affects monetary policy of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Back in September 1993, Senator Dorgan and I requested a GAO \ninvestigation of the operations and management of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. We were concerned because no close examination of the Fed's \noperations had ever been conducted before. The GAO report that was \nissued in 1996 raised serious questions about management within the Fed \nwhich this bill will address.\n  One of the most astonishing findings in the 1996 report was the Fed \nhad squirreled-away $3.7 billion in taxpayer money in a slush fund. As \nof January 1998, this amount has now grown to $5.2 billion. This money \ncould be used for deficit reduction. The Fed claims the slush fund is \nneeded to cover system losses. Since it was created in 1913, however, \nthe Fed has never operated at a loss. This bill prohibits maintenance \nof surplus accounts and the surplus funds must be sent to Treasury.\n  The bill requires the Comptroller General of U.S. and the Fed Board \nof Governors to identify the functions and activities of the Board and \neach Fed bank which relate to U.S. monetary policy. After six months \nafter enactment, all non-monetary policy expenses of Federal Reserve \nSystem, will be subject to congressional appropriations. The Fed will \nnow have to justify its use of operating expenses.\n  Because of the Fed's self-financing nature, its operating costs have \nescaped public investigation. In order to be fiscally responsible, all \nactivities regarding government finances need to be scrutinized. \nSurprisingly, the GAO study was the very first look into the internal \noperations of the Fed. We think that oversight is needed on the \nworkings of this large and influential public entity. While the rest of \nFederal government has tightened its belt and\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\ndown-sized, the Fed enjoyed enormous growth in its operating costs and \nquestionable growth in its staffing.\n  Clearly, the Fed could do much more to increase its fiscal \nresponsibility, particularly as it urges frugal practices for other \nagencies. The picture the GAO report painted of the internal management \nof the Fed is one of conflicting policies, questionable spending, \nerratic personnel treatment, and favoritism in procurement and \ncontracting policies.\n  To date, there has never been an annual, independent audit of the \nnation's central banking system. This bill provides for annual \nindependent audits of the banks, the Board of Governors and the Federal \nReserve System. The detection of any possible illegal acts must be \nreported to the Comptroller General. The bill requires an annual audit \nof each Federal reserve bank, the Federal reserve board of governors \nand in turn, an audit of the Federal reserve system. This Auditor must \nbe a certified public accountant who is totally independent of the Fed. \nAn annual audit is fiscally sound policy which would instill greater \npublic confidence in our banking system.\n  This bill would also would reform the pricing practices of Federal \nReserve System so that fair competition with private businesses would \nexist. It will eliminate the possibility of accusations of favoritism \nand conflict of interest in procurement and contracting. This \nexamination will ensure that the Federal Reserve is competing fairly \nwith its private-sector competitors. This matter of fairness becomes \nvery important when the agency both competes with the private sector \nand also regulates their competitors.\n  The Federal Reserve operates several lines of business, which compete \nwith the private sector. These businesses are referred to as ``priced \nservices.'' This legislation will ensure that the Federal Reserve is \naccountable for the manner in which these businesses are run and how \nthe prices for these services are calculated. The Federal Reserve is \nrequired by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 to match its revenues with \nits costs so that the prices for services it sells are not subsidized.\n  We want to make sure that no accounting or pricing policy hides any \nsubsidy. This legislation will benefit anyone who cashes a check in \nthis country because it promotes a fair and competitive market place \nfor those who provide the many services necessary to process the \ncollection of checks. Costs should be fully recovered in the Federal \nReserve's pricing. These annual audits will ensure that they are \nrecovered and will level the playing field for those who can offer \ncompetitive services\n  We usually think of the Federal Reserve in the terms of monetary \npolicy, of setting interest rates. I want to make it very clear, I'm \nnot attempting to interfere with, or impugn, the monetary policy of the \nFed. I am simply seeking greater accountability in the operating \nexpenses and internal management of one of our most influential \ninstitutions. I believe that the Federal Reserve could do more to \nincrease its cost consciousness and to operate as efficiently as \npossible. This bill will ensure that this happens and I look forward to \ngreater discussion of this issue by Congress. I encourage the committee \nto give favorable consideration to our legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2154. A bill to promote research to identify and evaluate the \nhealth effects of silicone breast implants, and to ensure that women \nand their doctors receive accurate information about such implants; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          Silicone Breast Implant Research and Information Act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nwill make a significant difference in the lives of millions of American \nwomen--the Silicone Breast Implant Research and Information Act. There \nis one basic reason for this bill: to make sure women have accurate and \ncomplete information so they can make informed decisions about their \nhealth.\n  Each year, nearly 180,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in \nthe United States. In total, approximately 2.6 million Americans live \nwith breast cancer. When a women undergoes a mastectomy, she faces the \ndecision of whether to have reconstructive surgery, and one important \noption she has is to have a silicone breast implant.\n  Between 1 and 2 million women in the United States have received \nsilicone breast implants over the last 35 years, as part of \nreconstructive surgery after mastectomy, or for cosmetic purposes.\n  Many women with silicone implants have come forward with a variety of \nsymptoms and atypical illnesses. Although research over the years has \nattempted to get to the bottom of this, we still don't have the answers \nwomen need and deserve.\n  In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration restricted the availability \nof silicone breast implants because it had not received enough evidence \nto prove that these implants are safe. Currently, silicone breast \nimplants are only available to women who have had breast cancer surgery \nor who have other special medical needs, such as a severe injury or \nbirth defect. Women who need to have an implant replaced for medical \nreasons, such as rupture of the implant, are also eligible.\n  These women should have access to the broadest possible treatment \noptions--including breast implants. But it is just as essential that \nwomen can count on sound scientific research regarding the safety of \nimplants. It is essential that the Federal Government coordinate its \nefforts on this issue to maximize the use of limited resources.\n  This bill contains three components women need to make informed \ndecisions about silicone breast implants--research, information, and \ncoordination. It gives women not only options, but information and \npeace of mind.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill in the Senate, and to be joined by \nCongressman Gene Green, who is introducing this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Silicone Breast Implant \n     Research and Information Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Institute of Medicine, it is estimated \n     that 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received \n     silicone breast implants over the last 35 years.\n       (2) Silicone breast implants have been used primarily for \n     breast augmentation, but also as an important part of \n     reconstruction surgery for breast cancer or other conditions.\n       (3) Women with breast cancer or other medical conditions \n     seek access to the broadest possible treatment options, \n     including silicone breast implants.\n       (4) Women need complete and accurate information about the \n     potential health risks and advantages of silicone breast \n     implants so that women can make informed decisions.\n       (5) Although the rate of implant rupture and silicone \n     leakage has not been definitively established, estimates are \n     as high as 70 percent.\n       (6) According to a 1997 Mayo Clinic study, 1 in 4 women \n     required additional surgery because of their implants within \n     5 years of receiving them.\n       (7) In addition to potential systemic complications, local \n     changes in breast tissue such as hardening, contraction of \n     scar tissue surrounding implants, blood clots, severe pain, \n     burning rashes, serious inflammation, or other complications \n     requiring surgical intervention following implantation have \n     been reported.\n       (8) According to the Institute of Medicine, concern remains \n     that exposure to silicone or other components in silicone \n     breast implants may result in currently undefined connective \n     tissue or autoimmune diseases.\n       (9) A group of independent scientists and clinicians \n     convened by the National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases in April of 1997 addressed \n     concerns that an association may exist between atypical \n     connective tissue disease and silicone breast implants, and \n     called for additional basic research on the components of \n     silicone as well as biological responses to silicone.\n       (10) According to many reports, including a study published \n     in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the presence \n     of silicone breast implants may create difficulties in \n     obtaining complete mammograms.\n       (11) According to a 1995 Food and Drug Administration \n     publication, although silicone breast implants usually do not \n     interfere with a woman's ability to nurse, if the implants \n     leak, there is some concern that the silicone may harm the \n     baby. Some studies suggest a link between breast feeding with \n     implants and problems with the child's esophagus.\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote \n     research to identify and evaluate the health effects of \n     silicone breast implants, and to ensure that women and their \n     doctors receive accurate information about such implants.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to affect any rule or regulation promulgated under \n     the authority of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that is in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act relating to the \n     availability of silicone breast implants for reconstruction \n     after mastectomy, correction of congenital deformities, or \n     replacement for ruptured silicone implants for augmentation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide restitution of the economic potential lost \nto communities dependent on Spanish and Mexican Land Grants in New \nMexico due to inadequate implementation of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe \nHidalgo; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             Fair Deal for Northern New Mexico Act of 1998\n\n   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill to \nresolve a long standing controversy between many citizens of my State \nof New Mexico, and their government.\n  In 1848, the United States entered into a treaty with Mexico to end \nthe Mexican/American War called the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. In \nthat treaty, Mexico ceded an enormous tract of land that was to become \nthe American Southwest including the State of New Mexico. In return the \nTreaty stipulated that the property rights of the Mexican citizens who \nlived in the area, and who were to become new citizens of the United \nStates, would be protected.\n  We must recall that these new citizens had had a long, and sometimes \nancient, connection to the land. The Native American tribal peoples who \nhad lived there for thousands of years, had\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nbecome citizens of Spain and then Mexico. Also many of those new \ncitizens of Spanish descent had a family heritage of living on the this \nland dating back 250 years to 1598, when the Spanish colonial capital \nin New Mexico was established at San Juan Pueblo. They had built towns \nand cities, churches, and vast irrigation systems for their farms.\n  Unfortunately, the treaty provisions protecting title to land were \nnot well and evenly implemented. It has been fairly well documented by \nscholars such as Professor Malcolm Ebright at the University of New \nMexico, and Professor Emeritus Michael Meyer from the University of \nNorthern Arizona, that many people lost title to their land who should \nhave been protected by the treaty. In some cases this was due to faulty \nsurveying by the Surveyor General, in some cases it was due to a lack \nof knowledge by American Territorial Courts about how title was \nacquired under Spanish and Mexican law, and most egregiously people \nsometimes lost their land through outright fraud by government \nofficials and land speculators.\n  As I said earlier, the implementation of the treaty was not uniform. \nIn some areas property rights were fairly well adhered to, but in \nothers legitimate titles were wiped out wholesale. A group of people \nthat were particularly hurt in this process were the relatively poor \nsubsistence farmers and ranchers living in northern New Mexico. These \nnew American citizens were easy prey for land speculators. Not only \nwere they learning a new language and legal system, but usually they \ndid not have the financial resources to defend their property rights in \nthe courts. In some cases, people were told that if they signed a given \ndocument that they would be assured the continued use of their land \nforever. However in reality, what they were signing were quit claim \ndeeds, giving title to their land to some nefarious speculator.\n  The ramifications of this history have caused bitter disputes and \neconomic hardship in northern New Mexico for generations. The issue is \nstill relevant for many New Mexicans feel their government has an \nobligation to compensate them for their loss of land. In many cases \nthey may be right.\n  Mr. President, after 150 years it may not be possible or practicable \nto revisit the thousands of title claims originally made in 1848. So \nmuch time has passed, and so many title transfers have taken place \nsince then that the legal review could be a never ending legal maze. \nHowever, Spanish and Mexican law recognized community as well as \nindividual land titles. Under a grant from the King of Spain or the \nMexican government, whole communities had a claim on certain lands. \nThese community land grants form a distinct, and often better \ndocumented, subset of the claims made under the Treaty of Guadalupe-\nHidalgo. Given that this is a smaller, more defined group of claims, \nand because of they affect whole communities, it may be possible to \nsettle these long standing claims and provide a sense of justice to \npeople in northern New Mexico.\n  Last year former Representative Richardson introduced a bill, H.R. \n260, to create a commission to study and recommend settlement of these \nclaims. His successor in office, Representative Redmond has carried on \nthis issue in his own bill, H.R. 2538. These bills have been useful in \nbringing the issue to national attention and I commend both of my \ncolleagues for introducing them.\n  Mr. President, my bill, which I call the Fair Deal for Northern New \nMexico Act, builds upon the efforts in the other body. For example, the \nHouse bill is focused on an exhaustive legal review of the various \ncommunity land grant claims and whether land should be transferred back \nto the claimants. My bill also has a review of these claims, but \nacknowledges that after 150 years, that we may never be able to reach \nlegal certainty in some cases. We may find that a claim is colorable, \nthat it has a legal basis, but not exactly what is owed. Also, we may \nfind that the other people in the community currently either own the \nland in question, or if it's federal land, they may have long standing \nleases on which they depend. For that reason, my bill creates a package \nof options for settlement of these claims with the involvement and \nsupport of the whole community that would be affected.\n  I won't dwell on the differences between this bill and the one in the \nHouse because I see this bill as a broadening and strengthening of that \neffort. Let me just run briefly what my bill would do, and my hope is \nthat as this works its way through committee and on the floor that \nwe'll reach an agreement with the House sponsors on legislation that \nwill resolve this long standing legal dispute in New Mexico.\n  My bill has three key components: the creation of county-wide \nsettlement committees, the reasonable but expedited time-frame, and a \nbroad range of settlement options. First, it would create seven member \nsettlement committees, one for each county in New Mexico in which their \nare these community land grant claims. To get the federal agencies \nactively involved in a solution to the issue, the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and Interior would each have a representative on these \ncommittees. The State Lands Commissioner would represent the interests \nof the State's educational trust fund. Finally, each county commission \nwould appoint four representatives, at least one of which must be a \nTribal member if there is an Indian Pueblo within that county, and at \nleast one of which is a non-Indian heir to a Spanish or Mexican Land \nGrant.\n  Second, the bill tries to keep the issue on the front burner by \nlimiting the settlement committees to a set schedule. The settlement \ncommittees would have ninety days to publish a set of guidelines on to \nhow to document a land claim, and then people would have one year to \nfile their claims. These committees would then have three years in \nwhich to review the claims and develop a proposed settlement to be \nsubmitted to Congress.\n  The whole process from creation of these committees to proposals to \nCongress would take about five years. I think this very important. It \nshould be long enough to develop some solid settlement proposals, but \nit is a short enough time-frame that the people in New Mexico will see \naction before they just become frustrated.\n  Finally, the settlement committees would have a number of options to \nchoose from to create a settlement that will satisfy the claims and the \ncommunities in which they are made. As with the House bill, one options \nwould be to transfer land directly back to a particular community land \ngrant. However, the committee might propose that federal lands be set \naside for under special designations for community use, or that lands \nshould be transferred to local municipalities to benefit everyone in \nthe community. Further, a settlement committee could recommend that a \npackage of economic develop grants or tuition scholarships would better \nmeet the current needs of claimants and the community than a transfer \nof whatever land might be available. All of these options would be \ntools available to a county settlement committee to use in crafting a \nsettlement that the people of that county would find to be fair and \njust.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the United States to respond to its \ncitizens on this issue, to bring this controversy to closure, and to \ngive the citizens of northern New Mexico a sense that justice has been \ndone so that they can move forward both socially and economically \nwithout this cloud from the past hanging over them. I think this bill \nwill move us forward towards those goals. I would like to call on the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources to hold hearings on this bill \nat the earliest possible time. I hope to work with the rest of the New \nMexico delegation and the other members of Congress to pass good \nlegislation regarding the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Deal for Northern New \n     Mexico Act of 1998.''\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE, DEFINITIONS AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--\n       The purpose of this Act is to create a mechanism for the \n     settlement of Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in New \n     Mexico as claimed under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildalgo.\n       (b) Definitions.--For Purposes of this Act:\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\n       (1) Treaty of Guadalupe-hidalgo.--The term ``Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo'' means the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, \n     Limits, and Settlement (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo), between \n     the United States and the Republic of Mexico, signed February \n     2, 1848 (TS 207; 9 Bevans 791);\n       (2) Community land grant.--The term ``community land \n     grant'' means a village, town, settlement, or pueblo \n     consisting of land held in common (accompanied by lesser \n     private allotments) by three or more families under a grant \n     from the King of Spain (or his representative) before the \n     effective date of the Treaty of Cordova, August 24, 1821, or \n     from the authorities of the Republic of Mexico before May 30, \n     1848, in what became the State of New Mexico, regardless of \n     the original character of the grant.\n       (3) Land grant claim.--The term ``land grant claim'' means \n     a claim of title to land by a community land grant under the \n     terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n       (4) Eligible Descendant.--The term ``eligible descendant'' \n     means a descendant of a person who--\n       (A) was a Mexican citizen before the Treaty of Guadalupe-\n     Hildalgo;\n       (B) was a member of a community land grant; and\n       (C) became a United States citizen within ten years after \n     the effective date of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, May \n     30, 1848, pursuant to the terms of the Treaty.\n       (5) Settlement committee.--The term ``settlement \n     committee'' refers to committee, or one of the county \n     specific subcommittees as appropriate, authorized in Section \n     3 of this Act.\n       (6) Reconstituted.--The term ``reconstituted,'' with regard \n     to a valid community land grant, means restoration to full \n     status as a municipality with rights properly belonging to a \n     municipality under State law, including the nontaxability of \n     municipal property (common lands) and the right of local \n     self-government.\n       (c) Findings.--Congress Finds the Following:\n       (1) New Mexico has a unique and complex history regarding \n     land ownership due to the substantial number of Spanish and \n     Mexican land grants that were an integral part of the \n     colonization of New Mexico before the United States acquired \n     the area in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.\n       (2) Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, \n     these land grant claims were recognized as valid property \n     claims under United States' law.\n       (3) Several studies, including the New Mexico Land Grant \n     Series published by the University of New Mexico, have \n     documented that the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in regards to \n     these land grant claims in New Mexico was never well \n     implemented. Whether because of a lack of knowledge of \n     Spanish land law on the part of the judicial system in the \n     then new Territory of New Mexico, whether because of \n     inadequate or conflicting documentation of these claims, or \n     whether it was due to sharp legal practices, many of the \n     former citizens of Mexico, and then new citizens of the \n     United States, lost title to lands that had been guaranteed \n     to them by treaty.\n       (4) Following the United States' war with Mexico, the \n     economy of the Territory of New Mexico was dependent on the \n     use of land resources, and that held true for much of this \n     century as well. When the land grant claimants lost title to \n     their land, the predominantly Hispanic communities in \n     northern New Mexico lost a keystone to their economy. The \n     effects of this loss have had long lasting economic \n     consequences and are in part the cause that these communities \n     remain some of the poorest in the United States.\n       (5) The history of the implementation of the Treaty of \n     Guadalupe-Hidalgo has been a source of continuing controversy \n     for generations and has left a lingering sense of injustice \n     in the communities in northern New Mexico, which has \n     periodically lead to armed conflicts.\n       (6) The government of the United States has an obligation \n     to try to find an equitable remedy for the inadequate \n     implementation of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and the \n     consequences that has had on the communities and people of \n     New Mexico. This should be done as expeditiously as possible. \n     However, reconstructing the one hundred and fifty year \n     history of land title claims and transfers in these \n     communities is likely to prove lengthy and costly. In some \n     cases it may never be possible to adequately reconstruct the \n     title history.\n       (7) The Secretary of the Interior has had a experience in \n     administratively developing settlement packages to resolve \n     large and complex Tribal water rights claims as an \n     alternative to lengthy and expensive litigation. This \n     experience may be invaluable in resolving the large, complex, \n     and sometimes conflicting Spanish and Mexican land grant \n     claims in northern New Mexico.\n       (8) The history of colonial Spanish America, the system of \n     land distribution under Spanish and Mexican law, and the \n     subsequent impacts to that system following the transfer of \n     territory from Mexico to the United States under the Treaty \n     of Guadalupe-Hidalgo is a requisite body of knowledge in \n     determining an appropriate settlement of land grant claims. \n     It is also an integral part of the national history and \n     culture of the United States of America and, as such, \n     deserves formal recognition and interpretation by our \n     institutions of historical preservation.\n\n     SEC. 3. CREATION OF SETTLEMENT COMMITTEES.\n\n       (A) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior working through \n     the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs, and the and the Secretary of Agriculture working \n     through the Forest Service are hereby authorized and directed \n     to establish a ``Settlement Committee'' to develop \n     comprehensive settlements for land grant claims on a county \n     by county basis.\n       (b) The Settlement Committee will be comprised of separate \n     subcommittees for each county in which there are land grant \n     claims in New Mexico.\n       (c) Each county subcommittee shall be comprised of seven \n     members including: (1) a representative of the Secretary of \n     the Interior; (2) a representative of the Secretary of \n     Agriculture; (3) a representative of the State Commissioner \n     of Public Lands; and (4) four residents of the particular \n     county in question. The four county representatives are to be \n     appointed their county commissions: Provided, That in \n     counties with Federally recognized Native American Indian \n     Tribes that at least one county representative shall be an \n     enrolled member of a tribe whose reservation pueblo \n     boundaries come within that county: Provided further, That at \n     least one county representative shall be an eligible \n     descendent who is not an enrolled member of a Native American \n     Indian Tribe.\n       (d) Each member shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Settlement Committee. A vacancy in the Settlement Committee \n     shall be filled in the manner in which the original \n     appointment was made.\n\n     SEC. 4. SUBMISSION OF LAND GRANT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Within ninety (90) days of the creation of the \n     settlement committee it shall establish a set of guidelines \n     for the submission of land grant claims, and publish these \n     guidelines within papers of general circulation in each of \n     the counties in New Mexico.\n       (b) Land grant claims must be submitted to the appropriate \n     county settlement committee within one year of the \n     publication of the guidelines.\n\n     SEC. 5 REVIEW AND SETTLEMENT PACKAGE.\n\n       (a) The settlement committee for each county shall review \n     all of the submitted claims in the county and, based on the \n     documentation at its disposal, make an initial determination \n     concerning their potential validity including: possible past \n     conveyances, the accuracy of the boundaries of the land \n     claimed, and the number of eligible heirs affected.\n       (b) Upon completing this review, the settlement committee \n     shall develop a proposed settlement package in satisfaction \n     of land grant claims within that county. In creating the \n     settlement package, the settlement committee shall take into \n     account: the degree of certainty with which it has determined \n     that various claims are valid, the impacts, including \n     economic and social impacts, that any unfulfilled land \n     grant claims may have had on the communities within that \n     county, the relative benefits of various settlement \n     options on those communities, and whether there is a legal \n     entity that can accept settlement. The elements of a \n     proposed settlement package may include, but are not \n     limited to:\n       (1) Restoration of lands to a given land grant community or \n     communities;\n       (2) Reconstitution of a given land grant community or \n     communities;\n       (3) The setting aside of certain lands for communal use for \n     fuel wood, building materials, hunting, recreation, etc. \n     These lands could be set aside as special managerial units \n     within existing federal land management agencies or \n     transferred to local county, tribal, or municipal, \n     governments;\n       (4) Trust funds for scholarships or home and business \n     loans; or\n       (5) Land for commercial use with the proceeds to be \n     deposited into the trust funds.\n       (c) The settlement committee shall complete its review and \n     proposed settlement package within three years of the \n     deadline for submission of land grant claims under this Act, \n     and submit them in a report to the Senate Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Indian \n     Affairs, and to the House Resources Committee. Any proposal \n     that require action by the government of the State of New \n     Mexico shall be submitted to the Governor, to the Speaker of \n     the State House of Representatives, and to the President Pro \n     Tem of the State Senate for New Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) To complete its tasks the settlement committee may use \n     a variety of methods to gather information and to build \n     community consensus on the form of a proposed settlement \n     package, including: the use of town meetings, holding formal \n     hearings, the solicitation of written comments, and the use \n     of mediators trained in alternative dispute resolution \n     methods. The settlement committee is also authorized to hire \n     consultants as it may choose for historical, economic, and \n     legal analysis. In its efforts to develop a consensus on a \n     settlement package, the Settlement Committee is not subject \n     to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-462; 5 \n     U.S.C. Ap. 2 Sec. 1).\n       (b) Gifts, Bequests, and Devises.--The Settlement Committee \n     may accept, use, and dispose of gifts, bequests, or devises \n     of services or property, both real and personal, for the \n     purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of the Settlement \n     Committee. Gifts, bequests, or devises of money and proceeds \n     from sales of other property received as\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\n     gifts, bequests, or devises shall be deposited in the \n     Treasury and shall be available for disbursement upon order \n     of the Settlement Committee. For purposes of the Federal \n     income, estates, and gift taxes, property accepted under this \n     subsection shall be considered as a gift, bequest, or devise \n     to the United States.\n       (c) Administrative Support Services.--Upon the request of \n     the Settlement Committee, the Administrator of General \n     Services shall provide to the Settlement Committee, on a \n     reimbursable basis, the administrative support services \n     necessary for the Settlement Committee to carry out its \n     responsibilities under this Act.\n       (d) Immunity.--The Settlement Committee is an agency of the \n     United States for the purpose of part V of title 18, United \n     States Code (relating to the immunity of witnesses).\n       (e) Compensation.--Members of the Settlement Committee \n     shall each be entitled to receive the daily equivalent of \n     level V of the Executive Schedule for each day (including \n     travel time) during which they are engaged in the actual \n     performance of duties vested in the Settlement Committee.\n\n     SEC. 7. SPANISH LAND GRANT STUDY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the \n     Settlement Committee working in conjunction with the \n     University of New Mexico, and Highlands University shall \n     establish a Spanish Land Grant Study program with a research \n     archive at the Onate Center in Alcalde, New Mexico. This \n     program shall be designed to meet the requirements of the \n     Smithsonian Institution's Affiliated Institutions Program.\n       (b) The purposes of the Spanish Land Grant Study Program \n     are to assist the Settlement Committee in the performance of \n     its activities under section 5, and to archive and interpret \n     the history of land distribution in the southwestern United \n     States under Spanish and Mexican law, and the changes to this \n     land distribution system following the transfer of territory \n     from Mexico to the United States under the terms of the \n     Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848.\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION.\n\n       The Settlement Committee shall terminate on 180 days after \n     submitting its final report to Congress under section 5.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003 for the purpose of \n     carrying out the activities of the Settlement Committee \n     created in section 3, and the Spanish Land Grant Study \n     Program created section 7.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Lott, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Frist, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Faircloth, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Thomas, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Shelby, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Robb, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S.J. Res. 50. A joint resolution to disapprove the rule submitted by \nthe Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and \nHuman Services on June 1, 1998, relating to surety bond requirements \nfor home health agencies under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6037-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6046-S6050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RESOLUTION DISAPPROVING OF HCFA'S SURETY BOND RULE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I introduce a measure on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, and others which sends a strong \nmessage to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) that the \nUnited States Senate disapproves of the agency's recent rule regarding \nsurety bond requirements for home health agencies.\n  The surety bond regulation, coupled with HCFA's implementation of the \nInterim Payment System (IPS) for home health, are crippling the ability \nof our Nation's home health agencies to provide high quality care to \nour Nation's seniors and disabled.\n  Over this past month alone, in St. Louis, Missouri, the two largest \nhome health providers decided to get out of the home health business--\nleaving hundreds of elderly and disabled patients searching for a new \nprovider. The invaluable, dedicated services provided by the largest \nindependent provider in St. Louis , the Visiting Nurses Association \n(VNA), will no longer be realized by the approximately 600 home care \npatients the agency has served.\n  It is regrettable that a government bureaucracy is forcing a home \nhealth agency, that has served the St. Louis area for 87 years, out of \nthe home health care business.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires that all Medicare-\nparticipating home care agencies hold surety bonds in an amount that is \nnot less than $50,000. This provision was modeled after a successful \nFlorida Medicaid statute which imposes surety bonds on home care \nproviders as a way of ensuring that only reputable businesses entered \nFlorida's Medicaid program.\n  This needed and modest idea, however, has been severely distorted by \nHCFA. HCFA's surety bond rule deviates from Florida's program in two \nmajor ways:\n  First, the Florida program requires a $50,000 bond. HCFA's rule \nrequires the bond amount to be the greater of $50,000 or 15 percent of \nthe home care agency's previous year's Medicare revenues.\n  Since HCFA issued its initial rule back in January of 1998, \nconstituents in my home State have reported numerous problems in \nsecuring these bonds. These reputable individuals inform me that most \nbond companies are refusing to sell home care bonds under the \nregulation's requirements. Those few companies that are selling bonds \nare requiring backup collateral equal to the full face value of the \nbond, or personal guarantees of two or even three times the value of \nthe bond.\n  Second, the Florida program requires only new home care agencies to \nsecure these bonds. Agencies with at least one year in the program and \nwith no history of payment problems were exempted from the bond \nrequirement. HCFA's rule, however, requires all Medicare-participating \nhome care agencies to hold bonds, regardless of how long an agency has \nbeen in Medicare and regardless of the agency's good Medicare history. \nFurther, HCFA's rule requires every home care agency to purchase new \nsurety bonds every year.\n  HCFA's rule is outrageous. These requirements and costs are \nunaffordable, especially for the smaller, freestanding home health \nagencies. HCFA's surety bond regulations threaten the existence of many \nsmall business home health providers and the essential services they \nprovide to the most vulnerable and most frail of our society.\n  The surety bond requirement reflects HCFA's attitude that all \nMedicare providers are suspect. Rather than keeping unscrupulous \nproviders out of the home health business, HCFA's rule will penalize \nand put many decent home health agencies out of business.\n  In promulgating this rule, HCFA did not consider the long-standing \nreputation of most home health agencies, their years of compliance with \nMedicare's regulations, or their history of managing and avoiding \noverpayments from the government. These providers have worked long and \nhard within the convoluted Medicare program, have abided by the rules \nand regulations, and have been subjected to numerous audits by fiscal \nintermediaries.\n  HCFA's careless disregard, which has already put many conscientious \nlaw-abiding companies out of business, must be dealt with immediately. \nIt is especially incomprehensible when the small businesses at risk \nprovide a service so valued by the disabled and older Americans who \nreceive it.\n  On Tuesday, June 8, the Regulatory Fairness Board for Region VII held \na public meeting in Frontenac, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. My Red \nTape Reduction Act of 1996 created ten Regional Fairness Boards to be \nthe eyes and ears of small business, collecting comments from small \nbusinesses on their experience with Federal regulatory agencies. The \nOmbudsman, created under the same law, is to use these comments to \nevaluate the small business responsiveness of agency enforcement \nactions.\n\n  According to Scott George, a small business owner from Mt. Vernon, \nMissouri who serves on the Region VII Fairness Board, this particular \nmeeting of the Fairness Board was dominated by testimony from smaller, \nfreestanding home health care agencies that will be driven out of \nbusiness by the HCFA regulations. They testified that more than 1,100 \nhome health care providers nationwide have already closed their doors \nthis year. Mr. George noted that every company that testified before \nthe Region VII Fairness Board said they would be driven out of business \nby year-end. One couple traveled from Michigan to Missouri to testify \nthat they will be out of business by the time of the Regional Fairness \nBoard for their area holds a hearing absent relief from the HCFA \nregulations.\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n  Mr. President, concerns similar to those expressed in Missouri this \nTuesday were raised with HCFA during its rulemaking. Regrettably, HCFA \nreacted like a quarter horse down the home stretch with blinders on, \nignoring the comments submitted by small business as well as the \nagency's statutory obligations under the Administrative Procedures Act \n(APA) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 as amended by my Red \nTape Reduction Act in 1996.\n  In April, at the urging of myself and other Senators, the Small \nBusiness Administration's Office of Advocacy sent a letter to HCFA to \nadvise the agency of the significant NEGATIVE impact this rule would \nhave on small home health care providers. SBA's letter documents the \ndeficiencies in the HCFA efforts to implement the bonding requirement. \nAs set forth by the Chief Counsel of Advocacy, HFCA appears to have: \nexceeded the Congressional mandate in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \ninappropriately waived the APA's requirement for a general notice of \nproposed rulemaking with the opportunity for comment, and bypassed the \nprocedural and analytical safeguards provided by the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act as amended by my Red Tape Reduction Act in 1996.\n  The SBA Office of Advocacy petitioned HCFA to exclude the provisions \nrequiring the 15 percent bond requirement and the capitalization \nrequirement pending a ``proper and adequate analysis'' of the impacts \non small businesses. HCFA did not exclude these requirements. Not only \ndoes this exceed the scope of the 1997 Congressional directive, but it \nalso imposes an undue financial burden on reputable home health \nagencies. Furthermore, in its June final rule, HCFA did not conduct a \nRegulatory Flexibility analysis of the rules impact on small home \nhealth care agencies. Instead, HCFA certified that the rule would not \nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities. HCFA's certification is in direct conflict with the comments \nsubmitted by the Office of Advocacy and the home health care industry \nregarding the small business impacts of the rule.\n  In 1996, Congress voted to enhance its ability to put a stop to \nexcessive regulations and sloppy agency rulemakings. Enacted as \nSubtitle E of my Red Tape Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act \nenhances the ability of Congress to serve as such a backstop. Senators \nNickles and Reid sponsored the bipartisan, Congressional Review portion \nof the Red Tape Reduction Act to provide a new process for Congress to \nreview and disapprove new regulations and to make sure regulators are \nnot exceeding or ignoring the Congressional intent of statutory law.\n  The simple fact is that HCFA has ignored everyone--Congress, the SBA, \nthe home health industry, and most importantly the beneficiaries of \nhome health services. Congress must therefore move expeditiously and \nexercise its authority under the Congressional Review Act to pass a \nresolution of disapproval to strike the June 1 HCFA rule because HFCA \nexceeded the Congressional mandate and issued this rule in total \ndisregard of its statutory obligations under the APA, Regulatory \nFlexibility Act and the Red Tape Reduction Act. Although Congress did \ndirect the agency to develop surety bonding requirements and provide a \ndeadline for such a rule to be issued, this does not relieve the agency \nof its responsibility to conduct such a rulemaking in accordance with \nexisting laws intended to ensure procedural fairness in the rulemaking \nprocess.\n  The practical implication of Congress expressing its disapproval of \nthe June rule is to require HCFA to go back and to conduct rulemaking \nin accordance with the intent of Congress as expressed in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 and in keeping with the APA and the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. As part of the rulemaking, HCFA should conduct an \nappropriate initial and final Regulatory Flexibility analysis in \naccordance with Sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. \nCongress enacted these procedural safeguards to require agencies to \nassess the impact of rules such as HCFA's on small entities and to \nensure that agencies choose regulatory approaches that are consistent \nwith the underlying statute while minimizing the impacts on small \nentities to the extent possible. We should pass the resolution we are \nintroducing today to ensure HCFA implements its statutory \nresponsibilities in accordance with the law.\n  While I strongly support the vigorous routing of fraud and abuse \nwhenever and wherever it is found, Congress and HCFA must ensure the \nhighest access to appropriate, high quality home care--because in-home \ncare is the key to fulfilling the desire of virtually all seniors to \nremain independent and in their own homes. Home health provides a \nsafety net for our Nation's elderly and disabled, and Congress must \nensure that these protections continue long into the future.\n  Many of the elderly and disabled being cared for at home would not be \nable to remain there if it were not for the services provided by this \nvital industry. We should clean up the fraud and abuse, not shut the \nindustry or cut off these critical services.\n  It is clear that HCFA must be held accountable, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in beginning this process today. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that a SBA Office of Advocacy letter \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           U.S. Small Business Administration,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1998.\n     Health Care Financing Administration,\n     Department of Health and Human Services,\n     Attn: HCFA-1152-FC, Baltimore, MD.\n       Dear Dockets Management Clerk: On January 5, 1998, the \n     Heath Care Financing Administration (HCFA) published a final \n     rule with comment period concerning surety bond and \n     capitalization requirements for home health care agencies \n     (HHAs). This regulation implements the surety bond \n     requirement for such agencies established in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). The regulation also imposes \n     additional minimum capitalization requirements on the \n     agencies and includes an additional 15 percent surety bond \n     requirements not contained in the BBA. The goal of the BBA \n     and this final rule is to reduce Medicare/Medicaid fraud by \n     regulating HHAs that do not or cannot reimburse Medicare/\n     Medicaid for overpayments.\n       To address complaints by the surety bond industry and the \n     HHA industry regarding the compliance deadline for obtaining \n     surety bonds, HCFA published a final rule on March 4, 1998 \n     deleting the February 27, 1998 effective date for all HHAs to \n     furnish a surety bond. The new compliance date is on or about \n     April 28, 1998, or 60 days after publication of the final \n     rule.\n       In addition, to address complaints by the surety bond \n     industry and members of the Senate Finance Committee \n     regarding the potentially unlimited liability of sureties \n     under the final rule, HCFA published a Notice of Intent to \n     Amend Regulations on March 4, 1998 (concurrently with the \n     final rule to extend the compliance date). The notice \n     announces HCFA's intent to amend the final rule so as to \n     limit the surety's liability under certain circumstances. It \n     also establishes that a surety will only remain liable on a \n     bond for an additional two years after the date an HHA leaves \n     the Medicare/Medicaid program; and gives a surety the right \n     to appeal an overpayment, civil money penalty or an \n     assessment if the HHA fails to pursue its rights of appeal. \n     HCFA claims that the changes will help smaller, reputable \n     HHAs, like non-profit visiting nurse associations, to obtain \n     surety bonds.\n       The Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the U.S. \n     Small Business Administration was created in 1976 to \n     represent the views and interests of small business in \n     federal policy making activities.\\1\\ The Chief Counsel \n     participates in rulemakings when he deems it necessary to \n     ensure proper representation of small business interests. In \n     addition to these responsibilities, the Chief Counsel \n     monitors compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n     (RFA), and works with federal agencies to ensure that their \n     rulemakings demonstrate an analysis of the impact that their \n     decisions will have on small businesses.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Chief Counsel has reviewed the final rules in the \n     instant case and has determined that HCFA has not adequately \n     analyzed the impact on small entities. This determination \n     does not mean that regulating the problem of fraud and abuse \n     is not an important public policy objective. Nor does it mean \n     that small business interests supersede legitimate public \n     policy objectives. Rather, the determination is based on the \n     principle that public policy objectives must be achieved by \n     utilizing recognized administrative procedures. The purpose \n     of the procedures is not to place an unnecessary burden on \n     federal regulatory agencies, but to ensure the promulgation \n     of common sense regulations that do not unduly discourage or \n     destroy competition in the marketplace.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n       The final rule is troubling for a number of reasons: 1) The \n     proposal, although probably within HCFA's regulatory and \n     statutory authority, goes far beyond the requirements \n     contemplated by Congress when they enacted the BBA; 2) HCFA's \n     good cause exception and waiver of the proposed rulemaking \n     may be arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative \n     Procedure Act (APA); and 3) Nearly all of the significant \n     procedural and analytical requirements of the RFA were \n     overlooked.\n       Action requested: Inasmuch as the rule is now final and in \n     effect, the Chief Counsel of the Office of Advocacy herewith \n     petitions the agency, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e), to \n     amend the final rule to exclude the provisions concerning the \n     15 percent bond requirement and the capitalization \n     requirement until such time as a proper and adequate analysis \n     can be prepared to determine the impact on small entities.\n\n\n                   i. legislative history and intent\n\n       Prior to August 5, 1997, there were no provisions in the \n     law pertaining to a surety bond requirement for home health \n     agencies. Under the House bill (The Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997, H.R. 2015), there remained no provisions for the surety \n     bond requirement. Under the Senate bill (as amended) (S. \n     947), a requirement was introduced to provide state Medicaid \n     agencies with surety bonds in amounts not less than $50,000. \n     Finally, in the conference agreement, the final bill was \n     modified to require a surety bond of not less than $50,000, \n     or such comparable surety bond as the Secretary may permit \n     (applicable to home health care services furnished on or \n     after January 1, 1998).\\2\\ Congress, therefore, intended \n     there to be a $50,000 or ``comparable'' bond, but did not \n     intend the bond to be higher.\n       The surety bond issue had not been the subject of public \n     hearings, and some members of Congress expressed concern \n     about the potential impact of the fraud and abuse provisions.\n       According to a floor statement by Senator Hatch, the fraud \n     and abuse provisions found in the amended Senate version were \n     actually based on provisions contained in the Administrations \n     fraud and abuse legislation introduced earlier in 1997, and \n     on which no hearings were held in the Senate. Senator Hatch \n     was concerned that the fraud and abuse provisions might have \n     ``unintended consequences or implications that would penalize \n     innocent parties who are following the letter of the law.'' \n     \\3\\ He further stated that, ``As a general rule, we in the \n     Congress should not act without the full and open benefit of \n     hearings so that all parties have an opportunity to comment, \n     and so that legislation can be modified as appropriate.'' \\4\\ \n     With regard to the surety bond requirement, it seems that the \n     affected business community had no real opportunity to \n     provide meaningful input or comment.\n       After the legislation was enacted, HCFA had little choice \n     but to implement the surety bond requirement. However, the \n     agency created additional bonding and capitalization \n     requirements and incorporated them into the instant final \n     rule.\\5\\ Not only were law abiding home health agencies \n     denied an opportunity to comment during the legislative \n     process, they are now faced with additional burdensome \n     requirements effective almost immediately--with no true \n     recourse (since the agency waived the notice of proposed \n     rulemaking and the 30-day interim effective date).\n       Congress clearly intended to eliminate or reduce waste and \n     fraud in the Medicare/Medicaid system and to preserve quality \n     patient care. The presumably unintended effects of the \n     legislation and HCFA's final rule are that legitimate, law \n     abiding home health agencies will be forced to file \n     bankruptcy, go out of business or curtail their business \n     operations significantly. Patient care will likely suffer \n     when there are not enough home health agencies to meet \n     increasing public demand in an aging population. Moreover, \n     the resulting lack of market competition and bloating of the \n     large, hospital-based and government-based home health \n     agencies may lead to increased prices.\n\n\n                 II. Waiver of Administrative Procedure\n\n       An agency is subject to the notice and comment requirements \n     contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 unless the agency rule is exempt \n     from coverage of the APA, or the agency establishes ``good \n     cause'' for not complying with the APA and waives notice and \n     comment. When an agency waives the notice and comment \n     procedures required by the APA, however, there should be \n     compelling reasons therefor. In fact, courts have held that \n     exceptions to APA procedures are to be ``narrowly construed \n     and only reluctantly countenanced.'' New Jersey v. EPA, 26 \n     F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C.Cir. 1980).\n       In the instant case, the agency waived both the notice and \n     comment requirement and the requirement to allow a 30-day \n     interim period prior to a rules effective date. The agency \n     based its ``good cause'' waiver on three factors: 1) Issuing \n     a proposed rule would be impracticable because Congress \n     mandated that the effective date for the surety bond \n     requirement be January 1, 1998 five months after Congress \n     passed the BBA of 1997; 2) Issuing a proposed rule is \n     unnecessary with respect to Medicare regulations because \n     there is a statutory exception when the implementation \n     deadline is less than 150 days after enactment of the statute \n     in which the deadline is contained; and 3) A delay in issuing \n     the regulations would be contrary to the public interest.\n       First, with regard to the impracticability of issuing a \n     proposed rule, as a general matter, ``strict congressionally \n     imposed deadlines, without more, by no means warrant \n     invocation of the good cause exception.'' Petry v. Block, 737 \n     F.2d 1193, 1203 (D.C.Cir. 1984). In addition, there is no \n     good cause exception where an agency unwilling to provide \n     notice or an opportunity to comment could simply wait until \n     the eve of a statutory .  .  . deadline, then raise up the \n     ``good cause'' banner and promulgate rules without following \n     APA procedures. Council of Southern Mountains, Inc. v. \n     Donovan, 653 F.2d 573, 581 (D.C.Cir. 1981).\n       By way of example, in Petry v. Block, the court concluded \n     that the passage of a complex and extraordinary statute \n     concerning changes in administrative reimbursements under the \n     Child Care Food Program that imposed a 60-day deadline for \n     the promulgation of interim rules justified the agency's \n     invocation of the good cause exception. Also, in Methodist \n     Hospital of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225 1236, (D.C. \n     Cir. 1994), the court stated that the agency had good cause \n     to waive notice and comment because Congress imposed a \n     statutory deadline of about 4\\1/2\\ months ``to implement a \n     complete and radical overhaul of the Medicare reimbursement \n     system.'' (Emphasis added). Moreover, ``[o]nce published, the \n     interim rules took up 133 pages in the Federal Register: 55 \n     pages of explanatory text; 37 pages of revised regulations, \n     and 41 pages of new data tables.'' Id.\n       In the instant case, HCFA had five months to implement a \n     relatively simple provision to require a $50,000 or \n     comparable surety bond from home health agencies. After HCFA \n     added additional bond requirements and capitalization \n     requirements (never requested or contemplated by Congress), \n     the regulation took up 63 pages in the Federal Register: \n     18 pages of explanatory text, 6 pages of revised \n     regulations, and 39 pages of application documents. The \n     final rule appeared in the Federal Register on January 5, \n     1998--four days after the mandatory effective date.\n       The Office of Advocacy opines that if HCFA had not included \n     the additional requirements, which were not intended by \n     Congress, and therefore not intended to be implemented within \n     the five month window, there would have been ample time to \n     follow proper notice and comment procedures. Based on the \n     circumstances of this rulemaking and pointed case law, HCFA \n     cannot rely on the impracticability argument to demonstrate \n     that it had good cause to waive notice and comment.\n       Second, HCFA also based its good cause exception to notice \n     and comment on the fact that they have the statutory \n     authority to do so with regard to this particular type of \n     rule. The agency states: ``Issuing a proposed rule prior to \n     issuing a final rule is also unnecessary with respect to the \n     Medicare surety bond regulation because the Congress has \n     provided that a Medicare rule need not be issued as a \n     proposed rule before issuing a final rule if, as here, a \n     statute establishes a specific deadline for the \n     implementation of a provision and the deadline is less than \n     150 days after the enactment of the statute in which the \n     deadline is contained.'' \\6\\\n       HCFA cannot rely on this statutory provision because the \n     agency has gone way beyond their statutory mandate in issuing \n     this final rule. Again, Congress only intended there to be a \n     $50,000 or comparable surety bond. Therefore, only those \n     provisions contemplated by Congress should be subject to the \n     statute that permits HCFA to waive notice and comment when \n     the deadline is less than 150 days.\n       Third, HCFA claims that a delay in implementing the final \n     rule would be contrary to public policy. Quite the contrary--\n     implementing the final rule as written would be contrary to \n     public policy. The final rule imposes serious economic \n     burdens on an industry already under increased scrutiny and \n     financial hardship including a recent moratorium on entrants \n     to the Medicare program and repeated audits.\\7\\ HCFA has also \n     announced its intention to include home health agencies in \n     the enormously complicated prospective payment system now \n     used by hospitals and physicians. As such, availability of \n     home healthcare for those communities not served by giant \n     hospital-based providers will surely decrease. This result \n     seems contrary to the stated public policy objective of \n     Congress and HCFA.\n       Finally, it should be noted that HCFA did insert a post-\n     effective date comment period in the final rule. However, the \n     fact that HCFA attached a comment period to the final rule is \n     not a valid substitute for the normal provisions of the APA. \n     The third circuit stated that: ``[i]f a period for comments, \n     after issuance of a rule, could cure a violation of the APA's \n     requirements, an agency could negate at will the \n     Congressional decision that notice and an opportunity for \n     comment must precede promulgation. Provisions of prior notice \n     and comment allows effective participation in the rulemaking \n     process while the decision maker is still receptive to \n     information and argument. After the final rule is issued, the \n     petitioner must come hat-in-hand and run the risk that the \n     decision maker is likely to resist change.'' Sharon Steel \n     Corp. v. EPA, 597 F.2d 377, 381 (3rd Cir. 1979).\n       HCFA's waiver of administrative procedure would be less \n     troubling if the rule were not so burdensome. By waiving \n     notice and comment procedures, the agency conveniently \n     removes itself from the obligation to carefully analyze and \n     solicit input on the impact\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n     of the rule. Such an analysis could have yielded other, less \n     burdensome alternatives that would have accomplished the \n     agency's public policy objectives.\n       Since HCFA improperly waived notice and comment, the agency \n     must comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\n\n              III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Requirements\n\n       Even when a regulation is statutorily mandated, agencies \n     are obligated by law to adhere to certain requirements prior \n     to issuing the implementing regulations. Specifically, the \n     RFA requires agencies to analyze the impact of proposed \n     regulations on small entities and consider flexible \n     regulatory alternatives that reduce the burden on small \n     entities--without abandoning the agency's regulatory \n     objectives. Agencies may forgo the analysis if they certify \n     (either in the proposed or final rule) that the rule will not \n     have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \n     small entities. Agency compliance with certain provisions of \n     the RFA is judicially reviewable under section 611 of the \n     RFA.\n       It is not clear from the instant rule whether HCFA has \n     actually certified the rule pursuant to section 605(b) of the \n     RFA or attempted a final regulatory flexibility analysis \n     (FRFA) pursuant to section 604 of the RFA. In either case, \n     the agency failed to comply with the requirements of the RFA.\n       HCFA expresses confusing ``certification-like'' statements \n     throughout the text of the final rule.\\8\\ However, the actual \n     certification and statement of factual basis are not to be \n     found in the final rule. If the agency was attempting to \n     certify, then it did so erroneously for reasons discussed \n     more fully below. On the other hand, perhaps HCFA did not \n     intend to certify, but instead intended to prepare a FRFA. \n     The agency did do some type of analysis: ``we have prepared \n     the following analysis, which in conjunction with other \n     material provided in this preamble, constitutes an analysis \n     under the [RFA].'' 63 Fed. Reg. at 303. The problem with that \n     declaration is that there is more than one type of analysis \n     under the RFA. There is the preliminary assessment analysis \n     which helps agencies determine whether to certify, and in the \n     case of a final rule, there is a FRFA when an agency \n     determines that certification is not appropriate. If HCFA was \n     attempting a FRFA, then the FRFA was not adequate because it \n     contained no analysis of alternatives to reduce the burden on \n     small home health care providers. This, too, is more fully \n     discussed below.\n\n\n                            A. Certification\n\n       When an agency determines and certifies that a rule will \n     not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n     number of small entities, then it is logical to assume that \n     the agency has already performed some basic level of analysis \n     to make that determination. Will a substantial number of \n     small entities be impacted? In the instant case, the agency \n     admits that all home health agencies will be affected. \n     According to SBA's regulations, a small home health care \n     agency is one whose annual receipts do not exceed $5 million, \n     or one which is a not-for-profit organization.\\9\\ Although \n     the Office of Advocacy does not have data based on annual \n     receipts, data is available based on number of employees. \n     1993 data obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census by the \n     Office of Advocacy indicates that about 7% of home health \n     care services (489 out of 6,928) have 500 or more employees \n     and earn 51.2% of all annual receipts for the industry, 93% \n     of home health care services (6,439 out of 6,928) have fewer \n     than 500 employees and earn about 49% of all annual receipts \n     for the industry, and 52.5% of home health care services \n     (3,637 out of 6,928) have fewer than 20 employees and earn \n     6.3% of all annual receipts for the industry. Although it may \n     be difficult to reconcile employment-based and receipt-based \n     size standards, it is still fairly clear from the available \n     data that a substantial number of small entities will be \n     impacted by this final rule.\n       Will there be a significant economic impact? To determine \n     whether the final rule is likely to have a significant \n     economic impact, further analysis is required. It is not \n     enough to claim that elimination of fraud and abuse in the \n     Medicare/Medicaid system outweighs the need for further \n     analysis. It is not enough to assume that only those agencies \n     with ``past aberrant billing activities'' will be impacted. \n     It is not enough to say that reducing a surety's liability \n     means that there will not be a significant economic impact on \n     home health agencies. The Office of Advocacy opines that the \n     agency's ``analysis'' was doomed from the outset because of \n     the agency's flawed assumptions about the number and type of \n     small entities likely to be impacted, and about the cost of \n     compliance.\n       Which small entities will be impacted? The agency did not \n     take the basic and necessary step of adequately explaining \n     why other small entities (presumably those whose billing \n     practices are not ``aberrant'') will not be affected or \n     whether small home health providers are even the primary \n     offenders. At the least, the agency must consider the impact \n     the bonding requirement will have on all small home health \n     providers and not just the ones with ``aberrant'' billing \n     practices. After all, the majority of home health agencies \n     apparently do not have aberrant billing practices. HCFA \n     presents evidence that, in 1996, Medicare overpayments were 7 \n     percent of all claims paid to HHAs, and of that 7 percent, 14 \n     percent remained uncollected by Medicare. Fourteen percent of \n     7 percent is .0098.\\10\\ In other words, Medicare fails to \n     collect overpayments less than one percent of the time. \n     Despite this extremely low occurrence of failure to collect \n     overpayments, HCFA deemed it necessary to place extremely \n     costly and burdensome requirements on the entire industry. \n     However, HCFA did not identify what percentage of the \n     industry is contributing to the fraud problem, whether \n     certain offenders were recidivist, or whether those offenders \n     are primarily large or small.\n       With regard to the capitalization requirement, HCFA states \n     that, ``An organization that is earnest in its attempt to be \n     a financially sound provider of home health services under \n     the Medicare program will already be properly capitalized \n     without the need for Medicare to require such \n     capitalization.'' This statement is basically true. However, \n     the issue of adequate capitalization is relative and fungible \n     because it is based on a number of factors like varying \n     overhead costs, location, profit margins, competition in the \n     area, etc. Surely some home health agencies cannot meet the \n     capitalization requirements set by HCFA, but desire to be \n     ``earnest'' in their efforts to be ``sound providers.'' The \n     capitalization requirement is a barrier to market entry for \n     all new home health agencies and not just the ones who enter \n     the market for purposes of defrauding Medicare. A careful \n     look at the questions like the ones raised in this and the \n     preceding paragraph would have yielded a conclusion that the \n     rule would have a significant economic impact on a \n     substantial number of small businesses.\n       Congress weighed in on the issue of impact after the final \n     rule is published. Even members of Congress recognized that \n     HCFA went beyond its mandate and imposed a significant \n     economic burden on home health agencies. Specifically, a bi-\n     partisan group of three senators from the Senate from the \n     Senate Finance Committee, on January 26, 1998, asked HCFA to \n     delay and modify the requirement that all home health \n     agencies secure a surety bond. The Senators believed that \n     home health agencies would not be able to obtain bonds by the \n     original February 27 deadline. According to a recent news \n     article, the senators reportedly wrote that:\n       ``HCFA has imposed conditions that go beyond the standard \n     in the surety bond industry. Some of the biggest problems \n     include cumulative liability, a short period of time in which \n     to pay claims, and bond values of 15 percent of the previous \n     year's Medicare revenues with no maximum, the letter said.\n       `The cumulative effect is that many surety companies are \n     opting not to offer bonds to Medicare [home health agencies] \n     at all', the letter said. `Those companies which are offering \n     the bonds are doing so at a cost which is prohibitive, or \n     with demands for collateral or personal guarantees that HHAs \n     cannot provide.'\n       The letter said Congress enacted the surety bond \n     requirement to keep risky agencies out of the Medicare \n     program. However, HCFA's rule seems to use the bonds as \n     security for overpayments to providers, the letter said.\n       `We simply doubt that it is realistic to expect bonding \n     companies to embrace a role as guarantors for overpayments \n     from HCFA,' the senators wrote.''\\11\\\n       It should be fairly obvious to HCFA, as it was to these \n     members of Congress, that obtaining a $50,000/15 percent bond \n     in addition to the 3-month reserve capitalization requirement \n     (where there were no such requirements before) is likely to \n     be prohibitively costly for small home health care \n     providers--particularly new providers or providers operation \n     only a few years that typically have few hard assets and \n     relatively little credit.\\12\\ Moreover, most home health \n     patients are Medicare patients. If a home health agency is \n     not Medicare certified, then it is very difficult to attract \n     patients, and without patients, there is no opportunity to \n     increase capital. There is already a requirement in many \n     states (pursuant to ``Operation Restore Trust'') that home \n     health agencies have a minimum number of patients prior to \n     obtaining a Medicare license. How can these small home health \n     agencies absorb losses on these ten patients (--possibly long \n     term patients requiring multiple services several times per \n     week--), never be reimbursed for services to these patients, \n     and continue to raise capital? It's a vicious circle and \n     there is a tremendous cumulative effect of all the various \n     state and federal regulations. In any event, it seems that \n     with only a cursory analysis and a little industry outreach, \n     HCFA should have been able to determine that the final rule \n     would have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n     number of small entities. Therefore, under the RFA, HCFA \n     should have prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis \n     with all the required elements for that analysis.\n\n\n                B. FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS\n\n       The preparation of a FRFA may be delayed but not waived. \n     Section 608(b) of the RFA reads: ``Except as provided in \n     section 605(b) [where an agency certifies that there will be \n     no significant economic impact on a substantial number of \n     small entities], an agency head may delay the completion of \n     the requirements of section 604 of this title [regarding the \n     preparation of FRFAs] for a period of not more than one \n     hundred and eighty days after the date of publication in the \n     Federal Register of a final rule by publishing in the Federal \n     Register, not later than such date of publication, a written \n     finding, with reasons therefor, that the final rule is being \n     promulgated in response to an emergency that makes timely \n     compliance with\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\n     the provisions of section 604 of this title impracticable. If \n     the agency has not prepared a final regulatory analysis \n     pursuant to section 604 of this title within one hundred and \n     eighty days from the date of publication of the final rule, \n     such rule shall lapse and have no effect. Such rule shall not \n     be repromulgated until a final regulatory flexibility \n     analysis has been completed by the agency.''\n       FRFAs may not be waived because they serve a vital function \n     in the regulatory process. The preparation of a FRFA allows \n     an agency to carefully tailor its regulations and avoid \n     unnecessary and costly requirements while maintaining \n     important public policy objectives. Without a careful \n     analysis--which should include things like data, public \n     comments and a full description of costs--agencies would be \n     operating in a vacuum without sufficient information to \n     develop suitable alternatives.\n       Since the agency did not issue a proposed rule, the agency \n     had an obligation to consider carefully all of the \n     significant comments regarding the impact of the final rule. \n     After all, the agency was apparently unsure of the \n     impact.\\13\\ The congressional letter should have been some \n     indication that there would be a significant economic impact \n     and that further analysis was required. HCFA did extend the \n     deadline for obtaining a surety bond for 60 days, and in some \n     ways limited the liability of sureties. However, the agency \n     did not change the bond or capitalization requirements, or \n     explain why such changes were not feasible. Inasmuch as the \n     agency failed to heed any of the comments regarding impact--\n     even those from Congress--the comment period served no real \n     function here.\n       The dearth of information regarding less costly \n     alternatives is possibly the most serious defect in the \n     analysis presented. To begin with, HCFA never demonstrated \n     why the $50,000 bond was insufficient or would not accomplish \n     the objective of discouraging bad actors from entering the \n     Medicare program. The agency did not demonstrate why the 15 \n     percent rule would not cause a significant economic impact--\n     particularly when the $50,000 bond amount changed from a \n     maximum level to a maximum level. There is no evidence that \n     HCFA attempted to find less costly alternatives. Before \n     heaping on additional regulations, would it not be prudent to \n     first determine whether the programs and policies recently \n     put in place by the Administration, and the prospective \n     payment rules yet to come will work?\n\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       Not everyone in the home health industry is a bad actor. \n     More importantly, home health providers that cannot afford to \n     comply with HCFA's regulations are not necessarily bad actors \n     either. HCFA has twisted Congress' intent and changed the \n     rule into a vehicle for punishing legitimate home health \n     agencies and for securing overpayments by Medicare rather \n     than a vehicle to discourage bad actors from entering the \n     Medicare program. There must be a middle ground--a place \n     where legitimate home health providers can survive and \n     compete in the marketplace, and where fraud and abuse can be \n     controlled. This final rule is not that place.\n       Therefore, the Office of Advocacy petitions HCFA to amend \n     its final rule to remove the 15% bonding requirement and the \n     capitalization requirement until such time as proper notice \n     and comment procedures can be completed. Thank you for your \n     prompt attention to this urgent matter. Please contact our \n     office if we may assist you in your efforts to comply with \n     the RFA on this or any other rule effecting small entities, \n     202-205-6533.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jere W.

The other major \n     requirement for new the HHAs is for minimum capitalization. \n     The amount of the reserve is to be determined by Medicare \n     intermediaries based on the first year experience of other \n     HHAs. First the intermediary determines an average cost per \n     visit based on first-year cost report data for at least three \n     HHAs that it serves that are comparable to the HHA seeking to \n     enter the Medicare program. The average cost per visit is \n     determined by dividing the sum of the total reported costs of \n     care for all patients of the HHAs by the sum of their total \n     visits. Then, the intermediary multiplies the average cost \n     per visit by the projected number of visits for all patients \n     (Medicare. Medicaid and all other patients) for the first \n     three months of operation of the HHA asking to inter the \n     program. HCFA also designates which funds count toward \n     satisfying the capitalization requirement (--fifty percent of \n     the funds required for capitalization must be non-borrowed \n     funds) Medicare expects those funds to be available in cash \n     or, in some cases short term highly liquid cash equivalents.\n     \\6\\ 63 Fed.

See 63 \n     Fed. Reg. at 304.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nBond-Baucus-Grassley Joint Resolution introduced today that nullifies a \nregulation which threatens to put many of my state's home health \nagencies, or HHAs, out of business. Our resolution officially \ndisapproves the regulation issued by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration on June 1 of this year. The rule requires each home \nhealth agency that receives Medicare reimbursement to buy a costly \nsurety bond. This expensive bond is out of reach for many of the \nagencies that provide in-home service to Montana's elderly and low \nincome residents.\n  Let me say from the outset that I support the provision in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 requiring HHAs to post a surety bond for \nMedicare and Medicaid. Perhaps we need to make some changes to the \nstatute, but the underlying idea--to protect the Medicare program by \nrequiring home health agencies to post a bond--is a good one. \nUnfortunately, the regulation HCFA plans to implement requires a much \nhigher bond amount.\n  One Montana home health agency based in Butte would have to post a \nbond of more than $600,000 under the HCFA regulation. That's an \noutrage. And it will put that company, and many others across the \ncountry, out of business.\n  I am also concerned that HCFA has incorrectly interpreted \nCongressional intent by using the bonds to collect on Medicare \noverpayments, not just fraud. As a result, many HHA owners are being \nasked to put up personal assets, such as their house, as collateral for \nthe bond. These agencies tend to be non-hospital based and not tied to \na larger corporate structure. All have far less than $600,000 in \npersonal and business assets. We shouldn't expect anyone to sign over \nthose assets just to do business in the Medicare program.\n  Also, many HHAs are family-owned small businesses. We cannot let any \nfederal regulation force small businesses to close their door. This not \nonly affects businesses, but also their customers--our bed-ridden \nelderly.\n  That is why we have acted here today. The Bond-Baucus-Grassley \nresolution will invoke the Congressional\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nReview Act to disapprove HCFA's regulation. And I urge quick action in \nthe Senate on this important matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S.J. Res. 51. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \nthe Potomac Highlands Airport Authority Compact entered into between \nthe Stats of Maryland and West Virginia; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              POTOMAC HIGHLANDS AIRPORT AUTHORITY COMPACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ntogether with my colleagues Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, and Mikulski to \ngrant Congressional consent to a Compact entered into between the \nStates of West Virginia and Maryland that established the Potomac \nHighlands Airport Authority. The purpose of this legislation is to help \nfacilitate a regional approach to the operations, use, management and \nfuture development of the Greater Cumberland Regional Airport.\n  Greater Cumberland Regional Airport is an important transportation \nhub serving the commercial, general aviation and corporate communities \nin the tri-state area of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It \nis not only an essential link in the region's transportation network, \nbut a critical part of the strategy to attract new business and tourism \nto the area.\n  The airport was established in 1944, when the City of Cumberland, \nMaryland purchased property in Wiley Ford, WV--three miles south of \nCumberland--and began construction of airport facilities. \nUnfortunately, this unusual situation--a commercial service airport \nlocated in one state while owned by a local unit of government in a \ncontiguous state--has greatly complicated the operation, financing and \ndevelopment of the airport over the years. With two states, two \ncounties and two municipalities having jurisdiction over different \naspects of the airport and enforcing different laws, taxing authorities \nand regulations, it was difficult, at best, to transcend the political \nand boundary lines and achieve a consensus on the future of the \nairport.\n  In order to address this situation, in 1976, the General Assemblies \nof the State of Maryland and the State of West Virginia enacted a bi-\nstate compact authorizing creation of a public agency known as the \nPotomac Highlands Airport Authority (PHAA) to govern and operate the \nairport. However, no action was taken to implement that Compact until \n1990, when the two states, the Board of County Commissioners of \nAllegany County, Maryland and Mineral County, West Virginia and the \nMayor and City Council of Cumberland, Maryland signed an \nintergovernmental agreement to transfer airport management and control \nto the Authority and changed the name to the Greater Cumberland \nRegional Airport.\n  Since that time, the Potomac Highlands Airport Authority has actively \nmaintained and operated the airport, and has been working to develop \nand implement a 20-year, $10 million airport modernization and \nexpansion program designed to facilitate current operations and \nanticipated growth in utilization of the facility. In the process of \nseeking investment capital, loans and airport development grants, \nquestions have been raised by the Federal Aviation Administration, USDA \nRural Development, and others about the Authority's eligibility to \nfunction as legal sponsor for the airport and borrow money and give \nsecurity, absent Congressional Consent to the Interstate Compact which \nestablished the Authority.\n  Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution requires Congressional \napproval of compacts between States and Bond Counsel for the airport \nhas recommended that the Compact creating the Airport Authority receive \nthe consent of Congress in order to provide some certainty as to the \nlegal status of the airport and to permit the Authority to borrow \nfunds.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would ratify the Interstate \nCompact enacted by Maryland and West Virginia in 1976 and reaffirmed in \nthe 1990 Intergovernmental Agreement. It will allow the Potomac \nHighlands Airport Authority to fully exercise the powers and authority \nset forth by the Compact and to provide a truly regional approach to \nthe operation, use and future development of the airport. It will help \nadvance the public interest by ensuring the future viability of Greater \nCumberland Regional Airport to serve the transportation needs of the \ntri-state area.\n  I urge the swift enactment of this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                             S.

COMMISSION OF JURISTS ON TIBET AND ON \n               UNITED STATES POLICY WITH REGARD TO TIBET\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Mack, Mr. \nWellstone, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 103\n\n       Whereas the International Commission of Jurists is a non-\n     governmental organization founded in 1952 to defend the Rule \n     of Law throughout the world and to work towards the full \n     observance of the provisions in the Universal Declaration of \n     Human Rights;\n       Whereas in 1959, 1960, and 1964 the International \n     Commission of Jurists examined Chinese policy in Tibet, \n     violations of human rights in Tibet, and the position of \n     Tibet in international law;\n       Whereas in 1960, the International Commission of Jurists \n     found ``that acts of genocide had been committed in Tibet in \n     an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group,...'' \n     and concluded that Tibet was at least ``a de facto \n     independent State'' prior to 1951 and that Tibet was a \n     ``legitimate concern of the United Nations even on the \n     restrictive interpretation of matters `essentially within the \n     domestic jurisdiction' of a State.'',\n       Whereas these findings were presented to the United Nations \n     General Assembly, which adopted three resolutions (1959, \n     1961, and 1965) calling on the People's Republic of China to \n     ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of the \n     Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and \n     religious life, and to cease practices which deprive the \n     Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms \n     including their right to self-determination;\n       Whereas in December 1997, the International Commission of \n     Jurists issued a fourth report on Tibet, examining human \n     rights and the rule of law, including self-determination;\n       Whereas the President has repeatedly indicated his support \n     for substantive dialogue between the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives;\n       Whereas on October 31, 1997, the Secretary of State \n     appointed a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to oversee \n     United States policy regarding Tibet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representative \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses grave concern regarding the findings of the \n     December 1997 International Commission of Jurists report on \n     Tibet that----\n       (a) repression in Tibet has increased steadily since 1994, \n     resulting in heightened control on religious activity; a \n     denunciation campaign against the Dalai Lama unprecedented \n     since the Cultural Revolution; an increase in political \n     arrests; suppression of peaceful protests; and an accelerated \n     movement of Chinese to Tibet; and\n       (b) in 1997, the People's Republic of China labeled the \n     Tibetan Buddhist culture, which has flourished in Tibet since \n     the seventh century, as a ``foreign culture'' in order to \n     facilitate indoctrination of Tibetans in Chinese socialist \n     ideology and the process of national and cultural \n     extermination;\n       (2) support the recommendations contained in the report \n     referred to in paragraph (1) that----\n       (a) call on the People's Republic of China----\n       (i) to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives on a solution to the question of Tibet based \n     on the will of the Tibetan people;\n       (ii) to ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of \n     the Tibetan people; and\n       (iii) to end those practices which threaten to erode the \n     distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the \n     Tibetan people and, in particular, to cease policies which \n     result in the movement of Chinese people to Tibetan \n     territory;\n       (b) call on the United Nations General Assembly to resume \n     its debate on the question of Tibet based on its resolutions \n     of 1959, 1961, and 1965, and to hold a referendum in Tibet; \n     and\n       (c) calls on the Dalai Lama or his representatives to enter \n     into discussions with the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China on a solution to the question of Tibet based on the \n     will of the Tibetan people;\n       (3) commends the appointment by the Secretary of State of a \n     United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues----\n       (a) to promote substantive dialogue between the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives;\n       (b) to coordinate United States Government policies, \n     programs, and projects concerning Tibet;\n       (c) to consult with the Congress on policies relevant to \n     Tibet and the future and welfare of all Tibetan people, and \n     to report to Congress in partial fulfillment of the \n     requirements of Sec. 536(a) of Public Law 103-236; and\n       (d) to advance United States policy which seeks to protect \n     the unique religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage of \n     Tibet, and to encourage improved respect for Tibetan human \n     rights;\n       (4) calls on the People's Republic of China to release from \n     detention the 9-year old Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, \n     to his home in Tibet from which he was taken on May 17, 1995, \n     and to allow him to pursue his religious studies without \n     interference and according to tradition; and\n       (5) call on the President, as a central objective of the \n     1998 presidential submit meeting with Jiang Zemin in Beijing, \n     to secure an agreement to begin substantive negotiations \n     between the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     the Dalai Lama or his representatives.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I offer a resolution which speaks to \nmany of the issues now facing the Tibetan people in their long \nstruggle. This has been threatened for a half-century now, but there \nare efforts underway to resolve these issues. This resolution puts the \nCongress on record in support of these goals.\n  Begin with the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), which has \nclosely followed the situation in Tibet since the Dalai Lama was forced \nto flee into exile. In 1959, 1960, and 1964, the ICJ examined Chinese \npolicies in Tibet and reported its findings to the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations. The 1960 report made the important international \nlegal determination that ``acts of genocide had been committed\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nin Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group . . \n.'' and concluded that Tibet was at least ``a de facto independent \nState'' prior to 1951.\n  Now the ICJ has returned to the issue of Tibet and produced another \nimportant report. It finds that repression in Tibet has increased since \n1994. This is an assessment which my daughter Maura shares after having \nvisited Tibet and having worked closely for many years with Tibetan \nrefugees who continue to make the dangerous journey over the Himalayan \nmountains to flee persecution in their homeland.\n  In 1996 she returned from Tibet to report,\n\n       . . . in recent months Beijing's leaders have renewed their \n     assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with and \n     alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the \n     Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--\n     reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign \n     to vilify the Dalai Lama.\n\n  The Dalai Lama, of course, remains unstained, but it is time for the \nChinese to consider a policy of ``constructive engagement'' of their \nown--with the Tibetans. The recent ICJ report calls on the People's \nRepublic of China to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \nrepresentatives on a solution to the question of Tibet. Mr. President, \nfor many years now, the United States Congress has been calling for \nexactly this. I hope that while the President is in China, he will be \nable to convey the importance of this issue to secure a commitment from \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China to begin such \ndiscussions with the Tibetans.\n  In 1979, Deng Xiaoping stated that ``except for the independence of \nTibet, all other questions can be negotiated.'' The Dalai Lama has \nrepeatedly stated his unambiguous willingness to begin substantive \nnegotiations with the Chinese without preconditions, and that the issue \nof independence need not be on the agenda. This is not a concession \neasily made by the leader of the Tibetan people who, as the ICJ \nconcluded in 1960, enjoyed de facto independence before the Chinese \ntake-over. Nonetheless, he has made the offer sincerely, and \nrepeatedly, and deserves a sincere response.\n  The United States can help elicit such a response. In addition to the \nopportunity posed by the upcoming visit by the President, we now have a \nSpecial Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Gregory B. Craig, whom \nSecretary Albright appointed to achieve just such a result. A special \ncoordinator is something that our beloved Claiborne Pell proposed in \nthe 103d Congress and I am glad we have been able to achieve another \none of his aspirations. Having a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues \nwill better enable the Administration to facilitate a dialogue between \nthe Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.\n  Finally, Mr. President, atheists are rarely involved in choosing \ndivine leaders, but the Chinese Communist Party has not only involved \nitself in the selection of the eleventh Panchen Lama, but Chinese \nofficials have asserted that it is the party's sole right to make the \nselection, and they have detained the boy the Dalai Lama recognized as \nthe next Panchen Lama. This resolution calls attention to this odious \ninfringement on religious freedom.\n  The Tibetans--I think I am correct in saying--above all value their \nability to practice religion. Religion infuse every aspect of Tibetan \nculture. We cannot begin to comprehend the affront to Tibetans of \nhaving an important religious figure detained and declared illegitimate \nby the Communist Party. Add to that affront that another boy is \nproduced by the Party and proclaimed as the religious leader.\n  This resolution calls for the release of 9-year old Gedhun Choekyi \nNyima, the boy selected by the Dalai Lama as the next Panchen Lama, who \nhas been under detention for 3 years.\n  The Senate has always maintained strong support for the Tibetan \ncause. This resolution continues that tradition. I especially wish to \nthank my colleague, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Helms, for his outstanding leadership on this issue. We are \nalso joined in this effort by Senators Leahy, Mack, Wellstone, and \nFeingold. I thank them for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6053-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 246--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  (Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and by providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203.

LOOK-BACK ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning no later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (d)(1), to determine--\n       (1) the percentage of all young individuals who used a type \n     of tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of young individuals who identify each \n     brand of each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     that type smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Annual Determination.--The Secretary shall make an \n     annual determination, based on the annual performance survey \n     conducted under subsection (a), of whether the required \n     percentage reductions in underage use of tobacco products for \n     a year have been achieved for the year involved. The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     publication or release in other form.\n       (d) Methodolgy.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) based on the \n     point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     tobacco product of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary shall determine the industry-wide \n     non-attainment percentage for cigarettes and for smokeless \n     tobacco for each calendar year.\n       (2) Non-attainment surcharge for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the percentage reduction in underage \n     use required by section 203(b) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers as \n     follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                If the non-attainment percentage is:

smokeless tobacco.--For \n     each year in which the percentage reduction in underage use \n     required by section 203c) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on smokeless tobacco product \n     manufacturers as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                If the non-attainment percentage is:                             The surcharge is:              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot more than 5 percentage points                                    $4,000,000

$200,000,000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (4) Strict liability; joint and several liability.--\n     Liability for any surcharge imposed under subsection (e) \n     shall be--\n       (A) strict liability; and\n       (B) joint and several liability--\n       (i) among all cigarette manufacturers for surcharges \n     imposed under subsection (e)(2); and\n       (ii) among all smokeless tobacco manufacturers for \n     surcharges imposed under subsection (e)(3).\n       (5) Surcharge liability among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall make \n     such allocations according to each manufacturer's share of \n     the domestic cigarette or domestic smokeless tobacco market, \n     as appropriate, in the year for which the surcharge is being \n     assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (f) Manufacturer-specific Surcharges.--\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n       (1) Required percentage reductions.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall reduce the \n     percentage of young individuals who use such manufacturer's \n     brand or brands as their usual brand in accordance with the \n     required percentage reductions described under subsections \n     (b) (with respect to cigarettes) and (c ) (with respect to \n     smokeless tobacco).\n       (2) Application to less popular brands.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for which the \n     base incidence percentage is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level shall ensure that the percent prevalence of \n     young individuals who use the manufacturer's tobacco products \n     as their usual brand remains equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the percentage \n     reduction necessary to reduce the actual percent prevalence \n     of young individuals identifying a brand of such tobacco \n     product of such manufacturer as the usual brand smoked or \n     used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Cigarettes.--For a cigarette manufacturer, the amount \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge shall be an amount \n     equal to the manufacturer's share of youth incidence for \n     cigarettes

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that \n     results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and \n     adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) The citizens of the several States are exposed to, and \n     adversely affected by, environmental smoke in public \n     buildings and other facilities which imposes a burden on \n     interstate commerce.\n       (13) Civil actions against tobacco product manufacturers \n     and others are pending in Federal and State courts arising \n     from the use, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Among \n     these actions are cases brought by the attorneys general of \n     more than 40 States, certain cities and counties, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other parties, including \n     Indian tribes, and class actions brought by private claimants \n     (such as in the Castano Civil Actions), seeking to recover \n     monies expended to treat tobacco-related diseases and for the \n     protection of minors and consumers, as well as penalties and \n     other relief for violations of antitrust, health, consumer \n     protection, and other laws.\n       (14) Civil actions have been filed throughout the United \n     States against tobacco product manufacturers and their \n     distributors, trade associations, law firms, and consultants \n     on behalf of individuals or classes of individuals claiming \n     to be dependent upon and injured by tobacco products.\n       (15) These civil actions are complex, time-consuming, \n     expensive, and burdensome for both the litigants and Federal \n     and State courts. To date, these civil actions have not \n     resulted in sufficient redress for smokers or non-\n     governmental third-party payers. To the extent that \n     governmental entities have been or may in the future be \n     compensated for tobacco-related claims they have brought, it \n     is not now possible to identify what portions of such past or \n     future recoveries can be attributed to their various \n     antitrust, health, consumer protection, or other causes of \n     action.\n       (16) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     comprehensive public health legislation because of tobacco's \n     unique position in the Nation's history and economy; the need \n     to prevent the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising \n     of tobacco products to persons under the minimum legal age to \n     purchase such products; and the need to educate the public, \n     especially young people, regarding the health effects of \n     using tobacco products.\n       (17) The public interest requires a timely, fair, \n     equitable, and consistent result that will serve the public \n     interest by (A) providing that a portion of the costs of \n     treatment for diseases and adverse health effects associated \n     with the use of tobacco products is borne by the \n     manufacturers of these products, and (B) restricting \n     throughout the Nation the sale, distribution, marketing, and \n     advertising of tobacco products only to persons of legal age \n     to purchase such products.\n       (18) Public health authorities estimate that the benefits \n     to the Nation of enacting Federal legislation to accomplish \n     these goals would be significant in human and economic terms.\n       (19) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths each year and \n     save up to $43 billion each year in reduced medical costs, \n     improved productivity, and the avoidance of premature deaths.\n       (20) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (21) In 1995, the tobacco industry spent close to \n     $4,900,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (22) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (23) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (24) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (25) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (26) Tobacco advertising increases the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including increasing tobacco use by young people.\n       (27) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and \n     children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a \n     character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (28) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market.\n       (29) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (30) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (31) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones. Text-only \n     requirements, while not as stringent as a ban, will help \n     reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the \n     informational function of advertising.\n       (32) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (33) If, as a direct or indirect result of this Act, the \n     consumption of tobacco products in the United States is \n     reduced significantly, then tobacco farmers, their families, \n     and their communities may suffer economic hardship and \n     displacement, notwithstanding their lack of involvement in \n     the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products.\n       (34) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the authority of the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to require the tobacco industry to fund both Federal \n     and State oversight of the tobacco industry from on-going \n     payments by tobacco product manufacturers;\n       (3) to require tobacco product manufacturers to provide \n     ongoing funding to be used for an aggressive Federal, State, \n     and local enforcement program and for a nationwide licensing \n     system to prevent minors from obtaining tobacco products and \n     to prevent the unlawful distribution of tobacco products, \n     while expressly permitting the States to\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\n     adopt additional measures that further restrict or eliminate \n     the products' use;\n       (4) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     States may continue to address issues of particular concern \n     to public health officials, especially the use of tobacco by \n     young people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (5) to impose financial surcharges on tobacco product \n     manufacturers if tobacco use by young people does not \n     substantially decline;\n       (6) to authorize appropriate agencies of the Federal \n     government to set national standards controlling the \n     manufacture of tobacco products and the identity, public \n     disclosure, and amount of ingredients used in such products;\n       (7) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that the tobacco industry makes efforts to develop and \n     introduce less harmful tobacco products;\n       (8) to confirm the Food and Drug Administration's authority \n     to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful \n     components of tobacco products;\n       (9) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to \n     require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (10) to impose on tobacco product manufacturers the \n     obligation to provide funding for a variety of public health \n     initiatives;\n       (11) to establish a minimum Federal standard for stringent \n     restrictions on smoking in public places, while also to \n     permit State, Tribal, and local governments to enact \n     additional and more stringent standards or elect not to be \n     covered by the Federal standard if that State's standard is \n     as protective, or more protective, of the public health;\n       (12) to authorize and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a continuing national counter-advertising and \n     tobacco control campaign which seeks to educate consumers and \n     discourage children and adolescents from beginning to use \n     tobacco products, and which encourages current users of \n     tobacco products to discontinue using such products;\n       (13) to establish a mechanism to compensate the States in \n     settlement of their various claims against tobacco product \n     manufacturers;\n       (14) to authorize and to fund from payments by tobacco \n     product manufacturers a nationwide program of smoking \n     cessation administered through State and Tribal governments \n     and the private sector;\n       (15) to establish and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a National Tobacco Fund;\n       (16) to affirm the rights of individuals to access to the \n     courts, to civil trial by jury, and to damages to compensate \n     them for harm caused by tobacco products;\n       (17) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (18) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry; and\n       (19) to protect tobacco farmers and their communities from \n     the economic impact of this Act by providing full funding for \n     and the continuation of the Federal tobacco program and by \n     providing funds for farmers and communities to develop new \n     opportunities in tobacco-dependent communities.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The Secretary shall amend the designation of authority \n     in such regulations in accordance with this subsection.\n       (b) Limitation on Advisory Opinions.--As of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the following documents issued by the \n     Food and Drug Administration shall not constitute advisory \n     opinions under section 10.85(d)(1) of title 21, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, except as they apply to tobacco \n     products, and shall not be cited by the Secretary or the Food \n     and Drug Administration as binding precedent.\n       (1) The preamble to the proposed rule in the document \n     entitled ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution \n     of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products to Protect \n     Children and Adolescents'' (60 Fed.

Reg. 41453-41787 (August 11, 1995)).\n       (3) The preamble to the final rule in the document entitled \n     ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of \n     Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and \n     Adolescents'' (61 Fed.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203. GOALS FOR REDUCING UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE.\n\n       (a) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required percentage reductions in underage use of \n     tobacco products set forth in this title are achieved.\n       (b) Required Reductions for Cigarettes.--With respect to \n     cigarettes, the required percentage reduction in underage \n     use, as set forth in section 204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage  \n                                                                                   Cigarette Use                \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                         15 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         30 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     50 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                60 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (c) Required Reductions for Smokeless Tobacco.--With \n     respect to smokeless tobacco products, the required \n     percentage reduction in underage use, as set forth in section \n     204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage  \n                                                                               Smokeless Tobacco Use            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                       12.5 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         25 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     35 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                45 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     SEC. 204. LOOK-BACK ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning no later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (d)(1), to determine--\n       (1) the percentage of all young individuals who used a type \n     of tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of young individuals who identify each \n     brand of each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     that type smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Annual Determination.--The Secretary shall make an \n     annual determination, based on the annual performance survey \n     conducted under subsection (a), of whether the required \n     percentage reductions in underage use of tobacco products for \n     a year have been achieved for the year involved. The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     publication or release in other form.\n       (d) Methodolgy.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) be a household-based, in person survey (which may \n     include computer-assisted technology);\n       (C) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (D) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (E) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) based on the \n     point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     tobacco product of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(E) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary shall determine the industry-wide \n     non-attainment percentage for cigarettes and for smokeless \n     tobacco for each calendar year.\n       (2) Non-attainment surcharge for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the percentage reduction in underage \n     use required by section 203b) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers as \n     follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    If the non-attainment percentage is:          The surcharge is:

which the percentage reduction in underage use \n     required by section 203c) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on smokeless tobacco product \n     manufacturers as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    If the non-attainment percentage is:          The surcharge is:

under subsection (e) \n     shall be--\n       (A) strict liability; and\n       (B) joint and several liability--\n       (i) among all cigarette manufacturers for surcharges \n     imposed under subsection (e)(2); and\n       (ii) among all smokeless tobacco manufacturers for \n     surcharges imposed under subsection (e)(3).\n       (5) Surcharge liability among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall make \n     such allocations according to each manufacturer's share of \n     the domestic cigarette or domestic smokeless tobacco market, \n     as appropriate, in the year for which the surcharge is being \n     assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (f) Manufacturer-specific Surcharges.--\n       (1) Required percentage reductions.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall reduce the \n     percentage of young individuals who use such manufacturer's \n     brand or brands as their usual brand in accordance with the \n     required percentage reductions described under subsections \n     (b) (with respect to cigarettes) and (c ) (with respect to \n     smokeless tobacco).\n       (2) Application to less popular brands.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for which the \n     base incidence percentage is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level shall ensure that the percent prevalence of \n     young individuals who use the manufacturer's tobacco products \n     as their usual brand remains equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed.

One month \n     after the end of the calendar year, the Secretary shall make \n     a final determination of each tobacco product manufacturer's \n     applicable base amount payment obligation.\n       (3) Calculation of tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     annual payment.--The share of the annual payment apportioned \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer shall be equal to that \n     manufacturer's share of adjusted units, taking into account \n     the manufacturer's total production of such units sold in the \n     domestic market. A tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     adjusted units shall be determined as follows:\n       (A) Units.--A tobacco product manufacturer's number of \n     units shall be determined by counting each--\n       (i) pack of 20 cigarettes as 1 adjusted unit;\n       (ii) 1.2 ounces of moist snuff as 0.75 adjusted unit; and\n       (iii) 3 ounces of other smokeless tobacco product as 0.35 \n     adjusted units.\n       (B) Determination of adjusted units.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), a smokeless tobacco product manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units shall be determined under the \n     following table:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             For units:                                    Each unit shall be treated as:       \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot exceeding 150 million                                                                          70% of a unit\nExceeding 150 million                                                                             100% of a unit\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (C) Adjusted units determined on total domestic \n     production.--For purposes of determining a manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units under subparagraph (B), a \n     manufacturer's total production of units, whether intended \n     for domestic consumption or export, shall be taken into \n     account.\n       (D) Special rule for large manufacturers.--If a tobacco \n     product manufacturer has more than 200 million units under \n     subparagraph (A), then that manufacturer's number of adjusted \n     units shall be equal to the total number of units, and not \n     determined under subparagraph (B).\n       (E) Smokeless equivalency study.--Not later than January 1, \n     2003, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report \n     detailing the extent to which youths are substituting \n     smokeless tobacco products for cigarettes.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted unites as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n     SEC. 404.

TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.\n\n       All payments made under section 402 are ordinary and \n     necessary business expenses for purposes of chapter 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the year in which such \n     payments are made, and no part thereof is either in \n     settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine or \n     penalty (civil or criminal) or the cost of a tangible or \n     intangible asset or other future benefit.\n\n     SEC. 406.

TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may \n     discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any \n     employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, \n     benefits, or privileges of employment because the employee \n     (or any person acting under a request of the employee)--\n       (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local \n     public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged \n     violation of this or any other Act;\n       (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such \n     Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality \n     to the manufacturer;\n       (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State \n     proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of \n     such Acts;\n       (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to \n     commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such \n     Acts, or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement \n     of any requirement imposed under such Acts;\n       (5) testified or is about to testify in any such \n     proceeding; or\n       (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or \n     participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any \n     other manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of such Acts.\n       (b) Employee Complaint.--\n       (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who \n     believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or \n     otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after \n     such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his \n     or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such \n     discharge, demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such \n     a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in \n     the complaint of its filing.\n       (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation \n     of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days \n     after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall \n     complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the \n     complainant (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) \n     and the person alleged to have committed such violation of \n     the results of the investigation conducted under this \n     paragraph. Within 90 days after the receipt of such \n     complaint, the Secretary shall (unless the proceeding on the \n     complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a \n     settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person \n     alleged to have committed such violation) issue an order \n     either providing the relief prescribed in subparagraph (B) of \n     this paragraph or denying the complaint. An order of the \n     Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and the \n     opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and \n     556 of title 5, United States Code. Upon the conclusion of \n     such a hearing and the issuance of a recommended decision \n     that the complaint has merit, the Secretary shall issue a \n     preliminary order providing the relief prescribed in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not order \n     compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary may \n     not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a \n     complaint without the participation and consent of the \n     complainant.\n       (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of \n     this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the \n     person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative \n     action to abate the violation, and (ii) reinstate the \n     complainant to his or her former position together with \n     compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and \n     privileges of his or her employment. The Secretary may order \n     such person to provide compensatory damages to the \n     complainant. If an order is issued under this subparagraph, \n     the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall \n     assess the person against whom the order is issued a sum \n     equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses \n     (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred (as determined by the Secretary), by the complainant \n     for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint \n     upon which the order is issued.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the \n     investigation required under paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection, unless the complainant has made a prima facie \n     showing that any behavior described in subsection (a) of this \n     section was a contributing factor in the unfavorable \n     personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the \n     complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) \n     of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior.\n       (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the \n     complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in \n     subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in \n     unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order \n     issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review \n     of the order in the United States court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the \n     order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review \n     must be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the \n     Secretary's order. Judicial review shall be available as \n     provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The \n     commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, \n     unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review \n     could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any \n     criminal or civil proceeding.\n       (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply \n     with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, \n     the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States \n     district court for the district in which the violation \n     occurred to enforce such order. In actions brought under this \n     subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to \n     grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and \n     compensatory and exemplary damages.\n       (e) Action to Ensure Compliance.--\n       (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under \n     subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action \n     to require compliance with such order against the person to \n     whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties.\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\n       (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this \n     subsection, may award costs of litigation (including \n     reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party \n     whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n       (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by \n     this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding \n     brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of \n     this section shall not apply with respect to any employee \n     who, acting without direction from the manufacturer (or the \n     agent of the manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of \n     any requirement of this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq), or any other law or \n     regulation relating to tobacco products.\n       (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be \n     construed to expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right \n     otherwise available to an employee under Federal or State law \n     to redress the employee's discharge or other discriminatory \n     action taken by a tobacco product manufacturer against the \n     employee.\n       (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be \n     prominently posted in any place of employment to which this \n     section applies.\n\n        TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS\n\n     SEC. 901. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American tobacco industry has made claims of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, and trade \n     secrets to protect from public disclosure thousands of \n     internal documents sought by civil litigants;\n       (2) a number of courts have found that these claims of \n     privilege were not made in good faith; and\n       (3) a prompt and full exposition of tobacco documents \n     will--\n       (A) promote understanding by the public of the tobacco \n     industry's research and practices; and\n       (B) further the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 902. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title applies to all tobacco product manufacturers.\n\n     SEC. 903. DOCUMENT DISCLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Disclosure to the Food and Drug Administration.--\n       (1) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     each tobacco product manufacturer shall submit to the Food \n     and Drug Administration the documents identified in \n     subsection (c), including documents for which trade secret \n     protection is claimed, with the exception of any document for \n     which privilege is claimed, and identified in accordance with \n     subsection (b). Each such manufacturer shall provide the \n     Administration with the privilege and trade secret logs \n     identified under subsection (b).\n       (2) With respect to documents that are claimed to contain \n     trade secret material, unless and until it is finally \n     determined under this title, either through judicial review \n     or because time for judicial review has expired, that such a \n     document does not constitute or contain trade secret \n     material, the Administration shall treat the document as a \n     trade secret in accordance with section 708 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379) and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing herein shall \n     limit the authority of the Administration to obtain and use, \n     in accordance with any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, \n     any document constituting or containing trade secret \n     material. Documents and materials received by the \n     Administration under this provision shall not be obtainable \n     by or releasable to the public through section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, and the \n     only recourse to obtain these documents shall be through the \n     process established by section 905.\n       (3) If a document depository is not established under title \n     XIV, the Secretary shall establish by regulation a procedure \n     for making public all documents submitted under paragraph (1) \n     except documents for which trade secret protection has been \n     claimed and for which there has not been a final judicial \n     determination that the document does not contain a trade \n     secret.\n       (b) Separate Submission of Documents.--\n       (1) (1) Privileged Trade Secret Documents.--Any document \n     required to be submitted under subsection (c) or (d) that is \n     subject to a claim by a tobacco product manufacturer of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection shall be so marked and shall be submitted \n     to the panel under section 904 within 30 days after its \n     appointment. Compliance with this subsection shall not be \n     deemed to be a waiver of any applicable claim of privilege or \n     trade secret protection.\n       (2) Privilege and trade secret logs.--\n       (A) In general.--Within 15 days after submitting documents \n     under paragraph (1), each tobacco product manufacturer shall \n     submit a comprehensive log which identifies on a document-by-\n     document basis all documents produced for which the \n     manufacturer asserts attorney-client privilege, attorney \n     work-product, or trade secrecy. With respect to documents for \n     which the manufacturer previously has asserted one or more of \n     the aforementioned privileges or trade secret protection, the \n     manufacturer shall conduct a good faith de novo review of \n     such documents to determine whether such privilege or trade \n     secret protection is appropriate.\n       (B) Organization of log.--The log shall be organized in \n     numerical order based upon the document identifier assigned \n     to each document. For each document, the log shall contain--\n       (i) a description of the document, including type of \n     document, title of document, name and position or title of \n     each author, addressee, and other recipient who was intended \n     to receive a copy, document date, document purpose, and \n     general subject matter;\n       (ii) an explanation why the document or a portion of the \n     document is privileged or subject to trade secret protection; \n     and\n       (iii) a statement whether any previous claim of privilege \n     or trade secret was denied and, if so, in what proceeding.\n       (C) Public inspection.--Within 5 days of receipt of such a \n     log, the Depository shall make it available for public \n     inspection and review.\n       (3) Declaration of compliance.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall submit to the Depository a declaration, in \n     accordance with the requirements of section 1746 of title 28, \n     United States Code, by an individual with responsibility for \n     the de novo review of documents, preparation of the privilege \n     log, and knowledge of its contents.

The panel may modify its findings or \n     make new findings by reason of the additional evidence or \n     arguments and shall file with the court such modified or new \n     findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the \n     modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.\n       (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The panel's \n     findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the \n     record taken as a whole, shall be conclusive.

The judgment of \n     the court affirming or setting aside the panel's decision \n     shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided \n     in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days \n     after a final decision that a document, as redacted by the \n     panel or in its entirety, is not protected from disclosure by \n     a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, \n     or trade secret protection, the panel shall direct that the \n     document be made available to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs under section 903(a).

The decision by the panel shall not be construed \n     to prevent a document from being disclosed in a judicial \n     proceeding or interfere with the authority of a court to \n     determine whether a document is admissible or whether its \n     production may be compelled.\n\n     SEC. 907. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n       The disclosure process in this title is not intended to \n     affect the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or \n     any Federal law which requires the disclosure of documents or \n     which deals with attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection.\n\n     SEC. 908. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall act in good faith in asserting claims of \n     privilege or trade secret protection based on fact and law. \n     If the panel determines that a tobacco product manufacturer \n     has not acted in good faith with full knowledge of the truth \n     of the facts asserted and with a reasonable basis under \n     existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed costs, which \n     shall include the full administrative costs of handling the \n     claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the \n     panel and any party contesting the privilege. The panel may \n     also impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if \n     it determines that the manufacturer acted in bad faith in \n     asserting a privilege, or knowingly acted with the intent to \n     delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the panel's \n     determination of privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection claims.\n       (b) Failure to Produce Document.--A failure by a tobacco \n     product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in \n     compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with \n     such extension as may be granted by the panel, shall be \n     punished by a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. A \n     separate violation occurs for each document the manufacturer \n     has failed to produce in a timely manner. The maximum penalty \n     under this subsection for a related series of violations is \n     $5,000,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, \n     the panel shall consider the number of documents, length of \n     delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, \n     and such other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this \n     title shall replace or supersede any criminal sanction under \n     title 18, United States Code, or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 909.

GOVERNMENTAL CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b) and \n     (c), no State, political subdivision of a State, municipal \n     corporation, governmental entity or corporation, Indian \n     tribe, or agency or subdivision thereof, or other entity \n     acting in parens patriae, may file or maintain any civil \n     action involving a tobacco claim against a participating \n     tobacco product manufacturer.\n       (b) Effect on Existing State Suits of Settlement Agreement \n     or Consent Decree.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, any State that has filed a civil \n     action involving a tobacco claim against a participating \n     tobacco product manufacturer may elect to settle such action \n     against said tobacco product manufacturer. If a State makes \n     such an election to enter into a settlement or a consent \n     decree, it may maintain a civil action involving a tobacco \n     claim only to the extent necessary to permit continuing court \n     jurisdiction over the settlement or consent decree. Nothing \n     herein shall preclude any State from bringing suit or seeking \n     a court order to enforce the terms of such settlement or \n     decree.\n       (c) State Option for One-Time Opt Out.--Any State that does \n     not make the election described in subsection (b) may \n     continue its lawsuit, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this \n     section.

ADDICTION AND DEPENDENCY CLAIMS; CASTANO CIVIL \n                   ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Addiction and Dependence Claims Barred.--In any civil \n     action to which this title applies, no addiction claim or \n     dependence claim may be filed or maintained against a \n     participating tobacco product manufacturer.\n       (b) Castano Civil Actions.--\n       (1) The rights and benefits afforded in this Act, and the \n     various research activities envisioned by this Act, are \n     provided in settlement of, and shall constitute the exclusive \n     remedy for the purpose of determining civil liability as to \n     those claims asserted in the Castano Civil Actions, and all \n     bases for any such claim under the laws of any State are \n     preempted (including State substantive, procedural, remedial, \n     and evidentiary provisions) and settled. The Castano Civil \n     Actions shall be dismissed with full reservation of the \n     rights of individual class members to pursue claims not based \n     on addiction or dependency in civil actions, as defined in \n     section 1417(2), in accordance with this Act. For purposes of \n     determining application of statutes of limitation or repose, \n     individual actions filed within one year after the effective \n     date of this Act by those who were included within a Castano \n     Civil Action shall be considered to have been filed as of the \n     date of the Castano Civil Action applicable to said \n     individual.\n       (2) For purposes of awarding attorneys fees and expenses \n     for those actions subject to this subsection, the matter at \n     issue shall be submitted to arbitration before one panel of \n     arbitrators.

SUBSTANTIAL NON-ATTAINMENT OF REQUIRED REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Action by Secretary.--If the Secretary determines under \n     title II that the non-attainment percentage for any year is \n     greater than 20 percentage points for cigarettes or smokeless \n     tobacco, then the Secretary shall determine, on a brand-by-\n     brand basis, using data that reflects a 1999 baseline, which \n     tobacco product manufacturers are responsible within the 2 \n     categories of tobacco products for the excess. The Secretary \n     may commence an action under this section against the tobacco \n     product manufacturer or manufacturers of the brand or brands \n     of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products for which the \n     non-attainment percentage exceeded 20 percentage points.\n       (b) Procedures.--Any action under this section shall be \n     commenced by the Secretary in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia within 90 days after \n     publication in the Federal Register of the determination that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is greater than 20 percentage points. Any such \n     action shall be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under \n     section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (c) Determination by Court.--In any action under this \n     section, the court shall determine whether a tobacco product \n     manufacturer has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that it--\n       (1) has complied substantially with the provisions of this \n     Act regarding underage tobacco use, of any rules or \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, or of any Federal or \n     State laws regarding underage tobacco use;\n       (2) has not taken any material action to undermine the \n     achievement of the required percentage reduction for the \n     tobacco product in question; and\n       (3) has used its best efforts to reduce underage tobacco \n     use to a degree at least equal to the required percentage \n     reductions.\n       (d) Removal of Annual Aggregate Payment Limitation.--Except \n     as provided in subsections (e) and (g), if the court \n     determines that a tobacco product manufacturer has failed to \n     make the showing described in subsection (c) then sections \n     1411 and 1412 of this Act do not apply to the enforcement \n     against, or the payment by, such tobacco product manufacturer \n     of any judgment or settlement that becomes final after that \n     determination is made.\n       (e) Defense.--An action under this section shall be \n     dismissed, and subsection (d) shall not apply, if the court \n     finds that the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) \n     was unlawful under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of \n     section 706(2) of title 5, United States Code. Any judgments \n     paid under section 1412 of this Act prior to a final judgment \n     determining that the Secretary's determination was erroneous \n     shall be fully credited, with interest, under section 1412 of \n     this Act.\n       (f) Review.--Decisions of the court under this section are \n     reviewable only by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari \n     granted upon the petition of any party. The applicability of \n     subsection (d) shall be stayed during the pendency of any \n     such petition or review.\n       (g) Continuing Effect.--Subsection (d) shall cease to apply \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer found to have engaged in \n     conduct described in subsection (c) upon the later of--\n       (1) a determination by the Secretary under section 201 \n     after the commencement of action under subsection (a) that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is 20 or fewer percentage points; or\n       (2) a finding by the court in an action filed against the \n     Secretary by the manufacturer, not earlier than 2 years after \n     the determination described in subsection (c) becomes final, \n     that the manufacturer has shown by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that, in the period since that determination, the \n     manufacturer--\n       (A) has complied with the provisions of this Act regarding \n     underage tobacco use, of any rules or regulations promulgated \n     thereunder, and of any other applicable Federal, State, or \n     local laws, rules, or regulations;\n       (B) has not taken any action to undermine the achievement \n     of the required percentage reduction for the tobacco product \n     in question; and\n       (C) has used its best efforts to attain the required \n     percentage reduction for the tobacco product in question.\n\n     A judgment or settlement against the tobacco product \n     manufacturer that becomes final after a determination or \n     finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection \n     is not subject to subsection (d). An action under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be commenced in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall \n     be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under section 2284 \n     of title 28, United States Code. A decision by the court \n     under paragraph (2) of this subsection is reviewable only by \n     the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari granted upon the \n     petition of any party, and the decision shall be stayed \n     during the pendency of the petition or review. A \n     determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     this subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     bring a subsequent action under this section against any \n     tobacco product manufacturer or the applicability of \n     subsection (d) with respect to any such subsequent action.\n\n     SEC. 1410. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.\n\n       If the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs, the Surgeon General, the Director of the \n     Center for Disease Control or the Director's delegate, and \n     the Director of the Health and Human Services Office of \n     Minority Health determines at any time that a tobacco product \n     manufacturer's actions or inactions with respect to its \n     compliance with the Act are of such a nature as to create a \n     clear and present danger that the manufacturer will not \n     attain the targets for underage smoking reduction, the \n     Secretary may bring an action under section 1409 seeking the \n     immediate suspension of the tobacco product manufacturer's \n     annual limitation cap on civil judgments. If the court \n     determines that the Secretary has proved by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the subject manufacturer's actions \n     or inactions are of such a nature that they present a clear \n     and present danger that the manufacturer will not attain the \n     targets for underage smoking reduction, the court may suspend \n     the subject manufacturer's annual limitation cap on civil \n     judgments.\n\n     SEC. 1411. TOBACCO CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST PARTICIPATING \n                   TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS.\n\n       (a) Permissible Defendants.--In any civil action to which \n     this title applies, tobacco claims may be filed or maintained \n     only against--\n       (1) a participating tobacco product manufacturer; or\n       (2) a surviving entity established by a participating \n     tobacco product manufacturer.\n       (b) Actions involving participating and non-participating \n     manufacturers.--In any civil action involving both a tobacco \n     claim against a participating tobacco product manufacturer \n     based in whole or in part upon conduct occurring prior to the \n     date of enactment of this Act and a claim against 1 or more \n     non-participating tobacco product manufacturers, the court, \n     upon application of a participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer, shall require the jury to or shall itself \n     apportion liability as between the participating tobacco \n     product manufacturer and non-participating tobacco product \n     manufacturers.\n\n     SEC. 1412. PAYMENT OF TOBACCO CLAIM SETTLEMENTS AND \n                   JUDGMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in this section, any \n     judgment or settlement in any civil action to which this \n     subtitle applies shall be subject to the process for payment \n     of judgments and settlements set forth in this section. No \n     participating tobacco product manufacturer shall be obligated \n     to pay a judgment or settlement on a tobacco claim in any \n     civil action to which this title applies except in accordance \n     with this section. This section shall not apply to the \n     portion, if any, of a judgment that imposes punitive damages \n     based on any conduct that--\n       (1) occurs after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) is other than the manufacture, development, \n     advertising, marketing, or sale of tobacco products in \n     compliance with this Act and any agreement incident thereto.\n       (b) Registration with the Secretary of the Treasury.--\n       (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of settlements, \n     judgments, and payments in civil actions to which this title \n     applies.\n       (2) Any party claiming entitlement to a monetary payment \n     under a final judgment or final settlement on a tobacco claim \n     shall register such claim with the Secretary by filing a true \n     and correct copy of the final judgment or final settlement \n     agreement with the Secretary and providing a copy of such \n     filing to all other parties to the judgment or settlement.\n       (3) Any participating tobacco product manufacturer making a \n     payment on any final judgment or final settlement to which \n     this section applies shall certify such payment to the \n     Secretary by filing a true and correct copy of the proof of \n     payment and a statement of the remaining unpaid portion, if \n     any, of such final judgment or final settlement with the \n     Secretary and shall provide a copy of such filing to all \n     other parties to the judgment or settlement.\n       (c) Liability Cap.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate payments made by all \n     participating tobacco product manufacturers in any calendar \n     year may not exceed $8,000,000,000.\n       (2) Implementation.--The Secretary shall initiate a \n     rulemaking within 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act to establish a mechanism for implementing this subsection \n     in such a way to ensure the fair and equitable payment of \n     final judgments or final settlements on tobacco claims under \n     this title. Amounts not payable because of the application of \n     this subsection, shall be carried forward and paid in the \n     next year, subject to the provisions of this subsection.\n       (3) Inflation adjustment.--\n       (A) In general.--The amount in paragraph (1) shall be \n     increased annually, beginning with the second calendar year \n     beginning after the date of enactment of this Act, by the \n     greater of 3 percent or the annual increase in the CPI.\n       (B) CPI.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n     urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (C) Rounding.--If any increase determined under \n     subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase \n     shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (d) Injunctive Relief.--A participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer may commence an action to enjoin any State court \n     proceeding to enforce or execute any judgment or settlement \n     where payment has not been authorized under this section. \n     Such an action shall arise under the laws of the United \n     States and may be commenced in the district court of the \n     United States for the district in which the State court \n     proceeding is pending.\n       (e) Joint and Several Liability.--All participating tobacco \n     product manufacturers shall be jointly and severally liable \n     for, and shall enter into an agreement to apportion among \n     them, any amounts payable under judgments and settlements \n     governed by this section arising in whole or in part from \n     conduct occurring prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Bankruptcy of Participating Manufacturer.--No \n     participating tobacco product manufacturer shall cease \n     operations without establishing a surviving entity against \n     which a tobacco claim may be brought.

LANDERS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Captain Michael J. Landers, United States Navy, as he retires \nupon completion of over 30 years of honorable and faithful service to \nour Nation.\n  A native of Utica, NY, Captain Landers was enlisted into the Regular \nNavy in November 1968 as a Seaman Recruit. After 5 years of enlisted \nsubmarine service, he was commissioned an Ensign upon graduation from \nthe University of Missouri in December 1973.\n  Captain Landers, a Submarine Warfare Officer, has performed in a \nconsistently outstanding manner under the\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nmost challenging of circumstances. From 1973 to 1985 Captain Landers \nserved with the surface and submarine fleets of the Atlantic and \npacific Oceans. He gained extensive experience aboard USS ALEXANDER \nHAMILTON (SSBN) 617) USS VON STEUBEN (SSBN 632), and USS PIGEON (ASR \n21). After serving on the staff of the Director of Strategic Systems \nPrograms, Washington, DC, Captain Landers commanded the USS ORTOLAN \n(ASR 22) from 1987 to 1990. He subsequently became the Executive \nAssistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel. Captain Landers left \nthe Navy Annex in 1994 and reported for duty at the Industrial College \nof the Armed Forces at Fort McNair where he received a Master of \nScience Degree in National Resource Strategy.\n  From 1995 to 1997, Captain Landers commanded the naval Submarine \nBase, Bangor, WA. He returned to the Pentagon in November 1997, where \nhe served as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity \nhe has been a major asset to the Navy, Marine Corps and Congress. He is \nconsidered a valued advisor to the very top echelons of the Navy and \nCongress. His consummate leadership, energy and integrity ensured that \nthe morale and effectiveness of the Navy-Marine Corps team reached \nheights otherwise thought to be impossible to achieve in such an \naustere budget climate. During a period of significant change and \nrestructuring of naval forces, Captain Landers helped to obtain \nCongressional support for a strong and balanced navy and marine Corps. \nThrough his brilliant insight, he has directly contributed to their \nfuture readiness and success.\n  Captain Landers' distinguished awards include the legion of Merit \nwith three gold stars, the meritorious Service medal with one gold \nstar, the navy Commendation Medal with two gold stars and the navy \nAchievement Medal with one gold star.\n  The Department of the navy, the Congress, and the American people \nhave been defended and well served by this dedicated naval officer for \nover 30 years. Captain Mike Landers will long be remembered for his \nleadership, service and dedication. He will be missed. We wish Mike, \nand his lovely wife Kris, our very best as they begin a new chapter in \ntheir life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6111-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VERMONT'S SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize two very \nspecial Vermont business people. Tom and Sally Fegley are the owners \nand founders of Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates of Brattleboro, \nVermont. For the past two years I have been pleased to nominate Tom and \nSally for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business \nPerson of the Year award for the state of Vermont. This year, I am \nproud to announce that Tom and Sally Fegley are the recipients of this \nprestigious award.\n  Eight and a half years ago, the Fegleys had the courage to move to \nVermont and risk their lives' savings to undertake their start-up \nbusiness in chocolates, a field in which neither of them had any \nprevious experience. With hard work and intense dedication they have \nbuilt this business to more than $1 million in gross sales in 1997. \nTheir products are sold in all fifty states and they are exported all \nover the world, including Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, South \nAfrica and the Netherlands. Tom and Sally's entrepreneurial savvy has \nhelped to spread the distinctive high quality of Vermont specialty \nfoods across the globe.\n  The Fegley's chocolates are so unique they have received five federal \ntrademarks for their chocolates ranging from ``Vermont Pasture \nPatties'' to ``Cowlicks.'' In addition, their products have won eight \nnational awards and have received media coverage ranging from ``Good \nMorning, America'' and ``The Today Show'' to such magazines as Bon \nAppetit, Fine Cooking, and Mademoiselle, as well as newspapers \nincluding The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The \nWashington Post.\n  I remember the first time that Marcelle and I visited Tom and Sally's \nshop in 1992. We were especially impressed with its old-fashioned \natmosphere and Vermont country charm. A few years ago, Tom and Sally \ndecided to combine the sale of their handmade chocolates and candies \nwith the sale of Vermont folkart. This gallery displays the handicrafts \nof Vermonters as the Fegleys display the fruits of their own \nhandicraft. This innovative combination makes visiting Tom and Sally's \na unique and charming experience while promoting Vermont's distinct \ncharacter.\n  Not only have Tom and Sally made an imprint on Vermont's specialty \nfood industry, but they have made an even larger contribution to their \ncommunity. Perhaps the Fegleys should be recognized more for what they \ndo for others than for their business success. From donating chocolates \nto local charities, to helping a local apple orchard after vandals \ndestroyed the apple trees, Tom and Sally's involvement and \ncontributions have expanded beyond the business industry and have made \nthem important members of Vermont's communities.\n  I am pleased that the Fegleys have been named 1998 Vermont Small \nBusiness Persons of the Year. I believe that they embody what Vermont \nis all about--a fine tradition of quality products with a strong sense \nof community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6112-S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REMARKS BY SENATOR BILL FRIST TO THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN \n                              UNIVERSITIES\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Tuesday, June 2nd, I addressed \nthe Association of American Universities regarding the importance of \nfederal support for university-based research. I ask that my remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\nFederal Support for University-Based Research Has Produced a Wealth of \n                       Benefits for All Americans\n\n       As a medical scientist, a researcher, a former university \n     faculty member, a current university Trustee, and a life-long \n     explorer in the quest for new knowledge, I believe, as you \n     do, that America's strategy of federally-supported \n     university-based research has produced a wealth of benefits \n     for all Americans.\n       It's not only expanded our scientific and academic national \n     base, but increased the economic vitality of our Nation, \n     raised the standard of living all Americans enjoy, and \n     produced a highly-educated workforce that has made us a \n     leader in today's global economy. In fact, in economic terms \n     alone, the return on our federal investment has been huge. As \n     much as one half of all U.S. growth is a result of the \n     technical progress we've achieved through research.\n       According to the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     (OSTP), technology is the single most important factor in \n     long-term economic growth. Not only is the performance of \n     U.S. businesses and their contributions to economic growth \n     directly linked to their use of technology, but as cited in a \n     study conducted by the US Department of Commerce, \n     manufacturing businesses that used eight or more advanced \n     technologies grew 14.4 percent more than plants that used \n     none--and production wages were more than 14 percent higher.\n       For any of you who may encounter doubters in other \n     Congressional offices let me give you just two quick examples \n     from the President of MIT, who testified before my committee, \n     of how the federal investment in university research has \n     produced phenomenal returns.\n       Over the last three decades, the Department of Defense has \n     funded $5 billion in university in information technology. \n     Those programs alone created one-third to one-half of all \n     major breakthroughs in the computer and communications \n     industries. Today, those businesses account for $500 billion \n     of GDP--a return on our investment of 3,000 percent!\n       In fact, studies of just that one university along--MIT--\n     found that, in Massachusetts, MIT grads and faculty founded \n     over 600 companies that produced 300,000 jobs and $40 billion \n     in sales. In Silicon Valley, MIT grads founded 225 companies \n     which produced 150,000 jobs and more than $22 billion in \n     sales.\n       In one industry alone--biotechnology--government's $43 \n     million annual investment has not only produced the human \n     capital of the biotech industry--scientists, engineers, \n     managers--and new knowledge that's led to an understanding of \n     the molecular basis of disease, but it's also produced new \n     companies and new wealth.\n       To again use MIT as an example, in Massachusetts alone, \n     MIT-related companies have produced 10,000 new jobs, $3 \n     billion in annual revenues, and 100 new biotech patents \n     licensed the U.S. companies that have induced investment of \n     $650 million. Those companies now produce nine of the 10 FDA-\n     approved biotech drugs that stop heart attacks and treat \n     cancer, cystic fibrosis and diabetes--and we've only just \n     begun to tap the potential returns of this rapidly advancing \n     new field.\n       And I'm sure every one of the universities you represent \n     could cite statistics that are equally impressive.\n       But, as you well know, universities are not just the \n     fountainhead of innovation. They\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\n     are the wellsprings that provide the intellectual \n     underpinning of future progress, because they train the \n     people who will translate tomorrow's discoveries into even \n     more exciting products and processes and industries. And when \n     you consider what today's students are already capable of, \n     the potential is truly breathtaking.\n       Jennifer Mills, for example, is a physics undergraduate \n     from Portland, Oregon who wrote much of the computer code \n     responsible for the astounding images sent back to Earth by \n     the Hubble telescope.\n       James McLurkin, an undergrad engineer, created a tiny robot \n     that may well revolutionize certain kinds of surgery, \n     enabling surgeons to operate inside the body without ever \n     touching the patient! Just imagine what tomorrow's students \n     to do!\n\n\n      America's Investment in Science and Technology Must Continue\n\n       Clearly, America's investment in science and technology \n     must continue. The two central questions that Congress must \n     ask and answer, however, are: (1) Will science and technology \n     continue to be as great a Congressional priority in the \n     future as it has been in the past; and (2) Will the kind of \n     financial investment necessary to sustain future progress \n     even be possible in light of our other growing financial \n     commitments?\n       The history of the last five decades has shown us that \n     there is a federal role in the creation and nurturing of \n     science and technology, and that even in times of fiscal \n     austerity that commitment has been relatively consistent. \n     However, the last three decades have also shown us something \n     else: fiscal reality. The simple truth is there's just not \n     enough money to do everything  we'd like to do. It took some \n     time for us to realize that, and by the time we did, we \n     found ourselves in a fiscal situation that is only now \n     being addressed. And, budget surpluses notwithstanding, \n     discretionary spending is, and will continue to be, under \n     immense fiscal pressure.\n       One only has to look back over the last 30 years to confirm \n     this trend. In 1965, mandatory federal spending on \n     entitlements and interest on the debt accounted for 30 \n     percent of the federal budget. Fully 70 percent went toward \n     discretionary programs--research, education, roads, bridges, \n     national parks, and national defense.\n       Today, just 30 years later, that ratio has been almost \n     completely reversed: 67 percent of the budget is spent on \n     mandatory programs and interest on the debt; only 33 percent \n     is left for absolutely everything else, including research.\n       In fact, total R spending today as a percentage of GDP is \n     just .75 percent--as compared to 2.2 percent in the mid-1960s \n     when superpower rivalry and the race to space fueled a \n     national commitment to science and technology. And as the \n     Baby Boom generation begins to retire and the discretionary \n     portion of the budget shrinks even further, this situation \n     will only grow worse.\n       Thus, we have both a long-term problem: addressing the \n     ever-increasing level of mandatory spending; and a near-term \n     challenge: apportioning the ever-dwindling amount of \n     discretionary funding.\n       The confluence of this increased dependency on technology \n     and decreased fiscal flexibility has created a problem too \n     obvious to ignore: not all deserving programs can be funded; \n     not all authorized programs can be fully implemented. In \n     other words, the luxury of fully funding science and \n     technology programs across the board has long since passed. \n     We must set priorities.\n\n\n vision for the future: How we ensure Federal Support for Science and \n                               Technology\n\n       With the introduction of S. 1305, the Federal Research \n     Investment Act, * * * a debate on funding for science and \n     technology that is long overdue, and I commend them for it.\n       I firmly believe that Congress must reaffirm our national \n     commitment to science and technology, and redouble its \n     efforts to ensure that funding is not only maintained but \n     increased. However, I also believe that funding levels alone \n     are not the answer.\n       What we really need is a strategy for the future, a vision \n     that not only provides adequate levels of funding, but \n     ensures that that funding is both responsible and sustainable \n     over the long term.\n       I believe we do that by establishing and applying a set of \n     first or guiding principles that will enable Congress to (1) \n     consistently ask the right questions about each competing \n     technology program; (2) focus on that program's effectiveness \n     and appropriateness for Federal funding, and most \n     importantly, (3) make the hard choices about which programs \n     deserve to be funded and which do not. Only then can we be \n     assured that Congress has invested wisely and well.\n       What are these first principles? There are four.\n       (1) Federal R programs must be good science. They must be \n     focused, not duplicative, and peer-reviewed. Because there is \n     strength in diversity, they must support both knowledge-\n     driven science--which broadens our base of knowledge and \n     advances the frontiers of science; and mission-driven science \n     requirements--which push the state-of-the-art in specific \n     technology fields.\n       (2) Program must be fiscally accountable. Especially in \n     today's fiscal environment, wasteful administrative habits \n     can't be tolerated.\n       (3) They must have measurable results. Programs must \n     achieve their aims. Their effectiveness must be evaluated, \n     not on the basis of individual projects which can have \n     varying rates of success, but on basis of the entire program.\n       (4) They must employ a consistent approach. Federal policy \n     must be applied consistently across the entire spectrum of \n     Federal research agencies. High quality, productive research \n     programs must be encouraged regardless of where they are \n     located.\n       Accompanying the four first principles, are four \n     corollaries:\n       (1) Flow of Technology.--The process of creating technology \n     involves many steps. However, the current federal structure \n     clearly reinforces increasingly artificial distinctions \n     across the spectrum of research and development activities. \n     The result is a set of a programs which each support a narrow \n     phase of research and development, but are not coordinated \n     with one another.\n       Government must maximize its investment by encouraging the \n     progression of a technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to commercialization, through funding agencies \n     and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This creates a flow \n     of technology, subject to merit at each stage, so that \n     promising technology is not lost in a bureaucratic maze.\n       (2 Excellence in the American Research Infrastructure.--We \n     must foster a close relationship between research and \n     education. Our investment at the university level creates \n     more than simply world class research. It creates would class \n     researchers as well. We must continue this strong research \n     infrastructure, and find ways to extend the excellence of our \n     university system to primary and secondary educational \n     institutions.\n       (3) Commitment to a Board Range of Research Initiatives.--\n     Revolutionary innovation is taking place at the overlap of \n     research disciplines. We must continue to encourage this by \n     providing opportunities for interdisciplinary projects and \n     fostering collaboration across fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among Industry, Universities, and Federal \n     Labs.--Each of these has special talents and abilities that \n     complement the other. Our federal dollars are wisely spent by \n     facilitating the creation of partnerships, in effect creating \n     a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n       These first principles and their four corollaries provide a \n     framework that will not only guide the creation of new, \n     federally-funded research and development programs, but \n     validate existing ones. Taken together, they create a \n     powerful method for elevating the debate by increasing \n     Congress' ability to focus on the important issues; \n     decreasing the likelihood that it will get sidetracked on \n     politically-charged technicalities; and ensuring that federal \n     R programs are consistent and effective. They will also \n     help us establish a both consistent set of national goals, \n     and a vision for the future.\n\n\nS. 1305: A Good First Step, But a More Comprehensive Approach is Needed\n\n       S. 1305 has put funding for science and technology at the \n     forefront of the 105th Congress. It is an important first \n     step in the creation of a long-term federal research and \n     development strategy, and I wholeheartedly support its \n     general concept and thrust. However, I believe it falls short \n     in many of the areas I have just outlined.\n       In S. 1305, funding levels are dramatically increased \n     within the first five years regardless of economic \n     conditions--making funding targets unrealistic and \n     unsustainable, particularly when those funding levels \n     jeopardize discretionary programs necessary to the \n     maintenance and operation of the nation.\n       The bipartisan bill I will propose with Senator Rockefeller \n     will also substantially increase funding but more gradually. \n     Rather than achieve a doubling of funds in 10 years as S. \n     1305 proposes, the First bill will achieve the same goal in \n     12 years.\n       My bill also requires the President to provide, as part of \n     his annual budget, a detailed summary of the total level of \n     federal funding for all civilian research agencies, as well \n     as a focused strategy that reflects the funding projections \n     of Congress for each future fiscal year until 2010.\n       S. 1305 provides Congress with no mechanism to identify or \n     target those programs that are either marginal or \n     ineffective. In keeping with the third principle that all \n     federal R programs must be fiscally accountable, my bill \n     will include a mechanism that requires OMB to indicate those \n     programs that fail to meet a minimally acceptable criteria as \n     defined by a National Academy of Science study.\n       Finally, S. 1305 effects only civilian research and \n     development programs, and provides no support for highly \n     successful defense science and technologies efforts such as \n     those under DARPA. And, as I demonstrated in my earlier \n     example, defense-related research has produced remarkable \n     spinoffs in the private sector, the Internet being the most \n     obvious example. Thus, in a companion bill, I will propose a \n     similar strategy for increasing funding for defense-related \n     R\n       Even with its imperfections, S. 1305 is already a success--\n     because it has commenced a debate on science and technology \n     investment that is long overdue. And it is a debate I am \n     committed to furthering.\n\n\n                           Legislative Update\n\n       Accordingly, I commenced a process, which continues daily, \n     through which I hope to examine all relevant approaches, and \n     collect and compile the input of all federal research \n     agencies, the scientific community, my distinguished \n     colleagues in Congress and government, and all other relevant \n     parties in an effort to construct a comprehensive, feasible\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\n     and effective strategy for future federal funding of science \n     and technology.\n       On April 28th, the Science, Technology, and Space \n     Subcommittee which I chair, held a hearing to further explore \n     the whole issue of federal funding, and three of the original \n     cosponsors of S. 1305--Senators Gramm, Lieberman, and \n     Bingaman--participated. Senator Domenici, who was unable to \n     attend, submitted testimony for the Record.\n       At my direction, my personal chief of staff, and my \n     Commerce Committee staff, have met extensively with \n     professional societies, private industry, and university \n     representatives, some of whom are here today, to get a clear \n     sense of your reality, your vision of where research and \n     development ought to be headed, and your reaction to both S. \n     1305 and a First alternative.\n       They've also been meeting with the senior legislative \n     staffs of other Members to develop a strategy everyone is \n     comfortable with, and that addresses everyone's primary \n     concerns. And we've been meeting with House staff and \n     coordinating our goals with those of the House Policy Study. \n     The response has been very positive.\n       After comprehensive discussions my Senate colleagues have \n     agreed to support a First alternative in which funding would \n     rise from $34 billion to $68 billion. And all other parties \n     seem to like the idea of a long-term vision, a concrete \n     strategy to take us there (vs. rhetoric that is subject to \n     change), and realistic numbers that stand a good chance of \n     being achieved.\n       Your input into this process has been particularly \n     important. Every time we meet, my staff and I gain a better \n     understanding of the complexity of these issues as they \n     relate to universities. And I hope you'll continue to work \n     with us in the days ahead.\n       In the very near future, probably within a week or two, a \n     Frist/Rockefeller bill, officially called the Federal \n     Research Investment Act of 1998, will be dropped. It is a \n     bill that represents--not a roadblock to increased federal \n     funding for research--but a carefully-crafted compromise, \n     agreed to by all, and representing the best efforts of all.\n\n\n                        challenge of the future\n\n       Today, in every known field of exploration, man has \n     answered questions once considered unanswerable, and \n     questions impossible to even conceive just a short time ago. \n     Yet so many mysteries remain. And so we must continue to \n     seek, to define, to know.\n       Yet science today is not only about the esoteric, it's \n     about the practical. It's about the simple as well as the \n     deep. It is both a luxury and a necessity. Science helps us \n     feed our families. It helps keep our loved ones healthy. By \n     continually creating new goods and services, new jobs and new \n     capital, it raises our standard of living. And it produces \n     the technologies that protect our troops and project our \n     resolve around the world. In other words, science has helped \n     keep us prosperous, and science has helped keep us free.\n       Without a doubt, science is an integral part of our \n     present. But because we live in a world now dependent upon \n     science and technology excellence, a world driven by a \n     science and technology economy, science is even more \n     important to our future.\n       To a large extent, universities hold the key to that future \n     because universities guide America's youth and inspire them \n     to seek out the deep truths of life, to lift the veil from \n     its fascinating secrets, to seek, to define, to know. It is \n     the University that fosters a love for the mysteries of God \n     and nature, and propels the next generation forward to \n     explore and improve our world. And that makes you a vital \n     link between the present and the future.\n       We are--and we should be--justly proud of our scientific \n     accomplishments thus far. But if there is one thing science \n     has taught us, it is that man's challenges only increase with \n     every new level of knowledge we achieve. Which is why \n     continued research and development is so important.\n       Expanding scientific knowledge is a responsibility that \n     extends well beyond the classrooms and universities of our \n     Nation. It is the responsibility of us all. As John F. \n     Kennedy said, ``Every educated citizen has the special \n     obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning, to promote \n     exploration of the unknown, to preserve the freedom of \n     inquiry, [and to] to support the advancement of research . . \n     .''\n       I take his words seriously. I know you do as well. Working \n     together, I believe we can ensure that American commitment to \n     research and scientific inquiry continues unabated in the \n     years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6112-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF COLONEL MARY TRIPP\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

KENNEDY ON THE 30TH \n                        ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH\n\n   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof one of our Nation's most compassionate and visionary leaders, Robert \nF. Kennedy, who was assassinated 30 years ago. He served our nation as \nAttorney General and United States Senator, but his impact on our \nnation's history cannot be measured by mere titles or the offices he \nheld.\n  Although his life was cut short thirty years ago, his legacy will \nlive on forever. Many of today's leaders were inspired by Bobby \nKennedy--he inspired me to become involved in politics more than three \ndecades ago. I had the privilege to meet Bobby Kennedy in the summer of \n1965 at Stetson University. Shaking his hand forever changed my life. \nNow today in the Senate my desk is very close to his old desk on the \nSenate floor--close enough to always remind me of why I first got \ninvolved in politics.\n  Bobby Kennedy's philosophy was truly admirable. Bobby Kennedy was \ncommitted to equal opportunity for all. He displayed ceaseless devotion \nto the impoverished members of the American community, and pushed for \ndecent wages and adequate healthcare for all. He knew the importance of \nprotecting the well-being of our youth, and he fought to improve their \neducation. Throughout his life, he worked toward a more just society.\n  His tragic death shocked and saddened the hearts of America. I was \nrecovering from my injuries from Vietnam in Walter Reed Hospital the \nday I heard of his tragic death. I am sure many others have a similarly \nclear recollection of that day. We had lost a committed, warmhearted \nleader who we would never forget or replace.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nremembering this admirable and courageous leader, who forever changed \nthe history of this nation. Thirty years later, his memory and legacy \nlive on. We continue to remember Robert F. Kennedy for his passion, \ncourage and devotion, and will always do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6114-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6114-S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO AARON LOPEZ: NEW HAMPSHIRE'S 1998 STATE YOUTH OF THE YEAR \n                                  1998\n\n   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Aaron Lopez of Nashua, NH. Aaron was recently named the \nNew Hampshire State Youth of the Year by the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica.\n  The Youth of the Year program, in its 51st year, recognizes \noutstanding\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\ncontributions to a member's family, school, community, and Boys and \nGirls Club, as well as personal challenges and obstacles overcome.\n  At the Club, Aaron has served as president of the Toastmasters, \ntreasurer of the Keystone Club, a teen leadership group, and peer \nleader of Smart Moves, a drug and sex prevention program. Aaron, a \nsenior at Nashua High School, is also active in his community. He \nparticipated in the Teen Institute, a leadership seminar to educate \nteens about drug and alcohol abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, and \nfamily and community issues. He is also organizing a program for \nParents and Children Together (P.A.C.T.) to help families resolve \nconflicts.\n  For the first time, winners of the 1998 State Youth of the Year \nhonors will receive scholarships for post-secondary education from \npopular television personality Oprah Winfrey. A nationwide fund drive, \nknown as ``Oprah's Angel Network,'' was announced by Oprah on her \nnationally-syndicated television program last fall.\n  Boys and Girls Clubs of America comprises a national network of close \nto 2,000 neighborhood-based facilities annually serving some three \nmillion young people, primarily from disadvantaged circumstances. Known \nas ``The Positive Place for Kids,'' the Clubs provide guidance-oriented \ncharacter development programs on a daily basis for children 6-18 years \nold, conducted by a full-time professional staff. Key Boys and Girls \nClub programs, such as Youth of the Year, emphasize character and \nleadership development, education and career enhancement, health and \nlife skills, the arts, sports, fitness and recreation.\n  Aaron and other extraordinary young people from the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America continue to keep alive the virtue of community service \nand inspire others to do the same. Their personal initiatives, \ndedicated service, and hard work have impacted the lives of many. In a \ntime when young people seem to be less involved in their communities, \nthese young Americans continue to defend and keep the spirit of \ncommunity alive.

Res. 131) entitled ``Concurrent \n     resolution acknowledging 1998 as the International Year of \n     the Ocean and expressing the sense of the Congress regarding \n     the ocean.'', do pass with the following amendments:\n       Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert:\n     That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the ocean is of paramount importance to the economic \n     future, environmental quality, and national security of the \n     United States;\n       (2) the United States has a responsibility to exercise and \n     promote comprehensive stewardship of the ocean and the living \n     marine resources it contains; and\n       (3) Federal agencies are encouraged to take advantage of \n     the International Year of the Ocean in 1998, to--\n       (A) review United States oceanography and marine resource \n     management policies and programs;\n       (B) identify opportunities to streamline, better direct, \n     and increase interagency cooperation in oceanographic \n     research and marine resource management policies and \n     programs;\n       (C) identify opportunities to further cooperation between \n     the United States and other nations to enhance oceanographic \n     research and exploration, and to strengthen international \n     marine resource conservation policies and programs;\n       (D) in cooperation with academic institutions, \n     nongovernmental organizations, and industry, develop \n     scientific, educational, and resource management programs \n     which will advance the exploration of the ocean, the \n     conservation of marine habitats and species, and the \n     sustainable use of ocean resources; and\n       (E) encourage participation in State, local, and private \n     initiatives and programs that use education and the arts to \n     increase public awareness of the ocean and the many benefits \n     that it provides, and to foster understanding of the need to \n     conserve and sustainably manage ocean resources.\n\n       Strike out the preamble and insert:\n\n       Whereas the ocean, which comprises nearly three quarters of \n     the Earth's surface, sustains a large part of the Earth's \n     biodiversity, provides an important source of food, and \n     interacts with and affects global weather and climate;\n       Whereas the ocean is critical to national security, is the \n     common means of transportation\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n     among coastal nations, and carries 95 percent of the United \n     States foreign trade;\n       Whereas the ocean and sea floor contain vast energy and \n     mineral resources that are critical to the economy of the \n     United States and the world;\n       Whereas ocean resources are limited and susceptible to \n     change as a direct and indirect result of human activities, \n     and such changes can impact the ability of the ocean to \n     provide the benefits upon which the Nation depends;\n       Whereas the vast majority of the deep ocean is unexplored \n     and unknown, and the ocean is truly the last frontier on \n     Earth for science and civilization;\n       Whereas there exists significant promise for the \n     development of new ocean technologies for stewardship of \n     ocean resources that will contribute to the economy through \n     business and manufacturing innovations and the creation of \n     new jobs;\n       Whereas any nation's use or misuse of ocean resources has \n     effects far beyond that nation's borders;\n       Whereas it has been 30 years since the Commission on Marine \n     Science, Engineering, and Resources (popularly known as the \n     Stratton Commission) met to examine the state of United \n     States ocean policy and issued recommendations that led to \n     the present Federal structure for oceanography and marine \n     resources management;\n       Whereas recent public opinion polls indicate that a large \n     majority of Americans consider the condition of the oceans to \n     be important, and that a large majority rate the overall \n     health of the oceans negatively; and\n       Whereas the United Nations has declared 1998 to be the \n     International Year of the Ocean, and in order to observe this \n     occasion, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     and other Federal agencies, in cooperation with organizations \n     concerned with ocean science and marine resources, have \n     resolved to promote exploration, utilization, conservation, \n     and public awareness of the ocean: Now, therefore, be it\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/10/senate-section/article/S6115-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6116-S6127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FEDERAL REPORTS ELIMINATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.
