Mr. President, just a few hours ago, President \nClinton delivered his 5-year balanced budget to the Congress. For the \nfirst time in a long while, no one was singing a funeral dirge on \nbudget day. The budget is alive and it is well and already has a sense \nof momentum and history to it. This is a budget that reflects \nmainstream America. It does not favor one special group at the expense \nof another. It does not pit generation against generation or rich \nagainst poor.\n  The President's budget reflects the hopes and the desires of all of \nour citizens, whether it is one of our seniors on a fixed income \nworried about health care or a family concerned about the quality of \neducation of their children or citizens fighting the pollution in the \nneighborhood in which they live. The budget moves ahead toward the \nfuture without leaving anyone behind.\n  As the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, I say to my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle this is a credible budget. Do not \njust knock it. Look at it and see if you want to recommend adjustments \nor amendments to it. It will reach balance by the year 2002. There are \nsafeguards built into this budget to ensure that promise.\n  President Clinton deserves a lot of credit for presenting a real \nbalanced budget that builds upon the deficit reduction of his first \nadministration. Since the President first took office, that deficit has \nbeen reduced consistently and dramatically to last year's low of $107 \nbillion. I can remember when President Clinton took office that no one \ndreamed, no one thought it possible that we could have a budget deficit \nat that low level. It is now the lowest deficit as a percentage of GDP \nof any major industrialized country. There are no dark clouds on the \nhorizon. The economy continues to grow and surpass most expectations. \nThe Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Dr. Alan Greenspan, recently \ntestified before the Senate Budget Committee: ``The economy has \nretained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and \ninflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions.'' And last \nweek we had more good news. The GDP grew at a 4.7 percent rate in the \nfourth quarter of 1996.\n  The President has presented a forward-looking budget that not only \ndemonstrates fiscal stewardship but is oriented toward the 21st century \nand its challenges and opportunities, what America needs to regain its \nfull-time leadership across the face of the globe. It looks forward to \nthe future but does not leave anyone behind.\n  This budget protects Medicare. For example, rather than trying to \nimpose radical and untested structural changes to Medicare, the \nPresident's budget ensures solvency through the year 2006 while at the \nsame time crafting pilot and demonstration projects that will expand \nhealth choices for seniors without jeopardizing the quality of care.\n  This budget also makes critical investments in education, \ntransportation, environmental cleanup, investments that are necessary \nif we are going to have long-term economic growth and an improved \nstandard of living.\n  We must make sure, however, that any new caps on discretionary \nspending will allow these investments to continue, because if we do \nnot, we will be forced to make deep cuts during this 5-year period in \nprograms like computers in schools, highway modernization, safe \ndrinking water grants, and community policing.\n  I hope, too, that as this budget evolves, we will take a closer look \nat cutting special-interest tax breaks and subsidies to help offset the \ncosts of making sound investments. The President has proposed about $34 \nbillion of savings in this area, and we should consider this number \nonly a beginning. Since we will spend over $2.8 trillion for tax breaks \nover the next 5 years, I think we can identify even greater savings in \nthis area. The President's budget also includes $98 billion of tax \nrelief for middle-class Americans, and it is targeted toward child \ncare, college tuition, and buying and owning a home.\n\n  Mr. President, this budget is an excellent starting point, and I \nbelieve the Budget Committee markup is the appropriate venue for \nRepublicans and Democrats alike to resolve their differences. The \nAmerican people deserve to know and everybody within the sound of my \nvoice deserves to know the changes that the Republicans would like to \nmake to the President's budget. If they think they can do better, OK. \nLook at it and try to make some decision. But they have an obligation \nto the American people to show ``how,'' ``where,'' and ``when'' and not \nsimply carp.\n  Mr. President, Senate Majority Leader Lott has called for the so-\ncalled regular order to produce a budget through the normal legislative \nprocess. I second that call. Regular order would be for the Budget \nCommittee to conclude its hearings in a timely manner and then write a \nbudget in early to mid March. At that point, either the Republicans \nwould use the President's budget, or Chairman Domenici will have a \nchance to put down a budget of his own. Congress would then stand a \nchance of meeting the April 15 statutory deadline for producing a \nbudget and the bipartisan goal of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, as we move toward the balanced budget, we must also \nremember that we are Senators, not simply accountants. We have to look \nat any budget proposal and evaluate its impact on the American people, \ntheir lives and the economy. A budget--as the distinguished occupant of \nthe chair knows from his professional background as a physician tending \nto people's needs --a budget is far more than numbers. A budget is \nprograms like Medicare, Medicaid, educational opportunity, cleaner \nenvironment. A budget has to be a reflection of the American people, \ntheir needs, their dreams, their hopes. That is what this budget, \nfrankly, is. I hope we will get to work quickly on a review of the \nbudget if any changes are going to be recommended.\n  As I said earlier, let's hear them. But I am encouraged by what I \nhave heard to this point--not just those who want to hang a black drape \nand say it doesn't work, it won't go, it can't go, it shouldn't go, but \nrather a more reasoned approach, I think. We all know that we are on \ndifferent sides of the aisle in terms of the parties, but I am talking \nabout a more reasoned approach that says maybe this budget is one that \nwe can work from, or work to, and we can get ourselves a budget that \nreflects the interests of both of our parties, our country, and our \npeople.\n  It is time for a reasoned discussion. It is time for a deliberate \ndiscussion for a serious review. And I am optimistic about the \npossibilities of being able to say to the American people that we did \njust what they wanted us to do. We got over the bipartisan squabbling. \nWe are not fighting anymore. What we are trying to do is to do what our \nconstituents sent us here to do, and that is solve the problems, folks, \ndon't just argue about them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, can I ask what the present proceedings are \nbefore the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is currently in morning \nbusiness, and Senators are to be recognized for up to 5 minutes. \nSeveral Senators, under a previous order, will be recognized for up to \n10 or 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1050-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1050-S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly this morning about \nthe status of the President's budget. Obviously, this is always a very \nsignificant event when the President presents a budget. This year, I \nthink the climate\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nand the substance of the budget is significantly different than what \nhas occurred in past years. There is a commitment by this Congress to \nget to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  A year ago, we sent a budget that would have accomplished that to the \nPresident, and he, regrettably, vetoed it. Now the President has come \nforward and accepted this challenge and said that he also believes that \nwe should get to a balanced budget by the year 2002. He sent up to us a \nproposal to accomplish that. His budget, as proposed, has many \nconstructive functions in it. It also has many questions. Regrettably, \nit has a lot that is left undone and unaddressed.\n  On the constructive side, he does get to a balanced budget --at least \nas he claims--using his numbers. Unfortunately, the questions that are \nraised by the way in which he gets there are significant. For example, \nnext year, the deficit will go up and the following year the deficit \nwill go up, under his budget. Even in the following year, the deficit \ngoes up under his budget. It is not really until he is about to leave \noffice that he alleges or represents he is going to put in place \nprograms which would bring the deficit down. That, to me, is not what I \nwould call a good glidepath to a balanced budget. The glidepath should \nbe a downhill glidepath, not a roller-coaster graph.\n  The President proposes about $258 billion of not cuts, but attempts \nto slow spending over the next few years. Of this, it appears that \nabout $80 billion comes from defense, about $58 billion comes from \ndomestic discretionary programs, and about $21 billion comes from \nentitlement issues. Those are good, solid numbers--well, not \nnecessarily solid numbers, but good starting numbers, and we will see \nwhether they are solid numbers.\n  At the same time he is proposing $121 billion in savings over the \nnext few years in the rate of growth of entitlements, he is also \nproposing $60 billion of new spending on entitlement programs, such as \nnew Medicare benefits, Medicaid benefits, food stamp and SSI benefits, \nnew health insurance benefits. And under his education initiative is a \nbrand new entitlement program for school instruction, allegedly, and a \nbrand new entitlement program for school literacy--$60 billion in new \nspending, which gives you basically a net in the entitlement areas over \n5 years of $60 billion in reduction, which is not a very significant \nnumber. That is about $10 billion a year on entitlement spending which \nannually represents almost 55 percent of the Federal budget and is \nclosing in on $700 billion. So it is not a big number. In fact, it is \nnot a strong enough number in order to get to a solid balanced budget \nbecause what happens is that, even if we get to the balanced budget, \neven if we accept the figures which the President has proposed in his \nbudget as getting to the balanced budget in the year 2002, we see those \ndeficits exploding after that period. Why is that? Because there is no \nfundamental proposal for structural reform of the major entitlement \nprograms in the President's budget. That is where I believe this budget \nis inappropriate. There has to be fundamental reform if we are going to \nhonestly address this issue, if we are not going to simply pass it off \nonto the next administration, as would occur in this case, or the next \nCongress as might occur in our case, or, unfortunately, the next \ngeneration, which is exactly what we are doing as a Congress and a \nPresidency if we pursue a tentative course in addressing the \nentitlement reform.\n\n  In the area of entitlement reform, there is in the President's budget \nno initiative to try to put in balance for any extended period of time \nthe Medicare trust fund, part A, or the Medicare system. The President \nof the Senate today has been one of the leaders on the issue of how you \ncan reform Medicare in a substantive way so we can have a strong \ninsurance system for our seniors.\n  I have also put together something called Medicare Choice, or Choice \nCare, which would be a substantive structural reform which would use \nthe marketplace to try to create an incentive for efficiency in the \nMedicare system which would give seniors choices, much as we have as \nMembers of Congress, to go into the marketplace and choose a variety of \ndifferent health care programs, the type of structural reform which \nmyself and the Senator from Tennessee, who is in the chair today, have \ntalked about, are trying to energize and for which we have a lot of \nsupport, by the way, here in Congress. It is nowhere to be found in the \nPresident's proposal, nor is there any other structural reform which \nwould address the underlying Medicare concerns to be found in his \nproposal; just a variety of traditional provider payment slowdowns and \npossibly an accounting mechanism that would significantly adjust the \nway we pay for home health care. Neither is there a long-term solution, \nbut one which is a totally inappropriate accounting gimmick. There is \nno long-term solution as to how we make Medicare solvent. So the \nproposal does not address Medicare reform.\n  The proposal also does not address the reform of our tax laws, which \nit should. It calls for a $98 billion cut in taxes. It also calls for \nan increase in taxes of about $76 billion. So essentially there is no \ntax cut in this package. More importantly, there is no attempt to \naddress the underlying problem which our tax laws have. We just saw \nwhere the IRS spent $4 billion to put in place a computer system to try \nto make the tax system work in this country, and it appears it can't \neven figure out who is filing what returns when and how much they are \nowed. After spending $4 billion, the IRS has openly admitted that it \nhas failed; $4 billion down the drain. Why is that? Is it because they \ncannot produce such a computer system? In large part, yes. More \nsignificantly, it is because our tax laws are so complex and convoluted \nthat they are simply unenforceable and ineffective, and is not a way \nthat we should be raising revenues for the citizenry. The IRS has \nbecome a totally overbearing and, in many instances, inept organization \nwhich the American people no longer have confidence in. That undermines \nconstitutional government when your tax-raising organizations lose the \nconfidence of the people.\n  So there should be a proposal, or at least a discussion of or an \ninitiative for how you reform the tax laws, how we take this great, \nhuge, byzantine morass called the IRS and bring it into the 21st \ncentury and simply make it understandable and give the American people \nan opportunity to file a tax return on a postcard, pay taxes, and know \nthat they are being accounted for correctly and recognize that we need \nmore efficiency.\n  So there is no proposal in here for fundamental tax reform, and there \nshould be. The President has missed an opportunity. It is basically a \nbudget which is based on optimistic economic assumptions, has in it new \nentitlement proposals for spending, and has a very low net tax cut, \nnone of which really accomplishes the basic goals of the balanced \nbudget. If we are going to balance the budget, we have to fundamentally \nreform the underlying drivers of our budget problem, which is the \nentitlement system and our tax laws. Yet, that is not addressed in this \nbudget proposal. It is, however, a starting point.\n  We as a Senate, and I as a member of the Budget Committee, intend to \ntake it as such and to work with the President to try to put in place \nsomething that should not only lead us to a balanced budget in the year \n2002 but will give us an opportunity at least to see some light at the \nend of the tunnel for a long-term resolution of the major underlying \npublic policy questions which we have in this country--Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and our tax laws.\n  So I appreciate the time, Mr. President, of the body. I yield back my \ntime at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1050-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, over 2 years after the defeat of health \nreform in Congress, many opponents of change still claim that Americans \nare satisfied with their health care and view Federal oversight as the \nfirst step in a Government takeover of the system. They assert that \nminor tinkering may be needed to shore up some of the system's weak \nspots, but access to and quality of care in our country are the best in \nthe world.\n  If the public thinks the system isn't broken, so the thinking goes, \nthere is no reason for lawmakers to try to fix it.\n  But are Americans so happy with the current state of health affairs?\n  Evidence from a recent survey suggests that there is still much that \ntroubles the public about our current system, and they expect their \nelected representatives to help them address the problems they are \nexperiencing.\n  People are confused about how the system works; they are anxious \nabout the cost of medical care; and they don't always feel they can \nobtain information to help them make sound health choices, get care \nwhen they need it, and be assured of quality.\n  And contrary to the widely publicized view that most people think \nGovernment should not be involved in health care, a bipartisan majority \nof Americans feel that the Federal Government can play an active role--\nworking with the private sector--to make health care more affordable \nand improve its quality.\n  These are the findings of a poll of American households commissioned \nby the National Coalition on Health Care. The bipartisan coalition, \ncochaired by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, is the \nNation's largest and most broadly representative alliance of large and \nsmall business, labor unions, consumer groups, religious groups, and \nprimary care providers.\n  The National Coalition on Health Care's recent survey reveals a \ndisturbing lack of confidence among the majority of Americans with the \nstate and direction of health care. Eight out of ten agree that ``there \nis something seriously wrong with our health care system.'' Less than \nhalf say they have ``confidence in the health care system to take care \nof [them].''\n  Not surprisingly, the poll reveals that lower-income Americans are \nparticularly troubled by their experiences with cost, coverage, and \ntreatment. Perhaps more startling is the pervasive concern of middle-\nincome Americans who also see major flaws in the system related to \nquality, access, and cost.\n\n  While a majority feel that their medical plan works for them, 4 in 10 \nreport reductions in coverage. Medicare recipients are among those most \nsatisfied and confident in their care.\n  Perhaps most disturbing for the Congress is the coalition's focus \ngroup's finding that Americans believe improvements in the health care \nsystem have been held hostage to partisan politics. While Americans do \nnot want Government involved directly in their health care, they do \nbelieve that Government has a role in protecting their interests.\n  Americans have voiced their concerns and have asked for Government's \nhelp--not in delivering health care, but in giving them greater \nsecurity about their ability to afford and retain health insurance. We \nshould heed their call.\n  Last year we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which helped workers \nwho lose or switch jobs keep their health insurance. This year, \nDemocrats believe it makes sense to build on that success by giving \nworking families financial assistance to help them insure their \nchildren.\n  These children do not come from the poorest families, for the poor \nhave Medicaid. The vast majority of the 10.5 million uninsured children \nin America are sons and daughters of working parents who do not have \naccess to affordable coverage through their workplace. Though many of \nthese parents work 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, they are still not \nable to buy health insurance for their children.\n  Yet we know that a little financial assistance goes a long way toward \ncovering kids and saving health care dollars and precious lives down \nthe line. Numerous studies confirm that uninsured children don't get \nthe cost-effective preventive care they need and end up costing the \nsystem more in the long run, through more expensive emergency room \nvisits, hospital admissions, and preventable chronic illnesses.\n  The Government Accounting Office reports that uninsured children are \nless likely than those with coverage to get needed health and \npreventive care, and that the lack of such care can adversely affect \nchildren's health status throughout their lives. These children are \nless likely to have routine doctor visits or have a regular source of \nmedical care, less likely to get care for injuries, see a physician if \nchronically ill, or get dental care, and they are less likely to be \nappropriately immunized to prevent childhood illnesses.\n  Each of us already helps pay for these children through implicit cost \nshifting for uncompensated care. But we pay too much, and we get far \ntoo little. How much better it would be to help families obtain \ninsurance for their children from the start; to provide continuous, \ncost-effective health care from birth through age 18 so that children \ncan grow up healthy and maximize their potential.\n  The Children's Health Coverage Act, S. 13, provides tax credits to \nhelp working families purchase private coverage for their uninsured \nchildren. There are many additional ideas being floated, from both \nsides of the aisle, to help families obtain coverage for their \nchildren. These ideas should be debated, considered, refined, and \ncrafted into bipartisan legislation that can pass the Congress this \nyear.\n  The American public wants us to act responsibly on their behalf to \nassure access to quality health care at a fair cost. Now is the time to \nact on that charge. There is ample common ground on the issue of \nextending health coverage to children. Let's prove there is ample will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1052-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1052-S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO PAMELA CHURCHILL HARRIMAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute \nto a very distinguished citizen of the world, Pamela Churchill \nHarriman, whose untimely death occurred yesterday in Paris, France, \nwhile she was performing her very distinguished duties as United States \nAmbassador to France.\n  Ambassador Harriman had an illustrious career. She has graced Europe, \nshe has graced the United States, and has capped an extraordinary life \nwith very distinguished service for the past 4 years as our Ambassador \nto France, dealing, in fact, with some of the most difficult problems \nof the world, as we have tensions between the United States and France \nand the problems of NATO and a great many other issues.\n  During the past several years, I have had the privilege to come to \nknow Ambassador Harriman personally. I traveled to Paris in connection \nwith my duties as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and \nfound her knowledge, experience, and wisdom in that field to be very \nextensive and, candidly, it was somewhat of a surprise to find such \ndepth and knowledge and understanding on the complicated matters which \ninvolve intelligence.\n  She truly had an extraordinary life. Married to Randolph Churchill, \nthe son of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she was privy to some of \nthe really fascinating and great events of the era.\n  During the course of conversations with her, I was struck to hear her \ntell of being at Checkers, the home of the Prime Minister, one Sunday \nevening when the dinner was interrupted by a telephone call from \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And she told the story about Prime \nMinister Winston Churchill telling the story of President Roosevelt \ntelling to Churchill the United States was now in it with Great \nBritain, because the attack on Pearl Harbor had just occurred.\n  And then her reminiscences about the events during the war. The \nChurchills had a basement at No. 10 Downing Street for when the air \nraids came on. They had tiered bunkers. They were not set up in very \nelaborate fashion. She slept in the lower bunk, pregnant at the time, \nand Sir Winston Churchill would come in, she recounted, at 2 a.m. and \nsnore loudly, awakening everybody in the compound.\n  When I heard of the news 2 days ago, I called Charge d'Affaires \nDonald Bandler to find out what her condition was. She finished an \narduous day, was on her way for a swim in the Ritz Hotel and, before \ngoing into the water, had suffered a seizure.\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\n  I had a chance to talk briefly with her son, Winston Churchill, who \nsaid at that point it was apparent that his mother would not survive.\n  While talking with her about the events of being an ambassador, I was \nstruck with the difficulties that Ambassadors of the United States are \nhaving around the world and took some of the information and made a \nstatement on the Senate floor praising the work she was doing, \nillustrative of ambassadors generally, commenting about the need to \nsupport the State Department and the activities which ambassadors were \nperforming.\n  While there, I had an opportunity to stay in the Benjamin Franklin \nRoom, a room of special significance to this Senator, Franklin being a \nPhiladelphian really, not a Bostonian, and had an opportunity to get \nsome of the memorabilia from the Ben Franklin Institute to send to \nAmbassador Harriman to furnish the Franklin Room in the style she \nwanted it to be.\n  We have lost a really great world citizen with the passing of \nAmbassador Harriman. There is much more that could be said about her, \nin terms of her illustrious life. Many Senators knew her; most of \nWashington knew her. She was a great citizen of Great Britain, she was, \nin a sense, a citizen of France but, most of all, a great citizen of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the opportunity at the NATO \nconference in November, as the ranking member and former chairman of \nState, Justice, Commerce Appropriations, to spend an entire morning \nwith Ambassador Harriman going over her particular needs, her budget. I \nwas really impressed with the overall view she had of the needs of the \nDepartment of State, particularly her grasp of bringing the Department \nup to date in the area of communications, upgrading its computers, and \nother technological issues.\n  I could tell that she understood, after we had some time together, \nthat the lack of real financial support for the Department of State has \nbeen at the executive branch, not here in the Congress. I have fought \nfor many, many years to try to get the needed increases for the \nendeavors of the State Department. And now with the fall of the wall, \ndefense is not our first line of defense. The State Department is.\n  We are trying to sell capitalism. We are trying to sell democracy and \nindividual rights the world around. And that is the province of our \nDepartment of State, which has been cut back. We have been closing \nconsulates and closing embassies.\n  The record will show that the distinguished Ambassador had really \nbeen to the President on these issues, and for the first time President \nClinton has made a substantial request for an increase for the \nDepartment of State. There will be many kudos, well deserved, for \nAmbassador Harriman, but I think she was the one who finally got the \nmessage to the executive branch as to what was needed at the State \nDepartment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Brookings Institute \nCouncil on Foreign Relations study recently published on the needs of \nthe State Department and the diplomacy of the U.S. Government be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Financing American Leadership: Protecting American Interests and \n                       Promoting American Values\n\n(Statement of the Task Force on Resources for International Affairs of \n    the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations)\n\n\n                      i. introduction and summary\n\n       Relative to the average of the 1980s, spending on \n     international affairs has fallen nearly 20 percent in real \n     terms, and it would decline by as much as another 30 percent \n     under the plans proposed by the President and the Congress \n     for balancing the federal budget by 2002.\n       Noting this trend in foreign affairs spending, the Council \n     on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution, while \n     taking no positions on the question as organizations, \n     convened an independent Task Force of distinguished private \n     citizens with a strong commitment to foreign affairs to \n     examine its consequences and to make such recommendations as \n     it might see fit.\n       The Task Force concludes that the cuts already made in the \n     international affairs discretionary account have adversely \n     affected, to a significant degree, the ability of the United \n     States to protect and promote its economic, diplomatic and \n     strategic agendas abroad. Unless this trend is reversed, \n     American vital interests will be jeopardized.\n       The Task Force calls on the President and the Secretary of \n     State to exert the strong and sustained leadership that will \n     be necessary to secure the understanding of the American \n     people and the bipartisan support of the Congress to provide \n     the funds necessary to finance American global leadership. \n     This effort must be accompanied by a thorough review of the \n     foreign affairs agencies with an eye toward a structure and \n     to processes that will be more efficient and effective in \n     terms of today's requirements.\n       The Task Force recommends that the President call for an \n     increase in international affairs spending from its 1997 \n     level of $19 billion to $21 billion in 1998, with annual \n     adjustments through the year 2002 to offset projected \n     inflation.\\1\\ In addition, this report calls for the creation \n     of a bipartisan commission to consider possible reforms in \n     the State Department and the other foreign affairs agencies \n     and identifies nearly one billion dollars in achievable \n     reforms and economies. The amount of the net increase the \n     Task Force proposes represents only about one-tenth of one \n     percent of the entire FY 1997 federal budget and less than \n     four-tenths of one percent for the total discretionary \n     budget. Although these amounts are small in absolute terms, \n     the potential consequences of not having them are quite \n     large.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The corresponding amount of budget authority would be \n     roughly $22 billion in 1998, due to the fact that increases \n     in actual spending always lag increases in the authorization \n     to spend. The amounts are similar to, but for technical \n     reasons somewhat greater than, spending and budget authority \n     for the ``150 (foreign affairs) account.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                   ii. the challenge and opportunity\n\n       With the Cold War over, it is natural that the United \n     States should focus more on domestic concerns. Reducing the \n     federal budget deficit must be a high priority. Ensuring that \n     government programs are efficient and effective is an \n     obligation owed to American taxpayers. However, domestic \n     renewal must not blind us to the world's continuing dangers \n     and the requirements of America's essential leadership role.\n       The end of the Cold War has transformed the nature of the \n     challenges we face. Ethnic strife, regional instability, \n     crime, narcotics, terrorism, famine, environmental \n     degradation, fanaticism and rogue regimes with mass \n     destruction capabilities have taken the place of the global \n     communist threat on our agenda. The United States cannot \n     effectively protect its interests in these areas and provide \n     leadership for those who would work with us unless we are \n     prepared to spend the amount necessary to protect our \n     interests and promote our values.\n       Moreover, by strengthening friendly forces and by calming \n     and defusing potentially explosive situations, our diplomats \n     can reduce the demands upon our military forces, avoiding \n     unnecessary troop deployments and saving much more money in \n     the defense account than would be spent from the much smaller \n     foreign affairs account. With such objectives in mind, our \n     diplomatic arm for example, has reinforced in recent years \n     our basic Asia-Pacific alliances with Japan, Korea, \n     Australia, Thailand and the Philippines. In both Asia and \n     Europe, new concepts of regional security and economic \n     cooperation have been advocated, including dialogues among \n     former adversaries. Timely spending for conflict resolution \n     can help to obviate the need for costly disaster relief, \n     refugee resettlement and possible military deployments.\n       The U.S. economy is increasingly interdependent with the \n     rest of the world--a world that is increasingly competitive. \n     Most recent increases in our nation's manufacturing \n     employment have come from increased export volume which has \n     produced jobs with higher than average wages and helped to \n     drive the continuous growth of our economy. Our ability to \n     sustain that growth depends, in part, on our willingness and \n     ability to employ the traditional instruments of foreign \n     policy to promote exports, protect our products and ensure \n     open trade. These are complex undertakings that include tasks \n     ranging from sustainable development and basic institution \n     building (e.g. establishing commercial codes where none have \n     existed) to multilateral trade negotiations such as in the \n     World Trade Organization. We know how to do these things; we \n     must establish the priorities and be prepared to spend the \n     money to deploy the assets, people and institutions required \n     to achieve them.\n       Managing today's international, political, economic and \n     security problems and seizing the opportunities before us \n     requires American leadership. Exercising that leadership is \n     difficult. It demands sustained official and public \n     diplomacy, an array of economic and military sticks and \n     carrots, and preventive measures where they can be effective. \n     And it will require money.\n       Senator Richard Lugar in a recent admonition to the \n     country's policy makers summarized the view of the Task \n     Force: ``Too many leaders in both political parties have \n     bowed to political expedience and embraced the fiction that \n     international spending does not benefit Americans and \n     therefore can be cut with impunity. As important as balancing \n     the budget is, it will not happen if American\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\n     disengagement from the world results in nuclear terrorism, an \n     international trade war, an international energy crisis, a \n     major regional conflict requiring U.S. intervention, or some \n     other preventable disaster that undermines our security and \n     prosperity.''\n       Americans want the United States to remain a world leader. \n     Polling by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations reveals \n     that two-thirds of the public wants the United States to \n     remain actively engaged in world affairs. This number is \n     actually higher than during many parts of the 1970s and early \n     1980s, when we were in the winter of the Cold War. Other poll \n     data strongly support the belief that the public is willing \n     to pay for continued global engagement.\n\n\n                      III. Projected Expenditures\n\n       What resources is our government currently devoting to \n     meeting these global challenges and opportunities?\n       In FY 1997, the United States will spend about $19 billion \n     for its diplomatic and foreign assistance. That amount is \n     slightly more than one percent of the overall federal budget. \n     It is less in real or inflation-adjusted terms than \n     international discretionary spending in any year since 1979, \n     and nearly 20 percent below the average since then.\n       International affairs is the only major category of federal \n     spending that has undergone a real reduction since 1980. \n     Along with funding for the Pentagon, international spending \n     is one of only two major components of the federal budget to \n     have been reduced since 1990.\n       As problematic as spending cuts have been to date, those \n     now planned are much worse. The President's last fiscal plan, \n     of early 1996, anticipated that real funding for \n     international affairs would decline from $19 billion to $16.5 \n     billion by 2002. If he agrees--as he may do--to use \n     Congressional Budget Office assumptions, the President would \n     need to cut significantly more. Under the Congressional \n     budget-balancing resolution of April, 1996, international \n     spending would drop to $13 billion, or 30 percent below its \n     current level and 45 percent below its 1980-1995 average in \n     constant 1997 dollars. That would be less than at any time \n     since 1955.\n       In contrast with the defense and intelligence budgets, the \n     international affairs account is not at all protected in the \n     deficit-elimination process. In the three year budget \n     agreement concluded between President Bush and the \n     Democratic-led Congress in 1990 (the ``Andrews Air Force Base \n     Agreement'') the international affairs function as well as \n     the national defense function of the budget were fenced off \n     and protected from diversion to alternative spending. By \n     contrast, at the conclusion of the January, 1996 budget \n     negotiations, there was political agreement to put a floor \n     under the national defense budget, but international affairs \n     was grouped with all other non-defense discretionary \n     expenditures and targeted by OMB for straight-line \n     reductions. Subsequent pleas from the State Department for \n     the protection of foreign affairs within a more expansive \n     ``national security'' category were to no avail.\n\n\n                            IV. Consequences\n\n       The State Department and its 260-plus overseas posts \n     constitute the basic and indispensable infrastructure upon \n     which all US civilian--and many military--elements rely to \n     protect and promote American interests around the world. The \n     Task Force found unmistakable evidence that the readiness of \n     this infrastructure has been seriously eroded. Some 30 posts \n     have been closed in the past three years for lack of \n     operating funds. Many of the remaining posts are shabby, \n     unsafe and ill-equipped. All are handicapped by obsolete \n     information technology. Staffing is highly uneven. The \n     Department's cadre of language and area specialists has been \n     depleted and resources for public diplomacy are fast \n     disappearing. Yet the demands upon our missions continue to \n     grow. Reports circulate that budget cuts may force the \n     Department to close more posts abroad and that the Department \n     is being advised to sell off its assets in order to meet \n     operating expenses. Taken together, these developments \n     contribute to an image of decline and withdrawal which \n     disheartens our friends and allies and undermines our \n     effectiveness abroad, as do the actual cuts out of our \n     diplomatic muscle.\n       More subtle is the extent to which the Executive's options \n     have been severely limited for lack of readily available, \n     flexible resources with which to avert or respond to foreign \n     crises. Future chief executives, regardless of party, will \n     find this every bit as vexing as has the present incumbent.\n       In the recent past our government has been forced to \n     choose, sometimes arbitrarily, which situations it will \n     engage in and which it will ignore. Here are some recent \n     examples: To stabilize Haiti, the decision had to be made to \n     reduce economic support for Turkey despite its critical \n     relationship to our Middle East interests; the decision to \n     provide aid to shore up the West Bank and Gaza was made at \n     the expense of funds originally intended to help demobilize \n     the armed forces of the parties to a Central American peace \n     agreement which the United States had spent years \n     negotiating; providing our share of the financing package \n     assembled for Cambodia's first free election required \n     deferring, for more than a year, support for smaller \n     initiatives in a dozen or so other countries; responding to \n     the refugee crisis in Rwanda meant taking funds for \n     democratic institution-building from the rest of Africa at a \n     moment when positive trends were emerging elsewhere on the \n     continent; and when the United States needed $2 million to \n     monitor a cease-fire between the Kurdish factions in northern \n     Iraq, ready money was not immediately available, the \n     situation deteriorated, and Saddam Hussein was afforded a \n     pretext to send forces into northern Iraq--a move which \n     culminated in US military action costing multiples of the \n     originally needed sum.\n       US investment in economic development, either through our \n     bilateral programs or international financial institutions \n     (IFIs) like the World Bank, has declined to $8.5 billion from \n     the $12 billion average of the earlier 1990's. It is \n     projected to fall every year under both the President's and \n     the Congressional out-year plans. The consequences of not \n     investing in development are impossible to quantify, but the \n     evidence of the benefits that development has brought to over \n     one-half of the world's population is impressive. In the \n     purely human dimension, US bilateral leadership has been \n     critical to recent worldwide advances in agricultural and \n     medical research and basic human needs including primary \n     education, family planning, child nutrition and immunization \n     programs.\n       Our own political and economic self-interest also benefit \n     from the activities of the IFIs. But as we fall behind in \n     meeting our commitments, we risk losing our ability to shape \n     their agendas in support of our objectives. In the past, this \n     influence has enabled us to mobilize multilateral funding to \n     supplement our own increasingly limited bilateral funds for \n     reconstruction in Bosnia, Haiti, the West Bank/Gaza, to \n     stabilize the Mexican peso, and to reinforce the transitions \n     to democracy in Central Europe and the countries of the \n     former Soviet Union. At home, US exporters expect to feel the \n     effects if our support for the IFIs continues to decline. \n     Nearly one half of US exports go to Asia, Latin America and \n     Africa, where close to 80 percent of the world's population \n     lives. IFI lending drives critical segments of development \n     which, in turn, determine the future market potential of \n     these countries.\n       United States' arrearages to the United Nations present a \n     more complicated and troublesome case. An independent Council \n     on Foreign Relations-sponsored Task Force chaired by George \n     Soros recently concluded that where the United States had \n     taken clear and firm positions, the United Nations ``has \n     served US interests well.'' The report noted further that its \n     judgments of the UN's utility ``have been shared by both the \n     Bush and Clinton administrations.'' But the UN will not \n     continue to work for us, particularly after we succeeded in \n     imposing our will on the issue of a new Secretary General, if \n     we are not prepared to meet our financial obligations. Nor \n     will our efforts toward reform of the UN system gain momentum \n     if it appears that the United States is unlikely to settle \n     its arrearages, which now amount to $300 million for the \n     regular budget and $700 million for peacekeeping operations.\n       The damaging implications of the planned, progressive \n     reduction in the international affairs budget are immediately \n     evident upon examination of the limited options for their \n     implementation. The most obvious strategy would be to take \n     most of the cut out of one or the other of its largest \n     components--development assistance and the Israel/Egypt \n     programs. Either would be virtually eliminated if it were \n     targeted. The alternative would be to cut each component \n     proportionately. Under this scenario, the State Department \n     could not avoid closing nearly 100 additional posts and \n     funding for ``new global issues''--including crime, \n     corruption, narcotics and the environment--would be at risk.\n       The magnitude of the cuts proposed through the year 2002 \n     would make it impossible to avoid significant cuts in support \n     for the Middle East peace process and development aid, \n     regardless of the strength and persuasiveness of their \n     advocates within the US political process. Those programs are \n     where the money is, and if total cuts of a cumulative \n     magnitude of nearly 50 percent are made, they simply cannot \n     be spared.\n       Advocates of sharp reductions in international spending \n     frequently do not spell out how their recommendations should \n     be implemented. They may be prepared to see one activity or \n     another savaged, but would probably find at least one of the \n     above-mentioned consequences of drastic cuts unacceptable.\n       None of this is meant to imply that there is no room for \n     selective reductions in foreign aid or no need for a tighter \n     focus on administering its distribution. Insufficient funding \n     is by no means the only problem with our foreign affairs \n     programs. However, any changes should be made with a scalpel \n     rather than an ax. The Task Force has identified several \n     specific areas where savings could be made in order to \n     enhance effectiveness and to offset partially the increases \n     it proposes.\n\n\n                           v. recommendations\n\n       To reverse the destructive funding trend of the last few \n     years, the President must take the initiative to ask for \n     adequate funding for international affairs and to work \n     together with the Congress to ensure that our foreign affairs \n     structure is organized to meet today's requirements with \n     maximum efficiency and effectiveness. He must take \n     responsibility for doing what only he can do--explain to the \n     American people why we need to devote resources to promoting \n     our interests abroad. At the same time, he must make clear to \n     the foreign affairs bureaucracy that ``business as usual'' is \n     unacceptable. All the poll data show that the American people \n     support constructive engagement and recognize the dangers and \n     opportunities abroad. They know\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n     leadership does not come cheaply and they will support the \n     President once he makes clear what is needed and that he is \n     prepared to push for reform.\n       Next, the Executive and the Congress must reestablish the \n     bipartisan and bicameral cooperation necessary to ensure that \n     adequate funds are provided. Otherwise, American interests \n     will be increasingly at risk in a rapidly changing and \n     turbulent world. To the extent that agreement can be reached \n     between the President and Congress on restructuring the \n     foreign affairs agencies, it would be highly desirable to \n     agree on basic terms in time for any necessary legislative \n     action to be completed during the coming session of \n     Congress.\n       Specifically, in FY 1998, federal discretionary spending on \n     international affairs should rise to $21 billion from its \n     1997 level of $19 billion, with annual adjustments through \n     the year 2002 to offset inflation. The recommended figure is \n     still well below the average of the 1980-1995 time period but \n     considerably more than current projections.\n       The Task Force was acutely aware of the continuing budget \n     pressures and searched for ways to cut existing costs. We \n     present these reforms before outlining the increases that are \n     recommended:\n       Saving in the development assistance account can be \n     realized by dropping the Title I PL 480 food program and \n     through the amalgamation of the Agency for International \n     Development's extensive administrative support operations as \n     discussed below.\n       Continuing administrative reforms in UN organizations and \n     the international financial organizations should produce \n     savings for the US of $100 million per year by the year 2002.\n       Amalgamation and re-engineering of the administrative \n     support services of the foreign affairs agencies need not \n     await the larger structural review recommended and therefore \n     should be initiated immediately. This reform would be a \n     logical follow-on to the newly agreed upon collaborative \n     arrangements for financing overseas administrative support. \n     The foreign affairs agencies should be directed to move \n     without further delay to eliminate overlap and duplication of \n     policy and program functions among themselves, as directed by \n     the Vice President in 1995. These actions should produce \n     savings of $100 million to $200 million by the end of the \n     decade.\n       A mission-by-mission review of all agencies' overseas \n     staffing should be considered as a means of sharpening focus \n     and realigning resources with policy priorities. Such a \n     review could achieve additional savings in accounts other \n     than 150.\n       We are persuaded that some restructuring of the foreign \n     affairs agencies is needed and that this would produce \n     additional savings--although less than some advocates have \n     suggested. Restructuring the foreign affairs agencies is a \n     task assigned by the Constitution and by practical necessity \n     to both political branches of the government and requires the \n     cooperation of leaders on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. \n     We urge the President and Congressional leaders to come \n     together on a mechanism--a bipartisan commission appointed \n     jointly by Congressional leaders and the President is one \n     time-honored method--to develop a solution which all can \n     support and which will improve the formation and \n     implementation of policy.\n       Disagreement over organization must not be permitted to be \n     the cause or the excuse for failure to reach agreement on the \n     funding increases that will be necessary--whatever structural \n     reforms are agreed upon. The following summaries our \n     recommendations for increases relative to FY 1997 spending \n     levels (all numbers are annual unless otherwise indicated, \n     should be maintained at this level in real terms for the next \n     five years, and are expressed in constant 1997 dollars):\n       $600 million should be available in accounts which the \n     President can draw upon to take prompt, concrete actions to \n     fix problems of urgent and particular concern to the United \n     States. Uses would include economic and security support, \n     military education and training, foreign military financing, \n     conflict prevention and resolution, democratic institution-\n     building, non-proliferation, counter-narcotics * * *.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                             vi. conclusion\n\n       The President has spoken very clearly about the imperatives \n     of global leadership and its price. In Detroit last October \n     he declared: ``The burden of American leadership and the \n     importance of it--indeed, the essential character of American \n     leadership--is one of the great lessons of the 20th century. \n     It will be an even more powerful reality in the 21st \n     century.''\n       What remains now is for the President to recognize that \n     without adequate resources it will not be possible to provide \n     the international leadership that our national interests \n     require. There are three aspects to this challenge:\n       First, the President must include in his 1998 budget \n     request an amount adequate to fund American leadership and he \n     must also reverse the out-year projections which threaten our \n     posture abroad. Second, the President must take the \n     international affairs resource issue to the American people. \n     The President, more than any other individual or institution \n     of our system, bears the responsibility for the success or \n     failure of American foreign policy. Better than anyone else, \n     he can make clear what it means not to have the resources \n     required to protect and promote American values and \n     interests. As Commander-in-Chief, the President can \n     underscore the vital link between diplomacy and deterrence. \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the nature of \n     this connection very clearly when he addressed the Corps of \n     Cadets at West Point last October 25: ``We will serve the \n     American people best of all if we can prevent the conflicts \n     and emergencies that call for a military response from ever \n     arising. . . . If we hold that line around the world, we are \n     much less likely to have to send you and the troops you will \n     command into harm's way sometime in the future.''\n       Third, once the President has done these two things he will \n     be in a position to reach out to the leadership of the \n     Congress to establish understanding about international \n     affairs financing. This must be a collaborative, non-partisan \n     undertaking and the President must commit, at the outset, to \n     a review of the structure and coordination of the foreign \n     policy agencies as recommended above. The initial move in \n     this regard must be the President's and it must be \n     accompanied by a clear indication of his willingness to take \n     the resource issue to the American people. He must then be \n     joined by the Congress, which deserves nothing less than a \n     full understanding, a full voice in decisions, and a full \n     measure of responsibility.\n       The American people do not want to swap a budget deficit \n     for a security deficit. We suspect most Americans would be \n     alarmed if these proposed budget cuts go through only to \n     discover that America faces an influence gap in world affairs \n     as we enter the twenty-first century.\n       We can afford to do more. We cannot afford to do less.\n\n\n                              signatories\n\n       Signatories include members of the Task Force, regional \n     participants who met in Boston and Seattle, and those who \n     have since endorsed this Statement.\n       David M.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to \nhonor my dear friend, Reverend Mark Jerstad, a Lutheran pastor and head \nof the Good Samaritan Society in Sioux Falls. After having spent much \nof his adult life comforting the dying and grieving, Mark recently \nlearned that he has terminal colon cancer. This news was a sad blow to \nall those who know and love him. Yet, as we face the loss of our \nfriend, we are inspired by the strength of character shown by Mark and \nhis family.\n  Mark's ability to help others confront their fears and prepare for \ntheir next journey has always been based on his strong faith in God. \nNow it is this same faith that has enabled Mark to be at peace with his \nown death. You see, Mark believes himself to be a lucky man. Unlike \nmany, he has the time to say goodbye, and to reflect on the life he has \nled. As he says, we are nothing but the sum of our deeds. I believe \nhim, and by this measure Mark is truly remarkable for he has lived a \nlife of kindness and love. We cannot help but to grieve for the fact \nthat Mark will no longer be with us. We must grieve for his children \nRachel, Michael and Sarah, who will be losing their father. And we must \ngrieve for Sandy, who will lose her husband of 31 years. But we can be \nat peace knowing that Mark is living out his remaining days to the \nfullest. He is at peace, and with his loved ones.\n  Mark eloquently described the challenge we all face: ``Unfortunately, \npeople just can't seem to live life to the fullest until they come face \nto face with their own death and incorporate it into his or her own \nexistence.'' Mark has done just that, continuing his work as the chief \nexecutive officer of the Good Samaritan Society of Sioux Falls while \nsharing his remaining precious days with friends and family from \nthroughout the country. He is an example for us all.\n  Mark, we wish you and your family well. Let your faith, grace and \ndignity be a lesson to all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article \nfrom the Sioux Falls Argus Leader honoring Mark Jerstad be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sioux Falls (SD) Argus Leader]\n\n       CEO Who Counseled the Dying Faces His Own Death With Faith\n\n                            (By Steve Young)\n\n       Mark Jerstad sat in an X-ray room at Sioux Valley Hospital \n     in November when cold reality swept over him.\n       The chief executive officer of the Good Samaritan Society \n     in Sioux Falls had just finished tests for what doctors \n     thought might be an appendix problem.\n       He was waiting alone for the results to come back when he \n     suddenly felt ``like a peeled grape shaking in a snowbank at \n     40 degrees below zero.''\n       The feeling lasted 30 seconds. When it passed, this \n     Lutheran pastor and business executive knew exactly what was \n     wrong.\n       ``All of a sudden, it came to me. . . . almost like a \n     voice,'' he recalls. ``You have cancer, and it is terminal.''\n       He was right.\n       Jerstad, 54, learned that he has an aggressive, advanced \n     stage of colon cancer. There is no cure. There is only the \n     hope that chemotherapy might prolong his life a month, maybe \n     two.\n       But this isn't a story about one man dying. Rather, this is \n     a tale about one man's incredible faith--and what it means to \n     live in the shadow of your mortality.\n       Lean and angular, Jerstad greets visitors in his spacious \n     Good Samaritan office with the same firm handshake that has \n     been his trademark.\n       Though the chemotherapy leaves him periodically weak, he \n     still routinely comes to work to oversee affairs at the \n     nonprofit monolith that provides services to senior citizens \n     in 240 facilities in 26 states.\n       This has been Jerstad's job for 7\\1/2\\ years. He has been \n     with Good Samaritan since 1985. Before that, he was campus \n     pastor and a religion professor for nine years at Augustana \n     College. And before that he served as a pastor in \n     International Falls, Minn.\n       In many ways, those years of ministering to church members \n     and college students helped prepare him for what lay ahead.\n       In International Falls, Jerstad counseled scores of people \n     and their families through death and grief.\n       ``Honestly, I think I was given a gift of working with \n     dying people,'' he said. ``I could be honest with them--\n     someone who could be open-minded and listen and hear their \n     fears.''\n       So many times, he sat bedside at the moment of death, \n     helping people in their journey from this existence to the \n     next. It couldn't help but affect his own life.\n       ``How can it not?'' Jerstad says. ``I mean, I believe we \n     are the sum of our life's experiences. I really feel these \n     very intimate sharings of people as they were dying have \n     touched my life deeply and richly.\n       ``They've helped me be at peace with my own dying, for \n     sure.''\n       Similarly, his years of teaching death and dying classes at \n     Augustana helped prepare him as well.\n       Jerstad would share his experiences in International Falls \n     with his classes. But his focus was more on living than \n     dying.\n       ``When you think about it, we're all terminal. . . . We're \n     all dead men walking. We just don't know when that final day \n     will be,'' he said.\n       ``Unfortunately, people just can't seem to live life to the \n     fullest until they come face to face with their own death and \n     incorporate it into his or her own existence.''\n       That isn't a problem for Jerstad. Indeed, there never has \n     been a moment in the last three months when he bolted upright \n     in bed in the middle of the night, sweating in fear about \n     what awaits him.\n\n\n                            Certain sadness\n\n       Obviously, there is sadness. He looked forward to becoming \n     a grandfather and baptizing his own grandchildren.\n       He thought maybe he would get to officiate at the marriages \n     of his two daughters and his son--a possibility that now \n     seems remote.\n       ``You know, I kind of wish it was summer rather than \n     winter,'' he said as he glanced out his office window. ``I \n     like to be able to sit out in my backyard in the afternoons \n     and evenings, just watching the sun go down.''\n       Still, Jerstad won't mire himself in what might have been. \n     He is a man of the moment.\n       When he was diagnosed with cancer, he had to wait a couple \n     of days before undergoing colon surgery. So Jerstad got a \n     discharge form, signed his name to it and checked himself out \n     of Sioux Valley for the day.\n       He then drove out to Good Samaritan and attended the \n     morning Bible study there. After sharing news about his \n     cancer with co-workers and staff, he ``went home to my kids, \n     built a big fire in the fireplace and just kind of hung out. \n     It really was a wonderful time.''\n       There have been many similar moments since.\n       He talks about liking to begin each day by snuggling in bed \n     with his wife, Sandy, and sharing a thought or two.\n       ``Sometimes, I reach over and just touch her . . . and \n     thank God for our partnership of 31 years.''\n       He goes into the office most mornings and stays until the \n     work day ends, or until he wear out.\n\n\n                          Greeting old friends\n\n       In recent weeks, he has spent much time greeting old \n     friends who have sought him out during his illness. One of \n     them flew recently from Alaska, another from Hawaii, yet a \n     third came all the way from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore to \n     spend 45 minutes with him.\n       ``There was a tycoon I knew who wept like a child and \n     embraced me,'' Jerstad said, his smile growing as he recounts \n     the memory. ``I was able to comfort him, and we both were \n     able to grow through that experience.''\n       That, he will tell you, is one of the joys about living \n     when you are dying. It certainly makes him thankful that his \n     life did not end suddenly, that he has had weeks and months \n     to prepare.\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\n       Undoubtedly, Jerstad thinks a lot about what death will be \n     like. But he doesn't fear it.\n       ``One of the things that fires me up,'' he said, and his \n     voice breaks as his eyes fill with tears, ``is knowing I'll \n     get the chance to meet my dad again. He died a couple of \n     years ago. I loved him dearly.''\n       What a glorious reunion, the son said. Yet until then, this \n     husband and father intends to revel in the support of his \n     family, his friends and his faith--for as long as he has.\n       ``I have to say, I wonder if I have been given a gift,'' \n     Jerstad said, marveling at his own outlook. ``I mean, I'm \n     surely not in denial. If anyone has accepted the reality of \n     their death much sooner than normal, it is I.''\n\n\n                             Gift of faith\n\n       How can that be? How can anyone face death with no \n     resentment, anger or bitterness?\n       In a phrase, he said with a smile, it is a gift.\n       ``The gift of faith,'' Mark Jerstad said. ``Maybe I'm not \n     angry because I'm so hopeful for the life beyond this life.\n       ``I'll be honest; I know my life is in the hands of the \n     Lord. I can't fantasize anything better than that.''\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  We are returning to the balanced budget constitutional amendment \ndebate. This is a singularly important debate in our Nation's history. \nAnd while I am talking, I am going to constantly refer to just 28 of \nthe unbalanced budgets since 1969--28 of them. We had to find a table \nstrong enough to hold them, and we could not put them on top of each \nother. As you can see, they are almost as high as I am, stacked in twos \nand threes. If we put them on top of each other, they would reach \nalmost to the ceiling. These are our unbalanced budgets over the last \n28 years, every last one. And yet every time we get into this debate, \nour friends on the other side of this issue come in and say, ``Oh, \nlet's just have the will to do this. We can do it if we want to, if we \njust have the will.'' And we heard the President the other evening \ntalking about all you have to do is pass it and I will sign it.\n  Give me a break. That is what was said in every one of these \ninstances. And a number of them were listed as balanced budgets during \nthis time. It turned out to be horrendous budgetary deficits rather \nthan balanced budgets. You can just look at this stack--and this is \njust 28 years. This does not count the other unbalanced budgets for \nmost of the last 60 years. This is just 28 years, these stacks right \nhere.\n  A lot of good intentions, a lot of people working hard to try to do \nwhat is right but never accomplishing it because they did not have the \nfiscal discipline necessary to get it accomplished. You cannot look at \nthis and listen to these arguments of ``Why don't we just do what we \nshould do.''\n  After 28 years--and we are just using the last 28 years like I am \nsaying--after 28 years we have to wake up and say we do need a fiscal \nmechanism to help Congress to do its job because it has not done its \njob in the last 37 years and most of the last 60 years.\n  If we put them all up here, we would not have room. Frankly, we are \nworried with this stack that we might be violating OSHA rules. If these \nhappen to fall over, somebody's leg could get broken.\n  We are returning to this debate, and it is an important debate. It is \nabout whether we have reached the turning point in our Nation's history \nin our fiscal affairs which will change the way we have been doing \nbusiness. We are hoping that if we pass this amendment, we will \nprofoundly effect a legacy we leave to all future Americans.\n  We have, as I have said, had piled on this table the failed budgetary \nhistory of the last 28 years. These are the unbroken string of \nunbalanced budgets that we have had since 1969.\n  As Senator Abraham observed last night, this is about as close to \nbalancing the budget as we have come, balancing these budget documents \non this table so they will not fall over. That is about as close as we \nget to balancing budgets. We are not sure we have it balanced well even \nthat way, so you can imagine how difficult it must be to try to balance \nthem the real way.\n  We received today yet another budget submission. In this one, \nPresident Clinton has promised to point us to balancing our budget by \nthe year 2002. In the coming days and weeks, the Congress will be \nreviewing this budget submission to determine whether it will be just \nanother failed attempt that we toss on top of this huge pile. Of \ncourse, since this budget for fiscal year 1998 will not itself balance, \nit can be placed on this stack of unbalanced budgets. But we have yet \nto see if Congress will be able to work with this budget submission to \nget us on the path to balance by 2002.\n  We should all understand that the backdrop to all this is that the \nCongressional Budget Office has recently painted a less rosy picture of \nthe deficit in the next few years under current policies. Let me just \ntake this chart.\n  As this chart shows, CBO predicts that the deficit will begin to rise \nthis year and continue rising throughout the foreseeable future. The \nCBO predicts that the deficit will rise to $124 billion in fiscal year \n1997 and continue to rise to $188 billion by fiscal year 2002, the year \nwe hope we will have balanced the budget. The deficits just keep rising \nuntil 2007, as you can see. Our annual deficit is projected to be, at \nthat time, $278 billion a year.\n  Added up, these deficits will add a total of more than 2 trillion \nadditional dollars to the debt from now until the year 2007. That is if \nwe do what the President is going to offer today.\n  The point is that we cannot yet congratulate ourselves for a job well \ndone. There is work ahead for all of us to do, and there is no \nassurance of success. Based on the sad history illustrated by these 28 \nyears of budgetary submissions, success has to be considered, by any \nreasonable person, to be in serious doubt. That is why we need a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It has been called an \ninsurance policy that we will get the budget actually balanced in the \nyear 2002 and, more important, that we keep it balanced afterward, \ninstead of doing what it appears will be done up through the year 2007, \na continual rising deficit each year, well over hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  I think the combination of these illustrations of the past and the \nprojections for the future based on our current policy suggest that the \npast is prologue and should show us that we need a balanced budget \namendment.\n  We have been through debates on this measure before. I would like to \noutline briefly for those watching these debates what they are likely \nto hear from the opponents of this amendment based on past debates and \nthe positions outlined to this point in this debate.\n  First, let me point out this is not a partisan disagreement or \ndebate, and it should not be. That is only fitting and proper for a \nconstitutional debate. You have to have people on both sides supporting \na constitutional amendment or there is no way it even has a chance of \npassing. This is a bipartisan amendment.\n  Some opponents of a balanced budget amendment will attempt to paint \nthis debate as a battle of parties, of a choice between a Republican \namendment or a Democrat amendment or Democrat opposition to the \namendment. While I hasten to point out that all 55 Republican Senators, \nevery one of us, are supportive of this balanced\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\nbudget amendment, there are numerous Democrats who support it as well \nand I commend them. Among the original cosponsors are seven Democrats. \nAn additional four Democrat Senators voted for this version of the \nbalanced budget amendment the last time it was considered in Congress, \ntwo of whom voted for it in the House and have now joined us in the \nSenate, and two other new Democrat Senators expressed support for the \nbalanced budget amendment in their Senate campaigns. That number alone \nwill give us sufficient support to send this amendment to the States. \nOther Democrat Members have supported this text in the past, and I hope \nthey will return. I would certainly be happy to welcome them back. \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 is a bipartisan undertaking and a bipartisan, \nbicameral consensus amendment.\n\n  The first division of opponents of the balanced budget amendment is \nbetween those who say that they are for a balanced budget amendment, \njust not this one, and those who are against all balanced budget \namendments. In effect, the position is the same. Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is the product of years of refinement and debate. It is \nthe only balanced budget amendment which has any chance of being \nadopted by the Congress as a whole.\n  In past debates, substitute amendments have been offered, not one of \nwhich has garnered the support of even a mere majority of the Members \nof this body, let alone approached the 67 Senate votes required for \nSenate approval. Any of us might change a word or two if we were \nwriting our own Constitution. We might want the courts to do this or \nthe President to do that, or we might want tax limitation or any number \nof other changes. But Senate Joint Resolution 1 is the only version \nthat has a chance of passing. So, when someone in this debate says they \nhave a better idea, you will know, in effect, that they are working \nagainst passing a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Second, there will be those who propose changes to the amendment to \nexempt certain items from the budget-balancing rule. While they will \nprofess that, of course, they are for balancing the budget--we are all \nfor balancing the budget now; I don't know of anybody on this floor who \ndoes not say that. They believe that certain items are just too \nimportant to be left to congressional prioritizing. Because they are so \nimportant, they propose pretending that, for purposes of the \nConstitution, these items do not exist in the budget of the Federal \nGovernment. Of course, these items are items that the Federal \nGovernment pays for, but never mind, they are not part of the budget \nfor purposes of balancing the budget.\n  When it comes to this, I have to say the No. 1 scheme on the part of \nthese people is to exempt Social Security from the balanced budget \namendment. We are here to save Social Security. That is what the \nbalanced budget amendment is all about. The best way to do that is to \npass this constitutional amendment. If you take Social Security out \nfrom the purview of the balanced budget amendment, the highest item in \nthe Federal budget, that is a risky gimmick that would endanger Social \nSecurity's future. So we are very concerned about what is happening \nhere.\n  Third, we will also hear those who believe that willpower, or another \nstatute, will be the discipline we need. Let me say, again, it has been \n28 years, since 1969, since we have balanced the budget. That was the \nonly time we did it since 1960--37 years ago. So, in 37 years we have \nonly balanced the budget once and we have only 28 of those years up \nhere. We could not afford to take the risk of violating OSHA rules by \npiling this any higher. So, willpower has not worked. We have had no \nfewer than five major statutory attempts to rein in our borrowing \nhabits since 1978 alone. No statute has worked.\n  Finally, there are those who would say that a constitutional \namendment is unnecessary because Congress and the President both want \nto balance the budget by 2002, we are moving toward that goal. While it \nis true that everyone has adopted the goal of balancing the budget by \n2002, we have not finished that job yet. June O'Neill, the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, testified last week before the Budget \nCommittee that the good news is pretty much over and the hard work is \nahead. As I pointed out, CBO projects that the annual deficit will \nbegin rising again this year from $107 billion this year, which they \nact like is nothing, to $124 billion next year, to $188 billion in the \nyear 2002, the year we all agree we will have a balanced budget, or we \nwill have to balance the budget.\n  The lesson, then, is we cannot declare victory and go home because \nthings have recently improved to some extent. The hard work is ahead, \nand the political pressures that have given us our decades-long debt \nhabit will continue to push us off balance, toward mortgaging the \nfuture. Only the permanent counterweight of the Constitution can get us \nto balance in the short term and keep us in balance for the long term.\n  Let me conclude simply by saying that I am pushing for this change in \nour basic charter because I care about the quality of life for all \nAmericans, for those now living, and for those future generations that \ncannot make their wishes known at this time. I believe that if our \ncolleagues will think about how Washington has worked over the last few \ndecades--just look at it, three decades almost--and the price real \nAmericans pay now, and especially will pay in the future, that they \nwill agree that a vote for the balanced budget amendment is a vote for \na better future for all Americans.\n  We have debated this amendment in Congress for many years. I believe \nit is time to let the American people debate it in their State \nlegislatures, but that cannot happen unless we pass it through both \nHouses of Congress. I believe it is time they will adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution if we give the people a chance. \nLet the people speak, and let them speak without further delay.\n  Let me just say one last thing about Social Security, because I think \nit is one of the phoniest issues I have seen in years. Without a \ncredible sustained balanced budget, we will never have the money to pay \nour future benefits. It is just that simple. A balanced budget means \neconomic prosperity, producing the revenues necessary to fund the \nprogram. With a balanced budget, the big spenders in Washington won't \nbe able to target Social Security to pay for other programs, just as \nthe administration did in 1993.\n  By the way, in the President's own words, he said this: ``Neither the \nRepublicans nor I could produce a balanced budget tomorrow that could \npass if Social Security funds cannot be counted.''\n  That was said on January 28, 1997, just a week ago. Neither of us can \ndo it without that.\n  I think it is important to make it clear that opponents of the \nbalanced budget will throw out any diversion to confuse the issue. They \nwill even use scare tactics. The truth is, excluding Social Security \ndoes nothing to secure benefits into the future, and the President's \nown budget that is submitted today counts those surpluses to set it in \nbalance.\n  We have set aside most of our time this afternoon for our newest \nMembers of the Senate, our freshman class, to come down and express \ntheir views on this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished chairman is not suggesting, and I \nrealize by parliamentary form he could arrange that to happen, he is \nnot suggesting, is he, that debate would be limited only to those who \nare in favor of the constitutional amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. We will go back and forth as we did \nyesterday; either way, as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't object.\n  Mr. HATCH. For some of these freshmen Senators, it will be their \nfirst speech as U.S. Senators. I can't believe that there is anything \nmore fitting than the balanced budget amendment in their very first \nspeech. This is a historic issue, and I think these freshmen Senators \nwill help us understand how truly historic it is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On that point, as the distinguished chairman knows, the \nnew Senator from Nebraska was on the floor yesterday. While he took a \ndifferent position than mine on this, I\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\ncommend him for his efforts and his work on this. While the chairman \nand I disagree on the need for this amendment, I think we both agree \nthat if somebody is to give their first speech in the Senate, there are \nfew issues that will be of such significance as this.\n  Anytime one amends the Constitution, something that has been amended \nonly 17 times since the Bill of Rights, that is a significant effort. \nAs I said yesterday, for 200-some-odd years, we have resisted the \ntemptation to amend our Constitution, which is one of the reasons why \nwe are such a powerful democracy and one of the reasons why our \nConstitution has stood the test of time.\n\n  I also note, I think on both sides of the aisle there is strong \nsupport to balance the budget, but what I want to remind everybody, as \nthe President said in his State of the Union Address, is all it takes \nis our vote and his signature to balance the budget without a \nconstitutional amendment. In the last 4 years, the deficit has come \ndown. For the first time since I have been able to vote, the President \n4 years in a row brought the deficit down and is now on the fifth time. \nHe deserves a great deal of credit for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I honor my colleague. He is a very fine \nSenator and does a very good job, but give me a break: All it takes is \nfor us to do the job and the President's signature. We have had 28 \nyears of that philosophy. Here it is. Twenty-eight years on balanced \nbudgets and really, in the last 60 years, there have been really very \nfew balanced budgets. This would be three times this size if we put it \nup for the last 60 years. This ought to give anybody enough pause to \nsay, ``Hey, it's time to get this over with. It's time to let people \nmove on from here.''\n  Our efforts to pass the balanced budget amendment predate even my own \nelection to the Senate some 20 years ago. But these new freshmen \nSenators are absolutely critical and an indispensable factor, it seems \nto me, in this debate. They came to the Senate last month with new \ninsights and unbounded enthusiasm and energy and determined that some \nintegrity and sanity be restored to the Federal budget process. Their \ncommitment to this process, to our children and our grandchildren is an \ninspiration to those of us who have dedicated most of our political \nlife to this message. I hope their message is heard around the country.\n  All freshmen Senators are original cosponsors and they can work in a \nbipartisan manner with their Democratic counterparts to ensure passage \nof the amendment this month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership \nof my colleague, the Senator from Utah, on the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  One of my primary campaign promises when I was running for election \nto the U.S. Senate was to push for a balanced budget, and I believe \nthat the best way to force us to finally take the courageous steps \nnecessary to balance the budget is to establish a constitutional \nbalanced budget requirement. Statutory balanced budget requirements \nhave proven to be insufficient as Congress has proven its willingness \nto amend any such requirements.\n  I must emphasize that the modern congressional movement to establish \nbalanced budget requirements is not a partisan issue. In 1935, the \nfirst bill to establish a statutory balanced budget requirement was \nintroduced by Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland. In the \nfollowing year, Congressman Harold Knutson, a Republican from \nMinnesota, introduced the first proposal to place a balanced budget \nrequirement in the United States Constitution. In light of the \nbipartisan history of the balanced budget movement, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join together in making the balanced budget amendment the \nfirst and most important accomplishment of this 105th Congress.\n  During the 104th Congress, the Federal Government surpassed a \nmilestone that our forefathers would have never thought possible--the \ndebt incurred by the Federal Government surpassed $5 trillion dollars. \nThis is an astronomical sum of money, and it is something of which we, \nas policymakers, should be ashamed. We owe it to our children and \ngrandchildren to do better. We owe it to them to pass a constitutional \nrequirement to mandate that the Federal Government balance its budget \nby 2002.\n  Most people believe that the issue of balanced budget constitutional \namendment is a relatively recent issue. But this issue actually \nsurfaced before the Constitution was ratified by the States.\n  New York and Rhode Island both included requests that the Federal \ngovernment be restricted in its ability to borrow money. Gilbert \nLivingston of New York proposed ``that no money be borrowed on the \ncredit of the United States without the assent of two thirds of the \nsenators and representatives present in each house.'' Admittedly, Mr. \nLivingston was an anti-Federalist who did not believe in the Union. But \nhe and other anti-Federalists realized that forcing the Federal \nGovernment to live within its means would provide an important check on \nits power. Requiring the Government to go to the people for all of the \nrevenues necessary to run its programs would force it to be accountable \nto the people.\n\n  Indeed, in 1779 when the United States was still governed by the \nArticles of Confederation, Benjamin Franklin angrily complained of the \nextravagances of the Federal Government that were afforded by its \nability to print money to pay its bills. While the Government was \nhaving difficulties raising the funding to carry out the Revolutionary \nWar, it still managed to spend large sums of money to pay for tea and \nother wasteful items.\n  The dire financial straits of the Federal Government in the aftermath \nof the Revolutionary War seem to have minimized the concern that the \nfounders had to constrain the ability of the Federal Government to \nincur debt. In addition, Framers of the Constitution such as Alexander \nHamilton believed that the Federal Government would voluntarily \nrestrain itself, and that the public would provide an adequate check if \nthe Government showed a tendency to get out of line. But it was not \nlong before some in the Federalist Party began to voice their support \nfor a constitutional balanced budget requirement. Thomas Jefferson was \nconcerned with what he considered to be the extravagant spending \npractices of the administration of John Adams and he felt that the best \nway to correct this problem was to take away the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to incur debt. He wrote to John Taylor on November 26, 1798, \n``I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \nConstitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the \nreduction of the administration of our government to the genuine \nprinciples of its Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking \nfrom the Federal Government the power of borrowing.'' Thus, Jefferson \nsaw a balanced budget requirement as the proper tool to constrain the \nFederal Government within its proper boundaries and to cure the \nGovernment of any wasteful tendencies.\n  In spite of the concerns of those like Jefferson who felt that the \nFederal Government needed to be constrained by a constitutional \nbalanced budget requirement, the Federal Government seemed to be able \nto balance its budget except in times of war and economic downturns \nuntil the 1930's. Budget deficits were considered to be abnormalities \nand Federal officials felt that they had a moral responsibility to \ntheir children and grandchildren to balance the budget and even pay \ndown the Federal debt. In his first inaugural address, Andrew Jackson \nstated, ``Some of the Topics which shall engage my earliest attention \nas intimately connected with the prosperity of our beloved country, \nare, the liquidation of the national debt, and the introduction and \nobservance of the strictest economy in the disbursements of the \ngovernment.''\n\n  Jackson detested debt because of an experience that he had had as a \nyoung man in which he was nearly ruined financially as a result of a \ndebt on a parcel of land that he had acquired as a young man. Jackson \nconsidered it to be a matter of public honor and morality to retire the \nnational debt. In a speech in 1831, he commented that when the debt was \nretired, ``we shall then exhibit the rare example of a great nation,\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\nabounding in all the means of happiness and security, altogether free \nfrom debt.'' Although the debt had been paid down on a nearly \ncontinuous basis after the United States was brought under the \nConstitution in 1789, Jackson finished paying off the debts incurred by \nthe Nation in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 in 1834--and \nbecame the first and only administration to ever retire the debt of the \nFederal Government of the United States.\n  In 1837, the worst economic downturn in the history of the United \nStates aside from the Great Depression caused the Government to resume \nrunning occasional deficits. But Jackson's successors shared his belief \nin a balanced budget and ran balanced or surplus budgets except in \ntimes of war or economic downturn. In 1842, President John Tyler wrote \nthat Americans were a ``people rendered illustrious among nations by \nhaving paid off its whole debt.''\n  The Republican Party held the White House almost continuously from \nthe outbreak of the Civil War until the beginning of the Great \nDepression. And although these Presidents managed to continue the trend \nof balancing the budget or running surpluses except in times of war or \neconomic downturn, these Presidents were not the model of efficient \ngovernment that we should aim to follow. Prior to the Civil War, the \nFederal Government spent a record $74 million. After the Civil War, \nFederal Government expenditures never dipped below $244 million and \noften times was in excess of $300 million, an increase of more than 400 \npercent. As the Federal Government increased its spending, it expanded \ninto new areas of influence. Prior to the Civil War, the Federal \nGovernment had mainly confined itself to matters relating to the \nnational defense. After the war, however, the Federal Government \nincreasingly took over waterway and transportation improvement projects \nfrom the State and local governments. Although the Federal Government \nonly spent a total of $3.7 million on river improvement and harbor \nconstruction between 1850 and 1860, it spent $53.8 million from 1869 to \n1879--an increase of over 1,300 percent.\n  Not only did the nature of Federal Government expenditures change, \nthe attitude about fiscal responsibility had changed as well. As a \nfavor to their business constituencies, the Republicans were intent \nupon maintaining exorbitantly high tariffs ranging from the 20 percent \nMorrill tariff which was enacted to finance the Civil War in 1861 to \nthe Dingley tariff of 1898 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, both of \nwhich were in excess of 45 percent. As these tariffs represented an \nenormous tax upon farmers and other consumers, they were very \nunpopular. The tariffs generated enormous budget surpluses and, as a \nresult, they were hard to justify to the public. Rather than finding \nways of returning the money to the people, Congress and the Republican \nadministrations engaged in unprecedented spending binges on patronage \nand questionable pork-barrel and logrolling projects to reduce the \nbudgetary surpluses to politically acceptable levels. At the same time, \nthey proclaimed their support for balanced budgets to the public. Thus, \nPresident Benjamin Harrison described unnecessary debt as criminal even \nthough spending increased during his term from $299 million in 1889 to \n$383 million in 1893.\n  The rules of the Federal budgetary game changed with the New Deal \npolicies developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the wake \nof the Great Depression, the worst economic downturn in the history of \nour Nation. FDR was a well-intentioned man whose primary goal was to \nend the suffering that he witnessed with any means at his disposal FDR \ndetested the tendency of economists and others around him to try to \nthink about the long-term implications of his policies, but instead \npreferred to devise immediate solutions to the problems that the people \nfaced. He established numerous agencies and public works projects to \ntry to pull the Nation out of the depression while continuing to \nprofess a sincere desire to balance the budget. One of FDR's fiscal \ninnovations that has had the most profound impact on our economy was \nthe widespread use of entitlement programs which are defined as \nprograms that make payments to all individuals or companies who are \neligible by current law and who apply for the benefits. The most \npopular entitlement program created during FDR's administration was \nSocial Security. Also created under FDR were the Federal farm \nassistance programs which I am proud to say we successfully reformed \nand made more market-oriented during last year's debate on the farm \nbill.\n  Most economists agree that the Great Depression ended only with the \noutbreak of World War II, but the legacy of the Depression era programs \nhas lived on. Several new entitlement programs have since been \nestablished, most notably the Medicare and Medicaid health programs \nwhich were started as a part of LBJ's Great Society fiscal agenda. \nAlthough FDR was not completely convinced by Keynesian economic \ntheories, in the aftermath of FDR's administration, Keynesian economics \nbecame an accepted theory in determining fiscal policy. This theory, \nbest expressed by the Employment Act of 1946, stated that the \nGovernment would run balanced or surplus budgets in times of economic \nprosperity, but it would seek to run deficits and stimulate the economy \nduring recessions through increases in discretionary spending projects. \nThis theory encouraged a reluctant President Eisenhower to run a \ndeficit throughout much of his administration stating:\n\n       Balancing the budget will always remain a goal of any \n     administration . . . That does not mean to say that you can \n     pick any specific date and say, ``Here, all things must give \n     way before a balanced budget.'' It is a question of where the \n     importance of a balanced budget comes in; but it must be the \n     aim of any sound money program . . . When it becomes clear \n     that the Government has to step in, as far as I am concerned, \n     the full power of Government, of Government credit, and of \n     everything the Government has will move in to see that there \n     is no widespread unemployment and we never again have a \n     repetition of conditions that so many of you here remember \n     when we had unemployment.\n\n  Based on Keynesian economic theories, Eisenhower approved \ndiscretionary spending increases in fiscal year 1958 and fiscal year \n1959 which resulted in deficits of $3 and $13 billion respectively.\n  This regard for Keynesian economic theories caused administrations to \nchange their views of deficit spending and encouraged the Federal \nGovernment to try to micromanage the economy and incur massive deficits \nin the process. No longer did policymakers consider it such a moral \nobligation to balance the Federal budget. In the entire postwar period, \nwe have run budgetary surpluses only eight times. It is curious to note \nthat the surpluses in times of economic prosperity in the Keynesian \neconomic theories have almost entirely failed to materialize. The last \nbudgetary surplus occurred in 1969 and the deficits run by the Federal \nGovernment have grown increasingly larger reaching a high of nearly \n$330 million in fiscal year 1992. Luckily, Keynesian economics has \nincreasingly been ignored in recent years as a usable guide for fiscal \npolicy. It has been realized that the Federal Government does not have \nenough information at its disposal to accurately predict the onset of a \nrecession. In addition, by the time a stimulus package can get through \nCongress, economic recovery is often already underway. In cases such as \nthese, precious taxpayer dollars are wasted while the economy may be \noverstimulated resulting in inflation.\n  In spite of the recent turn away from Keynesian economic theories, in \ngeneral the Federal Government's deficits have been growing larger over \ntime, and this trend is only expected to continue. This is due to the \nrapid growth of entitlement and other mandatory spending. About 55 \npercent of our spending went to entitlements in fiscal year 1996, and, \nas projected by the CBO in its January 1997 report on the Economic and \nBudget Outlook for fiscal years 1998 to 2007, entitlement spending is \nexpected to top $1 trillion in fiscal year 1999. This increased \nentitlement spending is expected to be accompanied by enormous \ndeficits. In its January 1997 report, the CBO forecasts the deficit to \nreach roughly $280 billion in fiscal year 2007 if discretionary \nspending is allowed to increase with inflation. This increase in \nentitlement spending also corresponds to a continued large role for the \nFederal Government in the economy, equal to 21 percent of GDP during \nthe next decade, of which 14 percent of GDP would be represented by\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\nspending on entitlements by 2002. We simply cannot allow this to \nhappen.\n  We must establish efficiency and accountability in the Federal \nGovernment. Entitlements, which automatically grow without any action \non the part of Congress, are causing these tremendous deficits. \nAlthough we can reduce the deficit by freezing discretionary spending, \nentitlement reform that puts these programs on sound economic footing \nis absolutely necessary in order for us to balance the budget. As the \n105th Congress begins, one of the first things that we need to do is to \nget our fiscal house in order and send to the States a balanced budget \nrequirement. It is a disgrace that in fiscal year 1996, we burdened the \nhard-working taxpayer with $241 billion in net interest charges on the \nnational debt. It is even more disgraceful that if we fail to balance \nthe budget, the resulting higher interest rates and lower foreign \nexchange rate will doom our children to a lower standard of living than \nthey otherwise would have. For our children and our grandchildren, we, \nthe Members of the 105th Congress must be courageous and pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nColorado for making such an impassioned statement on how important this \nbalanced budget amendment is. We are so glad to have you in the Senate. \nYou are making a difference and we appreciate and thank you so much for \nyour good comments. You are speaking for the vast majority of people in \nthis country, 68 percent of whom, according to the latest polls, want \nthis amendment passed. I personally thank you and congratulate you for \nyour speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. GORDON SMITH. Mr. President, it is an honor to rise in this \nChamber to make my first remarks as a U.S. Senator. I'd like to begin \nby paying tribute to Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah for the leadership he \nhas shown on this issue for many sessions of Congress, to help focus \nus, the American people, upon this important and overriding issue of \nbalancing our Federal budget.\n  I come to this Chamber, to this service at the Federal level, from \nthe State legislature in Oregon--where I served as a State senator and \nas the Senate president. It was our highest priority in the State \nlegislature to balance our budget. Indeed, it was our constitutional \nresponsibility to balance the budget. Every session, we would convene \nin Salem; coming together as Republicans and Democrats, liberals and \nconservatives, to have an honest debate about how we spent public \nmoney, and what taxes, if any, should be raised or reduced, and how \nbest to be good public stewards. I say it was an honest debate because \nwe did not have the recourse of deficit spending--of going to the \ncredit card of our children. I took pride in the kinds of debates we \nhad. Sometimes they were tough, but always they ended with our budget \nbalanced and Oregon's fiscal house being in order.\n  Today we come to a decision about whether or not our Government needs \nto have the same kind of commitment, that constitutional commitment \nthat we have in most States. My colleague, Senator Allard, read \nrepeatedly from the words of Thomas Jefferson. I like Jefferson's words \nin which he counseled us that it should be unthinkable for us to spend \nthe money of the next generation for our consumption in this \ngeneration. Indeed, we have done this to a degree, now, that we begin \nto hamstring our economy and threaten the future in ways that ought to \nmake us ashamed.\n  During the course of a yearlong campaign, I would go home as often as \nI could. But always when I did, I was very tired from long hours of \ncampaigning. On one occasion, I sat in my living room and began to fall \nasleep. My son, who was 6 years old at the time, toddled over to me and \ntapped me on the wrist. As I was waking up, he asked me the question, \n``Daddy, can I have your watch when you're dead?''\n  At that time, and since then, I have laughed at that comment many \ntimes because it was a question from an innocent child. I have thought \nhumorously about it since and yet, also, soberly. I would like my sons \nand daughters, and your sons and daughters, to be able to inherit more \nthan just a watch, to be able to inherit the kind of future and the \nkind of America that we have had, and the kind which we have an \nobligation to pass on.\n  What drives our need for a balanced budget amendment? Pure and \nsimple, it is the growth in spending that is out of control. It is \nimmoral. It ought to be illegal. I would like to use the growth of four \nprograms to demonstrate how, frankly, when coupled with interest on the \nnational debt, we are spending ourselves into oblivion. The four \nprograms are entitlements. They are important programs, and they have \ndone great things for the American people--for the needy and the \nelderly--to take them out of poverty. Entitlements don't require a vote \nof Congress each year. And interest on the debt is something we have to \npay, again; it is not voted upon.\n  Thirty years ago, in 1967, the Federal Government's spending on these \nfour programs--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Federal and \nmilitary pensions, and then interest on the national debt--represented \njust 25 percent of our budget. Ten years later, in 1977, just these \nfour programs, plus interest, had grown to 41 percent of the budget. In \n1987, just these four programs, plus interest, had grown to 50 percent \nof the budget. In 1997, these four programs, plus interest, have grown \nto 61 percent of our budget. In 2007, just 10 years from now, they will \nmake up more than two-thirds of our Federal expenditures, if we don't \nchange our spending habits now. What will be left, then, for schools, \nroads and bridges, for police and for our national defense? If we don't \ndo something right now, then each year the deficit will grow higher and \nhigher. We must have a mechanism that will ensure that deficit spending \nwill stop. We must have an amendment that will ensure a balanced \nbudget.\n  I understand, as a former legislator at the State level, how \ndifficult it is to say ``no,'' because whether you are a Republican or \na Democrat, you go through the fire and pain of a campaign because you \ncare about people, you want to leave your community better off. \nEveryone who comes to your door has a legitimate and often heartrending \nstory to tell. And if you could, you would say ``yes'' every time. But \nthe problem in this Federal city is that we never say ``no'' when we \nought to say ``no'' for the betterment of our whole society.\n  I spoke about these programs, these entitlements that help our \nNation's elderly. I believe that to preserve and protect and strengthen \nMedicare and Social Security, we have to have a debate about the whole \nproblem. Many have talked about how Social Security needs to be \nprotected. I share that concern, and I will always talk about that, and \nI will vote to protect Social Security. But it is not right to say that \nthis program--in order to protect it--should be taken off budget as \npart of the balanced budget amendment. Not even our current President \nbelieves that and, therefore, when speaking about his administration's \ndeficits, always including the Social Security trust funds.\n  There are those in the Senate that say that we should exempt Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget amendment. I disagree with that. I \nsay that passing the balanced budget amendment, which both Republicans \nand Democrats have proposed, is the most important thing we can do to \nprotect Social Security and our seniors. If Social Security balances \nare exempted, additional cuts will have to be made during years of \nsurpluses. For example, in the year 2002, Congress will already have to \nsave, in order to balance the budget, $188 billion. If those trust \nfunds are exempted, then Congress will have to cut an additional $104 \nbillion from the budget. Thus, Congress will have to radically cut \nprograms by $292 billion. Just making the cuts to reach the $188 \nbillion mark will be difficult. An extra $104 billion will be \nincredibly difficult and will, undoubtedly, cut discretionary and \nmandatory programs, many of which will help America's aged, those 65 \nand over.\n\n  What does a balanced budget mean to Oregon, my State, and to your \nState, and to America? It guarantees that we will be fiscally \nresponsible. It means that we will restrain the rate of growth of \ndeficit spending by the Federal Government, and that we will increase \nthe rate of growth in the private sector. It means that interest rates \nwill be lower for all Americans. That means lower mortgage payments.\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\n  For example, if you have a $100,000 mortgage payment, on a 30-year \nbasis, a 2 percent drop in the interest rate would result in a $140 \nper-month reduction in your mortgage payments. At the same time, it \nmeans lower car payments. For a $15,000, 5-year auto loan at 9 percent, \nthis would represent savings of $1,200 over the life of the loan. Well, \nlower interest rates also means lower interest on your credit cards. On \na credit card balance of $1,000, with a rate of 14 percent, it would \nsave you $20.\n  That is real money to real people who have real problems in their \nlives. It means more money in your pocket, as an American citizen, to \nbe saved, if you choose, for things that are important to your family, \nlike buying a home, providing for a child's education, for food, for \nclothing, all the things that real people need more than Government \nneeds them.\n  This is a choice about a brighter future for America. I am very \npleased that I was able to support a balanced budget amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution in my first remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nIt will send a credible message to all of the world and its economic \nmarkets. It will mean long-term economic growth. It will give greater \ncontrol of our foreign-held debt. It will restore integrity to our \nbudget process. Finally, this debate will show American families that \nthey have a choice for a brighter future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment our distinguished colleague \nfrom Oregon. He became the president of the Oregon Senate shortly after \nhe was elected to the Oregon Senate. I think we are very privileged to \nhave him in our body today. He has made his maiden speech, and I can't \nimagine any subject that would be more meaningful than this one. I am \npleased he took the time to make that speech on the balanced budget \namendment. It also shows there is a new wave coming through this body. \nPeople are now getting serious, after 28 years of unbalanced budgets. \nThis stack represents the 28 unbalanced budgets over the last 28 years. \nThese folks are coming in here saying it is time to change it. You can \nhardly see me behind this stack. But this has to be changed, and the \nonly way we are going to change it is with a balanced budget amendment. \nWhen people come on the floor and just say, ``Let's have the will to do \nit,'' the only will they need to show is to pass the balanced budget \namendment so we will do it. For 28 years--really, for most of the last \n60 years, we haven't had the will to do it. I compliment my colleague \nand thank him for his cogent, good remarks here today.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issue which \nis before us, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. But I \ndon't think today we can talk about this babble about putting the \nFederal Government on a budget like everybody else, except in the \ncontext of the latest edition to this big stack of budgets over here \nwhich have failed America and failed the working people of our country \nand piled hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on generations yet \nunborn, without looking at the newest installment of this debate; that \nis, the budget that the President has sent to us this morning.\n  I want to make it clear, Mr. President, that I am rising to talk \nabout this budget and to criticize it, in some ways in harsh terms. I \nwant to begin by pointing out that I rise to criticize this budget more \nin disappointment than in anger. I believe with the rhetoric that both \nparties have been using that it is essential that we work together with \nthe administration. I do not believe we are going to balance the budget \nbased on the efforts of one party, though I think both parties need to \ndo a better job of doing their part.\n  I am the new chairman of the Medicare Subcommittee. I would like to \ndo something worthy of being remembered by taking major, bold steps \ntowards saving Medicare, and I know we can't do that if we do not work \nwith the President.\n  So I would like to focus my comments on the President's budget today, \nand really focus not so much on the deficiencies of this budget and on \nthose aspects of this budget which represent really a political shield \nthat the President has erected to protect himself from having to make \nhard decisions; I would like to couch my comments about this budget in \nterms of what is left to be done, and what we have to do if we begin \nwith the President's budget and we decide we are going to go from here \nto a balanced Federal budget. I would like to talk about that first. \nThen I would like to talk about where we differ with the President. \nWhat is the real issue that we are going to have to decide in writing \nthe budget of the United States of America for this year? Then I would \nlike to sum up.\n  First of all, let me say that, like most of my colleagues, I was \ndisappointed when our President the night before last told us that we \ndo not need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  My guess is that at the founding of the Republic, when the Bill of \nRights was set out as the immediate follow-on to the Constitution, \nthere were those who said, ``Well, we do not need to guarantee freedom \nof speech. We do not need to guarantee freedom of religion. We do not \nneed to guarantee freedom of assembly. Let us do it ourselves. Let us \nlet the Congress do it. We do not need to guarantee the protection of \nthe rights of the States in those areas where the Federal Government \ndoesn't have specific enumeration in the Constitution. Congress is \ncapable of making those decisions.''\n  Our Founders decided that trust Congress to guarantee freedom of \nspeech, that they couldn't. That logic didn't make any sense. Our \nFounders decided that they couldn't trust Congress to guarantee freedom \nof religion. So they put it in the fundamental contract which bypasses \nCongress, which bypasses the President, and that is the contract \nbetween the Government and its people. That is what the Constitution \nis.\n  The difference between our position and the President's position is \nthe President is saying after 28 years of failure in a row, after \npiling now trillions of dollars of debt on generations yet unborn, that \nwe ought to trust Congress; that we ought to trust the President to \nbalance the budget without being required to do it. Obviously, if you \nlook at that big stack of budgets over there on Senator Hatch's desk, \nfor 28 years in a row under Democrat and Republican Presidents, under \nDemocrat and Republican Congresses, we have not done the job. I point \nout that many of those budgets claim to be in balance. But as I will \nmake clear in my comments about the newest installment, the 29th budget \nto go on top of 28 budgets that failed to get the job done, if we took \nthis budget on its face and assumed that it was adopted whole by this \nCongress, it is probably the poorest blueprint among the 28 to get the \njob done.\n\n  In fact, for a President who says we do not need to require a \nbalanced budget, that we can do it, it is very instructive to look at \nthe fine print in the President's budget. In fact, it is not even in \nthe budget document itself. You have to get over into the analytical \nperspectives to find any word as to how the administration actually is \ngoing to ensure that the budget is balanced. In fact, it is the very \nlast paragraph in the section of the President's budget that is \nentitled ``Preview Report.'' In other words, it is about as hidden as \nyou can make something hidden.\n  Let me read basically what it says. It says in very small italic \nprint, ``Mechanism to ensure balance in the year 2002. The budget \nincludes a mechanism to ensure that the President's plan reaches \nbalance in 2002 under OMB or CBO assumptions.''\n  What is that mechanism? Here is the mechanism. The mechanism is that \nif things don't work out, the tax cuts that the President has in his \nbudget this year would in the future be taken back. But the tax \nincreases the President has in his budget this year would be forever. \nThe President proposes spending more money now and increasing the \ndeficit now over the last year where we have an actual figure on the \ndeficit, and that is fiscal year 1996. The deficit would rise from $107 \nbillion in 1996 to $121 billion in 1998. But what the President says \nis, let me raise taxes this year. Let me increase spending this year. \nAnd then, if we do not balance the budget in 4 years, I want to\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\ntake back the tax cuts that we would have given you 4 years from now. \nAnd let me spend the money on all of these new programs--which we heard \nabout the other night--but if, in fact, the budget is not balanced, \nthen we are going to have a mechanism to take that money back. Where is \nthe mechanism? We do not know. Nowhere does the President tell us where \nthis mechanism is.\n  Mr. President, this is no guideline for balancing the budget. This is \nno program for achieving what the President says he is committed to. \nWhat we need more than anything else is to, No. 1, sign a contract with \nthe American people through the Constitution that President Clinton \ncan't change and the Republican Congress can't change committing that \nwe are going to do it. And then, second, we need to buy an insurance \npolicy by setting out a program that makes changes now--not 4 years \nfrom now--if we fail to get this job done.\n  So I think it is very instructive in this debate about a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution that when our President adds the \n29th failed budget in a row, nowhere in the budget itself does he talk \nabout how we are going to achieve a balanced budget and an enforcement \nmechanism. But in one paragraph in Analytical Perspective, he tells us \nthat ``most of the President's tax cuts would sunset, and discretionary \nbudget authority and identified entitlement programs would face an \nacross-the-board limit.'' No one knows what that mechanism really is. \nBut it is very clear what the President intends here, and that is tax \nnow, spend now, and then 4 years from now let somebody else worry about \nit.\n  President Clinton is not alone in these failures. We have budgets \nover there in that stack from Republican Presidents who have done the \nsame. Isn't it time that we stop this process with a balanced budget? I \nsay yes. God willing, we will.\n  Let me turn to a discussion of the President's budget. It is hard to \ncome up with analogies because accounting, especially when you are \ndealing with billions of dollars, bores people to death. Quite frankly, \nmost of us do not know what $1 million is. I have one constituent, Ross \nPerot, who knows what $1 billion is. Nobody knows what $1 trillion is. \nBut let me try to set it in perspective. Let me just run through and \ntalk about a few of the things that the President is proposing in his \nbudget.\n  No. 1, think of the Government as being overweight and think of what \nwe are trying to do here as going on a 4-year diet. We have been \noverweight, and we have been claiming to be on a diet for 28 years, but \nwe have a new diet that the President is going to put us on here. Let \nme start and go through the diet and I am sure at least--well, let me \nbe careful-- some of my colleagues have been on diets as I have been. \nOthers probably are so blessed that they have not, but judge this diet \nif you needed to lose weight for your happiness or health.\n  First of all, the President takes the amount of weight we need to \nlose and, by assuming different things, he says let us assume half of \nthe weight loss is going to occur naturally.\n  The first thing the President does in his budget is he changes the \neconomic assumptions of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nwhich gave him their outline that we are required by law to follow in \nour budget. Before he ever wrote his budget, they told him the rules \nCongress will be bound by in writing our budget.\n  What the President says in essence is that to achieve a balanced \nbudget we have to have a certain amount of savings. I am going to \nchange assumptions, the President in essence says in his budget, so we \nassume that half the weight loss is just going to occur naturally. So \nthe President is talking about, if you look at a budget, in this case \nfor a bloated Government which has not been on a real diet in 28 years \nand shows it, losing half the weight that Congress is bound in writing \nin our budget to lose--to be able to claim that in fact we have a diet \nwhich will achieve our goal, the President assumes half the problem \naway right off the top.\n  Second, we heard the other night about the President's tax cut and \nwhat it was going to provide, but now that we have the numbers--and I \ndo not think it is unusual. I am not trying to be partisan with regard \nto the President. But let me just give you the rest of the story. The \nPresident the other night talked about a $98 billion tax cut and all \nthe good things we were going to get.\n  Now that we get the President's budget, we discover some very \nstartling things. First of all, in the first year, 1997, taxes go up, \nnot down. No. 2, the President has in his only enforcement mechanism a \nprovision that says, 4 years from now, if we do not lose half this \nweight by assumption and good wishes, he is going to take back the tax \ncut. So the first year he raises taxes out and out, no doubt about it. \nThen he is going to give us a tax cut in the future, but he has \nprovisions in the bill that say, if we do not lose half the weight we \nneed on this diet automatically, he is going to take the tax cuts back. \nThe President's tax increases are forever, but the tax cuts are \ntemporary.\n  Also, the President has all kinds of offsetting receipts and hidden \ntaxes and user fees that let the President claim we are controlling \nspending when we are not.\n  For example, the President assumes we are going to sell spectrum, \nsell the right to use the radio waves of the country, and that we are \ngoing to get $36 billion from that, and that he is going to spend every \npenny of that $36 billion. The President has nearly $47 billion in new \nfees that he would have us impose. The President increases nondefense \nspending. In an era where, the President told us last year, big \nGovernment was over, the President proposes in his budget increasing \nnondefense discretionary spending by $73 billion.\n  And with this increase in spending, guess what. Discretionary \nspending goes up next year, the deficit from the last real number we \nhave in 1996 goes up next year, taxes go up next year. Next year, taxes \nwill be at the highest level in the history of the United States of \nAmerica. Defense will be at the lowest level as a percentage of the \nbudget since the mid 1930's. And yet the deficit will be rising \nrelative to what we have achieved in fiscal year 1996. Why? Because of \nnew spending. There are 101 other little tricks in the budget, and each \nof these tricks is aimed basically at having it both ways.\n  Let me get down to the fundamental choice we are going to have to \nmake. First of all, if we are going to lose this weight, if we are \ngoing to balance the budget, we cannot start by assuming that half the \nproblem is going to solve itself. We have to assume that we are going \nto have to do every bit of it. We are going to have to make the tough \nchoices. And if we really want to do it, we need to be conservative in \nmaking choices so that if things do not quite work out, we still get \nthe job done.\n  We cannot get where we are going by beginning in the wrong direction. \nIf our goal is to spend less, why spend more in the first year, the \nonly year of the budget that is binding? If our objective it is to \nlower taxes, why raise taxes the first year with a program that will \ncut taxes in the future--but only if you achieve the deficit reduction \ntargets.\n  However, there is a more fundamental issue here, and this is one \nwhere there is a legitimate difference, and that is we have two \ncompeting visions. The President's vision, despite all the rhetoric of \na year ago, is a vision of Government providing more benefits and more \nservices to more people. The President gives us a budget where \ndiscretionary spending grows by $73 billion. The President believes, \nobviously, as reflected in this budget, that Government can spend the \nmoney of working families better than they can spend it themselves. The \nfundamental difference between the President's budget and the vision \nthat most Republicans share is, at its very root, a philosophical issue \nand a legitimate issue and it is what we ought to be deciding in the \nbudget, and that is what kind of America do we want?\n\n  The President wants an America with taxes at the highest level in \nhistory, spending at the highest level in history for nondefense \nprograms, spending on defense at the lowest level as a share of the \nbudget in a half century. That is his vision, as reflected in this \nbudget. Our vision is different. Our vision is the vision that we want \nfamilies to spend more money, whereas the President wants Government to \nspend\n\n[[Page S1064]]\n\n$73 billion more on nondefense discretionary programs alone. And, look, \nhe wants Government to spend it on good things. He wants Government to \nspend it on education. He wants Government to spend it on health. He \nwants Government to spend it on building schools. He wants Government \nto spend it on all kinds of programs to help people. There is no evil \nor sinister scheme in what the President wants here. He wants \nGovernment to help you with $73 billion in new spending. The fact that \nit will mean that social spending will be at the highest level in \nAmerican history and taxes will be at the highest level in American \nhistory, that does not change the fact that the President's intentions \nare both good, from his point of view, and they are honorable.\n  But here is the difference. We are not debating how much money is \ngoing to be spent on education. We are not debating how much money is \ngoing to be spent on nutrition or health. We are debating who is going \nto do the spending. President Clinton wants the Government to do the \nspending and we want the family to do the spending. We want to take \nthis $73 billion of spending increases on all the good things the \nPresident wants to spend it on and we want to give that money back to \nthe families who earned it to begin with and we want to let them spend \nit on education and housing and nutrition. It is fundamentally an issue \nof whether Government can make better decisions for working families or \nwhether working families can make better decisions.\n  Let me give an example, the most heartrending part of the President's \nprogram, health care for children. Who wants to debate health care for \nchildren and be against it? Nobody. The President spoke with great \neloquence and passion about it. He said 80 percent of the families that \ndo not have private health insurance pay taxes; 20 percent that do not \nhave it, by and large qualify for Medicaid but have never bothered to \nfill out the papers, in many cases because when a child gets sick and \nthey go into the hospital, at that point they join Medicaid.\n  Now, here is the fundamental issue. The President says working \nmoderate-income families are having trouble making ends meet and, as a \nresult, many of them do not have private health insurance for their \nchildren. We agree, Mr. President. We are in total agreement.\n  But the issue is this. Is the solution to create another Government \nprogram to help these people? Or is the solution to let these working \nfamilies keep more of what they earn so they can buy private health \ninsurance for their children? Is the solution more Government? Or is \nthe solution to let families have more freedom about spending their \nmoney? Is the solution to spend 73 billion more dollars, as the \nPresident has proposed, sitting around the Cabinet table at the White \nHouse, sitting around the committee tables here in Congress? Or is the \nsolution to let working families keep more of what they earn and let \nthem spend the money sitting around their kitchen tables? That is the \nfundamental issue. It is two different visions for two different \nAmericas.\n  If you want to go to the analogy about bridges to the 21st century, \nit is the debate about, not how we are going to get to the century--we \nare certainly going to get there. I can guarantee you today that, \nbarring a calamity, we will have a 21st century. The debate is not \nabout building a bridge to it, we are going to get there. The debate is \nwhat is the century going to be like when we get there. Is it going to \nbe a century dominated by Government? Is it going to be a century where \nGovernment is taking care of us? We started out with a Government \ntaking care of the poorest of the poor. Now the Government is taking \ncare of more and more and more Americans. We are going to take care of \nmoderate-income people because they cannot take care of themselves with \nthe confiscatory tax burden that has them paying 15 cents out of every \ndollar in payroll taxes and often 28 cents of the last dollar they \nearn, or certainly 15 cents of the last dollar they earn to the Federal \nGovernment, and then State and local taxes on top of it. Is the \nsolution, when families are taxed so they cannot meet their fundamental \nneeds, to tax them more and to give them benefits? I don't think so.\n\n  I think the solution is to let them keep more of what they earn and \nlet them decide. That is the fundamental issue. That is what we ought \nto be debating. My appeal to the administration is: Look, let's clear \nall these other issues off the table. Let's not start out assuming that \nhalf of the work to be done is just going to happen miraculously. Let's \nnot tell people we are giving them tax cuts and then take them away 4 \nyears from now, or tell them we are giving them tax cuts when, in fact, \nin the first year we are raising their taxes even if you believe \neverything in the President's budget. Let's not say we are going to \nmake tough decisions in the sweet by-and-by, but in the first year have \nthe deficit rising from 1996 and have taxes rising and have spending \nrising. If we are going to start on this diet, let's not wait until \nnext week and go on a feeding binge this week. Let us start today.\n  So, let's debate real, permanent tax cuts. Let's debate real \ndecisionmaking. And then let's have the debate that America deserves, \nand the debate is a simple debate but it is fundamental to the future \nof our country. Do we have too much Government or too little? Can \nGovernment take care of you better than you can take care of yourself? \nDoes Government love your children more than you do? Has Government \nproven that it can educate your children better than you could, if you \ngot to keep more of what you earn and could invest it in their \neducation? Would you rather have a new health care program or would you \nrather have us cut your taxes so you could buy health insurance that \nyou choose for your children? That is a fundamental issue and that is \nwhat we ought to be deciding. But we cannot debate those issues when we \nare not debating apples to apples.\n  So, my urging today to the President is: Let's go back and rewrite \nthese budgets. Let's assume the same things about where the goalpost is \nand what we have to do to get to it. And then let's explain to America \nhow we are going to do it, not with a sleight-of-hand, where we are \ngoing to come in 4 years from now with an unspecified policy and raise \ntaxes and cut spending but we are not going to tell people how we are \ngoing to do it now. Let's put it all out on the table, let the American \npeople look at it, and then let's make a fundamental decision.\n  Finally, and I have spoken too long, but let me end on a note about \ncooperation. There is one area where we are going to have to have \nbipartisanship. If all else fails, it is an area where it is absolutely \nessential that we not let partisanship stop us from acting, and that \narea is Medicare. I know we talk about gloom and doom and the world \ncoming to an end, and it does not come to an end. And it is not going \nto end until somebody more powerful by far than we are makes that \ndecision. But Medicare is going broke. It is in the red this year. It \nwill be bankrupt in 4 years. It will have a cumulative deficit of a \nhalf a trillion dollars in 10 years. We have a crisis in Medicare that \nis far beyond the comprehension of most people, as to how big this \nproblem is. If we set out today to fix Medicare permanently, it would \ncost more money to fix Medicare and guarantee it for our parents and \nour children than it cost in real dollars to fight and win World War \nII.\n  Those are the facts. So the one thing we must do, if we are going to \ndo anything this year worthy of being remembered, is we have to begin \nto address the problems in Medicare. The President has made a bunch of \nproposals, and in some form or another, I can support virtually \neverything the President has proposed. I think, obviously, there are \nareas, with some debate, where the administration would make some \nchanges, but here is the point. We are going to have to do some \nfundamental reforms in the system, and we are going to have to do them \nthis year.\n  In a sense, I will tell you the sky is falling in Medicare by saying \nif we don't start this year fixing Medicare, within a decade, we are \ngoing to be denying benefits to people, within a decade we are going to \nhave a tax rate on the payroll tax that is going to be substantially \nhigher than it is today, and the crisis is going to be greater even \nthen than it is now. So this is one area where every person who \nrepresents the good interest of the country should work together. I am \ncertainly interested in working with the President.\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n  We need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I plan to \nspeak at some length on this subject later. But I thought it was \nimportant to note, when we have stacked up 28 budget failures, \nDemocratic and Republican budget failures that have not gotten the job \ndone, that have failed the American people, that have mortgaged the \nfuture of our children, in the current form, the President's budget \nissued today will fail. It cannot and will not balance the budget, and \nour goal has to be to work with the President, if we can, to make this \nbudget a real budget that will do the job. I, for one, am willing to \nwork for that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think we all accept the fact that this \nbody faces so many great decisions on such a regular basis that it is \nsometimes difficult to focus on one vote or one debate that stands \napart as a truly monumental decision, a truly monumental vote.\n  But, let me be clear. I think the Senate is now entering such a \ndebate, and later this month, this body will face such a vote. The \nstakes could not be higher. With a balanced budget constitutional \namendment, this Senate will face perhaps its defining moment as we lay \nthe foundation for our fiscal agenda of our Nation's coming century--as \nwe decide how this Nation will conduct its affairs. Who can doubt that \nfuture generations will look upon this debate and this vote with great \nhistorical interest as a crossroads in our country's national affairs. \nWho can doubt, with this vote, these future generations will praise us \nfor bringing America's economic house in order, or they will blame us \nfor simply passing the buck when we could have stopped a mounting \nnational crisis.\n  Mr. President, as an idea, the concept of a balanced budget is hardly \nnew. Many in this body have rightly championed it for many, many years. \nLeading economists across our Nation have spoken and written of its \nvalue, and many of the Nation's brightest business minds from Wall \nStreet to Main Street have urged its passage. There is no politics in \nany of these voices. They simply speak the truth: A balanced budget is \nthe first step on the road to long-term prosperity for America.\n  But perhaps most convincingly, Mr. President, the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment is not just supported by these impressive \nvoices. It is also championed by a nation of citizens who, for months \nand years, have been urging this body to take action, to pass the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment for the sake of our Nation and \nour children. According to a CBS-New York Times poll conducted January \n30 and February 1, an astounding 76 percent of our citizens favor this \namendment. From parents who care about the economic future of their \nchildren to teenagers who are worried about their future, the call for \na balanced budget has been loud. Some would say it has been deafening.\n  Yet, the regrettable reality still exists. Unable to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment, our Nation has run staggering deficits year \nafter year that stifle our Nation's economic growth and prosperity, \nsuffocate our future generations, and ultimately eradicate public \nconfidence in our Nation's fiscal management to the point where only 12 \npercent of the American people, according to a CBS-New York Times poll, \nthink we will balance the budget by the year 2002. Unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, the American people are losing confidence in our willingness \nand ability to act. They have lost confidence in our ability as a \nnation to face the challenges as we approach the 21st century.\n  So let us in this debate consider some of the facts, because facts, \nas has often been said, are stubborn things. And the facts, when \nproperly considered, point us unequivocally toward the merit of a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  First, I want this body to listen carefully to an assessment issued \njust last May by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO, as my \ncolleagues well know, is not a partisan voice; it has no real stake in \nthis debate, except to ensure the facts are properly considered. But \nits assessment of deficit spending could not be more troubling.\n  According to the CBO report: ``The budget deficits projected for \nfuture years are so large that they could put an end to the upward \ntrend in living standards that the Nation has long enjoyed. Thus, \ncurrent U.S. budget policies cannot be sustained without risking \nsubstantial economic damage.''\n  Substantial economic damage, that's right, Mr. President, is what we \nrun the risk of bringing to this Nation if we do not act now. The CBO \nreport goes further. Should we fail to bring our deficits to a halt, \nour economy will enter what CBO calls a period of ``accelerating \ndecline.''\n  ``Accelerating decline,'' ``substantial economic damage''--in my 18 \nyears in Congress, I have read a lot of CBO reports, a lot of analyses \nof our Nation's economy, and I can tell you, the warnings and the \nwordings do not get more dire than these.\n  I know there are some who may say, ``Yes, I, too, support balanced \nbudgets, and I, too, oppose deficits, but a balanced budget amendment, \nwell, that goes too far, that binds us unnecessarily.''\n  Mr. President, let us be clear about two further facts. First, these \npast three decades have shown that our political culture, the ways of \nour democratic governance, great as they are, do not always lend \nthemselves well to fiscal prudence. My colleagues will recall that we \ntried before to reduce our deficits through statutory means. You can \nsee right here that these number of budgets for the last 28 years have \nshown that we have failed. Let's look at the history of our efforts.\n  Next to me, I have two charts. The first documents 33 years of good \nintentions--5 more years than these unbalanced budgets--statutory \nefforts that required or promised to balance the budget of our Nation. \nAll the greatest hits from the past are here from the Revenue Act of \n1964 through Gramm-Rudman-Hollings of 1987, and more recently was the \ninfamous Budget Act.\n  But as we can see on this chart, the statutes don't work. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings II; Gramm-Rudman-Hollings I; Recodification of title \n31, 1982; Bretton Woods agreement, 1980; debt limit increase, 1979; \nByrd amendment; Humphrey-Hawkins Act; Revenue Act of 1978; and Revenue \nAct of 1964. These are just some of the examples of our statutory \nefforts in the past.\n  I might also add, over the years, we have had a number of balanced \nbudget amendments in both the House and the Senate, and I point back to \nOctober 1, 1982. The House failed to pass a resolution getting two-\nthirds, and the Senate adopted a balanced budget constitutional \namendment, August 4, 1982. Unfortunately, we didn't pass it in \nCongress, but as far back as 1982, we debated a balanced budget \namendment. Each and every time, when we have had those debates on the \namendments, everybody said, ``We can do it on our own if we only have \nthe will. We really don't need a constitutional amendment.''\n  Yet, Mr. President, this graph speaks for itself. Statute after \nstatute has been passed by this body, but this deficit has kept right \non marching. The lesson, I think, is clear--fail to pass this amendment \nand we reject perhaps the greatest fiscal lesson of modern times.\n  This deficit is not going to be halted through statutes. I think this \nis a good indication with these 28 years of unbalanced budgets. The \nlast time we had a balanced budget is when Neil Armstrong landed on the \nMoon. The only way we are going to stop deficit spending and reach a \nbalanced budget is through an amendment.\n  The second chart I have behind me reveals some other important \naspects to this entire debate. First, a close examination of our budget \nhistory dating back, I might add, to 1905, reveals that deficits have \nbeen the norm, not the exception, as we can see. The deficits are in \nthe red bars below the line. And the green--you can barely see it--is \nabove the line, which would represent the years in which we have had \nsurpluses between 1905 and 2005. Some of those are estimates for the \nprojections by CBO for future years. That is last year's estimate. They \nmay be a little bit better than that with this year's estimate. But, \nnevertheless, it gives a broad indication of the fact that we are going \nto continue to have major deficits in the future. It also has shown \nthat we have had generally a century of deficits with very few \nexceptions.\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\n  These deficits go back decades. Very rarely we found efforts in which \nwe have been able to have a surplus. So I think that this chart reveals \nthat we have had a century of failure of statutory efforts to balance \nthe budget.\n  Now, some have said, well, a balanced budget amendment is just a \ngimmick. As I have said before on the floor, and I will say it again, \nif this amendment was really a gimmick, we would have passed it long \nago because Congress loves gimmicks.\n  Mr. President, this is no gimmick. This is the first necessary step--\na brave, bold and thoughtful step--on the road to fiscal sanity.\n  The second point, in response to these critics, is that the balanced \nbudget amendment does allow us in the event of some national crisis, \ndisaster or massive economic downturn to run a deficit. With a three-\nfifths majority we can take the steps necessary to address any existing \ncrisis that threatens our Nation and requires a commitment of our \nnational financial resources above and beyond a balanced budget.\n  When Members of this body vote yes for a balanced budget amendment, \nthey are not prohibiting our country from ever running a deficit. We \nare simply making it the rare exception. So, Mr. President, I view this \nas a most responsible approach to the problem.\n  I know some may be thinking that certainly we can escape this debate \none more time, we can duck the big question one more time, we can \nconveniently leave this decision to others one more time. Well, again, \nMr. President, facts are stubborn things, and they suggest a very \ndifferent reality.\n  The deficit of this Nation was $107 billion last year. Left \nunchecked, according to CBO, it will double by the year 2004. And by \nthe year 2007, if we fail to act, it is expected to reach a staggering \n$278 billion. Put another way, the deficit comprised 2 percent of the \nGDP in 1995. Should we stand aside and do nothing? According again to \nstatistics from CBO, this deficit will rise to 5 percent of the GDP by \nthe year 2010 and 37 percent by the year 2030. The message of those \nstatistics could not be more blunt: Time is ticking.\n  In fact, in the year 2025 alone--in that year alone--the deficit will \nbe $2 trillion. So the deficit, obviously, in future years is going to \ndouble and triple.\n  Lest there be any doubt about the ramifications of all this, consider \nthis. If we can prevent these staggering deficits and bring the budget \ninto balance permanently through this constitutional amendment, our \nNation will be the big winner. We will experience a 25 percent growth \nin the GNP per capita by the year 2030, according to CBO--a 25 percent \ngrowth per person, Mr. President. That means growth for our Nation's \neconomy. It means jobs. It means higher standards of living. It means a \npositive difference in people's lives and their futures and their \nchildren's futures. These are the things that this Senate must take \nvery, very seriously.\n\n  So to those who say, well, the balanced budget amendment is just a \nproduct of deficit hawks, I say, take a close look at these CBO \nnumbers. This is an economic growth initiative. This is about the \nfuture. This is about our children and our grandchildren. This is about \neconomic security. It is about providing for a stronger standard of \nliving, not a lower standard of living, because we are incurring debts \nand deficits to bequeath to the next generation.\n  What about interest rates? I know this body knows well that growth is \nintimately linked to the rates of borrowing. That is no secret. Pay \nhigher interest rates for a car, higher interest rates for a house, and \nyou soon find less and less people able or willing to make that \npurchase. Production goes down, jobs get fewer. That, too, is no \nsecret.\n  But consider for a moment, Mr. President, the actual impact the \namendment can have on our citizens. Look at the projections for lower \ninterest rates if we pass a constitutional amendment to ensure the \ncontinuity of balanced budgets into the future, year after year after \nyear, not just the year 2002.\n  We have had estimates by the Joint Economic Committee that says that \nwe could have a 2 percentage point decline in interest rates by the \nyear 2002 if we have a balanced budget. The DRI-McGraw-Hill projection \nsays that interest rates could drop even further, could drop more than \n2.5 percent if we pass this amendment.\n  That means lower cost to people in terms of their mortgages and car \nloans and student loans, whatever the case may be in terms of \nborrowing. And that is real money to the average American family.\n  It means that Americans who now pay $570 a month on an $80,000 \nmortgage, when that mortgage is paid at an interest rate of 7.7 \npercent, if we pass the constitutional amendment, this rate would fall \nto an estimated 5.7 percent, bringing that mortgage payment down to \n$464 a month according to the Joint Economic Committee. The result is a \n$1,272 mortgage savings per year for this family, all because we have \ntaken the right steps through an amendment.\n  That again is real money to the average American family who works \nhard and sees more of their hard-earned dollars being taken in terms of \ntaxes. We have seen the tax burden escalate in this country. It is the \nhighest historically because taxes consume more now than food, shelter \nand clothing combined.\n  But also look at what a balanced budget amendment would mean in \nsavings--in excess of $1,500 to the typical middle-income family, \ncounting their interest savings on all of these loans, on mortgage \nloans and car loans and student loans, according to the Joint Economic \nCommittee.\n  Now, Mr. President, President Clinton is talking about building a \nbridge to the 21st century. That is fine. But, with this vote, we will \ngo far in defining what kind of bridge this will be. This bridge to the \n21st century can be solid, constructed on strong beams, capable of \nmoving the American people safely and securely, or it can be a \nhazardous and rickety bamboo bridge suspended by worn ropes over the \nchasm of our national deficit.\n  Pass the balanced budget amendment and we lay the ground for a solid \nfoundation for this bridge into the next century. Pass the buck on the \nbalanced budget amendment and we cross this bamboo bridge literally on \nborrowed time.\n  So the decision will be ours. I think we know the right thing to do. \nWe know the danger, indeed, the very threat, to our Nation of ongoing \ndeficits and deficits. We know that we need stronger steps of fiscal \nself-discipline. I doubt that any Member of this great body, knowing \nwhat they know about the dangers of deficits and our historical \ninability to end them without this amendment and the many benefits of \nthis amendment, can rise in good conscience to defend the status quo.\n  Now only one question remains, and it is this: Will we have the \nstrength and the courage and the wisdom to implement it? Mr. President, \nlet this Senate answer this vital question without hesitation. For the \nsake of our Nation and its future, let this answer be yes. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been very interested in the \ndiscussion today about a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. It is a serious subject and one which the Senate should take \nseriously. We should have a robust, aggressive, provocative and \ninteresting debate on a question of this magnitude.\n  I have told the Senate before, and I would like to again at the risk \nof being redundant, that I was privileged to be one of 55 people to go \nback into the room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia on the 200th \nanniversary of the writing of the Constitution. 200 years previous, 55 \nwhite men went into the room in Philadelphia Hall, some very great men, \nand they wrote a Constitution for this country. George Washington's \nchair is still in that room. You can see where he sat in the front of \nthe room and presided over the Constitutional Convention.\n\n  Mr. President, 200 years later 55 people--men and women, people from \nall ethnic and racial backgrounds--went in and had a celebration in \nthat room.\n  Coming from a very small town in southwestern North Dakota, I kind of \ngot goose bumps that day because I was sitting in the very room where \nthey wrote the Constitution of the\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nUnited States. It was a unique and special privilege for me to be \npresent and to be one of those participants.\n  Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and I \nwere just visiting moments ago about the U.S. Constitution and he gave \nme a copy of the Constitution that he carries in his pocket. It is a \nvery small document, one of the most remarkable documents ever written \nby people who live on this Earth. It is the framework for the most \nsuccessful democracy in the history of the world.\n  It is this document, the Constitution of the United States, that we \nare talking about amending. We are debating whether or not to alter \nthis document. And we are in the midst of a blizzard of rhetoric about \na stack of 6 or 8 feet of budget documents spanning some 29 or 30 \nyears.\n  Well, those budget documents do not read like this:\n\n       ``We The People of the United States, in Order to form a \n     more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.''\n\n  You will not find this language in that stack of documents.\n  This Constitution has a provision in it by which it can be amended. \nWe have some people in politics today who believe that this is an \nimperfect document. Some, in fact, in the last session of Congress, \nsome proposed three separate amendments in the period of 3 months. Over \nthe years we have had thousands of proposals to change this document. I \ndo not see many people who look like Madison, Mason, Franklin, or \nWashington walking around making these proposals. I see a lot of other \nfolks making these proposals.\n  My point is this: When we debate how and whether we should alter the \nConstitution of the United States, we ought to be mindful of the need \nto get it right. Be careful. Do not dishonor this great document by \nmaking alterations that will in the long run weaken our country.\n  That brings me to the debate about the current constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator yield at \nthis point without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator talked about the language of the \nConstitution. In reading this amendment, this proposed amendment to the \nConstitution, I have been struck as I read it by the contrast in this \nlanguage in the proposed amendment in contrast to the language of the \nConstitution.\n  Would the Senator be surprised if I were to say to him that the \nConstitution of the United States provides for a Congress of two \nbodies, the Senate and the House of Representatives, provides for the \ncreation of the House of Representatives, provides for the \nestablishment of the Senate of the United States, provides for the \nestablishment of the Presidency, provides for the establishment of the \nSupreme Court of the United States, and provides for the mode by which \nthat Constitution would come into being? Would the Senator be surprised \nif I were to say to him that the language in the Constitution that does \nall of these things that I just enumerated constitutes fewer words than \nare used in this proposed amendment to the Constitution? Would the \nSenator be surprised at my saying that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I am not surprised because I have read those \nprovisions. But I fully understand the point the Senator from West \nVirginia has made.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. This is not Constitution-like language, to start with.\n  Has the Senator heard any proponent of this amendment come to the \nSenate floor and explain to the Senate and to the people watching and \nlistening to the debate through the electronic eye, has the Senator \nheard any proponent come to the floor and, section by section by \nsection, explain this amendment, how each section would work, why each \nsection is there, what each section means?\n  I have heard quite a number of Senators come to the floor and talk \nabout the need for balancing the budget. I think we are all in \nagreement on that and I think there is a consensus here as to a need \nfor balancing the budget at some point, bringing down the deficits, but \nI have not heard a single Senator--and I have not been able to listen \nto all of the debate; I tried to listen to as much as possible, but the \nSenator has heard most of the debate--has the Senator heard any \nproponent of this amendment come fully explain this amendment, talk \nabout the amendment? Not about the need for balancing the budget, not \nabout the need for getting the deficits down, about which we all agree. \nI would be greatly enlightened if a Senator would take the time not to \ntalk about something we all agree on, but to talk about how this \namendment will balance the budget, how it will eliminate the deficits. \nHas the Senator heard any proponent do that thus far?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator I have not. Again, the Senator makes \na good point. There is a difference between balancing the budget and \namending the Constitution to require that it be done.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the comments by the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I will talk just for a moment about this issue of debt. Clearly, the \namount of Federal debt that we have is excessive. The deficits that we \nhave experienced in recent years, in the last couple of decades, \nespecially, saddle our children with interest payments that we do not \nwant to have to have them meet. Clearly, we need to make progress in \nbalancing the budget and finally achieve fiscal stability and have a \nbudget that is balanced. That is clear.\n  We have a debt problem. That is clear as a bell.\n  I say to people who come to the floor and talk about this issue, \nhowever, it is not just the Federal debt. We have corporate debt that \nis rising just exactly like the Federal debt is. We have credit card \ndebt that is rising faster. We have consumer debt that is rising just \nas fast. We have $21 trillion in debt out there in this country.\n  In fact, you walk down the street, you walk past a picture window of \na business someplace, and you almost hear the invisible tapping on the \nwindowpane behind the bright red letter sign that says to you ``Say, \nconsumer, come over here a second. It does not matter you cannot afford \nthis. It does not matter that you do not have money for it. Come and \nbuy this product. Come over here and buy this product. We will give you \nthe product. You take the product home. We will give you a rebate. You \ndo not make a payment for 6 months. Come over here. Credit bad, it does \nnot matter. We will give you credit. Are you in college and have no \njob? We will give you a credit card. In fact, we will give you four of \nthem, from four different companies. You do not have to have a job and \nyou can be in college and you get a pen pal or a dozen of them, saying \n`Take our credit card, buy our product. It does not matter that you \ncannot afford it.'''\n  We have a debt problem in this country. It is an addiction and it is \na problem in a range of areas in our economy. One area we can do \nsomething about is the Federal Government's spending and the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal policy. I want to talk about that. In 1993, \nPresident Clinton won his election to the Presidency. He came to this \nCongress and he said the Federal deficit is a problem and he proposed \nthat we do something about it. He proposed a deficit reduction act. It \nincluded some tough medicine, some things people did not like, some \ncontroversial items, spending cuts, yes, real spending cuts. Some tax \nincreases, yes, very unpopular. We passed it here in the Senate by one \nvote. I voted for it. Was it the popular thing to do? Of course not. \nThe popular thing to do would have been to have voted against it and go \nhome and crow about having voted in opposition to this proposal. Now, \nthat would have been the political thing to do--go home and crow about \nyour opposition to this proposal. We didn't get one vote from the other \nside of the aisle, not one, not even by accident. You would think maybe \nsomeone on that side would have made a mistake and voted for it. No. We \npassed it by one vote.\n\n  I will read for my colleagues some of the comments during that \ndebate. If you pass this legislation to tackle the deficit in this way, \nsome of my colleagues said, what is going to happen?\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\n ``This bill is going to cost America jobs.'' ``It will kill jobs.'' \n``It's going to be devastating.'' ``We are buying a one-way ticket to a \nrecession.'' Another Senator said, ``It will turn a fragile recovery \ninto a solid recession.'' Another said, ``It will lead to a \nrecession.'' All of that was said here on the floor of the Senate. ``Do \nthis and you kill this economy.''\n  But we did it, and here is what happened to the Federal budget \ndeficit since then: 4 straight years of reduced deficits; the unified \ndeficit cut in real terms by 60 percent--60 percent.\n  Now, this isn't the deficit the Republicans use or the President uses \nbecause neither one use the right numbers. This is a deficit without \nthe Social Security funds in it, because you ought not be able to \nmisuse those funds. A 60-percent reduction in real terms in the unified \ndeficit.\n  What happened to the economy? We have seen record numbers of new \njobs. The economy continues to grow.\n  What did we do? We cut the deficit by 60 percent. I am glad I did \nthat. Was there a price to pay for that? Yes. The popular thing would \nhave been to do something different. But we did this.\n  Now, how do you cut the deficit from here to zero? Well, you can get \na costume and suit up and strut around and bellow or bray or crow, or \nwhatever it is one wants to do. Or you can decide that the way to \nreduce the budget deficit is by individual spending and taxing choices \nthat we must make in a budget document.\n  You can alter the Constitution of the United States, I guess. You can \ntake this little Constitution and alter it in a hundred places and when \nit's done, in 5 seconds, not one penny will have been altered from this \nbudget deficit. You can change the Constitution at 2:10 today and you \nwon't have done one thing to change the budget deficit. Why? Because \nchanging the Constitution doesn't change the deficit. Only men and \nwomen making individual decisions on spending and taxing can change the \nbudget deficit. We did that in 1993. We didn't have many friends when \nwe did it, but we did it. It's tough medicine, but it's the medicine we \nhave to take.\n  Now, some come to us today and say that if we simply change the \nConstitution, we will solve this problem. I have taken the position \nthat I am willing to alter the Constitution of this country. I have not \nbeen willing to do it often. I voted against most of the proposals--\nterm limits and dozens of proposals around here--to alter the \nConstitution. I have not been very willing to change the Constitution. \nBut I have said I think there is some merit in fiscal discipline. I \nwould vote to alter the Constitution.\n  But I will not, under any condition, vote to alter this Constitution \nin a manner that, as the majority proposal does, takes the Social \nSecurity trust funds, adds them in, and then claims to have balanced \nthe budget when they haven't. That happens today in normal fiscal \npolicy practice, and it is wrong today. It was wrong last year and, \nespecially, it will be wrong and devastating to this country if you \nenshrine that practice into the Constitution of the United States.\n  I want to ask one question, and I want to come here this coming week \nand ask it repeatedly because I want to find someone who will stand up \nand answer the question.\n  To frame the question, I want to give a little history. In 1983, the \nCongress said, ``We have problems financing the Social Security \nsystem.'' We formed a commission, headed by Mr. Greenspan, who now \nchairs the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan and the commission \nreported to Congress and said that the way we are going to solve the \nSocial Security problem in the long-term is we are going to increase \npayroll taxes, we are going to increase the age of retirement in the \noutyears, far out in the outyears, and make a number of other changes. \nWhen we do that, we are going to deliberately develop a Social Security \nsurplus--this year, incidentally, it's $78 billion--and that surplus \nwill be available when the baby boomers need it and retire, well after \nthe turn of the century.\n  Why was that necessary? Because after the Second World War there was \nthis massive outpouring of love and affection when our young men came \nhome. Guess what? There was something called the World War II baby \nboomers, the largest baby crop in the history of our country. That \nlarge baby crop has worked its way through our society. When it reaches \nretirement age, we have a demographic problem in Social Security. That \nis what the Greenspan commission said. The Congress recognized that and \nthey said, ``Let us save for that period of time, collect more money \nnow in the Social Security system so that we have it available later \nwhen we need it.''\n  Now, the reason I say that they did that, here is the commission \ntestimony before the Ways and Means Committee on which I sat. It is \nwhat they claimed, what they said and recommended to us. Create the \nsurplus now so that it's available later when we need it. It was the \nsober and right thing to do. That is exactly what was done.\n  In fact, on the chart here are the Social Security surpluses that are \ngoing to accrue. This simply goes to 2010-- actually, the trust fund is \nin surplus out to about 2018, and in 2019 begins to run a deficit. You \nwill see the surpluses. These are not insignificant amounts of money. \nWe are talking a trillion dollars in the next 10 years alone.\n  Now, unfortunately, what has happened as a result of all of this is, \ninstead of this money being saved, it has been used as an offset \nagainst other spending. Some say, well, that is all technical garble. \nIt is not technical garble.\n  I want to ask this question as a result of all of this: In the year \n2002, when we are told by this constitutional mandate and by a budget \nthat calls for a balanced budget--and this would be true of the \nadministration's budget and also true of the majority party's budget--\nin 2002, if the budget is in balance, why in that year will the \nCongress be required to increase by $130 billion the limit on total \nFederal debt?\n  I want to ask this question again. I want to ask this a fair amount \nand get an answer to it. If the budget is balanced by constitutional \nmandate, if the budget is balanced by a budget plan submitted by \nanybody in the year 2002, why in the year in which the budget is \nbalanced does CBO tell us that the debt limit will have to be increased \nby $130 billion?\n  I will give you my answer. My answer is that the reason the debt \nlimit has to be increased the very year they say the budget is in \nbalance is because the budget isn't in balance, and everybody here \nknows it. It's a charade.\n  I want to ask that question and ask someone to come and answer it. I \ncertainly intend to ask the sponsors to answer it. If the budget is in \nbalance, why are you then required to increase the Federal debt?\n  Does anybody sitting around their dinner table talking about how they \nbalance their checkbooks believe that is what would happen? We are in \nperfect balance, our spending is meeting the amount of money we have to \nspend and, therefore, our debt is increasing. Does anybody believe that \nwould meet the test of credibility in business? I don't think so. It \ndoesn't meet the test of credibility here.\n  I will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I \nhave introduced one with six of my colleagues, which does not misuse \nthe Social Security trust funds to the tune of a trillion dollars. I \nchallenge those who say they want to alter the Constitution of the \nUnited States to join us. We can pass it in 10 minutes, pass it with 75 \nvotes. But that's not what is at stake here. What is at stake are \npeople who want to talk about balancing the budget.\n  We did more than talk in 1993. We cut the unified budget deficit by \n60 percent in real terms, at some political peril, and we paid a price \nfor it. Some people want to talk about balancing the budget and about \naltering the Constitution. What I want to talk about is doing what we \npromised the American people we would do--saving over a trillion \ndollars in the next 10 years of Social Security dedicated trust funds \nthat are taken from workers' paychecks. We promised those workers their \nmoney would be saved in a trust fund, saved for when we need it after \nthe turn of the century. Yet here we see a Constitutional proposal to \nmisuse those trust funds and claim that we have balanced the budget.\n  A columnist in the Washington Post, who I shall not name--Charles \nKrauthammer--wrote a column last week about this matter. This was his\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\nthird column on this issue. He is all cranky about it. He basically \nsaid, ``Dorgan and those folks don't know what they are talking \nabout.''\n  There is no Social Security trust fund? Social Security is pay as you \ngo? Nonsense. What a bunch of nonsense.\n  You have a right to be wrong in this country. God bless political \npundits who are wrong. You have a right to be wrong. But if you want to \nsee the Social Security trust fund securities, go to Parkersburg, WV. \nThe bonds are under armed guard. The trust funds exist under law. Bonds \nare in the trust fund.\n  Pay as you go? Nonsense. The Commission in 1983 said it was not going \nto be a pay-as-you-go system anymore, that we will raise more money--\n$78 billion this year alone--and save that money for the future. So Mr. \nKrauthammer is just flat wrong.\n  A group that is right is the well-respected Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities. They published something on this issue this week. I \nwant to read part of it into the Record because I heard some discussion \nhere today saying if we do not pass our constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, the one that misuses all of these Social Security \nrevenues, it is going to hurt our kids.\n  You want to hurt kids? I will tell you how, and do it quickly. It is \nconfirmed by this study. What you do is take the savings that are \ndesigned to be spent in the Social Security system when our kids are \ngoing to be out there working and you use the surplus now in order to \nclaim that you are balancing the budget and continue running the \ndeficit. That is why you are still increasing the Federal debt even as \nyou claim you have a balanced budget.\n  That will really hurt kids, because 10, 15 or 20 years from now you \nwill have to have massive tax increases on our kids to pay for the baby \nboomers' retirement. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities lays \nthe whole scenario out in this document.\n  Pass the constitutional amendment that I have talked about, and you \ndo the honest thing. You save the money we said we would save and you \nare balancing the budget.\n  But let me go through this quickly. The report by the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities reads as follows:\n\n       The version that includes the Social Security revenues in \n     the unified budget poses serious dangers for the Social \n     Security system. It also is inequitable to younger \n     generations, as it would likely cause those who are children \n     today to have to bear substantial payroll tax increases when \n     they reach their peak earning years.\n\n  The reason? Because the money we said was going to save the day is \nnot going to be saved by those who want to enshrine the misuse of it in \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  I will read another piece of this.\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the \n     Leadership would undermine this approach to protecting Social \n     Security and promoting generational equity. Under this \n     version of the balanced budget amendment, total government \n     expenditures in any year--including expenditures for Social \n     Security benefits--could not exceed total revenues collected \n     in the same year, including revenues from Social Security \n     payroll taxes.\n\n  What are the implications of that? It is pretty clear. We envisioned \nwhen we passed the Social Security Reform Act that we were going to \nhave a circumstance where we save now and spend out later. The balanced \nbudget amendment reported by the Judiciary Committee would not only \nallow the misuse of the savings now but also would prevent the \nexpenditure later when it was necessary to meet future needs.\n  The leadership version, according to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, ``would eviscerate the essential achievements of the \nGreenspan commission.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record. This is \nan excellent piece that has been written by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities on exactly this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           The Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security\n\n       In recent years, Congress has considered two versions of \n     the balanced budget amendment. The version supported by the \n     Republican Congressional leadership (herein termed the \n     ``Leadership version'') requires the ``unified budget'' to be \n     balanced each year, including Social Security. The other \n     version, which Senators Feinstein, Wyden, Dorgan and others \n     introduced in the last Congress, requires the budget \n     exclusive of Social Security to be in balance.\n       The version that includes Social Security in the unified \n     budget poses serious dangers for the Social Security system. \n     It also is inequitable to younger generations, as it would \n     likely cause those who are children today to have to bear \n     substantial payroll tax increases when they reach their peak \n     earnings years. The Feinstein/Wyden/Dorgan version introduced \n     in 1996 does not pose these problems.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       In coming decades, Social Security faces a demographic \n     bulge. The baby boomers are so numerous that when they \n     retire, the ratio of workers to retirees will fall to a low \n     level.\n       This poses a problem because Social Security has \n     traditionally operated on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis. The \n     payroll taxes contributed by today's workers finance the \n     benefits of today's retirees. Because there will be so many \n     retirees when the baby boomers grow old, however, it will be \n     difficult for the workers of that period to carry the load \n     without large increases in payroll taxes.\n       The acclaimed 1983 bipartisan Social Security commission \n     headed by Alan Greenspan recognized this problem. It moved \n     Social Security from a pure ``pay-as-you-go'' system to one \n     under which the baby boomers would contribute more toward \n     their own retirement. As a result, the Social Security system \n     is now building up surpluses. By 2019, these surpluses will \n     equal $3 trillion. After that, as the bulk of the baby boom \n     generation moves into retirement, the system will draw down \n     the surpluses (although it is likely that Congress will act \n     to bolster Social Security's finances by reducing benefits or \n     increasing revenues before then, thereby causing the \n     surpluses to grow larger and last longer than current \n     projections indicate). This practice of building up the \n     surpluses while most baby boomers are still working and \n     drawing them down after they retire is akin to what families \n     do by saving for retirement during their working years and \n     drawing down their savings after they reach retirement.\n       This approach has important merits. It promotes \n     generational equity by keeping the burden on younger \n     generations from becoming too high. In addition, if the \n     Social Security surpluses were to be used in the next two \n     decades to increase national saving rather than to offset the \n     deficit in the rest of the budget, that would likely result \n     in stronger economic growth, which in turn would better \n     enable the country to afford to support the baby boomers when \n     they reach their twilight years.\n       To pursue this approach, the deficit in the non-Social \n     Security budget will need to be reduced significantly or \n     eliminated in coming years--so the surpluses in the Social \n     Security trust funds contribute in whole or large part to \n     national saving--and further reforms in Social Security will \n     need to be instituted to restore it to long-term actuarial \n     balance.\n\n\n                 The Leadership BBA and Social Security\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the \n     Leadership would undermine this approach to protecting Social \n     Security and promoting generational equity. Under this \n     version of the balanced budget amendment, total government \n     expenditures in any year--including expenditures for Social \n     Security benefits--could not exceed total revenues collected \n     in the same year, including revenues from Social Security \n     payroll taxes. The implications of this requirement for \n     Social Security are profound.\n       First, the budget would be considered balanced when the \n     deficit outside Social Security exactly offset the surplus \n     inside Social Security. But when that occurred, the sound \n     objective of the Greenspan commission--to accumulate a Social \n     Security surplus partly to help build the nation's capital \n     stock and productive capacity so we can better afford to pay \n     for the baby boomers' retirement--would be stymied.\n       Second, the benefits of the baby boomers would have to be \n     financed in full by the taxes of those working in the years \n     the baby boomers are retired.\n       The Leadership version thus would eviscerate the central \n     achievements of the Greenspan commission.\n       One reason the Leadership version would have this effect is \n     that even though the Social Security trust funds would have \n     been accumulating large balances, drawing down those balances \n     when the baby boomers retired would mean the trust funds were \n     spending more in benefits in those years than they were \n     receiving in taxes. Under the Leadership version, that would \n     result in impermissible deficit spending (unless it were \n     offset by a corresponding surplus in the rest of the budget, \n     a daunting and possibly unachievable task, especially since \n     Medicare and Medicaid costs also will rise when the baby \n     boomers retire.)\n       By precluding use of the Social Security surpluses in the \n     manner the 1983 legislation intended, the Leadership version \n     would be virtually certain to precipitate a massive crisis in \n     Social Security about 20 years from now, even if legislation \n     had been passed in the meantime putting Social Security in \n     long-term actuarial balance. To help pay the benefits of the \n     baby boom generation, the nation would face an excruciating \n     choice at\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\n     that time between much deeper cuts in Social Security \n     benefits than were needed to make Social Security solvent and \n     much larger increases in payroll taxes than would otherwise \n     be required. There would be only one other alternative--to \n     finance Social Security deficits in those years not by \n     drawing down the Social Security surplus but by raising other \n     taxes substantially or slashing the rest of government \n     severely. As a result, the government might fail to provide \n     adequately for other basic services, potentially including \n     health care and national defense.\n       Given the numbers of baby boomers who will be retired or on \n     the verge of retirement in those years, deep cuts in Social \n     Security benefits are not likely at that time. Thus, under \n     the leadership version, it is almost inevitable that younger \n     generations will face a combination of sharp payroll tax \n     increases and deep reductions in basic government services.\n       For these reasons, the Leadership version is inequitable to \n     younger generations. Aggravating this problem, the Leadership \n     version would undermine efforts to pass Social Security \n     reforms in the near future. Why should Congress and the \n     President bother to make hard choices now in Social Security \n     that would build the surpluses to more ample levels if these \n     surpluses can't be used when the boomers retire? Under the \n     leadership version, there is no longer any reason to act now \n     rather than to let Social Security's financing problems \n     fester.\n\n\n    leadership version also poses other problems for social security\n\n       Under the Leadership version, reductions in Social Security \n     could be used to help Congress and the President balance the \n     budget when they faced a budget crunch. This could lead to \n     too little being done to reduce or eliminate deficits in the \n     non-Social Security part of the budget and unnecessary \n     benefit cutbacks in Social Security.\n       At first blush, that may sound implausible politically. But \n     the balanced budget amendment is likely to lead to periodic \n     mid-year crises, when budgets thought to be balanced at the \n     start of a fiscal year out of balance during the year, as a \n     result of factors such as slower-than-expected economic \n     growth. When sizable deficits emerge with only part of the \n     year remaining, they will often be very difficult to address. \n     Congress and the President may be unable to agree on a \n     package of budget cuts of the magnitude needed to restore \n     balance in the remaining months of the year. Congress also \n     may be unable to amass three-fifths majorities in both \n     chambers to raise the debt limit and allow a deficit.\n       In such circumstances, the President or possibly the courts \n     may feel compelled to act to uphold the Constitutional \n     requirement for budget balance. In documents circulated in \n     November 1996 explaining how the amendment would work, the \n     House co-authors of the amendment--Reps. Dan Schaefer and \n     Charles Stenholm--write that in such circumstances, ``The \n     President would be bound, at the point at which the \n     `Government runs out of money' to stop issuing checks.'' This \n     would place Social Security benefits at risk.\n\n\n                  the feinstein/wyden/dorgan approach\n\n       The Feinstein/Wyden/Dorgan approach resolves the problems \n     the Leadership version creates in the Social Security area. \n     It reinforces the 1983 Social Security legislation rather \n     than undermining that legislation. It does so by requiring \n     that the surpluses in the Social Security system contribute \n     to national saving rather than be used to finance deficits in \n     the rest of the budget and by enabling the surpluses to be \n     drawn down when the baby boomers retire.\n       The Feinstein/Wyden/Dorgan version thus improves \n     intergenerational equity rather than undermining it. It \n     ensures the surpluses will be intact when they are needed. It \n     also allows these surpluses to be drawn down when the baby \n     boomers are retired, rather than forcing large payroll tax \n     increases and benefit cuts at that time that go well beyond \n     what is needed to make the trust fund solvent.\n       This version of the amendment also ensures that Social \n     Security benefits will not be cut--and Social Security checks \n     not placed in jeopardy--if the balanced budget amendment \n     leads to future budget crises and showdowns. However such \n     crises are resolved, Social Security would not be involved, \n     because cuts in Social Security would not count toward \n     achieving budget balance.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will come back to the floor and ask this \nquestion again: If the budget is balanced, why is the Federal debt \nincreasing? Why do you want to put a process in and enshrine a practice \nin the Constitution that reaches this result, a budget that you claim \nis in balance when the Federal debt is continuing to rise?\n  I will continue to ask that question and ask if there isn't a better \nway to decide to alter the Constitution of the United States.\n  I want to just respond for one moment to some of what we heard on the \nfloor about how we got to where we are now. I will be very brief on \nthis final point.\n  We are constantly told--in fact, one of my colleagues last year, and \nI will never forget this, talked about how we ought to somehow regret \nthe last 50 years in our country. ``Gee, what an awful place. What \nterrible decisions were made in America in the last 50 years.''\n  In November I was in several countries in Asia, and one of the \ninteresting things that I discovered is that when you talk to most of \nthe citizens of those countries, they want to come to the United \nStates. Why? They think this is a wonderful place because of the things \nthat we have created--our education policies, our achievements in a \nwhole range of areas such as health care, education, and the \nenvironment.\n  Most people see America as a beacon of hope and opportunity. Most \npeople around the world see this as a wonderful place in which to live. \nAnd much of what makes us a great country is Medicare, Social Security, \nHead Start programs, and so many other things, almost all of which had \nto be done by people standing up on the floor of the Senate saying let \nus do these things, let us improve this country, this is a step \nforward.\n  And others are standing up saying, ``Oh, Lord no, we can't do this.'' \nI know people who are just opposed to everything for the first time. We \nall know people like that. No matter what it is, they oppose it for the \nfirst time, and 10 years later, of course, they think it is just fine \nbecause they then understood that it worked.\n  We have done some good things in this country. And we have made some \nmistakes.\n  David Stockman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nunder President Reagan, has written about one of our mistakes. And he \nwas one of the architects of what was done. One of the mistakes made in \nthe early 1980's, as he tells it, was this. ``The root problem''--he is \ntalking about the deficits now and where we are financially as a \nnation--``The root problem goes back to July 1981, the frenzy of \nexcessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the Nation's fiscal \nstability * * *'' He says, ``A noisy faction of Republicans willfully \ndenied this giant mistake of fiscal governance and their own \nculpability in it ever since. Instead they have excessively poisoned \nthe political debate pretending that economic growth and spending cuts \nalone will cure the deficit.''\n  That is David Stockman. That is a Republican.\n  The only point I am raising is not to point back and forth but just \nto say here is where we are. Here is how we got here. Let all of us \ndecide, yes, let us balance the budget. Let us put this country on a \nfiscal policy plane that makes some sense. Let us do this for the \nbenefit of our kids.\n  But let us not enshrine in the Constitution a practice that is not \nhonest budgeting. Let us not do something that ends with this result of \npeople crowing about how we are balancing the budget, even for their \nchildren's benefit, who come to vote for increasing the Federal debt \nand the same year claim the budget is balanced. How do they explain \nthat to their kids?\n  If we are going to do something on this floor, especially with this \ndocument, let us do it the right way and not the wrong way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Senator: The Senator is aware, I am sure, that \nduring the first 7 or 8 years of the 1980's the national debt was \ndoubled and tripled; that the administration, then President Reagan's \nadministration and the budget they proposed and received, took all the \nnational debt that this country had built up over 200 years, first \ndoubled it, and then they tripled it.\n  The Senator, I believe, pointed that out. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the point I was making. It is the point David \nStockman made.\n  It was the fiscal policy recommended and designed by them. However, \nwe also have a responsibility. Democrats and Republicans all have a \nresponsibility for this problem and to solve it together but not create \ncircumstances where we can claim a balanced budget as the Federal debt \ncontinues to increase. That is my point.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator's point. Would the Senator not\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\nalso agree with what President Clinton said in the State of the Union \nMessage that we want a balanced budget? The answer is right there in \nthe Chamber where he spoke. We can vote for it, and he can sign it, and \nwe can do that without amending the Constitution.\n  The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of \nRights.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. As I pointed out, if the Constitution is \namended at 2:25 today, at 2:26 the deficit will not have decreased by \none penny. Why? Because altering the Constitution will not decrease the \ndeficit. Only individual choices by men and women of goodwill in this \nChamber who are willing to take some risks and take a little heat for \nit will cut the deficit and finally balance the budget.\n  I am willing to do that. I demonstrated that in 1993, as did the \nSenator from Vermont. We had the fiscal discipline.\n  If we can get some others to join us, we can balance this Federal \nbudget. I just do not want us to play games, saying we balanced the \nbudget, only then trying to explain to our children why the Federal \ndebt continues to increase at the same time. That is not balancing the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I believe the other \nside wishes to have time, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise in support of this constitutional amendment. I \nhave had an opportunity each and every time--and I suppose this is the \nfifth or sixth time now--in the period of time I have been in the \nSenate to vote for a constitutional amendment because I believe that \nsuch a statement in the Constitution would be a legitimate part of the \nConstitution. I learned that from serving in a State legislative body \nwhere I worked with such a statement within our State constitution, and \nI saw it bring discipline to both Republicans and Democrats in State \nlegislative bodies to balance the budget, to be fiscally responsible, \nand have each generation pay its own way.\n  I have also voted for it because there is not such a statement within \nthe Federal Constitution, and I have seen the lack of discipline in the \nCongress of the United States to balance the budget. Since I have seen \nthat discipline work at the State legislative level and since State \ngovernments tend to be laboratories for our political system, I think \nwe can, with a great deal of certainty and ease of mind, feel confident \nthat we are doing the right thing by placing that discipline on Members \nof Congress.\n  The rule of law is something that is traditional to our British-\nAmerican legal system. Other societies as well might have a rule of law \nnot exactly like ours but still have a respect for basic documents. The \npurpose of the rule of law is predictability and stability for the \nfuture.\n  Constitutions are part of the rule of law. Constitutions are adopted \nby societies because it brings discipline to policymakers in \nGovernment. It brings a certainty to the relationship of people who \ngovern and the people who are governed. Part of that certainty is \ndiscipline on the part of policymakers like those of us in \nthe Congress. So we have a Constitution, and it has worked well to \nbring stability, to bring discipline, and to bring predictability to \nthe relationship between those who govern and those who are governed.\n\n  We see that discipline works in most of the policymaking between the \nFederal Government and our people, but we have not seen discipline work \nin the fiscal arena. Has it always been that way? No, it has not always \nbeen that way, because for the first 160 years of our country, except \nduring times of war, we had more years where we had budgets balanced \nand surpluses than years we ran deficits. It was pretty well understood \nthat fiscal discipline, even though it was not written in the \nConstitution, was an integral part of the tradition of America.\n  Since the year 1969, or for most of the time since World War II, that \nhas not been the case. We have shown anything but discipline when it \ncomes to being a caretaker of the tax dollars we raise. The American \npublic sees that. That is why, overwhelmingly, in mail and surveys and \neverything else, the people of the United States are telling the \nCongress we need discipline in fiscal matters and that they see a \nconstitutional amendment as bringing that discipline.\n  It has been 28 years since the time we last ran a surplus. Congress \nin that period of time has made some feeble attempts to bring our \nnational debt under control--but has failed. I have served with many \nfine Congressmen and Senators who have made valiant efforts to curb \nrunaway spending. Regardless of their good faith, no balanced budget \nwas produced. The goal has remained out of reach. In the end, then, we \nmust conclude the will to balance the budget has been weak. That is why \nwe desperately need the discipline of a constitutional amendment.\n  The scope of the national debt is immense. Every year this monster \ngrows as it gobbles up the American dream for our young people. That \nAmerican dream says that our children should have a better life than \nour generation as we had a better life than our mothers and fathers, as \nour mothers and fathers had a better life than our grandfathers and \ngrandmothers. But the American dream is being snuffed out because of \nfiscal irresponsibility.\n  This situation has gotten so bad that we now spend nearly 40 cents of \nevery dollar that we collect in income taxes just to pay interest costs \non this national debt. The danger of this for the economy and the \npotentially disastrous effects for future generations have become \nimpossible to ignore. You have to look long and hard these days to find \npublic servants who do not say that they support balancing the budget. \nThat is on both sides of the aisle. Rhetoric in support of budgetary \ncontrol is at an unprecedented level. But it ends up that talk tends to \nbe too cheap, I am sorry to say, and, as a result, the budget still \nremains unbalanced.\n  We must then have the structural discipline of a balanced budget \namendment. Fortunately, there has been some progress made lately in \nbringing down the deficit. For the most part, this is the result of two \nactions--one by the Republican-controlled 104th Congress, and the other \nby President Clinton. In the case of the Republican-controlled 104th \nCongress, some spending restraint that we enacted; in the case of \nPresident Clinton, it was his suggestion for the largest ever tax \nincrease that passed in 1993.\n  Now, of course, some of this reduction in the deficit can be \nexplained by better than expected economic growth, which was mainly the \nresult of the Federal Reserve's wise economic policies. And, despite \ninitial budgets of President Clinton which projected deficits as far as \nthe eye can see, the Congress has been able to submit a budget which \nbalances by the year 2002. This is\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\nall good news. But the political balance is fragile, and we are still \nwaiting for the debt to be tamed.\n  The American people have had enough. That is why they are telling us, \nby an overwhelming percentage: Adopt the fiscal discipline of a \nconstitutional amendment. They sent us here to work to restore the \nAmerican dream for our children and grandchildren.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with us \non this amendment. The national debt has become the gift that keeps on \ntaking. It is unconscionable that we would saddle our children and \ngrandchildren with such a backbreaking public debt. But, if we do not \nimpose the fiscal restraint that only the balanced budget amendment can \nprovide, this debt will be passed on to future generations, and they \nwill be faced with crippling high taxes. Americans will be working \nharder and longer for less and less.\n  Such a scenario simply cannot be tolerated, and is not tolerated \ntoday at the grassroots. It is only tolerated here, in this Disneyland \nof Washington, DC.\n  Passing the buck of the Federal debt to our children and \ngrandchildren is not just an economic problem that they face. It is an \nimmoral problem for us. Because, when you get right down to it, this \ndeficit spending is evidence that this generation, my generation, can \nlive high on the hog and leave the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren to pick up. We must bring the spending binge under \ncontrol. And the only way to do this in a serious and lasting way is to \npass the balanced budget amendment.\n  I say this after having served as both a Congressman and a Senator \nand having worked through several attempts to get the national debt and \ndeficit under control. Everything we have tried to date has failed. The \nBudget and Impoundment Control Act, Gramm-Rudman I and II, and so many \nother well-intentioned acts and procedures have all come up short. I'll \nhave more to say on this later.\n  Mr. President, now, more than ever, we have a moral duty to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment. It will force both the Congress and the \nPresident, regardless of which party is in control, to live up to their \nconstitutional responsibilities of confronting the national debt. And \nwhen those of us here in Washington are forced to live within our \nmeans, just like American families do, every American will benefit. \nInterest rates will go down, which will mean lower payments for car \nloans, student loans, and mortgages. And by reducing the cost of \nliving, the American dream will still be attainable. This is especially \nimportant today when it often takes two wage earners to make ends meet.\n  When I talk with the folks back home in Iowa, they let me know that \nwe have to get our fiscal house in order. An overwhelming majority of \nthem support the balanced budget amendment. It has been our experience \nin Iowa that the state constitutional balanced budget requirement \nworks. Whether the legislature is controlled by Democrats or \nRepublicans, our elected officials have abided by it. We here in \nWashington have a great deal to learn from Iowa and the many other \nStates where similar procedures have been successful.\n  As the only family farmer in the Senate, I think it is also important \nto note that the American Farm Bureau Federation supports the balanced \nbudget amendment. Even though many farmers, including those in my home \nState, have had to shoulder a large part of the load in budget \nreduction recently, they know that their livelihood depends on the \nlong-term economic health of the country. They know that there can be \nno future for the American farmer, or anyone else, if deficit spending \nis not reined in. We need the budget discipline mandated by the \nbalanced budget amendment in order to guarantee the survival of the \nAmerican dream for farmers and everyone who benefits from their labor.\n\n  Another alarming aspect of our Federal debt is the growing percentage \nwhich is held by foreign interests. The proportion of overseas holdings \nin our debt is approaching 20 percent. In essence, we have seen the \nslow drip of national sovereignty going down the drain. If we do not \ncontrol the Federal debt soon, this drip will become a steady stream. \nSo, in a very real sense, irresponsible Federal budgeting has \ncompromised our national security. The time to put a halt to this trend \nis now.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude today by saying it is a moral \nimperative that we pass the balanced budget amendment. This is not a \ndecision I come to lightly. I am very hesitant about making additions \nto our Constitution. But our Founding Fathers knew that there would be \ncritical moments in our Republic's history when problems of great \ndifficulty would arise which would require constitutional force in \norder to solve them. That is why the Constitution was designed to be \namended in such circumstances. I would remind my colleagues that all we \nin Congress can do is send this measure to the States and let the \npeople of America decide whether it will become law. Why is a vocal \nminority here in Congress so afraid of letting democracy work and \nletting the people decide?\n  Our ever-expanding national debt is a problem of fundamental \nimportance which justifies a constitutional solution. We cannot let \nanother Congress go by in which we do not confront this issue and \nimpose discipline on this institution. Our future and that of our \nchildren and grandchildren depend on it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate began debate on the \nbalanced-budget constitutional amendment, of which I am an ardent \nsupporter. Passing this amendment, and abiding by it, is the most \nimportant action we can take to protect the future of our children, \ngrandchildren, and future grandchildren. Congress' insatiable appetite \nfor spending is mortgaging the prosperity of these future generations. \nNot only is this irresponsible, but it is immoral.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized the basic principle that the Federal \nGovernment must not spend beyond its means. Thomas Jefferson said, ``We \nshould consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \ndebts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.'' Unfortunately, we \nhave strayed far from Mr. Jefferson's wise advice.\n  The Federal Government's uncontrolled spending has built up an \nenormous national debt that currently stands at $5.3 billion. \nApportioned equally, this means that every man, woman and child in this \ncountry currently owes almost $20,000. Put another way, if you spent a \ndollar every second, it would take 150,000 years to spend our current \ndebt. And our debt is still growing by $4,500 per second--about the \nsame amount it would cost to send three people to a community college.\n  The economic rewards for balancing the budget should be reason enough \nto act. Many well respected economists predict that if the budget were \nbalanced, interest rates would drop by about 2 percent. This would mean \nannual savings of $1,230 on a middle-class family's home mortgage; $216 \non an average student loan; and $180 on an average auto loan. In the \nFederal budget world of billions and trillions, these savings are all \ntoo often ignored, but these are real savings that would lead to a \nbetter life for America's families.\n  Although Congress has talked endlessly about balancing the budget, \nthe budget has not been balanced since 1969. Without a balanced-budget \nconstitutional amendment, I doubt the President or Congress will ever \nhave the political courage to balance the budget. We simply lack the \ndiscipline to control our spending habits. We have ignored our \nresponsibility to put our fiscal house in order, choosing instead to \nleave future generations of Americans with an overwhelming legacy of \ndebt. It is simply immoral to allow this deficit spending to continue. \nOur duty as elected officials must be to preserve a strong and solvent \nnation for the next generation.\n  Let us show the American people that we take our duties seriously. We \nmust prove we are ready to embrace fiscal responsibility permanently. \nThe moment has finally come for Congress to pass the balanced budget \namendment and send it on to the States. Let us begin a national debate, \nin every State legislature in this country. Americans have waited \ndecades for this opportunity. They have waited long enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1071-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SLATER OF ARKANSAS TO BE SECRETARY OF \n                             TRANSPORTATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time \nallocated to Chairman McCain.\n  Mr. President, last week I had the opportunity to speak before the \nCommerce and Environment and Public Works Committees on behalf of my \ngood friend and our nominee for Secretary of Transportation, Rodney \nSlater. I am proud today, and honored today to be able to rise before \nthe entire Senate body and once again voice my support for the \nPresident's choice for Secretary of Transportation.\n  I have known Rodney Slater since the 1980's, when I was first elected \nto the Arkansas State House of Representatives and Rodney was the \nexecutive assistant for then Governor Bill Clinton. From the very \nbeginning of our relationship, I had the deepest respect for Rodney on \nboth a personal and professional level.\n  Professionally, I think there is no question whatsoever that he is \nqualified to become the Secretary of Transportation. Before coming to \nWashington, Rodney served for 6 years as commissioner and later \nchairman of the Arkansas State Highway Commission. During this time, \nRodney, without hesitation, tackled the great challenge of improving a \npoor rural State's infrastructure. He took on that challenge, not just \ntrying to please, but trying to do the right thing. Arkansas, like most \nof our States, is a very diverse place with many competing regions. \nRodney, though he hailed from the delta, was always fair to every part \nof the State of Arkansas. I think that is a preeminent qualification \nfor somebody who is going to be Secretary of Transportation of the \nUnited States. He will be fair with all modes of transportation. He \nwill be fair to all parts of our Nation.\n  In the last 4 years, Rodney has served as Administrator of the \nFederal Highway Administration, where he has faced the demands of \nimplementing ISTEA. As you know, hearings on the reauthorization of \nISTEA will begin next week. We will be dealing with some of the most \nimportant and complicated issues of transportation when we consider \nthis vital piece of legislation. Rodney's experience with national and \nlocal transportation needs as well as his expertise in the intricacies \nof ISTEA give me great confidence he will be able to work with Congress \nin a manner that will help us form legislation that will not only be \nfair but will address the Nation's pressing transportation needs into \nthe 21st century. Certainly I look forward to working with a Secretary \nof Transportation who brings hands-on experience to the Department.\n  On a personal note, I cannot adequately express my esteem for Rodney, \nfor the courage he has shown in overcoming a childhood of deprivation. \nHe is a native of Marianna, AR, the Mississippi Delta region, one of \nmost impoverished of our Nation. Many children grow up in those \nconditions and find that poverty overcomes them. They never come close \nto reaching their full potential. Rodney serves, I believe, as a role \nmodel for countless Americans who pull themselves up from poverty to \nmake the American dream a reality. If you judge a person from what they \novercome, then Rodney Slater has overcome a lot, and should be \nesteemed. He has not only benefited his own life, but the lives of \nthose he has touched through his selfless public service. His \nexperience in the region of the world he came from, I think, gives him \na unique perspective of the value of our Nation's infrastructure and \nthe role it plays in economic development.\n  Another one of the great things about Rodney, which I have expressed \nmany times, is his commitment to his family. Nobody could question that \nafter watching the confirmation hearings. Several of his family members \ncame there at each time.\n  I want to reiterate my comments from last week. I have no hesitancy \nwhatsoever in giving my support for Rodney Slater to be Secretary of \nthe Department of Transportation. I believe the President made a fine \nchoice and I look forward to casting my vote for that confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has been so \nlaudatory, I think the Record should show that Rodney Slater is a \nDemocrat.\n  The fact of the matter is, he has strong, strong bipartisan support \nbecause he truly comes as an appointment, not on account of the color \nof his skin, but the content of his character. As the distinguished \nSenator pointed out, he started in the most humble Mississippi Delta \nsection of Arkansas, attended the public schools, graduated, then, from \nEastern Michigan University, and then from the University of Arkansas \nSchool of Law at Fayetteville.\n  Working as a commissioner on the Arkansas Highway Commission, he then \nwas able to serve as its chairman and came here just almost 4 years ago \nas the Federal Highway Administrator. You only have to go to \nNorthridge, CA, to ask how he did. Right after that earthquake out in \nCalifornia, Mr. Slater cut through all the bureaucracy. His actions \nthere, instituted immediately, facilitated the provision of alternative \ntransportation, and then Mr. Slater's FHWA allowed the repair and \nrebuilding of the damaged highways out there in record time.\n  He has become familiar with all modes of transportation, working at \nDOT--the civilian airline system; all the railroads, including the \nNation's rail passenger service, Amtrak; the water borne transportation \nsystem, and everything else. So he is totally familiar with it. I don't \nknow any better compliment than that related by my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas. Mr. Slater appeared with the strongest \nbipartisan support of any nominee I have seen in my time up here, and I \nthink he deserves it. I have watched him over the past 4 years, as I \nhave watched other Federal Highway Administrators, but none has done a \nmore resourceful job, a more understanding job, and a more effective \njob than Rodney Slater of Arkansas.\n  It's quite a journey from those rural roots to being chairman of the \nArkansas State Highway Department to administering the Nation's highway \nprogram and now, I hope, to Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Slater's \njourney began with a loving family and community, and we should, as he \ndoes, pay tribute to them. They instilled in him the thirst for \neducation, the drive to succeed at every job, and the determination to \nbe fair in whatever he did. These are qualities that we should look for \nin every nominee for every office. But in addition to Mr. Slater's \npersonal story there are several other excellent reasons for confirming \nMr. Slater in this very important Cabinet position.\n  He has high-level experience in transportation dating back to 1987. \nMr. Slater has served as a member of the Arkansas State Highway \nCommission and later as the commission chairman. In these positions he \nreceived high praise for his ability to bring together diverse \ninterests in order to get the job done. Part of Mr. Slater's success is \nattributed to his willingness to listen to disparate points of view and \na desire to learn from others.\n  Mr. Slater was appointed to the Federal Highway Administration [FHWA] \nby President Clinton in 1993. As Administrator, Mr. Slater managed a \n$20 billion annual budget in an agency with 3,500 employees and an \noffice in every State. In that capacity, he impressed both local \nofficials and Members of Congress with his ability to work within the \nsystem to get things done. During the last 4 years the FHWA under Mr. \nSlater has expanded our Nation's highways and linked isolated \ncommunities to new jobs and opportunities.\n  One important example of this nominee's abilities is the response of \nthe FHWA to the devastating earthquake that took place in Northridge, \nCA. Mr. Slater received high marks from those who witnessed his ability \nto cut redtape and lessen response time so that critical funds would be \nreleased\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\npromptly to the communities hit by the earthquake. His adept \nmaneuvering through the bureaucracy resulted in the provision of \nalternate transportation and the rebuilding of vital highways in record \ntime.\n  In nominating Mr. Slater, President Clinton said: ``* * * he was \nrecommended by more people from more places in more ways for this job \nthan any person for any position I have ever seen.'' Nothing is more \ntrue. Look at the Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, who \nhave supported this nomination. During the Commerce Committee hearing \non his nomination, Mr. Slater was endorsed by Senators Warner, Bumpers, \nand Hutchinson and Congressmen Hutchinson and Berry. That's a good \ncross-section of support--the chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works \nand four members of the Arkansas congressional delegation, two from \neach party. He has also received high praise from our House colleagues. \nCongressman Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation, called the nomination ``a natural.'' House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bud Shuster said \nhe considers the nominee one who ``can work well with both parties.''\n  Mr. Slater's nomination is not just endorsed within the Washington \nBeltway. Indeed, the transportation industry uniformly praised Slater \nboth for his abilities as the FHWA Administrator and for his interest \nin learning the promises and prospects of the other modes of \ntransportation.\n  From my perspective as Senator from South Carolina, I am very pleased \nto have a nominee who has a firm grasp of the highway system that is so \nvital to my State. Moreover, in Mr. Slater we have the opportunity to \nconfirm as Secretary of Transportation a man who knows the value of the \nother modes of transportation as well: The Nation's civil aviation \nsystem, Amtrak, and the country's waterborne transportation system.\n  With Mr. Slater, we will have a Secretary who knows that we must \nrebuild the Nation's infrastructure if we are to grow and prosper in \nthe 21st century. He is a man who believes, as I do, that the number of \nships that steam into our ports means little if road or rail transport \nis insufficient to speed the cargo on its way to points inland; and \nthat increasing tourism in Charleston or Boston or New Orleans won't \nmatter unless trains and planes are available to bring the tourists to \nthose cities.\n  He is also a man who is well aware that a carefully constructed \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nof 1991 [ISTEA] can give us the boost we need toward the year 2000. We \nin South Carolina have worthwhile intermodal projects that need \nfunding. These intermodal projects will relieve choke points in the \nStates, giving us a start on the seamless transportation network that \nISTEA envisions. An example of one of our most pressing issues for \nISTEA is the long overdue replacement of the bridges over the Cooper \nRiver in Charleston. These bridges are essential to the movement of \ncargo to and from the port.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Slater has earned my support and my vote because I \nam impressed with the intelligence, dedication, and ability I believe \nhe will bring to this job. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nconfirming this excellent appointment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a person who has \nbeen honored by President Clinton to serve as the Secretary of \nTransportation, Rodney Slater. Last week, Mr. Slater testified before \nthe Commerce Committee. He talked about his commitment to public \nservice, his background, and his desire to make sure that the United \nStates remains the leader in aviation. He talked about the challenges \nfacing the Transportation Department, but more importantly, the \nchallenges facing all of us and our constituents.\n  Mr. Slater showed himself to be forthright and straightforward. In \nresponse to some tough questions, he did not flinch. He looked each of \nus in the eye and committed to work through difficult problems, to \nrebuild our Nation's roads and bridges, and to make our transportation \nsystem as safe as possible. He also said something else in response to \na tough, but fair comment from our chairman, Senator McCain. He said he \nwanted to give people a reason to vote for someone, rather than against \nsomeone. Mr. Slater did that in his testimony.\n  Mr. Slater also brings something else to DOT--he has served for 4 \nyears as the head of the Federal Highway Administration. Mr. Slater's \nsupport before our committee was bipartisan, both Senators and \nCongressmen. Senator Warner talked of his first-hand experience with \nMr. Slater in working with flood victims in Virginia. Mr. Slater has \nsimilarly responded to problems in Kentucky and other States.\n  Mr. Slater is one of the first nominees for the Secretary's position \nto have worked for one of the modal administrations. That experience \nalone will benefit our communities. Mr. Slater understands, for \nexample, that opening up foreign aviation markets to our carriers will \nbenefit our communities. Mr. Slater understands the importance of \ndeveloping a new ISTEA bill. Mr. Slater recognizes the need to appoint \nmembers to the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, so that we \ncan move forward with improving the Federal Aviation Administration. \nFunding for the FAA, improving aviation safety, and continuing to make \nstrides in aviation security are matters that the new Secretary will \nconfront on day one. Let's make tomorrow day one.\n  Mr. Slater has many challenges ahead of him. We should let him get to \nit as quickly as possible and I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have about 4 minutes, I would say. Can I \nbe yielded some time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Rodney E. \nSlater to be the Secretary of the Department of Transportation. Over \nthe last four years, Mr. Slater has served the President and the \nNation, and he has served well in his capacity as our Federal Highway \nAdministrator. He has done so with the same distinction and \neffectiveness that he demonstrated previously while serving then-\nGovernor Clinton in several capacities back in his home State of \nArkansas.\n  I am pleased that the President has nominated such an able and \naccomplished and dedicated public official to head the Department of \nTransportation. We will face many critical challenges in the \ntransportation arena in the next several months and years--the \nreauthorization of all of our critical highway and transit programs; \nthe need to reform the entire financing mechanism for the Federal \nAviation Administration; the need to find more Federal resources to \nstem the deterioration of our transportation infrastructure; the need \nto reverse the recent increase we are witnessing in drunk driving as \nwell as the need to improve our safety record in all modes of \ntransportation.\n  I heard the President speak about the dangers of smoking, and I am \nfor the great crusade that has been conducted across this Nation \nagainst smoking. But I would like to see a similar crusade against \ndrinking alcoholic beverages. Let's have a crusade to match the crusade \nagainst smoking. Let's have a crusade against drinking, because my \nwife, your wife, my daughters, my grandchildren can get into an \nautomobile and leave the house and never come home alive again because \nof some drunken driver who is all over the highway. Let's have a \ncrusade against alcoholic beverages. I would be happy to help by \nspeaking out against the drinking of alcohol.\n  I know from several meetings that I have had with Mr. Slater that he \nrecognizes clearly how important a vibrant and efficient transportation \nsystem is to the Nation's future. He knows that, as a nation, we have \nallowed our transportation infrastructure to deteriorate to the point \nthat we have a backlog of unmet needs totaling well over $100 billion. \nThis backlog of unmet needs for unsafe bridges, deteriorated highways, \nairports, and transit systems serves as a continuing drag on our \nNation's productivity. He knows that poor highways restrict access to \njobs, to schools\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nand to health care--that poorly maintained ships and waterways can lead \nto environmental disaster.\n  At my request, Mr. Slater has visited my home State of West Virginia \non a number of occasions. He has seen first hand the benefits flowing \nto my constituents and the entire Nation from ongoing efforts such as \nthe completion of Appalachian Corridor ``G.'' But he also knows that \nmuch more needs to be done to improve mobility, not just in West \nVirginia but throughout the entire Nation.\n  Mr. Slater comes from humble origins, having been born in the small \ncommunity of Tutwiler, MS. With a population of 1,391, just a few more \npeople than we have in Sophia, WV, from where I come. Tutwiler has \nabout 200 more residents than the town of my upbringing, Sophia, WV. I \nknow something about humble beginnings. And I know that humble \nbeginnings can give some people a clarity of vision and tenacity of \npurpose. These are the attributes that we find among true national \nleaders--and Rodney Slater's leadership at this vital time in the \nNation's history as Secretary of Transportation will be critical as we \nstrive to balance the Federal budget without decimating the Nation's \nphysical infrastructure. I look forward to his confirmation. I am glad \ntoday to speak in support of his nomination enthusiastically and \nwithout any reservations.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support for \nRodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation.\n  Mr. President, as Administrator of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, Rodney Slater has demonstrated the leadership, \nintelligence, and vision that is required to lead the Department of \nTransportation. I am confident he will do an excellent job as \nSecretary.\n  During the past 4 years, Administrator Slater has overseen a $20 \nbillion U.S. Highway System and a nationwide work force of 3,500. In \nthat capacity, he transformed FHWA policies and programs to better \nserve the people and industries who rely on our highway system. He has \nalso been a strong advocate for the advancement of women and \nminorities.\n  As Secretary, Mr. Slater will play a critical role in ensuring that \nour Nation makes much-needed investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure. I know he shares my commitment to that goal. \nTransportation generates 20 percent of our GNP, and every $1 billion \ninvested in our transportation system yields more than 25,000 \nconstruction-related jobs.\n  Investment in transportation is also necessary to keep us \ninternationally competitive. Americans spend more than 1.6 million \nhours a day stuck in traffic, at a cost to U.S. businesses of about $40 \nbillion per year. That's a burden our economy simply cannot afford.\n  By reducing congestion, improving air quality and enhancing safety, \neffective transportation systems also improve our overall quality of \nlife.\n  This year we are facing renewed debate on the importance of \ntransportation as we discuss the authorization of ISTEA. And I am \npleased that Rodney Slater will be taking the lead for the \nadministration in the reauthorization effort.\n  Mr. President, ISTEA is a bold and innovative law that is helping to \nincrease mobility, ensure access to jobs and sustain our environment \nfor future generations. It has improved planning and flexibility, \nemphasized local decision making and encouraged new technology.\n  Mr. President, we need to extend ISTEA to meet the transportation and \neconomic challenges of the 21st century. We need to build on the \nlegislation's innovative intermodal system. We should continue to \npromote State and local flexibility. We should continue to use \ntechnology, or so-called Intelligent Transportation Systems, to \nincrease our capacity and efficiency. And we must maintain ISTEA's \ncommitment to promoting safety.\n  I believe Rodney Slater shares my commitment to these goals, and I am \nlooking forward to working closely with him throughout the debate on \nISTEA.\n  Mr. President, as we develop so-called ISTEA Two, all of us will need \nto remember that the choices we make will directly affect the lives of \nmillions of ordinary Americans. Our decisions will affect where and how \nwe live. Where we work. How we'll get there. And how long it will take.\n  In many cases, our choices also will be a matter of life and death \nfor thousands of Americans. And we shouldn't forget that. We will be \ndeciding the safety of our roads, our rails, and our air travel. \nUnfortunately, over the past 2 years, safety often has taken a back \nseat to other considerations. We have lost our national speed limit. We \nhave lost our motorcycle helmet and seatbelt laws. And, meanwhile, the \nproblem of drunk driving has worsened. In my view, it's long past time \nthat we made safety a top priority.\n  Mr. President, I raised this issue with Administrator Slater during \nthe informational hearing in front of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. He assured me that safety is, and will continue to be, \nhis top priority as Secretary of Transportation. I commend him for that \ncommitment.\n  Administrator Slater also assured me that he is an advocate for \nhealthy transportation funding this fiscal year and in the years ahead. \nIn the coming months, Congress and the administration will be working \ntogether to balance the budget. As that process moves forward, all of \nus who care about transportation will have to work hard to ensure that \ntransportation is given the priority it deserves.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that Rodney Slater will be a \nTransportation Secretary who will work to maintain our infrastructure, \nto preserve ISTEA, to enhance safety, and to ensure adequate funding \nfor our transportation needs. I look forward to working closely with \nhim to ensure that all Americans can travel safely and efficiently as \nwe move into the 21st century.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe confirmation of Administrator Rodney Slater to be the next \nSecretary of Transportation for this great Nation.\n  With 1 of every 10 workers and over $700 billion dollars being \ndevoted annually to transportation products and services, we certainly \nneed a person of Mr. Slater's caliber.\n  Transportation touches the lives of each and every American citizen \non a daily basis; and while we can be proud of our railways, \ninterstate, highways, and airport systems, there are still significant \nchallenges which lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, both personal and business travel are at all time \nhighs and the concern for safety is shared by all Americans.\n  We are continually facing the problems of congestion and pollution in \nmetropolitan areas while attempting to meet the demand for increased \nmobility.\n  And, in New Mexico, like many other rural States, we are witnessing a \ndemographic shift which is placing a strain on our current regional \ntransportation systems.\n  In addition, there are still the growing demands for speed and \nefficiency in the transportation of goods. With the emergence of just-\nin-time manufacturing, transportation authorities must continue to \nresearch transportation innovations and utilize new technologies which \nwill help preserve time and money.\n  Mr. President, I believe Mr. Slater's creativity and fresh thinking \nwill be an asset to the President as we begin to face these issues and \nlook towards the future of transportation in America. And that future \nbegins with the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA].\n  I believe we must build upon the priorities set forth in this \nimportant legislation while continuing to provide the necessary funding \nto ensure the strongest transportation infrastructure possible.\n  ISTEA's reauthorization must be based upon principles that will \nsustain a strong globally-competitive economy and ensure the mobility \nand safety of our people.\n  I believe Mr. Slater recognizes the challenges ahead of him as \nSecretary of Transportation and I am truly encouraged by his \ncommitment.\n  Administrator Slater's history is clearly is one of hard work and \ndedication. He served as assistant attorney general for the State of \nArkansas and later worked as an assistant to the Governor on economic \nand community programs.\n  Administrator Slater began his focus on transportation by serving as \nthe\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\nchairman of the Arkansas State Highway Commission.\n  And I believe in this era of new federalism, his experience in \nrunning a state highway agency will be an excellent background as we \nlook to provide State governments with enough flexibility to produce \nlocal answers to transportation issues.\n  In addition, Administrator Slater served as a member of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Executive \nCommittee of Commissions and Boards and is currently serving as the \nfirst African-American to head the Federal Highway Administration where \nhe worked as an effective leader in escorting the National Highway \nSystem legislation through Congress.\n  In speaking with Administrator Slater on many occasions, I have \nalways been impressed with his desire to participate in open \ndiscussions with one priority in mind--and that is to reach a solution \nwhich is best for the American people.\n  In fact, as Federal Highway Administrator, Mr. Slater personally \ntraveled from coast to coast as part of an outreach program which he \ninitiated.\n  From Buffalo, NY to Laredo, TX and from San Francisco, CA to our \nNation's Capital--Administrator Slater sat down with real people to \ndiscuss their thoughts and concerns about our Nation's highways and \ninterstates.\n  I believe Administrator Slater, in his new capacity as Secretary of \nTransportation, will continue to provide all Americans with a \ntransportation network that will be second to none.\n  And it is in my judgment that Administrator Slater has first hand \nknowledge as to what the future needs are for this Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I commend President Clinton for his nomination, and shall cast my \nvote for his confirmation with confidence and wish him the best as he \nbegins to face the transportation challenges of this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Rodney Slater as the new Secretary for the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  Mr. Slater has the experience, the sense of purpose, and the \ncommitment to make sure that our transportation infrastructure is ready \nfor the new century. He is well suited to head the Department of \nTransportation, a large and complex agency which is so vital to \nAmerica's infrastructure. Transportation is one of the underpinnings of \nour economy, and plays an essential role in the daily lives of all \nAmericans. A safe and efficient system of transportation is needed to \nkeep our growing economy strong.\n  Rodney Slater understands that transportation is an engine for job \ncreation. He knows that it provides hundreds of good paying jobs in the \ndevelopment of transportation technologies, in construction, and in the \ndelivery of transportation services. From the person who drives the \nlight rail train through my own hometown of Baltimore, to the \nscientists and engineers designing the transportation networks of the \nfuture, transportation means jobs. Mr. Slater understands that.\n  Under Mr. Slater's guidance, the Department of Transportation will \ncontinue to encourage new technologies, promote safety, and protect our \nenvironment. He is the right person to manage our national \ninfrastructure, and lead the way to better and safer roads and transit \nsystems, airports, and to keep us globally competitive.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Mr. Slater on making \nthe Department of Transportation a more effective and efficient agency. \nWe must work together to meet the transportation needs and challenges \nthat we face as we enter the 21st century. Much has been done and \ncontinues to be done as we work as partners to revitalize America's \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. Slater is equipped for this task. He was appointed to the \nArkansas State Highway Commission in 1987, and made its chairman in \n1992. Mr. Slater understands the needs of local and State governments. \nHe understands the need for our rural, suburban, and urban areas to be \nconnected, and provide the access to opportunity.\n  As the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, Mr. \nSlater has shown his commitment to put people first, and to rebuild \nAmerica. He has listened to thousands of constituents and incorporated \ntheir concerns into the Federal Highway Administration's decisionmaking \nprocess. He has led this agency as it rebuilt and expanded our Nation's \nhighways, and in the process created jobs and opportunities.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Slater as he works to meet the \ntransportation needs of Maryland and those across this great Nation. I \nurge my colleagues to confirm the nomination of Mr. Rodney Slater as \nSecretary of the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to support the confirmation of \nRodney Slater to be the new Secretary of Transportation. Perhaps only \nthe Secretary of Agriculture has as a profound effect on economy of my \nState as the Secretary of Transportation.\n  As a large geography, small population State at the Nation's \ncrossroads, Nebraska has a great deal at stake in America's \ntransportation policy. Perhaps only the Secretary of Agriculture has as \nprofound an effect on the economy of my State as the Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  Coming from rural Arkansas, Rodney Slater understands the \ntransportation problems of Nebraska and the Nation. He has demonstrated \nskill and vision as Administrator of the Federal Highways \nAdministration.\n  One of the most important bills the 105th Congress will consider is \nthe reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct (ISTEA). The new Secretary will lead the administration's efforts \non this important bill. The Senate begins its work on the \nreauthorization of ISTEA with this confirmation. As the Senate debates \nthe nomination of Rodney Slater to be Secretary of Transportation, I \nwould like to take a few moments to discuss some of the transportation \npriorities I want our new Secretary and the Senate to consider.\n  First, the new Surface Transportation law should promote a national \ntransportation infrastructure which addresses rural and urban needs. \nThat legislation must recognize that transportation investments in \nsmall population, crossroads States like Nebraska contribute to the \nproductivity and efficiency of the entire nation.\n  Second, ISTEA 2 should be truly intermodal by including an \nauthorization for Amtrak, and assistance for communities dealing with \nan increasing density of rail traffic. The Congress has a tremendous \nopportunity to enhance safety where rails meet roads in America.\n  Third, safety must remain the pre-eminent focus of transportation \npolicy. In spite of long-term progress on the safety front, more than \n41,000 Americans will die and more than 3 million Americans will be \ninjured this year on the Nation's roads and highways. We can reduce \nthat number by focusing much needed attention on two groups of \ndrivers--Teenagers and repeat offenders. Traffic accidents are the \nleading cause of death among Americans ages 15-24. The reauthorization \nof ISTEA provides an opportunity to seriously address this problem.\n  Fourth, in aviation, I applaud the Secretary-designate for his strong \nstatement in support of the Essential Air Service Program. Air service \nis critical to the economic survival of many rural communities. Last \nyear, the Congress solved the chronic funding problems of the Essential \nAir Service program. I am pleased that the Secretary-designate supports \nthat action.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I pledge to the new Secretary that I will \ncontinue to do everything I can to end the hemorrhage of the airways \ntrust fund. The lapse of the aviation ticket tax is draining the trust \nfund at an astounding rate of $18-20 million a day. As a new member of \nthe Finance Committee, I consider funding the Nation's investments in \nairport safety, security, and efficiency a top priority. I am proud \nthat our committee yesterday took swift, bipartisan action on this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. President, with this confirmation, we begin work on the \ntransportation policy for a new century. The Senate should not \nunderestimate the importance of this task or the significance of this \nconfirmation. Future employment, economic growth, international \ncompetitiveness, and national productivity are all at stake. I am \nconfident that Rodney Slater understands\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nthe importance of his mission and I look forward to working with the \nnew Secretary.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Rodney Slater to be the next Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  Most of my colleagues know Rodney Slater from his tenure as the \nFederal Highway Administrator--a position he has held since 1993. Mr. \nSlater has proven his ability to grasp and understand transportation \nissues that are important to all regions of this country.\n  Even though he is a native of Arkansas, I can tell my colleagues that \nhe recognizes the needs of areas such as the West. In fact, he has \ntraveled to Montana three times to see first hand the vast expanse of \nland and low population that is our State. These trips have enabled him \nto appreciate the true meaning of the word rural.\n  And this experience will come in handy in the coming months. One of \nthe key issues the 105th Congress will face is the reauthorization of \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act or ISTEA. This \nlegislation will set the highway and transit funding levels for every \nState and an understanding of the needs of rural States will be \ncritical. ISTEA expires on September 30 of this year and we have our \nwork cut out for us.\n  There will be many difficult and controversial issues to be debated \nduring reauthorization. One such issue will be the question of highway \nfunding formulas. I would remind my colleagues that we are one Nation--\nnot 50 separate ones. We all come from different States with diverse \ntransportation needs. But our goal should be to craft a reauthorization \nbill that will move this country forward into the next century--not one \nthat takes us back.\n  Mr. President, transportation in Montana is not just limited to \nhighways. There is another important component of our transportation \nsystem--the Essential Air Service program.\n  The Essential Air Service program ensures that some of this country's \nmost rural and vulnerable communities have access to air \ntransportation. It is truly an essential transportation program.\n  Montana is second only to Alaska in the number of EAS communities--\nseven. Every year, Congress must fight for the necessary funding to \ncontinue this program. However, Mr. Slater has pledged his commitment \nto support this program. I look forward to working with him and the \nrest of the Department to ensure the stability of this program into the \nfuture.\n  Rodney Slater has repeatedly shown an ability to bring diverse \ninterests together for a common goal. He has also displayed a skill for \ntaking innovative approaches to many of the problems facing the \ntransportation community. He has always been responsive to me and other \nMembers of the Senate. It is these skills that Congress will need \nduring the reauthorization of ISTEA and other transportation matters.\n  Mr. President, I support this nomination without reservation and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nRodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Slater \nhas distinguished himself by his fine service to the people of Arkansas \nand to the Nation as Federal Highway Administrator. I have had the \nopportunity to meet with Mr. Slater and discuss a range of \ntransportation issues with him. I am confident that he has the \nnecessary skills and knowledge to develop a national transportation \npolicy and to prepare our Nation for the transportation challenges of \nthe next century.\n  The greatest challenge before Mr. Slater is to establish a \ncomprehensive transportation policy for the 21st century. When Mr. \nSlater came before the Commerce Committee, I spoke of the need to \ndevelop such a policy and I emphasized my belief that such a policy \nmust prominently include passenger rail service as an integral \ncomponent. Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in \nEurope, Japan, and even here in the United States, our Nation continues \nto seriously underfund and shortchange passenger rail. Indeed, over \nhalf the Transportation Department's spending authority is devoted to \nhighways and another quarter to aviation; rail is still in distant last \nplace with roughly 3 percent of total spending authority. During the \nconfirmation hearing, I stated that I believe the time is long overdue \nto change our approach and to afford greater consideration to our \ncommitment to intermodalism. I hope to work with Mr. Slater in the \nyears ahead to develop and deploy a comprehensive, financially stable, \nintercity transportation network that includes passenger rail as an \nintegral component.\n  A second and important challenge Mr. Slater will face will be the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nor ISTEA. I am by no means alone in counting on the administration to \nplay a central role in this debate. Soon, the administration will \nsubmit its proposal for reauthorizing ISTEA. I expect this proposal to \nfairly allocate highway funds and to consider the aging and crumbling \ninfrastructure of the crowded cities in the Northeast. These cities are \nimportant population centers and significant gateways for international \ntrade and tourism. Those of us representing northeastern States are \nplacing great faith in Mr. Slater--faith that he will afford due \nconsideration to our legitimate needs and will offer sufficient support \nto ensure that those needs are addressed in a fair and equitable \nmanner.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Slater in several other areas \nincluding reforming the FAA, negotiating and implementing meaningful \nopen-skies agreements with our trading partners, and implementing the \ntrain whistle ban in a manner that respects the safety records of the \ncommunities that will be affected.\n  I enthusiastically will vote in favor of Mr. Slater's confirmation, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate, in just a minute, will vote on \nthe nomination of Rodney Slater to serve the Nation as Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  I congratulate Mr. Slater on the honor of being selected by the \nPresident for this very important post, and I urge the Senate to \nconfirm his nomination.\n  Mr. Slater currently serves as the top official at the Federal \nHighway Administration and has received much praise on both sides of \nthe aisle and from across the country for his good work in that \nimportant capacity.\n  On January 29, the Senate Commerce Committee conducted a thorough \nhearing on the Slater nomination, and, yesterday, the committee voted \nunanimously to refer his nomination to the full Senate with our \napproval.\n  As part of the committee's examination, we submitted a battery of \nquestions to the nominee regarding his qualifications and fitness to \nserve as Secretary; about his priorities in serving the transportation \nneeds of our country; and about his plans to ensure that he and the \nDepartment effectively serve the public interest in keeping with the \nhighest standards of professional conduct.\n  He faithfully responded to our many questions and while members may \ndisagree about some of his policies, the nominee is experienced in the \ntransportation arena; has proven himself to be a dedicated public \nservant; and has assured the committee that he has not engaged in any \nactivity which would cast doubt on his ability or fitness to serve.\n  Mr. Slater, has a very difficult job ahead of him. The Transportation \nsector affects every facet of our country's economic and social life. \nThe ability of our citizens and the Nation's goods to travel freely, \neconomically and safely, will be directly and deeply influenced by the \npolicies established by the new Secretary.\n  Our Nation faces severe challenges in the effort to keep our \ntransportation systems the most modern, efficient, and safest in the \nworld. In particular,\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nupgrading the Nation's highways, railways and aviation infrastructure \nin an era of necessary budget constraint will be especially difficult \nand will require vision and leadership.\n  Above all, the new Secretary's top priority must be protecting public \nsafety in all modes of transportation. And, he must apply himself to \nprioritizing national needs and eliminating unjustified programs so \nthat limited resources can flow to the Nation's most pressing \nrequirements according to merit and need. Achieving these lofty goals \nwill take a Secretary who can say no, as well as yes, and who can keep \nan unflinching eye on the interests of the country rather than on \npolitics.\n  Mr. Slater, assured us that he understands the magnitude of the \nresponsibilities awaiting the new Secretary, and is qualified and eager \nto take them on. Having questioned and examined this nominee, and given \nhis track record of public service, the committee trusts and believes \nthat is so. I urge my colleagues to confirm Rodney Slater, and we look \nforward to working with him to best serve the transportation needs of \nour Nation.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If my colleague would yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, under the previous order, we were supposed \nto vote at 3 o'clock. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back remaining time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Rodney E. \nSlater, of Arkansas, to be Secretary of Transportation? On this \nquestion the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] and \nthe Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 6 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bennett\n     Thurmond\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that under the previous order, \nthe President shall be notified of the confirmation of the nomination \nof Rodney Slater.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Rodney Earl Slater is the right choice to \nbecome the next U.S. Secretary of Transportation. He has earned the \nunanimous vote by which he was confirmed. He has taken a remarkable \npath from a childhood of poverty to being selected to head the $39 \nbillion Department of Transportation. His hard work and talents have \nproven invaluable to every effort he has undertaken.\n  Rodney was born in 1955 in the dirt-poor Mississippi Delta. His first \ntaste of hard work came early, when as a boy he picked cotton and \npeaches. He was recruited to play football at Eastern Michigan \nUniversity, rising to become co-captain of the team.\n  His performance in speech class so impressed his professor that he \npersuaded him to join the college's debate team. He went on to become a \nnational finalist in debate competitions. The coach of his college \ndebate team described him well: ``I knew way back then that here was a \nvery disciplined, goal-oriented young man who was driven by his own \ncompetitiveness. He wasn't competing against other students. He was \ncompeting against his own measure of success.''\n  Rodney Slater went on to an outstanding career of public service. He \nserved several years in the Arkansas State Attorney General's Office. \nAfter 4 years as an assistant to then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, \nhe directed government relations for Arkansas State University.\n  In 1987, he was appointed to the powerful Arkansas State Highway \nCommission, making him the first African-American to hold the job. Five \nyears later, he was promoted to chair the commission.\n  As Federal Highway Administrator since 1993, Mr. Slater has managed a \n$20 billion annual budget in an agency with 3,500 employees and offices \nin every State. He tackled the politically difficult task of putting \ntogether the National Highway System, a 160,000-mile network of \nroadways. Stitching together that system involved painstaking \nnegotiations with 50 State governments, regional transportation \nagencies, and city governments. Despite these difficulties, he won \npraise from all sides for his candor, political skills, and ability to \nwork within the system to get things done.\n  Rodney Slater's nomination has drawn wide and bipartisan support. As \nPresident Clinton put it, he ``was recommended by more people from more \nplaces in more ways for this job than any person for any position I \nhave ever seen.'' He has won praise from leaders from both parties and \nboth Houses of Congress. Senator John Warner, who chairs the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Transportation Subcommittee, described him \nbest as ``an effective partner with Congress.''\n  As a true Arkansas traveler, Rodney has demonstrated he understands \nrural transportation needs. He has certainly become a good friend of \nSouth Dakota. When we needed help, in good times and bad, we knew we \ncould count on him. South Dakotans are deeply grateful for his \nassistance, which we will never forget.\n  The nomination of Rodney Slater validates a life of hard work. He has \nearned this nomination. From his roots in rural Arkansas, he worked his \nway through college and law school. Here in Washington, he has rebuilt \nand expanded our Nation's highways and linked isolated communities to \njobs and opportunities. He has built bridges both of steel and of \ngoodwill to bring people closer together. He is the right person to \nhelp us meet the many transportation challenges we face as we enter the \n21st century.\n  I supported Rodney Slater's nomination with enthusiasm. He fully \ndeserved the unanimous vote by which he was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1073-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the recess be \ndelayed in order for Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Sessions of \nAlabama and Senator Grams of Minnesota\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\nto speak, and following their remarks the Senate stand in recess under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nlittle speech I would like to make on a nongermane matter. It will take \nme maybe 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I amend the request for the Senators that I \nmentioned, Senators Graham of Florida, Grams of Mininesota, Senator \nSessions, and the Senator from West Virginia to be able to speak, and \nthat we stand in recess under the previous order after those speeches.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreconvenes at 4 p.m. today--and it looks like there may actually, in \nview of the speeches to be given there, not be much of a recess at all, \nbut at approximately 4 p.m. Senator Durbin will be recognized to offer \nan amendment to the pending constitutional amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senator from \nIllinois [Mr. Durbin] will offer this amendment when the Senate \nreconvenes after our conference. He will then debate his amendment \nthroughout the remainder of today's session as long as he needs. It is \nmy understanding that Senator Durbin will be willing then to vote in \nrelation to his amendment on Monday, February 10, at 5 p.m.\n  I wish to say that we had been hoping maybe we did not need to have \nthat vote, but in view of the fact that we are not scheduled to be in \nsession next Friday and the funeral services are scheduled for Thursday \nfor Ambassador Harriman, we do need to get as much work done as we can \non Monday. So we will look toward having this vote at 5 o'clock on \nMonday and then votes early Tuesday morning, and continue on through \nthe remainder of the week to accomplish as much as we can in terms of \ntaking up amendments on the constitutional amendment and also \nconfirmations that we hope to be able to move. We think we will have a \ncouple more perhaps that we will be able to vote on in the next week.\n  So with that in mind, I would like to announce there will be no \nfurther votes today and the next rollcall vote is expected to occur at \napproximately 5 p.m. on Monday, February 10.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. It appears that some of the nominees may not get out until \nWednesday or so of next week without any problems but just because of \nwhen the next committee meeting will occur. Is it the majority leader's \nintention that if they get out, say, unanimously, without any \nopposition, and have very little opposition, if any, here, we might \nwaive the time and go ahead and try to vote before we leave here next \nweek?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as we have done on other nominees we have \nvoted on, it would be our intent to do that. We want to get as many of \nthem done as we can next week. We hope that perhaps we will reach a \npoint where we can vote on the U.N. Ambassador's position, and we think \nthere may be another one ready.\n  Mr. FORD. Secretary of Energy.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right. So if any of those will be cleared, we will try \nto get those up Thursday.\n  Mr. FORD. The only reason I asked, there will be kind of a time \ncrunch, and I wanted others to understand we might get the committees \nto move their hearings up a day.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in session on Friday of \nthis week for debate on the pending balanced budget constitutional \namendment. However, no votes will occur during Friday's session. It is \nmy understanding that Senator Wellstone will be in position on Monday \nto offer two amendments to the balanced budget issue. It will be my \nintent to schedule those votes to occur after the weekly luncheons on \nTuesday, February 11, somewhere between 2:15 and 3 o'clock.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1078-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1079-S1099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we as a Nation have come to an important crossroads in \nour history. We must decide whether or not we should alter our supreme \nand most respected document, the U.S. Constitution, to establish the \nprinciple of a balanced Federal budget.\n  As we all know, regrettably our Nation is deeply in debt and goes \nmore so each year. The budget deficit has become a permanent fixture of \nour Nation's fiscal policy. While there are those who say we can \nwithout a constitutional amendment balance the budget, recent history \nraises serious doubts.\n  Mr. President, I should like to humanize this issue by putting it in \nthe context of a family, my family. My father was born in Croswell, MI, \nin 1885--February 10, 1885, to be exact. When he was born, the national \ndebt, after almost 100 years of American history, after having \npurchased Louisiana from the French, having fought the Revolution, the \nWar of 1812, the Civil War, we had accumulated a total national debt on \nthe day my dad was born of $1.6 billion. If you took the population of \nthe United States in February of 1885 and divided it by that $1.6 \nbillion national debt, my father came into the Earth owing $28. That \nwas his share of the national debt.\n  I was born in November 1936. On that date, the national debt was \n$33.8 billion. Between my dad's birth and my birth, we had fought the \nSpanish-American War, the First World War, and suffered a deep \ndepression, which we still were in the midst of on the date of my \nbirth. On that day, dividing the then national debt by the then \npopulation, I owed $264. That was my indebtedness to the Nation at the \ntime of my arrival.\n  My first child was born in January 1963. When Gwen was born, the \nnational debt was $310 billion. In 1963. That was not very long ago in \nthe scale of life. And my daughter owed $1,640. That was her share of \nthe national debt as recently as January of 1963. And 27 years after \nher birth, my daughter Gwen had a daughter, Sarah. Sarah was born in \n1990, and upon her birth the national debt, if you can believe it, had \nsoared from $310 billion 27 years earlier to $3.2 trillion when my \nfirst granddaughter, Sarah Logan, was born. Sarah came into this world \nwith a proportion of the national debt of $12,830.\n  Since Sarah's birth, I have had seven other grandchildren, the most \nrecent born in 1995. When those four grandchildren, triplet \ngranddaughters and a grandson, Mark Ernest, were born, the national \ndebt had soared again now to $4.9 trillion, or they came into the Earth \nwith a indebtedness of $18,932.\n  Between my father's birth, with a $28 indebtedness, to my youngest \ngrandchild's birth, $18,932 per person is what we have inflicted upon \nour children, our grandchildren, and generations beyond.\n  Such history has brought me to the conclusion that if we are to \nreverse this profligate policy, if we are to begin to return to the \nprinciples of our parents and grandparents, we, unlike they, must have \nthe discipline of a constitutional amendment which will require that \neach generation assume responsibility for its indebtedness.\n  I make these observations not without recognition that we have made \nconsiderable progress in recent years in terms of gaining some control \nover our deficit. America reached its all-time high, in terms of an \nannual deficit, in 1992. In 1992 the national deficit soared to over \n$290 billion in that one year. It took us 100 years to get to $1.6 \nbillion. In one year we had a deficit of $290 billion.\n  This year, the estimate is that our deficit will be $107 billion. So \nwe have made substantial progress and I believe that President Clinton \nand the Members of Congress during this period deserve some recognition \nfor the fact that we have pulled that line of deficits in a downward \nposition, albeit still, each year, contributing substantially to our \naccumulated national debt.\n  But, despite this progress, current projections forecast large \ndeficits into\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nthe future. Our national debt is expected to reach not the $4.9 \ntrillion that it was in 1995, but $5.4 trillion at the end of this \nfiscal year, by the end of September of 1997.\n  With this history in mind, and witnessing numerous attempts--many of \nwhich carry the names of Members of Congress--attempts and failures to \nenact legislation to force ourselves to meet the standard of a balanced \nbudget, I believe the time has come to pass an amendment to the \nConstitution to mandate a balanced budget. It is unfortunate that we \nneed a constitutional amendment to force us to do something that we \nought to do voluntarily. However, a constitutional amendment is \nnecessary to provide Congress and Presidents, today and in the future, \nwith the necessary constitutional backbone to maintain a policy of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I have long supported a balanced budget amendment. I am an original \ncosponsor of the current amendment that is before us this afternoon. I \nsupport an amendment as an important principle, both to maintain the \nmomentum of the last 4 years toward reducing and eliminating the annual \ndeficits, and to assure that, once we are at a point of balance, we \nwill stay there. It is imperative that we not let this opportunity pass \nby, that we not lose the progress of the last 4 years. We must continue \non a path toward a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002.\n  If I could speak in the context of my State of Florida, we have a \nunique interest in the outcome of this debate. Florida will continue to \ngrow. It will be one of the fastest growing States in the Nation. Our \npopulation, which today is something over 14 million people, is \nprojected to reach over 16 million by the year 2005. The benefits of a \nbalanced budget amendment are national and numerous, but one of the \nmost important benefits, as recognized by virtually all economists, is \nthat a balanced Federal budget will lead to lower interest rates and \nincreased economic growth.\n  Americans deserve the benefits that a balanced budget will bring and \nthe people of my State, citizens in a State which each year must \nfinance the consequences of growth--additional homes, schools, all of \nthe things that a growing population requires--with money which has \nlargely been borrowed, will benefit especially by the lower interest \nrates that a balanced Federal budget will bring.\n  If capital is readily available at reduce cost, virtually everything \nAmericans do that involves borrowing money is easier and will have a \npositive financial impact on States with expanding population, such as \nFlorida. Most States have a constitutional requirement for a balanced \nbudget within their own fiscal houses. As a State legislator, and for 8 \nyears as Governor of Florida, I operated with a balanced budget \namendment to our State Constitution and with a balanced budget. I can \nsay from that experience that this requirement of a balanced budget in \nour State constitution, and the fidelity of generations of State \nofficials to that objective, has served my State well. It will serve \nAmerica well. I will support the specifics of this amendment because I \nbelieve that this specific amendment is better than the status quo, is \nbetter than the history of the last century. But I think we should not \nlet this opportunity pass without striving for additional perfection in \nthis amendment.\n  The U.S. Constitution appropriately is not amended frequently, or \nwithout the most serious considerations. Therefore, whenever its \namendment is considered, we should give attention to the details of \nthat amendment and strive to assure that we are leaving to future \nAmericans the best possible statement of national policy. To this end, \nnext week or as soon thereafter as possible, I will offer an amendment \nto the balanced budget amendment that will strive to accomplish four \nthings.\n  First, it will eliminate almost $2 trillion in the total debt that we \nwill accumulate over the next 25 years under the amendment in its \ncurrent form. Second, the amendment to the balanced budget amendment \nthat I will offer will protect our Social Security trust fund. Third, \nit will stimulate economic growth. Finally, it will be honest with the \nAmerican people, by being consistent with their expectations of what a \nbalanced budget truly means.\n  The failure to pass a balanced budget amendment this year will be a \ngreat mistake. For too many years we have delayed the hard discussions \nuntil tomorrow. Mr. President, tomorrow has come. It is our \ngeneration's duty to assure that we pay our Nation's bills rather than \nasking our children and grandchildren to do so. It is our challenge to \npass a constitutional amendment to establish as a national policy that \neach generation of Americans will balance its Nation's budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how much I personally \nappreciate the distinguished Senator from Florida, his courage and \nboldness in standing up for the balanced budget amendment, which he has \nalways done. He and Senator Bryan are the two principal Democratic \ncosponsors of this amendment, and they have both worked very hard with \nus to try to bring this to fruition, not only on the floor but through \nthe whole Congress. I want to personally thank him for his kind \nremarks, good remarks this day, and I look forward to the rest of the \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to rise to address this \nChamber and I am reminded of the responsibility given to me by my \nfellow Alabamians. It is both an honor and privilege to represent the \npeople of Alabama, and I will devote all my resources toward ensuring \nthat their best and most honest instincts are well served in this \ninstitution.\n  I am also delighted to have heard the remarks of the senior Senator \nfrom Florida. Those remarks are most pertinent and important for us \nall.\n  I think, also, I should note the great respect that I have for \nSenator Hatch and the work he has done on building a balanced budget \namendment that is sound and that will be a good addition to our \nConstitution. It is a well-written amendment and it ought to be passed \nin its present form.\n  I think it is, indeed, appropriate that the first bill under \nconsideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate, is the balanced budget \namendment. The people of Alabama have made their support for this \nlegislation clear, and I intend to do all I can to ensure that they \nhave the opportunity to have this amendment placed before them for \ntheir ratification. Americans know through experience that Washington \ncannot be trusted to keep its financial house in order. This has been \ndemonstrated to them by Washington's failure to balance more than one \nbudget in the last 28 years. The 28 years of unbalanced budgets stacked \nright here before us demonstrate Congresses past history of failure.\n  Americans know the burdens of Washington's excesses are going to fall \nprimarily on their children, a result which is unjust and \nunconscionable. They have reached the same conclusions that I have: \nEnactment of the balanced budget amendment is the only way Washington's \ntax-and-spend mentality can be curbed and provides the only way for \nintegrity and accountability in Government spending. It will force us \nto honestly confront the issues and to make choices.\n  Someone has suggested we really don't need to amend the Constitution, \nthe budget deficit is dropping. But in Judiciary hearings last week, \nSenator Biden, a senior Democratic Senator from Delaware, discussed \nthat very point.\n  He noted at the time that the only reason, in his opinion budget \ndeficits have been dropping is because of the fear that this body and \nthe House, along with the President, would pass a balanced budget \namendment. Without discipline, budget deficits will increase again at \nan alarming rate. That is why Senator Biden supported a balanced budget \namendment.\n  The arguments in favor of a balanced budget amendment are not new. In \nfact, the concerns Americans raise today were advocated by our Founding \nFathers, and none more vocal than Thomas Jefferson. Where today's \nfamilies worry about the crushing debt that is being passed onto their \nchildren, Jefferson warned, and I quote, ``Each successive generation \nought to be guaranteed against dissipations and corruptions of those \npreceding.''\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\n  And corruption it is. It is irresponsibility. It is a corruption of \nthe highest duties and responsibilities of office in this Government \nthat we fail to make the hard choices when confronted with competing \npriorities and simply adopt both priorities and pass that debt to our \nchildren.\n  During the first Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill, Senator \nOrrin Hatch placed a debt clock before us. It graphically illustrated \nthe point. Each second that passes sees another $4,500 being added to \nour national debt. Think about that. The national debt is growing at \nthe rate of $4,500 a second, $270,000 a minute, $16,200,000 an hour, \n$388,800,000 a day. This is in addition to the current national debt of \n$5.2 trillion.\n  At this moment, our current debt is equal to a $20,000 obligation \nbeing placed on every man, woman, and child in this country, and it is \nour children who will face the brunt of this problem. Make no mistake, \nthe increases in today's debt will be funded directly by taxes levied \non our children and grandchildren, limiting the opportunity for them to \nenjoy the same standard of living we enjoy. By continuing these \npractices, we are mortgaging their right to participate in the American \ndream.\n  Having paid no heed to Jefferson's advice, we have failed to protect \nour Nation from the dissipations and corruptions of the present \ngeneration. Indeed, we have violated the very principle of our \nfounding: taxation without representation. We are, in effect, taxing \nfuture generations without their consent as a result of our own \nirresponsibility.\n  I would like to take a moment to reflect upon the tragic waste of \nresources that the interest on this debt is causing us. We lose $800 \nmillion a day simply on interest payments. In fact, over the course of \na fiscal year, we spend nearly as much money on interest payments as we \ndo on the Nation's defense. For example, in the year 1995, we spent \n$232 billion on interest on the debt and $273 billion on defense. The \nmoney we use to pay the interest on the debt is money that could be \ndiverted to other areas or simply returned to the American taxpayer. \nThis is an intolerable waste of our resources. A balanced budget \namendment would offer protection against a continued waste of our \nrevenue resources.\n  A balanced budget amendment would also afford protection against \nanother evil Jefferson foresaw: the inability of Congress to restrain \nits spending with any degree of self-discipline. When Jefferson warned, \n``Public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared by a republican \ngovernment,'' he did so because he could foresee that self-interested \npoliticians could be expected to choose spending over restraint and \nresponsibility. Our $5.2 trillion national debt is a sad testament to \nthat fact. Our inability to live within our means on the national level \nis unacceptable and adds to the increasing lack of confidence the \nAmerican public--who must live within its budgets--feels for its \nFederal Government.\n  On this point, I am reminded of a story arising at the time I served \nas U.S. attorney and attended a Federal Judiciary Conference. The \nattending judges were complaining because Congress was requiring \nsentencing guidelines that would restrict their ability to sentence. In \nfact, the guidelines mandated certain sentences for certain types of \noffenses.\n  At one point, a senior judge stated to the entire conference: \n``Gentlemen, the plain fact is, the U.S. Congress no longer trusts you \nto sentence.''\n  The fact today is that the American people no longer trust the \nPresident or the Congress to bring their spending in order. They are \ninsisting upon a balanced budget amendment to end the deficit, because \nit is a people's initiative.\n  A constitutional amendment is needed, I submit to you, because we \nhave a systemic weakness. We have observed in the last 28 years, by \nthese budget deficits here before us, that this Congress cannot be \ntrusted. Our system is weak without fiscal discipline, and it is proper \nand appropriate for this body and the people of the United States to \namend that Constitution and fix that systemic weakness.\n  A balanced budget amendment is needed to regain the people's trust, \nbecause the people know that there has not been a balanced budget since \n1969, and they know that we are continuing to run budget deficit after \nbudget deficit. They are skeptical of our ability to keep our promises, \nbecause they do not believe that we have the political will to keep \nthem without a law requiring it. And they are right.\n  When Treasury Secretary Rubin testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I asked him about the current administration's commitment to \na balanced budget. I specifically asked him how he could commit to \nachieving a balanced budget in 2002 when neither he nor President \nClinton would even be in office at that time, because under the \nConstitution, President Clinton will leave office in the year 2000. \nThey cannot give an answer to that, and that is the point.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the President speak of the need \nfor a balanced budget in his address to the Nation. But what needs to \nbe remembered in this debate is that while the President may offer \nvisions of a balanced budget, and he may offer timelines for achieving \nthat goal, he will not be in office when the target date for the \nbalance arrives and therefore cannot be held accountable.\n  In essence, the promises of a balanced budget are nothing more than \nillusory commitments. Simply offering a vision of balance will not \nguide this Nation to its goal. An efficient enforcement mechanism needs \nto be in place in order to ensure that a commitment to a balanced \nbudget becomes a reality. This is especially true when an \nadministration proposes a budget in which much of the budget savings \nare backloaded with the supposed balance to be occurring in the years \nafter they leave office.\n  Such ``out-of-sight, out-of-mind'' proposals are a shunning of \nresponsibility and reflect the same business-as-usual thinking that has \nled us to the fiscal trouble we now face.\n  In truth, the only instrument capable of creating the kind of binding \ndiscipline needed to bring our budgets in balance is this amendment. \nWhile ending deficits may be tough for pork-addicted politicians and \nfor inefficient Government agencies and departments, it will become \nmuch easier, once the people speak, with this amendment.\n  Remember, there will be economic benefits from balancing the budget, \nsuch as increased savings and lower interest rates. The American public \nwould also be the recipient of another important benefit--that of \ngreater political independence.\n  On this issue, former Senator Paul Simon, a Democrat from Illinois, \nand a supporter of the balanced budget amendment, has raised a \nsignificant and often overlooked point. During testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Simon noted that limiting our ability to \nincrease our debt will necessarily mean that we reduce the amount of \nour Nation's debt held by foreign governments.\n  He recounted a jarring story in which he was once approached by a \nTreasury official before an important pending vote on a Saudi Arabian \narms sale. The official told him that if the vote failed to pass, the \nSaudis might stop buying bonds which finance our debt. This sort of \neconomic extortion is intolerable. American policymaking is and should \nalways remain the sole province of the American people's \nrepresentatives, not foreign bondholders. As most people know, it is \nnot a good idea to get into a fight with your banker.\n  The time to restore the American people's trust is now. We simply \ncannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by. As I campaigned \nthroughout Alabama last summer I was struck by the unanimous and \nuniversal support this amendment enjoyed. Whether I was meeting peanut \nfarmers in Dothan or teachers in Mobile, small businessmen in \nHuntsville or police officers in Birmingham, the support for this \namendment remained constant and strong.\n  The broad-based support is not confined simply to Alabama but is also \nreflected nationally. Survey after survey shows that over 80 percent of \nthe American public supports enacting a balanced budget amendment. In \nfact, support for this concept has already been powerfully demonstrated \non the State level with 48 States having enacted provisions which \nrestrict each State's ability to incur debt, including my home State of \nAlabama. And it works well.\n  Support for this amendment is so wide ranging that it transcends \nparty\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\nlines. I note with some interest that my predecessor, former Senator \nHowell Heflin of Alabama, and a Democrat, introduced a balanced budget \namendment as his very first piece of legislation in 1979.\n  Further, bipartisan support was evidenced in last year's vote on the \nissue, a vote which saw Republicans and Democrats in both Houses come \ntogether to fall just one vote short of passage. The reason for this \nbipartisan support is clear: The American people demand and deserve an \nopportunity to consider and vote on this amendment. I trust in the \njudgment of the American people to assess this amendment's merits as \nwell as its defects, and I encourage my fellow Members to trust in the \nAmerican people's collective wisdom as well.\n  As I began this speech by quoting Thomas Jefferson, I would like to \nfinish it by quoting another of our Founding Fathers, George \nWashington. I believe his words are applicable to our current debate. \nIn his words:\n\n       * * * whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public \n     credit can not be benefited by procrastination; and as far as \n     may be practicable we ought to place that credit on grounds \n     which can not be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive \n     accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all \n     governments.\n\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment does place our credit on \n``grounds which can not be disturbed'' and would prevent future \naccumulations of debt. It has been 200 years since Washington uttered \nthese sentiments. We have procrastinated long enough. The time to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment is now. Thank you very much. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama. When Senator Heflin left the Senate, I have to \nsay that I personally felt very badly about it. But I think Senator \nHeflin, who worked very hard for the balanced budget amendment, would \nreally have appreciated this wonderful set of remarks that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama gave today. I want to compliment him \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, there was a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent, if I can get this, that the order be \nSenator Grams, who I understand was supposed to go first, then Senator \nByrd, then finally Senator Durbin, who has an amendment that he will \nbring forward. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. With the right of the minority leader to come and speak \nwhenever he desires.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I will not object, knowing the right of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, to speak has been \nprotected.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know the distinguished Senator from Utah would do that \nin any event. I will not object. But I would like to make one comment \nafter the order is entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Utah--if I \nmight have his attention for one moment--the distinguished Senator from \nUtah and I have tried very hard to have speakers pro and con. It is my \nunderstanding that the distinguished majority leader wants this debate \nto go on for a few days, and as well it should.\n  Also, I understand the distinguished Senator from Utah wanted an \nopportunity for some of the new Members of the Senate to speak on this, \nas well they should. It is an important issue.\n  I urge those who do wish to speak to cooperate with the floor \nleaders, as they have. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have \nbeen trying to do this informally--not through an order, but \ninformally--to have one Member speak in favor of the amendment, one \nMember speak in opposition to the amendment, and go back and forth so \nthe debate will bear relevance to the issue. I hope that all Senators \nwill understand that and will work and cooperate with the two of us to \nmake that possible.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator. We will do that, except \nif the floor is vacant we will let whoever is here speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Whether in opposition or a proponent of the amendment. So \nwe will just work this out and work together. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I commend the chairman, the Senator from Utah, for all the hard work \nhe has done on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it was 2 years ago I rose as a freshman Member of this \nbody to express my strong support for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Federal budget. ``There is no question that Congress must \npass a balanced budget amendment and send it to the States for \nratification.'' That is what I said here on the Senate floor.\n  I thought that with the will of the American people behind us, at \nthat time we had every reason to be optimistic about its passage.\n  Well, here we are again, 2 years later, debating the same question we \ndebated in 1995. And I am here once again to call for the passage of \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  We have already heard many of the arguments in support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, and I will not use this opportunity to repeat them \nall. But let it simply be said that there are indeed many.\n  However, the release of the President's budget just this morning \nillustrates just how difficult it is to produce a balanced budget void \nof gimmicks and accounting tricks, and illustrates the very real need \nfor the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, this morning we got a first glimpse of the President's \nbudget for fiscal year 1998. After a quick review of this massive \ndocument, I must say my initial feeling has been mixed.\n  On the one hand, I am pleased that the President has agreed to many \nof our goals, such as a balanced budget by the year 2002, tax relief \nfor American families, and Medicare reform, and a strong national \ndefense.\n  On the other hand, I am very concerned about what I see as serious \nflaws included in the President's plan.\n  Let me begin my observations with the President's education \nproposals, which he described in his State of the Union Address as ``My \nNo. 1 priority for the next four years.''\n  The President proposes $51 billion for education spending next year. \nThat is an increase of 20 percent, rising to nearly $60 billion by the \nyear 2002, a 40-percent increase.\n  This includes $36 billion in tax incentives for education and \ntraining; $5 billion for school construction; $1.2 billion for a new \nreading program; and increased funding to connect schools to the \nInternet.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that there exists a strong correlation \nbetween education and steady economic growth.\n  Investing in the skills and abilities of the future U.S. work force \nwill enable us to achieve and maintain high levels of knowledge and \nproductivity in the workplace--helping to improve our standard of \nliving and ability to remain globally competitive.\n  However, the core question is not whether the Government should \ninvest in education, but how those taxpayer dollars should be spent--\nand, ultimately, whether more spending is the answer to our education \nproblems.\n  The United States has outspent every other G-7 country in education \nand leads in the attainment of secondary and university degrees. Our \ntotal government spending in all levels of education as a percentage of \nGDP has increased from 4.8 percent in 1985 to 5.1 percent in 1993--the \nhighest among the G-7 countries. Eighty-four percent of our population \nsuccessfully completes secondary education--once again, that is the \nhighest among the G-7 countries. Twenty-four percent of our population \nreceive a college or university diploma, a percentage more than twice \nthat of Germany, the United Kingdom and France. It is significantly \ngreater than that of Japan.\n  Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in education spending and \nhundreds of Federal programs, American students continue to perform \npoorly compared to students in other countries, particularly in terms \nof basic science and math skills. The science\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\nand math scores of our students are the lowest among Canada, France, \nItaly, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Korea. Our Scholastic Aptitude Test \nscores among college-bound students have barely increased over the last \ndecade, and remain below those scores attained in the 1960's and 70's.\n  We are spending more and achieving less. Clearly, this proves that \nspending more money on education is not the solution. If it were, the \nUnited States would have long been No. 1 in the world in attaining \nacademic success. Unfortunately, throwing more money at the problem \nappears to be this administration's only solution. The administration \nwould do well to look at my State of Minnesota, where a recent study \nconducted by the St. Paul Pioneer Press showed that the school \ndistricts with the highest per-student spending produced test scores \nthat were among the lowest.\n  The President's education plan fails miserably at addressing the real \nissues that face our Nation. This is unacceptable. We must dedicate \nourselves to improving our education system, but we must do it right.\n  First and foremost, in my view, an honest education budget should be \none that restores and revives our traditional values in American \neducation: It should ensure our current resources are used efficiently; \nit must have incentives built into Federal programs to reward students \nas well as teachers who improve their performance; it must focus on \nimproving basic science and math skills of our primary and secondary \nschool students; it must ensure a crime- and drug-free learning \nenvironment; it must ensure that taxpayer dollars are actually helping \neducate our youth.\n  Now let me turn to the President's tax proposals. I am pleased the \nPresident has acknowledged the tremendous good we accomplish by \nallowing working families to keep a little bit of their own money \nthrough the child tax credit. The President has moved one step closer \nto the $500 per-child tax credit my Republican colleagues and I have \nlong been advocating, and we welcome him on board. However, there still \nexists a big gap between his proposal and ours.\n  First of all, the President's child tax credit has too many \nlimitations. For instance, the President extends his tax credit only to \npreteen children, those under 13 years of age, taking away the tax \ncredit dollars just when families need them most. In the President's \nbudget, the tax credit begins at only a $300 per-child for the first 3 \nyears and is finally increased to $500 in the year 2000. Moreover, the \nPresident's plan begins phasing out the tax credit for families with a \ncombined income of $60,000, with more limited credits for families \nmaking as much as $75,000. Finally, the President's tax credit would \nnot be available unless deficit reduction targets are met.\n\n  Now these limitations greatly dilute the purpose of child tax relief. \nThe extensive debate we have undertaken in the past 2 years over fiscal \npolicy has helped us understand that working families are indeed \novertaxed. In fact, families today spend more on taxes than on food, \nclothing, and shelter combined. A $500 per child tax credit--without \nlimitation--is more appropriate and necessary to allow families to make \nmore of their own spending decisions.\n  As a long-time advocate for tax relief, I would prefer a zero capital \ngains tax on all investment incomes. While I do applaud the President's \nproposal to provide a capital gains tax cut for homeowners, his plan is \nreally just a small step forward. It is hard to justify the exemption \nof this type of investment gain from other investments, such as the \nindividual who chooses to live in a relatively modest home and invest \nin stocks and perhaps the formation of a small manufacturing company. \nWhy should those individuals be taxed more harshly than those who \ninvest in a personal residence?\n  In my view, a general cut in the capital gains tax must be provided \nto encourage savings, and to treat all investors equally. The current \ntax system discourages national savings and investment, which will \nadversely affect our long-term economic growth. Fundamental reform is \nneeded to change the system.\n  The President's budget includes tax cuts totaling $98.5 billion, with \nmost of it going toward the family tax credit, education tax subsidies, \nand expanded IRA's. However, the Clinton budget proposes new tax \nincreases targeted at airline passengers, small and large investors, \nand the Nation's job providers totaling some $76 billion. We can do the \nmath ourselves: The President's budget leaves a net tax cut of just \n$22.4 billion. I do not believe that is what the American people \nintended when they re-elected the President to a second term.\n  Another serious concern lies with the President's proposed new \nentitlement spending. If the President is serious about adding another \n$60 billion in new entitlement spending, he must show us why we need \nnew spending programs when we have yet to repair the ones we already \nhave.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I remain concerned about the economic \nassumptions the White House has relied upon in drafting its plan, which \nare significantly more optimistic than the projections of the \nCongressional Budget Office. The President's budget has not yet been \nscored by the CBO. Once it is, it may very well be $70 billion short of \nour deficit targets.\n  President Clinton came here to Capitol Hill just over one year ago \nand stood in the House Chamber to declare that, ``The era of big \ngovernment is over.'' I am afraid that sentiment is not reflected \nwithin the 2,418 pages of the President's budget. I had hoped for bold \nsteps from the President in addressing the very real need to control \nthe growth of the Federal Government. But what we received today were \nmore like baby steps, the first tentative wobbles of an infant. Under \nthe President's budget, Washington will actually spend 3.5 percent more \nin the next fiscal year than we are today. While the President's budget \nappears to reach balance in 2002, more than 60 percent of his deficit \nreduction are slated to come after he has left office. Leaving those \ntough decisions not to the Clinton White House, but the administration \nof the Nation's next Chief Executive.\n  Mr. President, I commend the President for the blueprint he has \nprepared for us, and I look forward to working with him and my \ncolleagues to improve on and implement these historic changes in our \nGovernment. In the administration's budget, we have before us a good \nfoundation on which to build that bridge to the 21st century the White \nHouse is so fond of speaking about. But without addressing some of the \nserious concerns I have outlined today, I am afraid that bridge may \ncollapse before we are able to cross it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nremarks in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of Senate \nJoint Resolution 15 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 2\n\n (Purpose: To allow waiver of the article in the event of an economic \n                recession or serious economic emergency)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2.\n       On page 3, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       ``The provisions of this article may be waived for any \n     fiscal year in which there is an economic recession or \n     serious economic emergency in the United States as declared \n     by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole \n     number of each House, which becomes law.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the chair of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for his cooperation in this effort. Though we may \nnot see eye to eye on this amendment or the underlying amendment to the \nConstitution, he has been gracious and gentlemanly throughout. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  I would also like to salute the Democratic leader from that same \ncommittee, the ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, for extending \nthe same courtesy, both personally and through his staff.\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\n  This is only the second time that I have taken the floor of the \nSenate to speak. And I consider it a high honor to follow the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. In the context of constitutional debate, I think we \nare all anxious to learn the views of the Senator from West Virginia \nbecause he reveres this Constitution, this great document, as much if \nnot more than any other Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  In the course of the last 14 years I have served in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I have cast about 7,000 votes. There were many \nimportant votes among them. The most important vote in my estimation \nwas when I was called on to vote and decide whether or not the United \nStates would go to war. I knew with that vote and the decision made by \nthis Congress that lives would be lost. Husbands, fathers, sons, \ndaughters, loved ones would put their lives at risk because of that \nvote. I do not think I cast a more important vote in my congressional \ncareer.\n  But immediately behind that vote I would have to put consideration of \nconstitutional amendments. It is so rare that we in this body or in the \nother body have an opportunity to address amending this great \nConstitution that I hope we will all take it with a great deal of \nseriousness. Since 1791, 205 years ago, we have chosen to amend this \ngreat document only 27 times. Of course, the first 10, the Bill of \nRights, were in that year, 1791. And each time an amendment has been \nsuggested we have tried to step back and measure it against this \nConstitution, this document, and to determine whether or not that \namendment or that suggestion really ranks with the importance of this \ngreat document.\n  This amendment that we are considering, the balanced budget \namendment, is one that has been debated at great length. And it has \nbeen debated by many people of both political parties for a long period \nof time.\n  I hope that every Member of the Senate will come to this debate as I \nhave with a new energy and a new determination to make certain that \nwhatever we do in accepting or rejecting this amendment that it will \nbear the test of history, that those who come after us will judge us as \nhaving been thoughtful and reflective in determining whether or not \nthis amendment belongs in this great document and whether this \namendment will stand the test of time.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that this balanced budget amendment \nas offered stands the test of time, and that is why I am offering an \namendment today to address what I consider to be a fundamental flaw in \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment that is before us today \ndoes not provide an adequate means for dealing with economic recessions \nor other serious economic emergencies that could unexpectedly throw the \nbudget out of balance or require a fiscal response. It would tip the \nbalance against working families and make it harder to help them \nrecover from a recession or other economic emergency. In times of \nrecession or economic slowdown it would force us to do exactly the \nwrong thing by making it more difficult for the Federal Government to \nrespond to adverse economic circumstances. In the case of a regional \neconomic downturn, or other economic emergency that fell short of a \nnational recession, it would leave us unable to respond unless a \nsupermajority of 60 percent or more agree to take action.\n  That is why I offer this amendment to allow Congress and the \nPresident to waive the requirement of a balanced budget in those times \nwhen our country is experiencing an economic recession or serious \neconomic emergency. I do not stand alone with this point of view. More \nthan 1,000 of the Nation's most respected economists recently joined \ntogether to condemn the proposed balanced budget amendment as unsound \nand unnecessary. And here are their words:\n\n       The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the \n     face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall \n     and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These \n     so-called ``built-in stabilizers'' limit declines of after-\n     tax income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced \n     every year would aggravate recessions.\n\n  The more than 1,000 economists who signed this statement include at \nleast 11 Nobel laureates and many present and former Government \nofficials, including the former chairman of President Nixon's Council \nof Economic Advisers, current and former Federal Reserve Board \nChairmen, and former Democrat and Republican Directors of the \nCongressional Budget Office. The group includes a friend of mine and a \nman I respect very much, Robert Eisner, professor at Northwestern \nUniversity in my home State of Illinois who has a solid grasp of the \neconomic ramifications of Government budget policies.\n  Most Members of this Senate, Democrat or Republican, would concede \nthat our economy has moved forward in the last 4 years. Some credit \nfiscal policy emanating from the President and Capitol Hill, and others \ncredit monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. I think it has taken \nboth efforts to put this economy on the right track.\n  During the course of his testimony before our Budget Committee the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, was asked point blank \nabout the balanced budget amendment. And in the Chairman's words he \nsaid he was ``opposed to putting detailed economic policy in our \nConstitution.'' This is a man who must on a day-to-day basis sit with \nhis staff and cohorts and determine the course of the American economy. \nHe is a man who is as dedicated to balancing the budget as any person \nin this Nation. He is someone who has made tough and difficult \ndecisions time and again to put this economy on track, and he has \ncautioned us that this is a mistake, a mistake for us to embody in this \nConstitution detailed economic policy, that we forswear the flexibility \nnecessary to make certain that this Government of, by, and for the \npeople can respond to the needs of the people in times of recession.\n  What these economists and Mr. Greenspan are warning us of is that the \nbalanced budget amendment if not changed will exacerbate the economic \nslowdowns we experience. It will put our Nation into an economic \nstraitjacket that will make it hard to respond to economic downturns.\n  Let us talk for a moment about the mechanisms that work in our \neconomy in times of recession. Tax receipts fall. Certain types of \nFederal spending increase. Consider the obvious, the plant closes in \nyour hometown where workers who have spent a lifetime showing up every \nday doing their job and paying their taxes end up out of work, perhaps \nfor the first time in their lives finding themselves drawing \nunemployment compensation from this Federal Government. Perhaps if \nthings go badly for a family for a longer period of time, they may be \ncalled on to apply for food stamps to make sure there is food on the \ntable, maybe even Medicaid to make sure there is hospitalization \nprotection for members of the family, and then of course trying to find \nanother job. They may need to call on the Government for job training \ncourses or education to prepare themselves for another career; another \nopportunity.\n  What I have just described is not radical. It is a natural outgrowth \nof a free market capitalist economy with business downturns and with \nthe vagaries of the business cycle leaving some families and some \nworkers needing help.\n  The fiscal changes I have described that take place when the \nGovernment steps in are described as economic stabilizers because they \nkick in automatically in times of unemployment and recession, and they \nhelp the economy recover, as they help individuals get back on their \nfeet. That is why Robert Greenstein from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities described the effect of the balanced budget amendment \nin this way in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       In years when growth is sluggish, revenues rise more slowly \n     while costs for programs like unemployment insurance \n     increase. As a result, the deficit widens. Under a balanced \n     budget amendment, more deficit reduction thus would be \n     required in periods of slow growth than in times of rapid \n     growth.\n       This is precisely the opposite--\n\n  The opposite, in his words--\n\n       of what should be done to stabilize the economy and avert \n     recessions. The constitutional amendment consequently risks \n     making recessions more frequent and deeper. In the period \n     from 1930 to 1933, for example, Congress repeatedly cut \n     Federal spending and raised taxes, trying to offset the \n     decline in revenues that occurred after the great crash of \n     1929. Yet those spending cuts and tax increases removed \n     purchasing power\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\n     from the economy and helped make the downturn deeper; they \n     occurred at exactly the wrong time in the business cycle.\n\n  In Dr. Greenstein's words:\n\n       This is why a balanced budget amendment requirement is \n     called ``pro-cyclical.'' It exacerbates the natural business \n     cycle of growth and recession. It also is why most economists \n     who favor tough deficit reduction measures strongly oppose a \n     constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin gave a similar warning when he \ntestified before our Judiciary Committee. He said as follows:\n\n       A balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to \n     unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity . . . A balanced \n     budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions, and \n     recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.\n\n  Mr. President, this would happen because the so-called automatic \nstabilizers in our economy that have been developed over the past 50 \nyears to reduce the extremes of the business cycle and help avoid \nanother Great Depression would remain inoperative by this proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I have a chart which I would like to bring up at this point.\n  This chart I think demonstrates graphically what I have described: \nWhat has happened in the business cycles of America from the year 1870 \nto 1990.\n  You will note that in our free market economy we have our ups and \ndowns, but note the changes that took place after World War II. It is \ntrue that those spikes below the line still occurred, but they were not \nas deep as they had been before. You look back to the Depression, the \nGreat Depression of 1929, you see the recession that we faced in the \nmid 1940's, but look at what happened afterwards. We have had our \ndownturns, but they have been moderate in comparison.\n  These are something more than mere statistics. These reflect \nAmericans working and out of work. They reflect businesses being forced \nto shut down. They reflect the misery that families feel when we go \ninto an economic downturn.\n  Now, what happened at this point that caused such a great change for \nthe 40 years reflected? We built into our economy certain ways to \nmoderate recessions. Those moderations or stabilizers are Government \nprograms involving Government expenditures. When our economy goes into \na downturn, tax receipts are diminished, the opportunity to balance the \nbudget is made more difficult, and we are called on at the same time to \nrespond and spend.\n  So as tax revenues are going down, calls for expenditures to \nstabilize the economy go up. That is a recipe for an unbalanced budget. \nBut it is also a recipe for stabilizing an economy, for ending a \nrecession, for bringing people back to work, for giving small \nbusinesses a chance to survive, to say to family farmers it was a bad \nyear but next year can be better; we are going to help you through \nthis.\n\n  If we accept what this balanced budget amendment offers, it will \nbecome increasingly difficult for us to use the stabilizers that have \nkept America at work, have kept families together, have kept small \nbusinesses in business and family farmers on the farm.\n  That is what is at stake in this debate. The reason I have offered \nthis amendment is to suggest that there is a more reasonable way to \napproach this. If those who support the balanced budget amendment want \nto make certain that this Congress goes on the record to make certain \nthat we go on the record with a record vote and be held accountable \nwhen we do not balance the budget, my amendment requires that as well, \nbut it does not require a supermajority.\n  In response to the claim by some that Congress could still easily \nrespond to economic recessions with the balanced budget amendment, \nSecretary Rubin added the following comments:\n\n       You recognize recessions quite a bit after they have \n     started. Predicting economic circumstances is well nigh \n     impossible, in my judgment, at least with any degree of \n     reliability. And under those circumstances you can be well \n     into an economic downturn before you realize you have to deal \n     with it, and--\n\n  In Secretary Rubin's words--\n\n       I think that is one of the very serious problems that the \n     balanced budget amendment creates.\n\n  Why does it take time for us to recognize these recessions? The \ngeneral working definition of a recession is that it is at least two \nconsecutive quarters--a quarter being a 3-month period of time--of \ndecline in real gross domestic product. It obviously takes 6 months to \ntrigger this definition. So sometimes we have started into a recession \nmoving below the line here, unemployment starting to show up and we do \nnot see it. It is hidden to us until 3 months or 6 months later.\n  The more technical definition of recession also includes inherent \nlags. We have found that the decline in economic activity associated \nwith a recession is not always widespread. Oftentimes it is confined to \na sector of the economy or region of the country. We also find that \nsometimes these declines are cumulative in nature, not restricted to \njust 1 month or 1 quarter. Again, it takes time to measure these \ncriteria.\n  So, as a general principle, what Secretary Rubin has said to us is we \nmay not know we need to help until we are in the middle of our problem. \nThere is a lag time, to accumulate and analyze data and recognize the \ndecline that may have already started.\n  So how often do we face these recessions? Are they rare occurrences \nin the American economy? We have been blessed in recent years, but \nhistorically recessions occur very frequently. By the National Bureau \nof Economic Research's official determination, our Nation has \nexperienced 9 recessions since World War II, 11 since the Great \nDepression of 1929 to 1933, and 21 recessions this century, which means \nthat roughly every 5 years we will face this recession.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not assume that this is going to \nhappen. It assumes it will not happen. And if Congress is going to \nrespond to this occurrence, which we know has been fairly regular, it \nrequires a supermajority for us to spend the money to stabilize the \neconomy.\n  In part because of the economic stabilizers that are now part of our \neconomy, the average length of recession since World War II has only \nbeen 11 months compared to 18 months in the previous half century.\n  A recession is not just an abstract economic concept. It is lost \njobs, lost wages, personal and family financial crises.\n  The Federal Government has developed many mechanisms to deal with it. \nI have mentioned a few: Unemployment compensation, Medicaid \napplications, food stamps and so forth.\n  Let me tell you a story that I think illustrates this as well as any \nthat I could tell you on the floor of the Senate. In my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, we were blessed for decades with manufacturing plants \nwhich created good jobs, good-paying jobs for men and women who would \ncome to work with a strong back, a good work ethic, and usually little \nmore than a high school diploma. One of those plants was known as the \nFiat-Allis plant. It was a plant organized by the United Auto Workers, \nproducing heavy equipment and producing great jobs for a lot of \nfamilies and a great boost to the Springfield economy.\n  Over a decade ago that plant closed, and hundreds of workers who had \nrelied on this plant were thrown out on the street. You can repeat the \nexample and story I am about to describe in virtually every city in \nAmerica. This happens all too frequently. Let me tell you about one \nfriend of mine who had worked at Fiat-Allis for years. His name is Bob \nBergen.\n  Bob saw it coming. He had heard a lot of talk about the plant closing \ndown. So Bob decided that he would do something about it. He went to \nthe community college before the plant closed down and started taking \ncourses in heating and cooling, thinking about opening his own \nbusiness, furnaces and air conditioners and the like. So, when the \nplant did close down, Bob had a short transition, but one that he \nplanned, drawing some unemployment, some trade adjustment assistance, \nfinishing up his course work at Lincoln Land Community College, and \nultimately opening his own business.\n  It worked. Our investment in Bob Bergen and his family paid off. We \ncushioned the shock of unemployment. We gave Bob an avenue to follow \ntoward a new course of livelihood, and he took it. Now he is in \nbusiness. In fact, he put the furnace in my home just a few years ago \nand does a pretty good\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\njob now, and I am glad to call him a friend. His life and experience \nare illustrations of what I am talking about.\n  Imagine a recession closing down plants across this country and \nimagine this Congress, faced with the need to balance the budget to the \ndollar, being unable to provide unemployment compensation that Bob \nBergen needed; being unable to provide the trade adjustment assistance \nthat Bob Bergen used to keep his family together while he got his \nbusiness started; being unable to provide job training, the scholarship \nassistance at community college, the things which people rely on in \nAmerica to get back on track. If we are hidebound, tied to the \nprovisions of this balanced budget amendment, and forget the Bob \nBergens of the world and what it means to them, I think we have lost \nsight of our responsibility.\n  How much of a difference do these economic stabilizers make to our \neconomy? Secretary Rubin testified, if you want to look at this in a \nlarger context, ``Without automatic stabilizers, the Treasury \nDepartment has estimated that unemployment in 1992 that resulted from \nthe 1990 recession might have hit 9 percent instead of 7.7 percent.'' \nStatistics aside, Secretary Rubin tells us that would have meant 1 \nmillion more Americans out of work. We would have had 1 million more \nunemployed Americans, 1 million more families pushed to the economic \nprecipice if our economic stabilizers had not been there.\n  These recessions also tend to be regional in nature. Proponents of \nthe underlying balanced budget amendment argue that it contains an \nescape hatch that allows a waiver of its provisions by a supermajority \nvote of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress. But mustering a three-\nfifths vote is not always an easy matter. Millions of working families \nin America might have to suffer if we cannot come up with 60 percent on \na vote to waive the balanced budget requirements in times of recession.\n  I recall, and I think most do as well, what happened not that long \nago, in fact, just 2 years ago, when we were called upon in Congress to \npass a debt limit, a debt limit which said we put our full faith and \ncredit as a government behind the debt of the United States. It took \nonly a majority vote to do that, and we could not bring it together. As \na consequence, we faced some of the most serious shutdowns in our \nNation's history. The Government shutdowns that occurred, two \nsuccessive shutdowns, literally sent thousands of Federal workers off \nthe job. The Government shut down not once but twice, a total of 27 \ndays. The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the \noverall cost of the shutdowns was more than $1.4 billion. America knew \nit. More than 750,000 Federal workers were affected, some during the \nChristmas and Hanukkah season, including more than 250,000 who were \nfurloughed.\n\n  During that period of the Government shutdown, 170,000 veterans did \nnot receive their GI bill education benefits on time, 200,000 passports \nwere not processed, more than 2 million people could not visit the \nSmithsonian museums and other facilities in the Washington area, and 7 \nmillion people could not visit their national parks. Mr. President, \n1,300 workplace safety complaints went unanswered and 3,500 \ninvestigations involving pension, health, and other employee benefit \nplans were suspended. Delays were created in 250,000 cases trying to \nfind deadbeat dads who were delinquent in their child support payments, \nand cleanup of hundreds of Superfund sites was delayed. All of this \nhappened because we could not muster a majority, a majority vote, let \nalone a supermajority.\n  This balanced budget amendment will enshrine in our Constitution the \nrequirement of a three-fifths vote in times of an economic recession to \ncome to the rescue of American families. For those who think this is an \neasy requirement, it is rare in our Constitution to have any \nsupermajority requirement and it certainly should not be imposed on \npeople who, through no fault of their own, are victims of this economy.\n  My amendment brings the supermajority requirement of three-fifths \ndown to a majority requirement. I think that is reasonable. It is still \nnot going to be easy. Each and every person, whether a Member of the \nHouse or the Senate, must stand and justify that vote in terms of a \nrecession, a national economic emergency, something that justifies \nslipping away from the balanced budget requirement that year.\n  I think we have to maintain flexibility to respond to recessions, \ndisasters, and other economic emergencies in a timely fashion. I do not \nthink we have to say, ``I'm sorry, Mr. Bergen, I am sorry you have been \nlaid off, but because of the balanced budget amendment, we are not \ngoing to be able to make the payments to you for your unemployment \nbecause we just have to balance the budget. We cannot help you when it \ncomes to food stamps, we have run out of money. We cannot help your \nfamily when it comes to job training or Medicaid.''\n  Think about that for a second. Is that fair to people we represent? \nIs that fair to this economy? Will it, in fact, result in these spikes \ngoing lower instead of moderating, as we have seen, as these \nstabilizers have been put in place? That, unfortunately, might be the \nverdict for Bob Bergen and others like him if this supermajority \nrequirement allows 41 Senators or 175 Representatives to prevent a \nresponse that involves deficit spending.\n  Our Founding Fathers established only a few circumstances where \nsupermajorities would be necessary for Federal action. We should not \nadopt a new supermajority requirement that prevents us from helping our \nmost vulnerable and neediest citizens in times of recession or other \nserious economic emergencies.\n  For all these reasons, I am offering an amendment to allow Congress \nto waive the requirements of the balanced budget amendment by a \nmajority vote for a joint resolution in times of recession or serious \neconomic emergency. My amendment will ensure that Congress can continue \nto respond to recessions and other serious economic emergencies with \nfiscal policies that will alleviate the pain of recession and shorten \nits duration rather than driving us deeper into economic stagnation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced \nbudget amendment. I think it is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will be debating in this body, in this Congress. I might \nadd, I appreciate the preceding Senator, Senator Durbin, acknowledging, \nas he presented his amendment to the balanced budget amendment, his \noverall opposition to the underlying amendment to the Constitution. We \nare going to, I suspect, hear many amendments--several amendments at \nleast--offered in the coming weeks, with the primary goal of ultimately \ndefeating the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  As I said, I believe this is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we are going to debate. The opponents of a balanced budget \namendment argue that to compel Congress to balance the budget will \nforever damage and eliminate the ability to provide our seniors with \nthe protection they have earned. Their plan--and we will be hearing \nmore of it; we have already heard quite a lot--to exempt Social \nSecurity is nothing more than a risky gimmick. I say again it is a \nrisky gimmick to put such an exclusion onto the balanced budget \namendment. Their arguments are aimed at scaring the most vulnerable \nsegments of our population.\n  In the last 2 years, in my experience in the House of Representatives \nand as I observe the deliberations in the U.S. Senate, we have seen a \ngreat deal of those efforts to scare those who are most vulnerable in \nour society. So I suppose it is not that unusual, as we enter a debate \non the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, to hear those who \nwould frighten and those who would scare the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. They assert Social Security checks will be withheld because \nthere will be no money left in the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nArkansas Democrat Gazette be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\n           [From the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Feb. 5, 1997]\n\n                   Budgetscare: How To Debase a Cause\n\n       Bill Clinton doubtless wants to defeat the Balanced Budget \n     amendment in the worst way which is just how he's going about \n     it--by scaring old folks again. Yep, once more he's saying a \n     proposed reform will put Social Security--Social Security!--\n     at ``grave risk.''\n       Now when have we heard that before? Only every time \n     somebody tries to get the federal government to put its \n     fiscal house in order. By now the clintonoids have made this \n     simple scare campaign a fine art First, scare the seniors; \n     then scare `em some more; then leave 'em petrified. And \n     never, ever let the facts get in the way.\n       Despite its name, the Balanced Budget amendment would not \n     keep Congress from passing an unbalanced budget. Instead, it \n     just puts a slightly larger hurdle in the way. It would \n     require a three-fifths vote of both houses of Congress to run \n     a deficit. It's not an insuperable obstacle; most \n     controversial business in the Senate already required a \n     three-fifths vote--because that's what it takes to prevent a \n     filibuster.\n       But here comes the president, warning that ``disbursement \n     of Social Security checks could cease or unelected judges \n     could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional \n     amendment.''\n       Not very likely. Not very likely at all. The chances of \n     Social Security checks being sequestered fall into the same \n     range of probability as the Loch Ness monster posing for \n     photographs. Both possibilities are great for scaring folks, \n     but for little else.\n       Social Security is an entitlement written into law, it is \n     not dependent on annual appropriations by Congress. It's \n     recipients paid into the program, they're entitled to their \n     checks--even if Congress doesn't approve a budget. It's \n     automatic.\n       The federal government would have to go broke before one of \n     those unelected judges the president uses as a bogeyman would \n     have to decide what creditors got paid first. And recipients \n     of Social Security would stand at the head of the line \n     because their benefits are part of a separate law. Behind \n     them would come all of the programs that are covered by \n     annual appropriations--everything from education to the \n     federal courts, from the Smithsonian to the space shuttle, \n     and the multitude of grants for essentials like battery-\n     operated grocery carts and solar powered cars.\n       All told, spending for these appropriated programs amounts \n     to five times the size of last year's deficit, meaning that \n     the government's default would have to be of Depression-\n     sized proportions before Social Security might be \n     threatened. And even then such a dramatic catastrophe \n     isn't likely. Because this amendment has more escape \n     hatches than an old-time movie serial.\n       The president knows the process. He has to know that Social \n     Security isn't in the imminent danger he's conjured up. Once \n     again he is playing to the darkest fears of the most \n     vulnerable citizens in order to achieve a partisan end. Why, \n     with all the arguments available to him, is Bill Clinton \n     invariably attracted to the lowest common one? Some days it's \n     as if he'll do anything but raise the level of public \n     discourse.\n       A mere citizen can still yearn for a leader who, acting on \n     principle, takes an unpopular stand without resorting to \n     demagoguery. To make his case, such a leader would not paint \n     a doomsday scenario of little old ladies starving in the \n     cold, but would rely on reason supported by fact and informed \n     by sober judgment.\n       About that misnamed Balanced Budget Amendment, he would say \n     it would unnecessarily clutter the Constitution we all \n     revere. He would explain that such an amendment would create \n     an even more unwieldy process in a Congress already prone to \n     procedural knots. Perhaps he would contend that the proposal \n     for a super-majority is undemocratic. Or he could argue that \n     while America is not a strict democracy, its citizens are \n     loathe to depart from majority rule without a pretty darned \n     good reason.\n       But these are all arguments that, unlike the usual scare \n     tactics, would have to be patiently explained in order to \n     carry the day. They would compliment the intelligence of the \n     American people, not insult it. It's so much easier to \n     proclaim that Social Security and the sky are falling. So, \n     once again, William Jefferson Clinton has chosen to frighten \n     any older citizens he can.\n       The result: Our president and head of state, an official \n     who should be most responsible of all, introduces still more \n     mistrust into a political system already overburdened with \n     it. He encourages suspicion and cynicism--always corrosive \n     agents in a system that relies on consent and understanding. \n     In doing so, he tears at the fabric of the very constitution \n     he claims to be defending.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, a part of that editorial says this:\n\n       The chances of Social Security checks being sequestered \n     fall into the same range of probability as the Loch Ness \n     monster posing for photographs. Both possibilities are great \n     for scaring folks, but for little else.\n\n  I believe that is very, very true. Again, nothing could be a more \nrisky gimmick to be put onto the balanced budget amendment than to \nexclude Social Security from the provisions of the amendment. It is \nattempting to replace the truth with fear.\n  The plain truth is that the President does not have the power to \nwithhold appropriations, such as Social Security. Only Congress can \ngive him that power. It is our responsibility to appropriate the funds \nnecessary to carry out the domestic and the foreign policy programs of \nthis Nation. In reality, the balanced budget amendment will ensure that \nmoney is there to spend.\n  Today, annual deficits and the national debt are the greatest threat \nto Social Security's existence. If we talk about the threat to the \nfuture of Social Security, let us not forget that the greatest threat \nis continued chronic deficits and an unwillingness or a lack of \ndiscipline and a lack of will on the part of the politicians of this \ncountry to bring our books into balance.\n  I believe this very vivid depiction of having 28 budget books stacked \non top of each other is very clear evidence that the notion--as the \nPresident put it in the State of the Union Address--that we can just do \nit, we pass it and he will sign it, we will balance the books, will not \nhappen, as we see with 28 budgets before us. It has to stretch the \ncredibility of not only the executive branch but a Congress that is \nmore inclined to continue spending on ever-expanding entitlement \nprograms.\n  Since the 1930's, literally dozens of proposals have been made to \nrequire a balanced budget to limit the size or the growth of the \nFederal budget or public debt, or some combination of these ideas, \nincluding several very notable recent efforts in 1990 and, again, in \n1993. These have come in the form of bills, statutory efforts, and \nproposed constitutional amendments. An average, Mr. President, of more \nthan 30 measures per Congress have been introduced in recent years.\n  I believe one reason that we have seen such statutory efforts and so \nmany offers of various constitutional amendments is because many of \nthose who occupy the Halls of Congress today, both at the other end of \nthe Capitol in the House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate, \nonce served in State legislatures where they have the yearly annual \nexperience of seeing their State budgets balanced. They came from State \nlegislatures where there were constitutional provisions that required \nthem to balance their budget, and they saw year after year after year \nthat it could be done.\n  So when they came to Washington, they came with a determination, they \ncame with a deliberation that we would have, in fact, that same \nprovision embodied in the U.S. Constitution. But it has been \nfrustrating. Year after year and time after time, we have seen those \nefforts defeated.\n  The opponents of a balanced budget amendment, I believe, are pursuing \na campaign of deliberate disinformation. There has been and will \ncontinue to be an effort to distract and to divert the attention of the \nAmerican people from the real issues that are at stake in the debate \nover a balanced budget and over a balanced budget amendment. The \nopponents would distract and divert the American people from the real \nthreat to Social Security, which is chronic deficits and enormous \naccumulated debt. They would like the debate over the coming weeks to \nbe about Social Security, but the debate is not about Social Security. \nThe debate is about the chronic deficits that threaten the future \neconomic stability of this Government and our economy in years to come. \nThat's what it is about.\n  If you care about Social Security, you should care about a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, because that is the best way of \nensuring fiscal sanity being restored to our budget process. Without a \ncredible, sustainable balanced budget, we will never have the money to \npay out future benefits. It is just that simple. A balanced budget \namendment needs economic prosperity that will produce revenues \nnecessary to fund the program. With a balanced budget, the big spenders \nin Washington will not be able to target and, therefore, raid Social \nSecurity to pay for other programs.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment will throw out, I think, \nany diversion to confuse the issue. They will use scare tactics. The \ntruth is that excluding Social Security does nothing to secure benefits \ninto the future. The President's own budget counts these surpluses to \nachieve his balance.\n  What if Social Security is excluded? Social Security will not be \nprotected,\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nbut between the years of 2002 and 2007, the deficit will appear $700 \nbillion larger. That means either a mammoth tax hike on American \nfamilies, almost $1,100 per year per household, or devastating cuts in \nimportant programs like Medicare, cancer research, Head Start, and \nenvironmental cleanup.\n  In the years since 1960, the budget has been balanced only once. \nDeficit spending during that period has increased the official national \ndebt from less than $284 billion to over $5 trillion, and the 28 budget \nbooks that are stacked right over here give vivid evidence of that \nfailure of Congress to discipline its spending habits.\n\n  Interest payments on the debt now consume about $240 billion \nannually; $240 billion annually just on interest to service the \nnational debt. The $240 billion that we are spending in interest \npayments is larger than the combined budgets of the Departments of \nCommerce, Agriculture, Education, Energy, Justice, Interior, Housing \nand Urban Development, Labor, State, and Transportation.\n  I suggest that if we have a commitment to education, then we ought to \nhave a commitment to a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to \nensure that these exploding interest payments will finally be reined \nin. In the future, the debt problem will only get worse. The \nGovernment's current debt calculation fails to include the 10 to 20 \ntrillion dollars worth of unfunded liabilities. These are promises to \npay future benefits like Social Security, Medicare, Government employee \nretirement and other programs. In short, we will soon long for the days \nof $200 billion deficits unless something is done, and that something \nshould be the balanced budget amendment.\n  When you exclude Social Security, you derail the very purpose of the \namendment. I was interested, as I listened to the deliberations of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee earlier this week on the balanced budget \namendment, in the testimony of a former Congressman, my former \ncolleague, Tim Penny. He referred to this gimmick of taking Social \nSecurity off budget and out of the unified budget as being the greatest \nmoney-laundering scheme in history, because future creative Congresses \nwill find it not too difficult to begin to shift programs into the \nSocial Security trust fund so as to circumvent the purpose and the goal \nand the intent of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It \nis a loophole so large, not only can a truck drive through it, but tons \nand tons of red ink can flow through it.\n  Finally, the goal of such an amendment is to defeat the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  As I said, I am glad that Senator Durbin acknowledged his underlying \nopposition to an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced \nbudget altogether. So while he offers this amendment to the BBA, he \nstill opposes the concept of an amendment requiring a balanced budget.\n  Secretary Rubin--who was quoted earlier this afternoon--Secretary \nRubin, when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee, was \nasked by my brother, Congressman Hutchinson, whether there was any \nbalanced budget amendment that he could envision that he would be able \nto support? In other words, if you went ahead and excluded Social \nSecurity, or if you put in a recession provision, or if there were some \nother addition to a balanced budget amendment, was there any such \namendment that Secretary Rubin or the administration could support? And \nwhen finally pressed, Secretary Rubin said no. He said he could not \nenvision any amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget \nin any form that the administration would support.\n  I think that really tells the story, that while there will be efforts \nto divert attention, while there will be efforts to distract the \nattention of the American people, all of the amendments that are \noffered are in the end ultimately being offered with the goal of \ndefeating this very, very important amendment to the Constitution.\n  I want to put a human face on the balanced budget amendment. We can \noften become too consumed with who has political advantage in policy \ndebates that we forget who sent us here and how it often affects them. \nLet me tell you about one of my constituents. Bob Boyd, a small \nbusiness owner in Little Rock, is the kind of person who can speak to \nthe importance, I think, of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. Boyd was a delegate to the White House Conference on Small \nBusiness. During that time, he and the conference made several \nrecommendations to President Clinton. The one proposal which received \nthe most votes, more than any other policy recommendation by the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business, was for the adoption of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, that proposal has \nonly collected dust at the White House. But this was from the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business, the recommendation that received \nthe most support.\n  When asked why so many of the conference voted on this proposal and \nvoted for this proposal, Bob simply says:\n\n       . . . as a small business owner, we know the importance of \n     the bottom line and [the] government doesn't, they have lost \n     the principle of being responsible for their debts.\n\n  Bob said that the President told them ``that small business is the \nengine that drives our economy.'' Unfortunately for Bob, and for all \nthe small businesses in Arkansas and America, the national debt, and \nthe taxes it needs to pay for it, are taking up all the fuel.\n  I strongly believe that ratification of a constitutional amendment is \nthe only way to turn around this unending sea of financial debt. It is \ntime to put the harness of the U.S. Constitution on Congress and the \nPresident. It is time to require these institutions to be more fiscally \nresponsible than our predecessors have been.\n  I would just say again, as I conclude, Mr. President, that there is a \nfundamental immorality that goes along with chronic deficit spending. \nFor decades and for generations of our history as a Nation, a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget was not necessary \nbecause there was an inherent fundamental belief on the part not only \nof our policymakers and our politicians but the people of the United \nStates as a whole that spending more than you take in, whether it is \nyour family budget or whether it is the Federal budget, is simply \nwrong. To transfer our spending in the form of debt to our children and \nto our grandchildren, for them to assume through higher taxes and \nthrough a lower standard of living, is simply wrong.\n  The intrinsic value, though, of the balanced budget amendment rests \non a simple point--it affects every American. It will affect how and \nwhere we spend taxpayers' dollars. It will affect the process by which \nthose decisions are made. Moreover, it will affect the real value we \nplace on the taxpayers' money, when we are restricted in the ways we \nspend it.\n\n  The time has come for Government to learn how to work with less, how \nto see the citizen's money as being precious, and to permanently reduce \nits size so that its people's wealth can expand. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I just want to take a second here and thank \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas for his remarks that he has \nmade. I do not know when I have been more impressed with a group of new \nSenators than I have now, unless it was the last time when we brought \nthe balanced budget amendment up and lost by one vote, when all of the \nnew Senators spoke together on the last one. I was just really \nimpressed with that. And these Senators this year have been doing very \nwell. I appreciate the Senator coming to the floor and making these \ncogent remarks. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Arkansas is still on \nthe floor--and while I indicate a different view than his on the \namendment, I, too, join the chairman in complimenting him and the other \nnew Senators who have spoken. When you think back to what your first \nspeech was, it is nice to know it was on a major issue. So I compliment \nhim for that.\n  Mr. President, I would note though that it is an important issue. \nThat is why we should take it as serious as possible. We talked about \namendments.\n  Senator Durbin, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, has also \nspoken,\n\n[[Page S1089]]\n\nin one of his first speeches on the floor of the Senate, as eloquently \nand as completely and as logically and cogently as he used to speak in \nthe other body. The Senator from Illinois has spoken of an amendment \nthat he has offered. While we will not vote on it today, we will \neventually vote on it to the balanced budget amendment. He also \nexpressed his concern about the underlying amendment.\n  There is nothing inconsistent with saying that one does not want to \namend the Constitution of the United States on this issue but will \npropose an amendment to the constitutional amendment as presented by \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah and others. I think there is \nnothing inconsistent with this because all of us have a responsibility, \nhowever we vote, to try to make what is the final product as good as \npossible.\n  All Senators know that there are issues that come to this floor where \nwe may have made up our mind how we would vote on the underlying piece \nof legislation, either for or against it, but yet we will be involved \nin numerous amendments before we get there.\n  I have voted against amendments on a bill when I finally voted for \nthe final bill and vice versa. I have had legislation of my own that I \nhave sponsored and have then supported amendments to my own \nlegislation, amendments offered either by myself or other Senators. I \nhave supported amendments to my own legislation offered by Senators \nfrom the other side of the aisle on major pieces of legislation on \nnumerous occasions because while I thought I had brought a good piece \nof legislation to the floor of the Senate, other Senators brought up \namendments that I realized, in listening to the debate, made that \nlegislation even better.\n  I can think of various times during the years when I was chairman of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, when I would have a farm bill, a \nmajor piece of nutrition legislation, and others on the floor--\nlegislation that I had been the principal author of--and Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats, had come up \nwith amendments which, after listening to them, I felt that they made \nthe underlying piece of legislation better and voted for them.\n  I can think of a couple instances when I have had legislation on the \nfloor where Senators have been very candid and told me they would not \nvote for my piece of legislation, but on the possibility it might pass \nthey had an amendment which at least in their thought would make it \nbetter. It is a very legitimate thing to do. We debated those \namendments. Some were accepted, some were not.\n  The underlying amendment, the underlying proposed constitutional \namendment, is unsound economic policy and should be rejected for that \nreason. But you also go on the assumption that any piece of legislation \nmay pass. It is the responsibility of each of us to offer suggestions, \nif we have them, of how it may be improved. Senator Durbin's amendment \nto waive this article in the event of an economic recession or serious \neconomic emergency is right on point, and it does improve the \nlegislation.\n\n  One should listen in that regard to the economic experts. More than \n1,000 of the Nation's most respected economists, including at least 11 \nNobel laureates, as well as a former chair of President Nixon's Council \nof Economic Advisers, the current and former Federal Reserve Board \nChairman, former Democrat and Republican Directors of the Congressional \nBudget Office, all agree this amendment is unsound economic policy.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from the State of West Virginia [Mr. \nByrd] held a news conference in which he released the signatures of \nmore than 1,000 economists and had a number of economists, Professor \nTobin and others, who pointed out why they felt this proposed \nconstitutional amendment was bad economic policy. These economists, \nincidentally, were across the political spectrum. They all agreed that \nthe proposed amendment would hamper the Government's ability to cope \nwith economic downturns.\n  Economists and financial experts agree that this proposed balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment will straitjacket the economy in hard \ntimes. It will hamstring the adjustment mechanisms that have been \ndeveloped since the Great Depression to preserve jobs and restore the \neconomy after a downturn.\n  Being opposed to the constitutional amendment is an entirely \ndifferent thing than being opposed to a balanced budget. This Congress, \nunder very strong leadership from President Clinton, has brought the \ndeficit down 4 years in a row and is now going to go for the fifth year \nin a row. Certainly since I have been old enough to vote, no President, \nRepublican or Democrat, has done that before. The deficit is coming \ndown.\n  Were it not for the fact that we were now paying almost half billion \ndollars a day in interest on the deficits run up in President Reagan \nand Bush's budgets, we would not even have a deficit today. We would \nhave a surplus, and we could start applying that surplus to the \nnational debt.\n  I urge Senators to understand that people like the Senator from \nVermont and others who have cast very, very difficult votes, \npolitically unpopular votes to cut programs, to cut spending, to bring \ndown the deficit, do not need to be shown a constitutional amendment \nthat some day in the next century, the next millennium, it might have \nsome effect. We can vote right now. As President Clinton said in his \nState of the Union Message, all it takes is our vote and his signature \nto bring down any deficit. We can do it now rather than saying, well, \nsometime in the next millennium, the year 2000-something, maybe there \nwill be this untried amendment to the Constitution, only the 18th \namendment to the Constitution since the Bill of Rights. Instead, we \nshould have the courage to vote to bring the deficit down now.\n  Some of us in this Congress and the House and Senate have had the \ncourage for 4 years in a row to cast those votes to bring down the \ndeficit. I wish we were not paying that half billion dollars a day in \ninterest from the doubling and tripling of the national debt during the \n1980's. But to President Clinton's credit and the credit of those men \nand women who have voted with him to bring down the deficit, it is \ncoming down.\n  Let us think about the flexibility you do need in difficult times. \nPresident Herbert Hoover, who was a great engineer and had many \nwonderful characteristics, but not a sense of the economy, felt during \nan early recession in his term that the most important thing he could \ndo to bring about some confidence in this country was to take whatever \nsteps necessary to have a balanced budget--basically taking the steps \nthat would be required by this constitutional amendment. By doing that, \nit plunged this country into the worst depression it has known in its \n200-year history.\n  If the economy today takes a downturn and Americans are losing their \njobs as happened in the early 1990's, then this proposed constitutional \namendment makes it more difficult for our Government to respond to the \nneeds of working families.\n\n  As Treasury Secretary Rubin, a man who has proven by his own life \nthat he understands the economy and economics, testified before the \nJudiciary Committee--and, incidentally, without any expert refuting \nwhat he said--Secretary Rubin said he thought ``a balanced budget \namendment would subject the Nation to unacceptable economic risk in \nperpetuity. * * * A balanced budget amendment could turn slowdowns into \nrecessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even \ndepressions.''\n  To date, no competent, recognized expert has come forward and refuted \nwhat Secretary Rubin said. Thus, the 1,060 economists and 11 Nobel \nlaureates who are opposing the proposed constitutional amendment \ncondemn it because the amendment ``mandates perverse actions in the \nface of recessions.''\n  I am deeply concerned about the impact the balanced budget amendment \nwill have on jobs for working families in Vermont and across the \ncountry during times of recession. If I put a human face on it, I put a \nhuman face of 560,000 Vermonters. We are a fiscally conservative State. \nWe find when we sell bonds from Vermont, they sell out virtually \nimmediately because people know how we feel about keeping our books. We \ndo not have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the \nVermont State Constitution. What\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\nwe have are 180 Vermont legislators who treat every tax dollar as \nthough it were their own. Governors, Republicans and Democrats, felt \nthe same, who realized, however, at such time as Vermont, a small \nState, has gone into a recession, there are times it has had to spend \nsome money to help us out of it as a responsibility to the people of \nVermont.\n  I hate to think what might happen if we go into a deep recession and \npeople are being laid off from jobs and are told, ``Well, we cannot \nhelp out.'' There are none of the programs we normally see to ease \nrecessions and get our economy going again. I realize it is 25 below \nzero in Vermont. I realize you have just been laid off from a job you \nhave had for 15 years, but the various Federal programs that we started \nafter the Great Depression cannot be funded.\n  As Secretary Rubin explained, the so-called automatic stabilizers in \nour economy would be ineffective under this proposed constitutional \namendment. These are mechanisms that have been developed over the last \n50 years to reduce the extremes of the boom-and-bust cycles. They are \nintended to prevent another Great Depression. They have proven \neffective over time.\n  Secretary Rubin testified:\n\n       ``[W]ithout automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department \n     has estimated unemployment in 1992 that resulted from the \n     1990 recession might have hit 9 percent instead of 7.7 \n     percent, which would have been in excess of 1 million jobs \n     lost.''\n\n  Some of these things that helped, when I think about 1988 and 1992, \nwe were adding around 40,000 people a week to the food stamp rolls to \nhelp bring us back. In the last 4 years, we have been taking millions \nback off the food stamp rolls. It shows it can work.\n  The preamble to the Constitution and its stated purpose to ``promote \nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves \nand our posterity,'' ought not be overridden by a constitutional \namendment that denies jobs to hundreds of thousands of working families \nin hard times.\n  People talk about the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan reiterated his opposition to the proposed constitutional \namendment during questioning by Senator Lautenberg during his testimony \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan \nurged the Senate Budget Committee to continue to eliminate the deficit. \nHe did join Secretary Rubin and our Nation's leading economists in the \nconclusion that this proposed constitutional amendment places too many \nconstraints on our economy.\n  This so-called escape hatch allowing a waiver of its provisions by a \nsupermajority vote of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress is small \ncomfort to America's working families, because many national recessions \nstart out in different regions of the country. For example, the most \nrecent recession hit New England first.\n  What if citizens of New England, who have fewer Members of the House \nof Representatives than other regions of the country, needed help? Or, \nconversely, what if a very populous region of the country suddenly had \na recession? Do they become the only ones who can get help? Could New \nEngland get Senators and Representatives from other States, which are \nstill experiencing good times, to waive the constitutional balanced \nbudget requirement to help protect their livelihoods?\n  Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, a past president of \nthe American Economic Association, understood the economic problems \nunder this proposed constitutional amendment when he wrote:\n\n       One need only recall the near collapses, in recent years, \n     of the economies in New England, California, and Texas. Who \n     would bail them out if their own tax revenues again decline \n     and there were surges of claims for unemployment benefits, \n     food stamps, and general assistance?\n\n  One of the reasons for having this great Nation of 50 States is so \nthat we can work together to help each other, knowing that if a tornado \nhits one part of the country and not others, or a recession hits one \nregion and not others, relief would be available. Relief for economic \nrecessions and emergencies has to be flexible. None of us can predict, \nand certainly cannot write into a constitutional amendment, when the \nnext natural disaster will hit or the next recession will take place, \nbecause usually a swift response from the Federal Government is needed \nto aid State and local relief efforts. Economic emergency relief by \nconstitutional supermajority mandate is a prescription for gridlock, \nnot swift action.\n  It would make no sense--if there is a terrible earthquake in \nCalifornia, or awful flooding in the Midwest, or a drought in the \nSoutheast, or a recession in New England--to say we can't do anything \nto help because we need a supermajority vote.\n  When your State or region is hit by a major recession or emergency, \ndo you want critical Federal assistance to hang on the whims of 41 \nSenators or 175 Representatives? That is all it would take. We have 535 \nMembers of Congress. All 535 Members of those bodies--save a critical \n41--could vote and you may not be helped.\n  Our Founders rejected this requirement of supermajorities. We should \nlook to their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements \nbefore we impose on our most vulnerable citizens a three-fifths \nsupermajority requirement to provide Federal relief from recessions and \nserious economic emergencies.\n  In fact, I urge some to go back and read ``The Federalist Papers,'' \nread what our Founders wrote. I hope that all Senators have read them. \nBut if they haven't, now is as good a time as any to add to your \neducation, improve your mind, and acquire a sense of history. It is why \nSenators, for 200 years, have resisted the temptation to amend the \nConstitution unnecessarily--17 times since the Bill of Rights, that's \nall. Surely, we have had more than 17 times in this country when we \nhave had the urge to do it, when it has been politically popular to do \nit, when we could point to political polls of the moment that said 70 \npercent of the country wanted us to amend the Constitution. We have \ntaken polling where people have taken our Bill of Rights--those things \nthat protect us from unlawful search and seizure, protect us in our \nright of free speech and religion--there have been polls and studies \ndone that would just break down the words and ask the people, and the \nmajority would say, oh, no, we could not vote for that. Then they are \nsurprised to find that it is in the Bill of Rights.\n  The Constitution should not be a prisoner of that moment's public \nopinion polls. The Constitution should be protected by the best \ninstincts and the greatest sense of responsibility of every man and \nwoman in the Senate and in the House. If we start voting by popular \npublic opinion poll and not by a sense of history and not by what is \nbest for the next generation, then we fail in our own responsibilities \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in a family that revered the Constitution. I \ngrew up in a family that understood the first amendment. I grew up in a \nfamily that knew that so much of what makes us Americans is in the Bill \nof Rights. In my public life as a prosecutor, as a lawyer and, more \nimportant, as a husband and a father, I have realized the advantages I \nhave that no one in any other country has because of the protections in \nthe Constitution. I also realize that those protections came because my \npredecessors, and all our predecessors in these bodies, resisted the \ntemptation to amend the Constitution every time that it was popular. I \nhope we will not do it now.\n  The sponsors of this measure repeatedly outline the dangers of a \nbudget deficit. We are all in favor of bringing down the deficit, as we \nhave done for the last 4 years. But these sponsors have failed to \naddress how the proposed constitutional amendment will provide for the \nflexibility needed in economic downturns, without holding working \nfamilies and hard-hit regions hostage to a supermajority vote.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment restores that flexibility by requiring a \nsimple majority vote to respond to economic recessions and emergencies.\n  Whether you are for or against this constitutional amendment, we \nshould take the effort to make it a better constitutional amendment. \nCertainly, Senator Durbin's amendment does that, and it deserves our \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Utah on the floor. Maybe he can \ngive us some idea of what he plans to do with our lives for the rest of \nthe day.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we have a few more remarks. The distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming would like to\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\nspeak, and the distinguished Senator from Maine wants to speak. I could \nthen wrap up, and that should end it for the day. Do you have anybody \nover there desiring to speak?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will check. It would be your turn to go now. I will \nyield the floor so your speakers may proceed. And we will find out if \nthere is anybody else on this side.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. Without that amendment, our \nchildren and grandchildren will be saddled with a mountain of debt. \nThey will be left with no hope of fulfilling their hopes and dreams.\n  I feel that it is time to correct the misleading reports that have \nbeen put forth by many of the opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nover the past few weeks. Their arguments are not new. They have been \nthe same arguments for the past 20 years--actually, for almost three \ndecades Congress has failed to balance the budget. I am standing almost \nin the shadow of the mountain of budgets that don't balance. That \nfailure has led to the current fiscal mess that holds us hostage.\n  But what has really kept us from a balanced budget amendment? The \nsame old excuses and fear-mongering still prevail, scaring everyone \nfrom the children to the senior citizens of this country. The excuses \ntake a little different form each year, but the same basic fears are \nstill being played upon. The easy position to take is to continue \nspending the taxpayers money on feel-good programs instead of grappling \nwith the tough issues.\n\n  The debt we are incurring for our kids amounts to taxation without \nrepresentation. We are forcing people who haven't even been born yet to \ncosign on a note. A balanced budget constitutional amendment would tie \nthe hands of the spenders in DC. It doesn't throw the baby out with the \nbath water. In fact, it is the life cord that connects the budget to \nthe baby. It would protect generations yet to come.\n  A balanced budget will do away with the hidden taxes Americans pay in \nthe form of higher interest rates. If we pass the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment now, a middle-class family could easily save \n$1,500 a year. That is a nice raise. This is assuming a drop in \nmortgage rates from 7.7 to 5.7 percent, a drop in interest rates on a \ncar loan from 9.2 to 7.2 percent, and decline in student loan rates \nfrom 8.5 to 6.5 percent. Interest rates should be 2 percent lower with \na balanced budget.\n  How would the financial markets view the balanced budget amendment? \nAccording to many financial market experts, such as David Malpass, the \nmore restraint on Government spending, the better the markets will \nrespond. Part of the reason for the bullish market is merely the \nsuggestion of a balanced budget. Laws enforcing a balanced budget would \nperpetuate a bullish financial market. Currently, interest rates are \nlow and the economy is healthy, due again in part by Congress and the \nPresident getting serious about balancing the budget. All of these \npositive trends are occurring as a result of just the possibility of \nbalancing the budget.\n  What about the claim that a balanced budget amendment would hobble \nour economy in a recession? First of all, there is a clause in the \namendment that would allow Congress, by a three-fifths vote, to spend \nmore than it takes. In an emergency situation of three-fifths vote \nwould not be difficult to attain. Financial experts agree that \nrecessions have occurred at times due to Federal mismanagement of \nmonetary, tax, or regulatory policies. Mistakes are usually made when \nthe Government intervenes too much in the private sector. The amendment \nhas a built in method that allows the Federal Government to quickly \nreact to these types of glitches.\n  The economist John Keynes knew that Government should attempt to \ncreate a surplus in the good times and that Government must borrow \nduring bad times. The problem with our situation is that Congress is \nborrowing during the bad and good, wartime and peacetime, national \nemergency or no emergency. Look at where we are now. We are supposed to \nbe having the best economy in years--with a focus on reinventing and \ndownsizing government, a huge reduction in military expenses, and a \nCongress and President that want to balance the budget. We lack the \nwill and discipline, however, to ultimately balance the budget before \nthe end of the 20th century.\n  We have had commission after commission study this issue to sheer \nboredom. We all know that revenue is up right now for Social Security. \nWe are also well aware that the program will start running a deficit in \n2013. Let's not make political hay out of Social Security. Let's start \ndealing with reality.\n  Opponents of the amendment want Social Security exempted or taken off \nbudget. It is catchy wording that some senior citizens have bought \nhook, line and sinker. It has absolutely no consistent meaning to \nanyone and it provides a false sense of security. There is a vague \nfeeling that ``off budget'' means that we don't want to cheat on Social \nSecurity and damage the ability to support our seniors.\n  I say right now that nobody wants to damage Social Security. Nobody \nwants that to happen. Everyone, including me, wants to protect senior \ncitizens. It is absurd to say otherwise.\n  Right now Social Security is a partial pay-as-you-go system. The \npeople paying Social Security taxes are paying for the people who are \nretired today. It is not a fully funded system. It doesn't build up a \ntrust fund. It's a bunch of IOU's. There is no secret vault stacked \nfull of Social Security funds. The revenue from Social Security is \ninvested into Government-backed securities like Treasury bills. To \ndisregard Social Security plays games with the budget. It would require \nan additional $80 billion match up front. Later, when baby boomers \nreach retirement, the fund will go broke without an enormous infusion \nof funds from our children and grandchildren. An amendment is not just \nfor the next 8 years.\n  It is for that time when there is an extra burden on Social Security.\n  As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I believe that in order to \nensure stability and longevity of Social Security, we need to go to a \nmodified accrual system of accounting for each of the trust funds.\n  We need to talk also about Medicare and the other trust funds, not \njust Social Security. It happens to be the only one that fits with the \nargument of the opponents.\n  This accrued system would assure that the moneys coming in match up--\nat some point in the critical near future--to the time that the money \nhas to go out. A modified accrual method would show that any surplus \nrevenue for this year's budget is already committed further down the \nline.\n  I believe we should pass a balanced budget amendment even though the \ngrowth rate of the deficit is falling without the amendment. The budget \ndeficit is expected to rise from $107 billion in fiscal year 1996, to \n$124 billion in fiscal year 1997. This is not a reduction in the size \nof the deficit. Some are praising the progress in reducing the deficit. \nWe aren't reducing the deficit or the national debt. I don't know where \ntheir numbers are coming from. They sure aren't coming from the \nCongressional Budget Office. But if we move toward a balanced budget by \nfiscal year 2002, a fiscal dividend of about $34 billion is in sight.\n  The Clinton administration and a number of Members of this body have \nalready begun a reign of terror on the American people regarding the \nbalanced budget amendment. Members of the administration have \ncriticized the amendment by claiming it is unenforceable. These attacks \nare not only unfounded, they represent a sad critique on the \nadministration's view of fulfilling its constitutional obligations.\n\n  On January 7, I swore a solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. All of my colleagues in the \nSenate and the House have taken this same pledge. President Clinton \ntook the same oath on January 20. This is one of the most serious \npledges a person can take in his or her lifetime. It binds all Members \nof the Congress and the President to follow all the provisions in the \nConstitution. If the balanced budget amendment was added to the \nConstitution, we would be bound by our most solemn oath to pass a \nbalanced budget in each and every fiscal year.\n  For the administration to criticize this amendment as unenforceable \nis a\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\nvery serious charge indeed. Does the President intend not to fulfill \nhis constitutional duty to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution by delivering a balanced budget proposal to Congress \nbefore each fiscal year? Is the administration insinuating that Members \nof the Senate and the House of Representatives are willing to blatantly \nviolate the clear language of our Constitution which they took an oath \nto uphold and defend?\n  I do not share the Clinton administration's cynical view that our \nconstitutional officers will openly and flagrantly flout their solemn \nduties. If we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment, I have \nevery confidence that Members of this noble Chamber as well as our \nfriends in the House will take their oath to defend the Constitution \nvery seriously. We will balance the budget because we have sworn to \nuphold the Constitution. We will balance the budget because we desire \nto leave our children and grandchildren a legacy of hope and prosperity \ninstead of the horror of a $5.3 trillion debt.\n  I want to stress that the enforcement of the balanced budget \namendment will rest first and foremost with this Congress. Under \nsection 6 of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, Congress \nmust pass implementing legislation to enforce this amendment. This \nprovision indicates that it will be primarily Congress--neither the \nPresident nor the Federal courts--which will provide the means of \nenforcement. Claims that this amendment will result in new powers of \nPresidential impoundment or judicial involvement in the budgetary \nprocess are unfounded. These are nothing more than further attempts by \nthe amendment's detractors to sidestep the serious obligation we all \nhave of safeguarding the financial future of our Nation, and our kids \nand grandkids.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join me in voting for Senate Joint \nResolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment. This will \nbe a giant step in restoring responsibility to our Government, and it \nwill demonstrate to future generations that we were willing to act \nresponsibly in the most serious of our tasks. And if we do not balance \nthe budget, we become the longest running game show with the lowest \nratings in history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for the excellent remarks he has made here on the floor today. \nI have really been appreciative of the new Senators coming and talking \nabout this because each and every one of them is a prime cosponsor of \nthis amendment. What a change that is from two Congresses ago when we \nlost this by three votes, one Congress ago by one vote.\n  I am very grateful to have had the good people we have listened to \nall day today. It makes a lot of difference to me.\n  I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my \ndistinguished colleagues who have spoken in favor of a balanced budget \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  It is not surprising that with a national debt which is $5.3 trillion \nand still growing this debate is awash in statistics, each more \nstaggering than the last. As someone who ran for office to fight for \nmore opportunities and better jobs, I find the costs in those areas of \nour chronic failure to balance the budget to be particularly troubling.\n  In light of the President's call for a crusade for education, one of \nthe more telling statistics is that last year the Federal Government \nspent about $240 billion to service our national debt, an amount that \nis almost eight times greater than the amount we spent on education. \nThink about that. If we had been operating the Government without debt, \nwe could have spent nine times more on educating our children. Now, \nthat is what I call a crusade.\n  Whatever the long-term benefits to the public sector from balancing \nthe budget, they pale in comparison to the benefits to our families. \nThe Concord Coalition has estimated that had we not run deficits for \nthe past two decades, the average family's annual income would be \n$15,500 higher. Looked at prospectively, the General Accounting Office \nhas said that we will increase per capita income by 26 percent over the \nnext two decades if we balance our budget.\n  These are not partisan statistics, just as this is not a partisan \nissue. The numbers I have cited to demonstrate the enormous costs of \nour past fiscal failures can be found in a recent letter to the editor \nfrom former Democratic Senator Paul Simon, a leader in the battle for a \nconstitutional amendment, whose 22 years of congressional service ended \nbefore the goal to which he was so deeply committed could become a \nreality.\n  The economic evidence that favors a balanced budget is overwhelming. \nBut one legitimately may ask how I make the jump from the need for a \nbalanced budget to the need for a constitutional amendment mandating a \nbalanced budget. That is a political not an economic issue but the \nevidence is equally as overwhelming.\n  The simple fact is that the road to our huge national debt has been \npaved with good intentions. We have had the Deficit Reduction Act, the \nGramm-Rudman Act, the Budget Enforcement Act, and yet we still have \ndeficits. The old saying that ``We have met the enemy and it is us'' \nhas never been more applicable.\n  As a freshman Senator, I do not sit in judgment on my predecessors \nand say that I would have done it differently. I know the pressures on \nWashington to spend money, even borrowed money. By and large, each \nCongress sets out to be fiscally responsible, but our national debt \nstill grows. The truth is experience has taught us that even in good \ntimes we need the discipline of a constitutional amendment.\n\n  To those who say that this issue does not rise to the level of \nconstitutional protection, I respectfully disagree. It is the unique \ngenius of the U.S. Constitution that serves to protect our people and \ntheir property from the excesses of their Government. It is difficult \nto imagine a greater excess, at least in the realm of property, than a \ndebt burden of more than $5 trillion. The legacy we are leaving our \nchildren and our grandchildren, many of them not yet born, is taxation \nwithout representation in its most egregious form.\n  As I said earlier, this is a debate in which there has been no \nshortage of statistics and no shortage of speeches, but buried \nsomewhere beneath that pile of numbers and mounds of rhetoric is a very \nsimple principle. That is that all of us, including the Congress of the \nUnited States, must be personally responsible for our actions. In the \ncontext of the budget, personal responsibility means not spending what \nis not ours to spend.\n  The 104th Congress struck a strong blow for personal responsibility \nin its welfare legislation. It told able-bodied welfare recipients that \nthey could not live off the efforts of others; that they would have to \nearn their own way. For those who grew up in a culture of dependency, \nthis was a harsh message. But it was the right message because \nresponsibility for one's own actions is the core of the American \neffort.\n  I think it important that the Congress and the President not hold \nthemselves to any less of a standard of personal responsibility. During \nthe past quarter century, a culture of dependency has developed right \nhere in the U.S. Congress, and it is reflected in our dependency on the \nmoney of future generations. In each of the past 27 years, we have \nborrowed from our children and our grandchildren to buy things for \nourselves, building up an immense debt with no end in sight.\n  The legacy we are leaving, however, is not just financial. It is a \nlegacy of excess, of taking advantage of those who cannot protect their \nown interests, of practicing not deferred gratification but, rather, \ndeferred responsibility.\n  I recognize that deficits are sometimes unavoidable and that, indeed, \nthey are sometimes critical to finance wars or to get the economy \nmoving out of a recession. The balanced budget amendment would still \npermit deficit spending in the event of war, recession, or other \nemergency, but deficit spending today is no longer a tool carefully \nused by Congress and the President to respond to emergencies. Rather, \nit has become a permanent feature of our fiscal landscape.\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n  Just how permanent deficit spending has become is reflected in the \nstaggering fact that if every man, woman, and child in this Nation \nbrought all of their currency to Washington, DC, it would not be enough \nto pay off our national debt. Those who argue that we do not need a \nconstitutional amendment to solve this problem are simply ignoring our \nfiscal history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe I will be the last to comment \ntoday, and I deliberately waited to the end to allow some other \nspeakers to have a turn, but we do have an amendment which has been \nfiled by the distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], and I do \nbelieve I need to make a few remarks about that. But I do not intend to \ntake too much time here.\n  Senator Durbin has offered an amendment to the balanced budget \namendment that would allow for suspension of the balanced budget rule \nin times of ``economic recession or serious economic emergency.'' I \nwonder what those words mean. Some words, when placed into the \nConstitution, can have almost any meaning.\n  The very purpose of this provision of the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois is to make the balanced budget amendment easier to waive. \nInstead of trying to find ways to avoid fiscal responsibility, we ought \nto be working toward passing a strong balanced budget amendment that \nwill help us to keep out of recessions in the first place.\n  As an initial matter, any definition of ``downturn'' is malleable and \ncould be abused by any future Congress bent on deficit spending. This \namendment is no different. Trying to deal with a concept as loose as an \neconomic downturn without even an attempt at defining terms can make \nthis a loophole you could drive a truck through. It will not be long \nuntil a convoy starts rolling through. Furthermore, there is a loophole \nwithin the loophole, because the amendment does not limit the waiver in \nany way, such as to amounts related to the emergency.\n\n  Under this provision, even during times of significant national \ngrowth, certain regions may experience an economic downturn which might \ngive Congress a reason to trigger this waiver, whether we actually need \nto borrow to respond or not. Or there could be a general feeling of \n``economic anxiety,'' or a perceived sense of anxiety felt in \nWashington about the economy. We can create anxieties about anything \naround here. For instance, I am very anxious about these 28 years of \nunbalanced budgets that are represented by this stack of budget \nsubmissions right here. We have had people worrying all day that these \nvolumes might fall off and crush somebody. I just hope it is not us. \nBut the debt burden they represent are crushing the American people.\n  Year after year of unbalanced budgets and all we get from the other \nside is, ``All we need is the will to do it, to balance the budget.'' \nThis President says we are going to do it by the year 2002, but he's \ngoing to do 75 percent of the balancing in the last 2 years according \nto the budget filed today. Give me a break. It is just more of the \nsame. That is why we are here.\n  I don't think it takes any brains to figure this one out. It is a no-\nbrainer to know that these people who file these amendments do not want \nany balanced budget amendment, they do not want any constraints; they \nwant to keep spending just like they always have. We have plenty of \nunbalanced budgets around here. We have done it for 28 years straight, \nand actually for the most of the last 60 years. We just put 28 budget \nsubmission volumes up here because we thought to stack up our budgetary \nfailures any higher would be truly dangerous. In fact, I am not sure \nthis little table will hold this throughout the whole debate.\n  Let me say this. Even during times of significant national growth, \nunder this proposal of the distinguished Senator from Illinois, we \ncould have a waiver of the balanced budget amendment during times of \neconomic boom, just when we should be balancing the budget or running a \nsurplus.\n  I believe the general three-fifths waiver already provided for in the \nbalanced budget amendment strikes the right balance. It will allow \nCongress to waive the balanced budget rule during times of real need, \nbut it will prevent those who are simply trying to find an easy way out \nof a budget crunch from strapping even more debt onto the backs of our \nchildren and future generations. The general three-fifths waiver \nprovision will give Congress an incentive to plan ahead, rather than to \nborrow and spend in good times and bad, just like we have up to now, \nand then when things get tough, just go borrow some more. That is what \nwe do. This is a recipe for instability.\n  You will find the people who bring these amendments by and large are \npeople who were never, never going to vote for a balanced budget \namendment. But they will do anything to stop it, anything to stop us \nfrom having to live within budgetary constraints.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is based in part on the largely \nrejected notion that increased borrowing will help us out of a \nrecession. Fred Bergsten, a noted economist who had testified in \nsupport of the balanced budget amendment in past years, suggested the \nbetter way to go is to shoot for a yearly surplus, and let that take \ncare of any truly automatic fluctuations and any truly pressing needs \nat that time, if there are any.\n  Further, financial market experts have stated that increased \nborrowing and spending is not a cure for recessions. The better way is \nto get Federal spending and borrowing under control, which will make \nfor a stronger, more stable economy, which will help us avoid economic \nproblems in the first place.\n  We should learn from other countries in the world that are trying to \n``spend their way out of recession.'' Several European countries and \nJapan have been trying to do this lately. The result has been continued \nrecession and even larger debt. On the other hand, a number of the \nworld's up and coming countries are enjoying booming economies while \nkeeping their national budgets in balance or even surplus. Perhaps we \nshould be more concerned that we do not spend ourselves out of \nprosperity. I think we ought to think about that. Are we spending \nourselves out of prosperity?\n\n  One commentator has wryly stated that the theory of borrowing and \nspending out of a recession ``is the game plan that propelled Argentina \nand Bolivia into economic superpower status in the 1970s.'' That is \npretty sarcastic, but I think a pretty good comment.\n  The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from running a \nreasonable surplus which could be used to offset the effects of an \neconomic downtown. This surplus would allow us to use fiscal policy \nwithin the balanced budget rule better than we can now without it.\n  Even if we were to drop below balance using the intended rainy day \nsurplus, the balanced budget amendment has anticipated this sort of \nneed. A three-fifths vote in Congress will allow the balanced budget \namendment rule to be suspended for a year. That way we have the \nflexibility to run reasonable deficits if we need to. The three-fifths \nrequirement makes sure we do not waive the amendment unless it is a \ntrue need and not just an attempt for us to avoid making tough choices, \nwhich is something that goes on here all the time.\n  So, we do not need any exceptions or loopholes. What we need is a \nstrong balanced budget amendment as a mechanism in the Constitution to \nhelp us to get to a balanced budget. We should be less concerned about \nwhen we can spend more and more concerned about when we must spend \nless.\n  Some say we are spending less. We have been hearing a lot in just the \nlast 2 days about what a wonderful job we have done in reducing the \ndeficit. Of course, we do not hear much about the fact that so long as \nwe still have a deficit, our debt is increasing. In fact, we are not \nspending less. You would think a $107 billion deficit was a wonderful \nnirvana-like state. Only in Washington do we celebrate a reduction in \nthe increase in the debt as an achievement, only here in this \nsurrealistic place where we have these surrealistic budgets, all of \nwhich were unbalanced for 28 straight years, some of which were \nproposed to be balanced budgets but were not. None of these since 1969 \nhave been balanced.\n  Another fact we do not hear much about is even though the economy is\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\ndoing fairly well, we are still in a deficit. Opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment keep talking about how the deficits are related to the \neconomy. It seems to me, that given the current health of the economy, \nthe budget should be balanced right now. But of course it is not. And \nof course the blame must be Mr. Reagan's or Mr. Bush's.\n  Give me a break. The Reagan tax cuts actually produced 40 percent \ngreater increase in revenues. What really cost us were two things, part \nof which was President Reagan's fault. One was the increase of strength \nto our military. But, on the other hand, I think most commentators now \nwill give President Reagan credit for having brought down the iron \ncurtain and having ended the cold war. But the other side of that \nequation was, during all of Reagan's 8 years, and all of Bush's 4 \nyears, the House of Representatives where all money bills originate was \ncontrolled by liberals. In particular, during the Reagan years it was \nTip O'Neill who led the liberal onslaught against the budget. Even \nthough Reagan cut taxes and reduced marginal tax rates, and revenues \nactually went up--not as high as we would have liked, but they went up \nsome 40 percent--even though that happened, the liberals in Congress \nwere spending us into bankruptcy. That, coupled with the increase in \nthe military, of course, did get us to the point where we are.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. It is an old expression that the time to save money is \nwhen you have it. If this economy is so good, as some of our colleagues \nare saying, Madam President, why do we not have a balanced budget. \nWhy? Because it is easy to spend other people's money in good times and \nbad. That is why we need to correct Congress' spending bias with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n  This country has enjoyed some remarkable economic progress in the \nlatter half of this century, and yet the United States has borrowed \never more money, despite the fact that most of those years were both \npeaceful and prosperous. So when people hear the opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment talk about needing to spend more in \nrecessions, they should consider whether we have spent less in \nprosperous times. Of course, we have not. The debt has simply gone up \nhigher and higher. It now stands at over $5.3 trillion.\n  Let me just take a moment to illustrate just how big that is. This \nchart shows, if you were to lay the debt of $5.3 trillion in $1 bills \nend to end on a road, they would stretch 514,283,460 miles. Were you to \ndrive to the end of that road traveling an average of 500 miles per day \nat 65 miles per hour, it would take you 2,818 years. You would have to \ndrive along the road paved with dollar bills for 500 miles a day at 65 \nmiles an hour for 2,818 years.\n  That gives us a little understanding of how big the debt is. Two \nthousand eight hundred and eighteen years is somewhat difficult to \ncomprehend, so let me put it in more descriptive terms.\n  Had the legendary founder of Rome, Romulus, gotten on his horse in \n753 B.C. and started down that road of dollar bills at a rate of 500 \nmiles per day, he would still be some six decades away from reaching \nthe end of that road. In the course of his travels, he would have \ncircled the globe more than 20,000 times.\n  That is our debt. It is no longer cyclical. It has become a permanent \nstructure in Washington. It even has its own Government office, the \nBureau of Public Debt. I am not kidding; that office really does exist. \nOur deficits have not been countercyclical, they have been \ncounterproductive.\n  What we need is to change the way Congress thinks. Only a requirement \nwith the strength and staying power of a constitutional amendment can \nmake that change. Only the balanced budget amendment can get our fiscal \nhouse in order and keep it there.\n  Before we are done with this debate, we will likely see amendments to \nexempt certain programs, exempt certain groups, and waive the balanced \nbudget amendment whenever the times get tough. But this is precisely \nthe type of thinking that has brought us 30 straight years of deficits \nand a $5.3 trillion national debt.\n  The way to avoid the hardships of recession is to pass a strong \nbalanced budget amendment and get our runaway deficit spending under \ncontrol. That will take some guts. Because it is tough, you will see \nall of these amendments to try and protect one constituency after \nanother. The fact is, we have to keep all the budget together and \napproach it in an intelligent and thoughtful way. And those programs, \nlike Social Security, that are so justifiable are better than capable \nof competing, and they will compete well. Some of the programs that are \nnot quite as good--all of them have some merit--but some that are not \nquite as good may have to have some changes. All of our budget has to \nhave some changes if we are ever going to get the budget and economy of \nthis country under control and save the future for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an excellent editorial by the Investors Business Daily of \ntoday's date entitled ``Perspective: Balanced-Budget Blather,'' as well \nas an excellent editorial by Bruce Bartlett entitled ``Dangers that \nDon't Hang in the Balance.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Balanced-Budget Blather\n\n       Without deficits, recessions would be longer, deeper and \n     harder to pull out of, the common wisdom says. Treasury \n     Secretary Robert Rubin echoes that in opposing a balanced-\n     budget amendment. But it's not true.\n       The idea that deficit spending could smooth out the rough \n     spots in a business cycle comes from John Maynard Keynes. \n     Recessions, he believed, started when all the buyers in the \n     economy suddenly stopped spending.\n       Sellers usually respond to such a decline in demand by \n     cutting output and jobs, rather than cutting prices, the \n     Keynesian view went. That threw more people out of work, and \n     further reduced aggregate demand.\n       Only government could turn this cycle around, by pumping \n     money into the economy. It did so by hiring people for public \n     works programs, for example.\n       But because the government collects less in taxes during \n     recessions, those public programs had to be paid for with \n     debt, Keynes argued.\n       The evidence shows that public works programs have done \n     nothing to solve recessions, a 1993 article by economist \n     Bruce Bartlett in The Public Interest magazine pointed out.\n       Spending packages aimed at fighting recession have never \n     been enacted before a recession ended on its own, as the \n     chart shows.\n       In fact, Congress often enacts these packages the very \n     month the recession is over. They are usually nothing more \n     than pork-barrel spending dressed up as compassion.\n       Recessions are usually defined as two straight quarters of \n     falling GDP. So no one actually knows a recession is \n     happening until six months after it starts. No one knows it's \n     over until three months later.\n       Even then, it takes Congress time to pass a law for extra \n     spending. And it takes still more time for that money to make \n     its way through the economy.\n       So even if Congress could tell when a recession was \n     starting--unlikely, given the records of most economic \n     forecasters--it still wouldn't have more than a small effect.\n       And Keynes was wrong not just in practice, but in theory as \n     well.\n       He based his whole theory on the notion that government \n     experts acted rationally, while the average person did not. \n     Central planners could know enough and act quickly enough to \n     save people from the consequences of their own bad \n     decisions--clearly not the case.\n       There are programs, such as unemployment insurance, that \n     kick in automatically when recession hits, without having to \n     wait for Congress to act. The amount those programs actually \n     increase during recession could be easily handled within a \n     balanced budget, however.\n       Between 1980 and 1984--which includes years of deep \n     recession--real spending on jobless benefits rose $47.4 \n     billion above its level in 1979, an economic peak. That \n     increase was just 1% of government spending over those four \n     years.\n       Recession have been less severe in the postwar period, many \n     economists argue, largely because of the greater role \n     government has played in easing recessions. But it is not \n     certain that they are less severe, and it is even less \n     certain that this is due to government.\n       On the surface it seems true. From 1920 to 1938, recessions \n     averaged 20 months, with a 14.2% decline in real GNP. Since \n     1948; they averaged 11 months, with 2.4% drop in real GNP. \n     Unfortunately, it's hard to compare the two periods, because \n     the prewar data are quite crude.\n       National Bureau of Economic Research economist Christina \n     Romer, in an key 1986 American Economic Review article, tried \n     to compare apples with apples. She adjusted the more recent \n     data so that it was calculated much like those of the prewar \n     period.\n       And she found the evidence of a change in the length, \n     frequency and severity of business cycles was weak.\n       Even if recessions are less severe, it may have little to \n     do with government. The growing importance of the service \n     sector, where\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\n     employment tends to be stable, could be one reason. And \n     technology has helped ease the sharp boom-bust cycle of the \n     farm and factory sectors.\n       Legitimate gripes about a balanced-budget amendment are \n     easy to come by. But Rubin's is not one of them.\n\n                                TOO LATE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Date of anti-recession\n             End of recessions                       legislation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nApr.

His main \n     concern is that it will hamper the government's ability to \n     respond to an economic downturn. While this is a valid \n     concern, it is overstated. Congress can always abandon the \n     balanced budget requirement by a super-majority vote, which \n     it certainly would do in the event of an economic crisis. \n     More importantly, however, there is no evidence that deficit \n     spending has been necessary to recover from past rescissions.\n       It is undeniably true that Congress always passes some sort \n     of anti-recession legislation every time there is an economic \n     slowdown. But the history of such legislation is that it \n     always comes too late to do any good. In fact, the date that \n     anti-recession legislation becomes law often corresponds to \n     the very date that the recession ends. More frequently, the \n     legislation comes well after the recession's trough. And \n     since the actual spending does not come into effect \n     immediately, it has always been the case that anti-recession \n     spending did not impact on the economy until long after the \n     recession's end--sometimes many years afterward.\n       The table illustrates this point, looking at every major \n     postwar recession as defined by the National Bureau of \n     Economic Research. As one can see, there is not a single case \n     in which anti-recession legislation was enacted in a timely \n     fashion, so as to mitigate the economic downturn. In fact, \n     one can argue that such legislation may have made matters \n     worse. By overstimulating the economy during upturns, it may \n     have sown the seeds of future recessions.\n       The problem is that for anti-recession spending to work, \n     forecasters would have to see a recession coming. Legislation \n     would have to be enacted into law well in advance, and \n     programs implemented so as to coincide with the beginning of \n     the downturn. These are virtually impossible requirements to \n     meet. Forecasters seldom, if ever, accurately predict turning \n     points in the economy. And if they could, it is doubtful that \n     they would be persuasive enough to convince Congress and the \n     administration to act in time. And even if they did, it \n     usually takes a year or more to get programs implemented and \n     money flowing.\n       Thus it is absurd to argue that the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment should be defeated because it will hamstring the \n     government's ability to respond to economic downturns. All \n     recessions really do is give politicians an excuse to enact \n     pork-barrel public works programs in the name of mitigating \n     the recession. If the amendment prevents such wasteful \n     spending it will serve a useful purpose.\n\n           DATES OF RECESSIONS AND ANTI-RECESSION LEGISLATION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Beginning                     End             Legislation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNov. 48.........................

Madam President, there will never be a time when we have a \ntrue economic need and a true economic emergency that we will not get a \nthree-fifths vote. As a general matter, whenever we needed it for \nunemployment compensation, whenever we needed it for emergencies, there \nhas always been more than three-fifths. That requirement of consensus \nto borrow, which allows for flexibility but not complete laxity, is the \nvalue of this amendment and the strength of this amendment.\n  So we can't just do what our friend from Illinois would like to do, \nand that is to just have a nebulous set of terms that would allow this \nCongress to do whatever it wants to about spending in the future. What \nwe are trying to do is establish some restraints and get this place \nunder control.\n  This constitutional amendment's approach is a bipartisan approach. It \nis not a Republican approach; it is not a Democrat approach. It has \ntaken a lot of us working together year after year--in my case, over 20 \nyears now--to get this bipartisan amendment, the only one having a \nchance of going through, and everybody knows that. So hoping for a \nversion more to one's liking is no excuse not to vote for this. \nEverybody knows this is the amendment. We are hopeful this amendment \nwill pass intact and be sent to the House, and if it receives the \nrequired votes in the House, it will be a great day for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to speak on the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Madam President, I am a liberal. I also support a balanced budget \namendment to the U.S. Constitution. To some, this might appear a \ncontradiction in terms. To others, including my predecessor in office, \nSenator Paul Simon, it is as logically consistent as the classical \ndefinition of ``liberalism,'' and I quote: ``Belonging to the people; \ngiving freely; generous; tolerant of views differing from one's own; \nbroad-minded; favoring reform or progress as in education; favoring \npolitical reforms tending toward democracy and personal freedom for the \nindividual; progressive.''\n  Those are all definitions to be found in Webster's New World \nDictionary of a ``liberal.''\n  It is precisely because I believe in this definition of liberalism \nthat I believe the balanced budget amendment is necessary. Chronic \nbudget deficits and cumulative national debt currently threaten to \nundermine our ability to act in the public interest.\n  Budget deficits make it much harder for our country to focus on what \nis really important: the objectives we want to achieve. Only by \nbalancing the budget will we be able to reclaim our country's ability \nto decide to make important investments in our communities, such as \nfixing crumbling schools, investing in mass transit, providing pension \nsecurity, ensuring that our airways are safe, or caring for the poor.\n  Unless we take a long-term view of budgetary problems and require \npermanent fiscal prudence, the Federal Government will be forced to \nspend its resources on paying interest to bondholders, rather than on \naddressing the priorities of the American people.\n  In the name of intergenerational fairness--fairness to these young \npeople who are here as pages and their generation--in the interest of \nintergenerational fairness, we need to keep in mind the needs of the \nnext generation, not just current short-term issues.\n  While we want to be able to respond to the next emergency and to the \nnext one, not telling the truth about the budget and not making the \ntough choices required forces us to continue to try to finance our \nfuture with debt. That accumulation of debt, however, will make America \nless competitive and less able to respond effectively to future \nemergencies and future priorities.\n  Because of persistent deficits and a huge national debt, the value of \nwhat Government is doing is being lost. Social Security, Medicare and \nMedicaid, for example, have reduced poverty among the elderly to the \nlowest levels since statistics first started being kept. Social \nSecurity has administrative costs of less than 1 percent of benefits \npaid, and Medicare has administrative costs of less than 3 percent of \nbenefits paid, both far better in terms of administrative costs than \ntheir private counterparts.\n  These programs account for almost 50 percent of all noninterest \nFederal spending, and they have made it possible for literally tens of \nmillions of Americans to enjoy a secure, healthy retirement, and they \nhave helped increase longevity.\n  The Federal Government has also built the Interstate Highway System, \nset aside national parks and created a space program that put men on \nthe Moon, and will soon begin a space station.\n  We financed an American military that won the cold war, and we went \nto the Persian Gulf and achieved victory at the lowest possible cost in \nAmerican lives.\n  In short, Madam President, Government can work. But Government \nsuccesses are being swallowed up in interest costs that were only 40 \nyears ago\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nabout a penny out of every dollar and now today are 15 cents out of \nevery dollar, and growing. Is there any wonder that Americans felt more \nprosperous in the 1950's and in the 1960's than they do today?\n  The balanced budget amendment will not undermine the value of what \nthe Federal Government does. The balanced budget amendment will help \nclear out that undergrowth of debt, making room for more investment in \nthe values that we hold dear.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Government \nis right now spending $684 million every day for interest payments on \nthe national debt. That is $684 million that could otherwise be used \nfor Head Start, for housing programs, for our battle against crimes or \ndrugs or to repair our crumbling school infrastructure. And $684 \nmillion a day is a resource hemorrhage that we, as a nation, can ill \nafford.\n  In fiscal year 1996, we spent $241 billion to service our national \ndebt. The national debt, as you no doubt have heard, is now $5.2 \ntrillion, and it is growing. We cannot allow these trends to continue \nunchecked. If we do not act now, if we wait until the country is on the \nbrink of financial ruin, we will have totally failed our obligation to \nthe American people and to our country and our children, and the next \ngeneration will pay the price for that failure.\n  Madam President, I served on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement \nand Tax Reform. One of the conclusions that was made clear there was \nthat unless we get the deficit under control, by the year 2003 \nmandatory spending, which is entitlements plus interest on the national \ndebt, by that year they will account for fully 73 percent of the total \nFederal budget. These few programs already consume almost two-thirds of \nFederal resources. So domestic discretionary spending, that is to say, \nthe kinds of things we appropriate here, will be frozen out altogether \nif we do not get a handle on the continuing deficits.\n  Even though, Madam President, the current economic news is generally \ngood and the economy continues to expand, we know that markets go up \nbut then markets also go down again. So the trend, given the changes in \nour country and the demographic changes, is not likely to continue.\n  A recently released Congressional Budget Office report entitled, \n``The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1998-2007,'' points \nout:\n\n       Despite the improved outlook through 2007. . .the budget \n     situation will start to deteriorate rapidly only a few years \n     later with the retirement of the first baby boomers and the \n     continued growth of per-person health care costs.\n\n  Madam President, the demographics of our time are something that we \nhave to come to grips with. I like to tell people that this year alone \na baby boomer will turn 50 every 9 seconds. So we are aging as a \npopulation. That is impacting on our budget situation and the decisions \nthat we here in the Congress have to make.\n  By the year 2012 the Social Security trust fund will begin spending \nmore money than it takes in. By the year 2029 the trust fund will have \nexhausted all its resources. After 2012, when there are no more \nsurpluses, Federal deficits will really begin to explode, an explosion \nthat will be fueled by the looming retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration.\n  It is true that for the next 15 years Social Security will be running \na surplus. It will be taking in more than it spends. I agree that the \nexistence of these annual surpluses does make the consolidated budget \ndeficit look smaller in the relative short run. But that surplus is a \ntemporary phenomenon. After 2012 Social Security will begin consuming \nthat accumulated surplus.\n  Madam President, the temporary or the permanent nature of the \nsurpluses perhaps would not be important if it were actually possible \nto decouple Social Security completely from the rest of the Federal \nGovernment. Social Security, however, is intimately related to the rest \nof the Government as long as the Social Security system invests in \nTreasury bonds.\n  Right now the Treasury Department is selling U.S. Government bonds to \nthe public, both here and abroad, and to the Social Security system. \nWhat that means is that whether Social Security is part of the budget \nor not, the Treasury Department will be selling exactly the same amount \nof bonds to the public, including those sold to the trust fund. And it \nis the amount of bond sales to the public that is the real measure of \nthe Federal deficits in any given year.\n  The unbreakable connection of an even theoretically off-budget Social \nSecurity system to the rest of the Federal budget will become even more \nclear by the year 2012 when the Social Security trust fund ceases to \ntake in more money than it pays outs. After that year, Social Security \nwill begin cashing in its Treasury bonds. So whether Social Security is \non budget our not is irrelevant, frankly, to the fact that the Treasury \nDepartment will have to find the cash to pay off those Treasury bonds.\n\n  There are only three basic ways that that can be done: issuing new \nbonds to the public, thereby increasing the Federal deficits in those \nyears; raising taxes by the amount necessary, which is another option; \nor cutting spending on other programs by the amounts needed. I hope we \nnever have to get to making those Draconian cuts. I believe that \npassing the balanced budget amendment will keep us from having to make \nthose choices under that gun.\n  Madam President, taking Social Security out of the budget, therefore, \ndoes nothing to make our long-term budget problems either better or \nworse. It does nothing to protect Social Security from the rest of the \nbudget because, again, Treasury bond purchases and sales continue to \nbind Social Security tightly to the rest of the budget. Perhaps most \nimportant, it does nothing to protect the long-term future of Social \nSecurity. The only way to protect the long-term future of Social \nSecurity and to keep the important Social Security contract with the \nAmerican people is through reform of that system.\n  Madam President, the balanced budget constitutional amendment will \nnot solve these problems overnight. What it will do, however, is force \nthe Congress, the President, and the American people, to face the truth \nabout the budget, all of it, both on the revenue and on the expenditure \nside of the equation.\n  Unless we get the deficit under control, we will be leaving to our \nchildren and to our children's children a legacy of debt that will make \nit impossible for them to achieve the American dream. We owe it to our \nchildren and their children to get our fiscal house in order now. If we \nfail to do so, our legacy to future generations will be one of greater \nproblems and diminished opportunities.\n  Madam President, I come from a working-class family. The availability \nof public education made it possible for me to get advanced degrees. I \nhave no doubt that without the commitment of my parents' generation to \ncreate a national community which would nurture my talents, I would not \nbe here today speaking to you as a U.S. Senator. It saddens me that it \nis harder for a child to get a quality education or for a teenager to \npay for college or for a young couple to have a single wage earner \noutside the home today than it was a generation ago.\n  The recent dismantling of our national commitment to support poor \nchildren is just the beginning of the chilling effect that these \nchronic budget deficits will have. We are faced with making hard \nchoices by which this generation will define our national community. \nThat is again why I support this amendment.\n  But, Madam President, whether we look to the future or look to the \npast, the arguments in favor of passage of the balanced budget \namendment are compelling.\n  As one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, stated:\n\n       We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \n     posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  This proposition is as true today as it was when he stated it \ncenturies ago.\n  Madam President, our country's debt did not emerge from a national \nemergency nor from some massive Federal initiative to build roads or \neducate children or to create jobs for poor people. It came in \npeacetime and, frankly, largely while no one noticed. When a national \nconsensus against chronic deficits did emerge, it came after the debt \nhad reached historic proportions.\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\n  Madam President, we should have known better. George Washington, in \nhis farewell address warned the Nation:\n\n       As a very important source of strength and security, \n     cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use \n     it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by \n     cultivating peace, but remembering, also, that timely \n     disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much \n     greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the \n     accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasion of \n     expense, but by exertions in times of peace, to discharge the \n     debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not \n     ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burdens which we \n     ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  Again, Madam President, sage advice from the Founding Fathers did \nnot, could not, overcome the pressures of the political and demographic \nrealities of our times. Legislators are often judged by constituents on \ntheir ability to--you may not have this expression in your State. But \nwe do in Illinois-- ``bring home the bacon'' whether in terms of actual \npork barrel project specific spending or in terms of across the board \nprogram funding. Each and every constituency wants its share. Each has \nlegitimate rationale for its demands.\n  However, these constituency demands must be seen in the long term and \noverarching context of our responsibility to the public interest. The \ndemographic changes the future holds will mean more demand, not less, \nfor health care and retirement security, at precisely the time that \nchanges in technology and the global economy requires more, not less, \ninvestment in education, transportation, and infrastructure. The \nconfluences of these trends which government does not control make more \nimportant than ever that we make decisions about those things we do \ncontrol. Passage of the balanced budget amendment will force a \ndiscipline in our decisionmaking which may well be the only force great \nenough to counter the institutional force in favor of secret spending.\n  I am not keen about tinkering with the Constitution. Happily, the \nFounding Fathers envisaged the periodic popularity of constitutional \namendments, and required absolute consensus in the process. I hope the \nbalanced budget amendment is one of the few to make it through the \nCongress and ratification by the States.\n  There have been amendments to the Constitution proposed for just \nabout everything in recent years. I hope, however, that this one which \nhad been suggested at the time of the Constitutional Convention, that \nthis one finally makes it through.\n  Now, Madam President, critics of the amendment have argued or warned \nus that a balanced budget amendment could worsen economic recessions or \ndownturns. The amendment, however, contains a safety valve for just \nthis sort of situation. The safety valve would allow Congress to \nprovide for a specific deficit by passing a law with a three-fifths \nvote in each House; the same vote, I point out, that is required to \nwaive the Budget Act. I believe in the event of an emergency or a \nrecession, Congress would be able, would be anxious to obtain a three-\nfifths majority to enact a countercyclical package of tax cuts or \ninvestment spending to counter the economic downturn. The requirement \nof the three-fifths majority, however, will ensure that the creation of \na specific deficit is done with deliberation and care, and is not a \ncasual occurrence.\n  This safety valve also applies to fears about risks of default. \nShould outlays exceed receipts and if our country were faced with a \nsituation where we were in danger of not being able to pay interest on \nour debt, Congress could respond with a three-fifths vote to increase \nthe debt. However, this dilemma could be avoided if Congress and the \nPresident followed the tenets of the amendment and actually balance the \nbudget, or, better yet, establish a rainy day emergency fund.\n  Madam President, an economist friend of mine who I had dinner with \nargued passionately that we should not be concerned about the debt \nbecause after all it is money that we owe ourselves. After all, the \ninterest is paid on Treasury bonds, so reduced to its essentials, it is \nmoney that is recirculated in other ways. I do not dispute that point. \nHowever, it seems to me that recycling large and growing amounts of \ntaxpayer money to bondholders represents a real problem that we ought \nto face up to, as well. We are putting off the books and out of \nCongress' control, scarce resources which are then no longer available \nfor our national priorities.\n  My friend also argues, further, that the balanced budget amendment \ndoes not allow for capital investment. Again, while most States that \nhave a balanced budget amendment do provide for a separate capital \nbudget, the balanced budget amendment that we are considering here \ntoday does not preclude Congress from enacting capital budgeting at the \nFederal level.\n  Another criticism is that should a three-fifths vote be necessary, it \nwould be difficult for Congress to obtain the votes to address \nemergencies. Again, the need to achieve a three-fifths vote majority is \nnot a foreign concept to this Congress. In the Senate, 60 votes are \nrequired to invoke cloture on a bill. Sixty votes are also necessary to \nwaive the enforcement provisions of the Budget Act. In each case, the \n60-vote mark is achieved or negotiations and compromise to develop an \nalternative way of proceeding.\n  One might point out now the way we obtain the majority necessary to \nraise the debt is for both parties to get the votes from their Members. \nTaking out partisanship is no less necessary under a 60-vote margin. On \nthe important issue of approving more debt, three-fifths is large \nenough to assure the decision is made with due deliberation but not so \nlarge that a minority in either House can deadlock the Government.\n  Critics also claim that a balanced budget amendment poses enforcement \nproblems, and I will for a moment address that. For instance, there are \nfears that disputes would go to the courts. I believe that elevating \nthe balanced budget amendment requirement to constitutional status \nwill, in and of itself, be enough to guarantee that it will be upheld. \nEvery Member of this Congress has taken an oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. The American people expect, as they \nhave every right to, that the officials to whom they entrust the \nConstitution will not betray that public trust.\n  Nor, however, do I believe that the amendment will unduly involve the \nFederal judiciary in matters of fiscal policy. Senate Joint Resolution \n1 provides ``the Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \nappropriate legislation * * *'' In other words, Congress is directed to \nenact legislation to make the amendment work. That can include, if \nnecessary, actions to limit the remedies a court could grant in a case \nbrought under the balanced budget amendment.\n  In addition, the courts have already developed a number of doctrines \nwhich will limit the type and the number of lawsuits which may be \nbrought under the act. First and foremost, all litigants must have \nstanding in order to bring a claim. This generally requires the \npotential plaintiffs to show they have suffered an injury, in fact, \nthat was caused by the alleged unlawful conduct and which is \nredressable by the courts. Courts have been extremely reluctant to \nconfer standing to litigants based on their status as taxpayers. \nFurthermore, courts have a longstanding practice of avoiding \ncontroversies that involve a political question. So, I believe, again, \nthat there are adequate safeguards to make certain that the courts do \nnot take over the constitutional function of this legislature under a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n\n  Madam President, the opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 have a \ngreat many arguments to support their view that a balanced budget \namendment is unnecessary and unwise. I do not doubt the sincerity of \ntheir opposition, for their ranks include a number of Senators with \nwhom I usually find myself in agreement. On balance, however, I believe \nthat the only way we will be able to turn the current budget trends \naround is to face reality with the help of the balanced budget \namendment. We must honestly address the budgetary, fiscal, and social \nissues of our time without resorting to the pocketbook resources of \nfuture generations.\n  As I stated at the outset, I am a liberal. My support of the balanced \nbudget amendment is logically consistent with that definition of \nliberalism that I previously outlined, for several reasons. The \nbalanced budget amendment\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\nwill save our ability to invest in people. It will protect our capacity \nfor humane government. And the balanced budget will help expand \npeople's opportunities. It is good policy and it is an idea whose time \nhas come.\n  Madam President, every generation of Americans has been able to \naddress and resolve challenges unique to their time. That is what makes \nthis country great. Our current fiscal challenges are daunting, but I \nam convinced that passage of this amendment will preserve our \nGovernment's ability to act to face our underlying budget problems--\nhonestly and directly--and save our ability to invest in people.\n  Passing a balanced budget amendment will not prevent the Government \nfrom acting to help address problems, and working to create expanded \nopportunities for Americans. It will mean that we will not abandon our \nresponsibility to help educate our children, to assist the poor in \nmoving into the economic mainstream, to protect our environment, or to \nexercise leadership in any number of areas of important public policy. \nBalancing the budget may be the critical element in our efforts to \npreserve the American dream of a better tomorrow.\n  I have no doubt but that this generation of Americans is as \ncompassionate and creative and patriotic as previous generations were. \nWe will be forced to make artificially draconian choices if we continue \nto spend what we do not have, and delude ourselves that debt passed on \nto future generations is not debt. The balanced budget amendment will \nforce a fiscal discipline which will be the first step toward ensuring \nour generation will adequately and honestly address its needs so that \nfuture generations will at least have the same opportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois. She may call herself a liberal, and that is fine with me. But \nshe has stood up on this amendment as one of our principal cosponsors \non the Democratic side of the floor, and that is one of the reasons \nthis amendment is as good as it is and why it is a bipartisan \namendment. I'm personally grateful to her for her courage in standing \nup for this. I think the generations will, as we pass this amendment, \nthank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for standing up and being \nwilling to articulate why this is so important. So, again, I want to \npersonally express my fondness for her and my feelings of what a great \njob she does on this issue and how I personally appreciate it. I have \nenjoyed her remarks. They have been right on point. I think she covered \nthe issues very well and, frankly, I hope everybody in this country is \nlistening to it.\n  As we close, I wanted to offer just a few final remarks on today's \ndebate.\n  First, I would once again like to thank all those who have \nparticipated so far in the debate. I especially wish to congratulate \nthose new Members who have made their first addresses on this important \nissue. I appreciate their participation.\n  Second, I would like to add just a few additional thoughts on the \nnotion of the so-called automatic stabilizers and the moderation of the \nbusiness cycle.\n  Madam President, I believe the importance of automatic stabilizers \nhas been overstated.\n  In her testimony before the Senate Budget Committee just last month, \nCBO Director June O'Neill responded to a question about the \neffectiveness of automatic stabilizers by citing better monetary policy \nand the Nation's move away from an agricultural based economy, with the \ninherent ups and downs that go along with agriculture, as factors at \nleast as important as automatic stabilizers in minimizing recessions. \nAdditionally, the move to a service economy and better inventory \nmanagement practices has reduced the fluctuations associated with \ninventory overstocks and the factory economy.\n  The global economy and greater business information and efficiency \nhave also contributed to a more stable economy.\n  Finally, there has been much discussion of who can take credit for \nthe recent reductions in the deficit.\n  I believe that, like the increases in the deficit, the credit is to \nbe shared. A recent article by Jim Miller, a former OMB Director shows \nvarious ways credit might be shared, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthat article be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the fight to adopt a balanced budget \namendment is a bipartisan one.\n  I congratulate my Democrat colleagues who have argued for the \nbalanced budget amendment. Their support shows that this constitutional \namendment is a nonpartisan solution to a nonpartisan problem.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Washington Times, January 15, 1997]\n\n                           (By James Miller)\n\n               Giving Credit Where Due for Lower Deficit\n\n       A week before the election, President Clinton announced the \n     scorecard for fiscal 1996 (which ended Sept. 31): the deficit \n     was $107 billion--lower than any time since 1981. As someone \n     who would easily take credit for a brilliant sunrise or a \n     starry night, Mr. Clinton wasted no time in claiming the \n     deficit record was the product of his ``economic plan.''\n       Credits aside, the deficit record is very good news indeed. \n     More U.S. saving is available for private investment, and the \n     Federal Reserve is less likely to act in such a way as to \n     restrain the economy. Tragically, had Congress adopted the \n     budget discipline President Reagan recommended in his 1988 \n     budget, the deficit would have been $108 billion and ``going \n     South'' eight years ago. Think of what spending restraint to \n     balance the budget (by 1991) would have meant for economic \n     growth in the meantime!\n       But who should get the credit for the latest deficit \n     figure? Bill Clinton likes to say his tax increase did the \n     trick, although in a moment of weakness he admits he raised \n     taxes too much. He also emphasizes his ``cuts'' in spending, \n     although in the package ultimately enacted most of the \n     claimed slowdown in spending growth takes place after 1996. \n     Is the Clinton economic plan of 1993 responsible for the \n     decline in the deficit?\n       It's especially helpful to focus on the outcomes in two \n     fiscal years, two years apart, reflecting two Congresses: \n     1994 and 1996, the first being the product of a Democratic \n     Congress, and the latter of a Republican Congress.\n       In April 1993, soon after taking office, Mr. Clinton \n     proposed a budget for 1994 that forecast a 9.2 percent \n     increase in receipts--from an estimated $1,146 billion for \n     1993 to $1,251 billion. The latter figure included $36 \n     billion in additional taxes from his economic plan (``A \n     Vision of Change for America'') announced two months earlier. \n     Actual receipts in 1994 were $1,258 billion--$7 billion more \n     than the initial forecast, and an increment due to the \n     economic boost attributable to further spending restraint \n     (see below). In the budget, Mr. Clinton proposed a 3.2 \n     percent increase in outlays--from an estimated $1,468 billion \n     to $1,515 billion, the latter figure reflecting his plan's $5 \n     billion net reduction from the spending baseline. Actual \n     outlays in 1994 were $1,461 billion--$54 billion less than \n     Mr. Clinton asked for. Clearly, the deficit reduction in \n     1994--from $255 billion (actual) to $203 billion (actual) was \n     due more to spending restraint by Congress ($54 billion) than \n     to Mr. Clinton's economic plan ($41 billion).\n       In 1995, receipts were $13 billion higher than forecast, \n     such forecast reflecting $47 billion in new taxes from \n     President Clinton's economic plan. Outlays were within $1 \n     billion of Mr. Clinton's request, which reflected an $18 \n     billion reduction from the baseline due to his economic plan. \n     The actual deficit fell from $203 billion to $164 billion, \n     and in this instance one can argue that Mr. Clinton's \n     economic plan is the major factor.\n       In February 1995, President Clinton submitted his budget \n     for 1996. In it, he forecast a 5.2 percent increase in \n     receipts--from $1,346 billion to $1,416 billion, the latter \n     figure reflecting a $54 billion increase due to his economic \n     plan. Actual receipts, announced a week before the election, \n     were $1,453 billion--$37 billion more than forecast, arguably \n     attributable to Congress' additional budget restraint (see \n     below). In that same budget, Mr. Clinton proposed a 4.7 \n     percent increase in outlays--from $1,539 billion to $1,612 \n     billion, the latter figure reflecting a $34 billion reduction \n     from the spending baseline due to passage of his economic \n     plan. Actual outlays were $1,560 billion--$52 billion less \n     than Mr. Clinton asked for. Thus, the sizable reduction in \n     the actual deficit in 1996--from $614 billion to $107 \n     billion--was due to additional spending restraint by Congress \n     ($52 billion) as well as the combined effects of the spending \n     restraint and the new taxes in President Clinton's original \n     economic plan ($88 billion).\n       Thus, if you give President Clinton all the credit for the \n     forecast changes due to his economic plan, he accounts for \n     $194 billion of reduction from the baseline deficit over the \n     three fiscal years, whereas Congress deserves credit for at \n     least $107 billion because of further spending restraint. If \n     you give Congress credit for the $57 billion revenue boost in \n     1996 (see below), Congress can claim credit for $164 billion \n     in deficit reduction. If you give Mr. Clinton credit only for \n     the tax portion of the plan (his negotiations with Congress \n     focused on its demand for spending restraints vs. his demand \n     for tax increase), Mr.\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n     Clinton's contribution is only $137 billion; Congress \n     accounts for the rest--$221 billion.\n       Of further interest here is that, contrary to the rhetoric \n     over alleged excesses of the (104th) Republican Congress in \n     paring programs indiscriminately, its record on spending in \n     its first year was almost precisely the same as that of the \n     first year of the last (103rd) Democratic Congress--both gave \n     the president some $50 billion less than he asked.\n       Receipts in 1994 (and 1993) were close to forecast. But \n     what explains the substantially larger-than-forecast receipts \n     in 1996? If the stock and bond markets are any guide, the \n     determination expressed by the new Republican majorities in \n     the House and Senate to balance the budget by restraining \n     spending improved the economic outlook and was responsible \n     for the better-than-expected economic performance during the \n     last fiscal year (3 percent real growth vs. 2.5 percent \n     forecast) which in turn led to higher federal receipts.\n\n                EFFECTS ON DEFICIT: CLINTON VS.

It strengthens \nMedicare and Medicaid, improves last year's welfare reform law, and \nprovides tax relief to help Americans raise their children, send them \nto college, and save for the future. It invests in education and \ntraining, the environment, science and technology, and law enforcement \nto raise living standards and the quality of life for average \nAmericans.\n  Over the last four years, my Administration and Congress have already \ndone much of the hard work of reaching balance in 2002. We have \nreversed the trend of higher deficits that we inherited, and we have \ngone almost two-thirds of the way to reaching balance. Now, I want to \nwork with Congress to achieve the final increment of deficit cutting \nand bring the budget into balance for the first time since 1969.\n\n\n                 building a bridge to the 21st century\n\n  For four years, my Administration has worked to prepare America for \nthe future, to create a Government and a set of policies that will help \ngive Americans the tools they need to compete in an increasingly \ncompetitive, global economy.\n  We have worked to create opportunity for all Americans, to demand \nresponsibility from all Americans, and to strengthen the American \ncommunity. We have worked to bring the Nation together because, as \nAmericans have shown time and again over the years, together we can \novercome whatever hurdles stand before us.\n  Working with Congress and the American people, we have put America on \nthe right path. Today, the United States is safer, stronger, and more \nprosperous. Our budget deficit is much smaller, our Government much \nleaner, and our policies much wiser.\n\n  The economic plan that we put in place in 1993 has exceeded all \nexpectations. Already, it has helped to reduce the deficit by 63 \npercent--from the record $290 billion of 1992 to just $107 billion in \n1996--and it has spurred a record of strong growth, low interest rates, \nlow inflation, millions of new jobs, and record exports for four years.\n  While cutting the deficit, we also have cut the Federal work force by \nover 250,000 positions, bringing it to its smallest size in 30 years \nand, as a share of the civilian work force, its smallest since the \n1930s. We have eliminated Federal regulations that we don't need and \nimproved the ones we do. And we have done all this while improving the \nservice that Federal agencies are providing to the American people.\n  We have cut wisely. We have, in fact, cut enough in unnecessary and \nlower-priority spending to find the resources to invest in the future. \nThat's why we were able to cut taxes for 15 million working families, \nto make college more affordable for 10 million students, to put tens of \nthousands of young people to work through national service, to invest \nmore in basic and biomedical research, and to help reduce crime by \nputting more police on the street.\n  My plan to reach balance in 2002 provides the resources to continue \nthese important investments. We must not only provide tax relief for \naverage Americans, but also increase access to education and training; \nexpand health insurance to the unemployed and children who lack it; \nbetter protect the environment; enhance our investments in biomedical \nand other research; beef up our law enforcement efforts; and provide \nthe needed funds for a thriving global policy and a strong defense.\n\n\n                  Putting the Building Blocks in Place\n\n  When my Administration took office in 1993, we inherited an economy \nthat had barely grown over the previous four years while creating few \njobs. The budget deficit had hit record levels, and experts in and out \nof Government expected it to go higher. Savings and investment were \ndown, interest rates were up, and incomes remained stagnant, making it \nharder for families to pay their bills.\n  We put in place a comprehensive set of policies that are bearing \nfruit. By cutting the deficit from $290 billion to $107 billion last \nyear, my economic program (and the strong economy it helped create) has \nbrought the deficit to its lowest level since 1981. As a share of Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP), we have our smallest deficit since 1974 and the \nsmallest of any major industrialized nation.\n  Other parts of my economic policy also are helping to create jobs and \nraise living standards. With regard to trade, for instance, my \nAdministration not only completed the Uruguay Round of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, but also more than 200 separate trade agreements, helping to \nraise exports to record levels. By opening overseas markets to American \ngoods--by encouraging free and fair trade--we are creating high-wage \njobs at home.\n  Taken together, our budget and trade policies have helped to create \nover 11 million new jobs in the last four years. After two decades of \ntroubling stagnation, incomes have begun to rise again\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\nwhile inequality shrinks. Also, partly due to a strong economy (and \npartly to our policies), poverty, welfare, and crime are down all \nacross America.\n  With strong growth, low interest rates, low inflation, millions more \njobs, record exports, more savings and investment, and higher incomes, \nthe Nation is enjoying what such experts as Alan Greenspan, the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve, have described as the healthiest \neconomy in a generation.\n  Now, our challenge is to complete the job that we began in 1993--to \nbring the budget into balance for the first time since 1969 while \ncontinuing to invest in the American people. My budget does that.\n\n\n            Improving Performance in a Balanced Budget World\n\n  Led by the Vice President's National Performance Review, we are truly \ncreating a Government that ``works better and costs less.''\n  We have cut the Federal work force by over 250,000 positions, \neliminated over 200 programs and projects, closed nearly 2,000 obsolete \nfield offices, cut red tape, and eliminated thousands of pages of \nregulations while dramatically simplifying thousands more. We also are \nproviding better service for Americans--at the Social Security \nAdministration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other agencies.\n  Our efforts to balance the budget will continue to put a premium on \nspending wisely. I am determined that we will provide the highest-\nquality service to Americans for the lowest price. And I will demand \nthat agencies continue to search for better and better ways to achieve \nresults for the American people.\n  As we move ahead, we plan to follow a series of strategies that build \nupon our successes to date. We will, for instance, restructure agencies \nto make them more flexible and decentralized. We will work to ensure \nthat Federal employees and their managers work together to achieve \ncommon goals. We will expand competition to ensure that agencies \nperform their functions as efficiently as possible.\n  Government cannot solve all of our problems, but it surely must help \nus solve many of them. We need an effective Government to serve as a \npartner with States, localities, business and labor, communities, \nschools, and families. Only when we can show the American people that \nGovernment can, in fact, work better for them can we restore their \nconfidence in it. And I am determined to do just that.\n\n\n   Creating Opportunity, Demanding Responsibility, and Strengthening \n                               Community\n\n  I worked with the last Congress to ensure that as many as 25 million \nAmericans no longer have to fear that they will lose their access to \nhealth insurance if they lose their jobs or change jobs; that people no \nlonger will be denied coverage because they have preexisting medical \nconditions; that insurance companies will sell coverage to small \nemployer groups and to individuals who lose group coverage; and that \nself-employed people will find it easier and cheaper to get health \ninsurance. Now, I want to strengthen both Medicare and Medicaid to \nensure that they continue to serve the tens of millions of Americans \nwho rely on them, to expand health care coverage to help the growing \nnumbers of American children and families who lack insurance, and to \npromote public health. My budget invests more in biomedical research, \nin programs to combat infectious diseases, in the Ryan White AIDS \nprogram that provides potentially life-extending drug therapies to many \npeople with AIDS, and in community health centers and Indian Health \nService facilities that serve critically underserved populations.\n  We have to ensure that every American has the skills and education \nneeded to win in the new economy, and we can do that only if every \nAmerican is ready for a lifetime of continuous learning. My budget \nexpands Head Start, increases our investments in Federal elementary and \nsecondary education programs, launches a new effort to jump-start \nneeded school renovation and construction, and provides funds for \nAmerica Reads to ensure that all children can read well and \nindependently by the end of third grade. To expand higher education and \ntraining to all Americans, I propose HOPE scholarship tax credits of up \nto $1,500 for two years, tax deductions of up to $10,000, the largest \nincrease in Pell Grant scholarships in two decades, lower student loan \nfees and interest rates, and the G.I. Bill for America's Workers so \nthey can choose where to get the best job training available.\n  We do not have to choose between a stronger economy and a cleaner \nenvironment. Over the last four years, we have produced both. Now, we \nwant to go further. In this budget, I am proposing the funds to speed \nup toxic waste clean-ups, to redevelop abandoned and contaminated sites \nknown as ``brownfields,'' to improve the facilities at our national \nparks, to advance our salmon recovery efforts, to invest in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy, to further our environmental efforts \noverseas, and to expand our work with States, localities, private \ngroups, and others to restore such sensitive ecosystems as the South \nFlorida Everglades and California's Bay-Delta area between San \nFrancisco and Sacramento.\n\n  We must maintain our leadership in research, the results of which \nhave so greatly improved our health and well-being. Federal research, \nin concert with the private sector, creates new knowledge, trains our \nworkers, generates new jobs and industries, solves many of our health \ncare challenges, strengthens our ability to address environmental \nissues, enables us to teach our children better, and ensures that we \ncan maintain a strong, capable national defense. I am proposing to \nincrease our investments in basic research in health sciences at the \nNational Institutes of Health, in basic research and education at the \nNational Science Foundation, in research at other agencies that depend \non science and technology, and in cooperative ventures with industry, \nsuch as through the successful Advanced Technology Program and \nManufacturing Extension Partnerships.\n  I want to build on our efforts to fight crime, curb the scourge of \nillegal drugs, and secure the Nation's borders. Crime is falling all \nacross America. And, under the Brady Bill that I fought so hard to \nachieve, we have prevented over 100,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers \nfrom obtaining guns. Now, I want to make further progress and, in \nparticular, target juvenile crime and violence. My budget continues our \nprogress toward putting 100,000 more police on the street. It renews \nour efforts to fight drug abuse, particularly by focusing on youth \nprevention programs to reverse the recent trends of softening attitudes \ntoward drugs and more drug use by young Americans. It also strengthens \nour efforts to control illegal immigration by stopping those who want \nto enter illegally, quickly removing those who slipped by, and making \nit harder for illegal immigrants to get jobs.\n  Because some American communities have grown disconnected from the \nopportunity and prosperity that most of us enjoy, I want to help \ncommunities attract private investment to spur their revitalization. \nBecause permanent solutions must come from the community level, my \nbudget proposes to create opportunities and offer incentives for \nindividuals and businesses to participate directly in addressing local \nproblems. I want to expand my national service program so that more \nAmericans can volunteer and earn money for college. I want to expand \nEmpowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, making more and more \ncommunities eligible for the tax incentives and other support that can \nspur a return to business and jobs. I also want to expand the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund to enhance credit and other \nservices to distressed areas. In addition, the Nation's capital, which \nsuffers from a unique set of challenges, would benefit greatly from the \ngroundbreaking proposal that I have previously outlined.\n  I am pleased that, today, 2.1 million fewer Americans are on welfare \nthan the day I took office, both because of a strong economy and \nbecause I have helped States to test innovative ways to move people \nfrom welfare to work and protect children. I am also pleased that I \ncould sign last year's welfare reform legislation, because I believe it \nwill promote my basic goals of work, family, and responsibility. I have \ndirected my Administration to work closely with States so that we can \nmake welfare reform succeed. Last year's law, however, also included \nexcessive budget cuts, mainly affecting\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nnutrition programs, legal immigrants, and children, that had nothing to \ndo with welfare reform. In signing the bill, I said that I would seek \nlegislation to address those problems. My budget does that.\n  Over the last four years, we have provided tax relief to millions of \nworking Americans and to small businesses. But I want to go further by \nhelping middle-income Americans raise their children, send them to \ncollege, and save for the future. For those Americans, my tax plan \noffers a $500 per child tax credit for all children under 13, a $1,500-\na-year tax credit to help families send their children to college for \ntwo years, a $10,000 tax deduction for tuition and fees for higher \neducation and training, and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts to \nencourage saving and enable families to cope with unforeseen problems. \nI am also proposing to ensure that homeowners do not have to pay \ncapital gains taxes on 99 percent of all home sales. My tax plan would \npromote the hiring of long-term welfare recipients in order to help \nmove people from welfare to work, restore the tax credit that \nencourages business research and development, and expand tax credits \nfor Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. And it would help \nfinance my tax relief by eliminating unwarranted tax loopholes and \npreferences.\n\n  On the international front, we must continue to project our \nleadership abroad while we advance our national goals. With the Cold \nWar over, we have a great opportunity to expand democracy overseas, but \nwe will have a much better chance to succeed if we fulfill our \ninternational commitments. In this budget, I am proposing that we pay \nour arrears to the United Nations and other international \norganizations, so that our leadership is not undermined at this crucial \ntime. But I will also insist that these institutions control their \nbudgets and enact the reforms that our Government and others have \ncalled for. In addition, we must continue our support for Russia and \nthe New Independent States of the Soviet Union as they make the \ndifficult transition to free markets and democracy, and we must be \nprepared to do whatever we can to advance the difficult, but vital, \npeace process in the Middle East. A strong, coherent foreign policy \nalso will help us further our progress in opening markets abroad, and \nmy budget proposes strong, continued support for the Federal efforts \nthat help to expand exports.\n  Finally, our goals both at home and abroad must rest on the firm \nfoundation of a strong national defense. It is a strong defense that \nsafeguards our interests, prevents conflict, and secures the peace. We \nmust ensure that our armed forces are highly ready and armed with the \nbest equipment that technology can provide. They must be prepared and \ntrained for the new threats to our security--from the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, to ethnic and regional conflicts, to \nterrorism and drug trafficking that directly threaten our free and open \nsociety. My budget continues to sustain and modernize the world's \nstrongest and most ready military force, a force capable of prevailing \nin two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts. It fully funds our \ncommitment to maintain the highest levels of training and readiness, \nand to equip our uniformed men and women with the most advanced \ntechnologies in the world. We must never fall short when it comes to \ndefense.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Our policies are working. By dramatically cutting the deficit and \ninvesting in the future, we have helped to spur four years of strong \neconomic growth, providing vast new opportunities for millions of \nAmericans. Jobs, incomes, savings, investment, exports, and \nhomeownership are all up. Crime, poverty, teen pregnancy, and \ninequality are all down. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction.\n  But our work is not done. For too long, the Federal Government has \nspent much more than it received, creating deficits that cast doubt on \nboth our economic future and our ability to govern. In the last four \nyears, we have made high progress, cutting the deficit by nearly two-\nthirds. I urge Congress to help me finish the job and balance the \nbudget by 2002--giving the American people the balanced budget they \ndeserve.\n                                                  William J.

We should \n     consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \n     debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves''; and\n       Whereas, the principal functions of the Constitution of the \n     United States include promoting the broadest principles of a \n     government of, by, and for the people; setting forth the most \n     fundamental responsibilities of government; and enumerating \n     and limiting the powers of the government to protect the \n     basic rights of the people; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow involves decisions of such magnitude, with such \n     potentially profound consequences for the nation and its \n     people, today and in the future, that it is appropriately a \n     subject for limitation by the Constitution of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove of \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States with the \n     people of the several States, as represented by their elected \n     Legislatures; and\n       Whereas, opposition by a small minority within Congress \n     and, on occasion, by the President, has repeatedly thwarted \n     the will of the people of the United States that a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     should be submitted to the States for ratification while \n     large majorities of both Houses of Congress already have \n     prepared considered, and voted for such amendment; now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     Concurring, That the General Assembly of the State of Iowa \n     requests the members of the Congress of the United States to \n     expeditiously pass, and to propose to the Legislatures of the \n     several States for ratification, an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States requiring in the absence of \n     a national emergency that the total of all federal \n     appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal year not \n     exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues for that \n     fiscal year; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Legislatures of each of the \n     several States comprising the United States be urged to apply \n     to the Congress requesting the proposal for ratification of \n     such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States; \n     and be it\n       Further Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     members of Iowa's congressional delegation, and the presiding \n     officers of each house of the Legislatures of each of the \n     other States.\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\n       We, Ron J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na mechanism for taxpayers to designate $1 of any overpayment of income \ntax, and to contribute other amounts, for use by the United States \nOlympic Committee; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE UNITED STATES OLYMPIC CHECKOFF ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I bring to the Senate the United \nStates Olympic Checkoff Act. This bill would provide significant--and \nneeded--new funding for our Nation's amateur athletic movement. This \nwill present a way for Americans to show support for the United States \nOlympic Committee, the USOC, and for our amateur athletes. Simply by \nchecking a box on their tax returns, American taxpayers could designate \na dollar from their refunds to go to the USOC, or they could enclose a \ncontribution to the USOC when they mail their tax forms. This concept \nis similar to the existing Presidential checkoff. It is different \nthough, in that this deduction for the Olympic Committee would come \nfrom the taxpayers' own money, their refunds or their contributions, \nand not from the money destined for the Federal Treasury.\n  The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 made the USOC the central coordinating \nbody for amateur sports in the United States. The responsibilities of \nthe act, that is the responsibilities given by the act to the USOC, \ninclude training and selecting athletes to represent the United States \nat international competitions and, equally important, encouraging \nathletic activities for all amateur athletes in the United States \nthrough grassroots sports opportunities.\n  What the Amateur Sports Act does not do is authorize Federal funding \nof the USOC. In almost every other nation in the world, Olympic and \namateur sports receive substantial government funding. That is not true \nin our country. The USOC's primary means of raising money to support \nU.S. athletes and to carry out the purposes of the act is through \ncharging sponsors a fee to use the words ``Olympics'' or ``Olympiad,'' \nand to display the Olympic symbol of five interlocking rings. Sponsors' \nfees do not come close to providing the funds necessary to train our \ngrowing legions of athletes. Our athletes at the grassroots level are \nnot getting a fair chance to be competitive with their counterparts \nfrom nations that provide funding from government sources.\n  My bill would create a new trust fund in the Treasury called the \nUnited States Olympic Trust Fund. The amounts voluntarily contributed \nby Americans would be deposited into the trust fund. At least once \nquarterly, the Secretary of Treasury would distribute the amounts in \nthe trust fund to the USOC, after deducting reasonable administrative \ncosts.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee and all \nof the Senate and the House to achieve enactment of this valuable \nlegislation in this Congress. I hope this bill will be welcomed by all \nAmericans who believe in the importance of our country's athletic \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a recurring bi-annual Olympic \ncommemorative coins program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE OLYMPIC COMMEMORATIVE COINS ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a second bill pertaining to \namateur sports I would like to present to the Senate today. This will \ncreate a recurring Olympic Commemorative Coins Program in the United \nStates to provide valuable souvenirs to amateur sports enthusiasts, and \na new source of revenue to the United States Olympic Committee, the \nUSOC. These are sort of companion bills. The second bill would require \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the USOC and the Citizens \nCommemorative Coin Advisory Committee on the design of a $1 silver coin \nwhich would commemorate each summer and winter Olympic games held \noutside the United States. Only 500,000 of such coins would be minted.\n  Under the bill, a new commemorative coin would be issued every 2 \nyears. The summer and winter Olympics are now staggered, so that, as we \nall know, now there is an Olympic games every 2 years.\n  Each coin would carry a surcharge of $10 and that money would be \ntransferred by the Secretary of the Treasury to the USOC. The Secretary \nof Treasury would be required to include in the sale price of each coin \nan additional amount to pay for the costs of the program. If the coins \nsell as they have in the past, and these have been very successful \nprograms in the past, the USOC could receive a total of about $5 \nmillion for each Olympic games, in other words every 2 years. This \nwould go a long way toward supporting our amateur athletes and carrying \nout our responsibilities of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. In years \nwhen the Olympics are held inside the United States, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury would be required to develop an expanded multicoin program \nto commemorate our Olympic Games. This program, designed by the \nSecretary, with the USOC and the Coins Committee, could provide 4 or 5 \ndifferent gold, silver or other coins in numbers larger than the \n500,000 for the games that are held outside the United States. These \nwould be of special interest to travelers who would come to the United \nStates for the Olympic games.\n  My bill also provides discretion with respect to the surcharge in \neach coin. This would make it possible for U.S. athletes and the USOC \nto receive an even greater benefit from each coin. In the first 2 \nmonths after the new Olympic Coins Program begins, the Secretary of \nTreasury would be prohibited from issuing other commemorative coins. In \nother words, we would like to have one period, every 2 years, of 2 \nmonths in which the USOC's coins, the Olympic coins, would be the only \ncoins available.\n  The Amateur Sports Act made the USOC, as I said before, the central \ncoordinating body for amateur sports in the United States. It does give \nthe USOC the duty to not only select and train athletes to represent \nthe United States at international competitions, but to encourage \nathletic activities through a grassroots sports program.\n  I believe that the USOC carries out the Amateur Sports Act well, in \nview of the fact it does not receive support from Federal \nappropriations. As I said before, the act does not authorize such \nappropriations.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, unless we find a source of revenue for the \nUSOC, we are going to have a situation where it cannot carry out the \nresponsibilities that were given it by Congress in 1978.\n  Last year, the Senate Commerce Committee began a review of the \nAmateur Sports Act. During our first two hearings, we determined \nadditional revenues are needed to provide greater grassroots sports \nopportunities in our country.\n  Toward this end, the bill I am introducing would require at least 25 \npercent of the revenues received by the USOC under the coins program \nwould be used solely for promoting grassroots sports opportunities, and \nit would require USOC to use at least 25 percent of the revenues to \npromote and encourage physical fitness and public participation in \namateur athletic activities; to assist organizations and persons \nconcerned with sports in the development of special amateur athletic \nprograms for amateurs in our country; and it would also foster the \ndevelopment of amateur athletic facilities for use by amateur athletes, \nas well as assist in making existing amateur athletic facilities \navailable and to modernize them, Mr. President, which is necessary for \ntheir use by amateur athletes now in this country.\n  I look forward on this bill to working with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe this bill will be \nsent to that committee. It is important legislation to be enacted in \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission on Structural Alternatives \nfor the Federal Court of Appeals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nTHE STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS COMMISSION \n                       ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which would \nestablish a Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Court \nof Appeals.\n  This commission would study the present division of the United States \ninto the several judicial circuits, study the structure and alignment \nof the Federal Court of Appeals system, with particular reference to \nthe ninth circuit, and report recommendations to the President and \nCongress on appropriate changes in circuit boundaries or structure for \nthe expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the \nFederal Court of Appeals, consistent with fundamental conceptions of \nfairness and due process.\n  As you may know, I have cosponsored legislation in the past that \nwould have split the ninth circuit. I have not altered my opinion of \nthe need for this, however, it seems that some of my colleagues need a \nlittle bit more convincing. That is why I believe having a well-formed \ncommission, which examines this issue closely and delivers a \nnonpolitical response, will dispel the doubts that my colleagues have \nabout a split.\n  I believe that the commission will begin to answer some of the \nconcerns that Montanans have voiced that they are not obtaining the \nsame level of judicial consideration as others in the ninth circuit. \nConsidering the size of the district, I have the same doubts. The ninth \ncircuit is now comprised not only of Montana, but also, Alaska, \nArizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, the Northern Mariana Islands, \nNevada, Oregon, and Washington. That's nine States and two \nprincipalities. The ninth circuit is about twice the size of the next \nlargest circuit, both in population and geography.\n  Its caseload is among the fastest growing in the Nation, and the time \nto complete an average appeal, more than 14 months, is more than 4 \nmonths longer than the national average. Its 28 judges are about twice \nthe recommended number for an appellate circuit.\n  Any objective view of the ninth circuit is a case study in the phrase \n``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' I am optimistic that a \ncommission that studies the ninth will come to the same conclusion: \nThis body will acknowledge this travesty and finally move for justice \nfor all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 284. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to improve \nsafety at public railway-highway crossings, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     the highway rail grade crossing safety formula enhancement act\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation to provide a more effective method of targeting available \nFederal funds to enhance safety at our Nation's most hazardous highway-\nrail grade crossings.\n  I first introduced this measure during the 104th Congress following 2 \nyears of work to address a pressing public safety problem occurring in \nIndiana and other rail-intensive States. It is my hope this important \nlegislation will be given thoughtful and thorough consideration this \nyear as Congress moves to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. It is unclear what the final \nprogram structure will look like, or what the specific Federal role \nwill be in the transportation decisionmaking process. I will work this \nyear to assure that the goals of this rail safety legislation are \nincorporated as part of an ISTEA reauthorization bill that creates a \nmore streamlined, flexible Federal highway program to help States \nmaintain safe, effective, and efficient transportation networks.\n  In America today, several hundred people are killed and thousands \nmore injured every year as a result of vehicle-train collisions at \nhighway-rail grade crossings. A significant number of these accidents \noccur in rail-intensive States such as Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, \nCalifornia, and Texas. One quarter of the Nation's 168,000 public \nhighway-rail grade crossings are located in these 5 States. They \naccounted for 38 percent of deaths and 32 percent of injuries caused by \nvehicle-train collisions nationwide during 1991-1993.\n  My home State of Indiana ranks sixth in the Nation for number of \ntotal public grade crossings with about 6,700, and is annually among \nthe top five States for numbers of accidents and fatalities caused by \nvehicle-train crashes.\n  In 1994, I travelled across northern Indiana aboard a QSX-500 \nlocomotive and witnessed what engineers see every day--motorists \ndarting across the railroad tracks before an oncoming train. From this \nexperience, and from my work to improve safety at highway-rail grade \ncrossings, I learned that engineering solutions, along with education \nand awareness about grade crossing safety, are key strategies that can \neffectively prevent grade crossing accidents.\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\n  Responding to this disturbing national trend, I began working in 1993 \nwith Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and with the Indiana \nDepartment of Transportation to address this serious safety problem. We \nworked to find solutions that would help Indiana and other States make \nbetter use of available funds to target the Nation's most hazardous \nrail crossings.\n  The Federal Government has played an important role in helping States \neliminate accidents and fatalities at public highway-rail intersections \nsince passage of the Highway Safety Act by Congress in 1973. This act \ncreated the Rail-Highway Crossing Program, also known as the Section \n130 Program. Since the program's inception, more than 28,000 \nimprovement projects have been undertaken--from installation of warning \ngates, lights and bells, to pavement improvements and grade separation \nconstruction projects.\n  During the 103d Congress, I introduced grade crossing safety \nlegislation to restore States' discretion over millions of Federal \nhighway dollars lost as a result of noncompliance with the Federal \nmotorcycle helmet law. Indiana and other States affected by this law \nwere prohibited from using a portion of their highway construction \ndollars to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings. I was \npleased the Congress repealed the helmet law penalty in 1995 as part of \nthe National Highway System designation legislation. States now have \ngreater flexibility to use their highway dollars for improvements at \nrail crossings, and for other transportation priorities.\n  In March 1994, Senator Coats and I asked the General Accounting \nOffice to conduct a survey of rail safety programs in Indiana and other \nrail intensive States experiencing a high number of accidents at \nhighway-rail grade crossings. Released in August 1995, the report \n``Railroad Safety: Status of Efforts to Improve Railroad Crossing \nSafety'' evaluated the best uses of limited Federal funds for rail \ncrossing safety, reviewed policy changes that help State and local \ngovernments address rail safety issues, and recommended strategies to \nencourage interagency and intergovernmental cooperation.\n  The report found that in addition to States' efforts to reduce \naccidents and fatalities through emphasis on education programs, \nengineering solutions, and enforcement of traffic laws, changes to the \nFederal funding formulas would target highway funds to areas of \ngreatest risk.\n  Under, ISTEA, the Section 130 Program was continued--with a portion \nof the 10 percent of a State's STP safety funds dedicated to highway-\nrail crossing improvement and hazard elimination projects.\n  The GAO reported that key indicators or ``risk factors'' used to \nassess rail-grade crossing safety are not taken into account when STP \nfunds are distributed among States. The GAO outlined the Federal \nHighway Administration's [FHWA] work to review options for STP formula \nchanges that adjust the current flat percentage allocation to include \nthese risk factors. Applying these factors to the funding formula \ncreates a more targeted and focused process that maximizes the \neffectiveness of Federal funds.\n  The risk factors criteria considered by FHWA include a State's share \nof the national total for number of public crossings, number of public \ncrossings with passive warning devices, total number of accidents, and \ntotal number of fatalities occurring as a result of vehicle-train \ncollisions at highway-rail grade crossings.\n  For example, while Indiana received 3.4 percent of section 130 funds \nin fiscal year 1995, the Hoosier State experienced 6.1 percent of the \nNation's accidents and 5.9 percent of the fatalities as a result of \nvehicle-train collisions from 1991 to 1993. In addition, Indiana has \nabout 4 percent of the Nation's public rail crossings.\n  Preliminary estimates of STP apportionments under a risk-based \napportionment formula indicate Indiana's share of section 130 funds \ncould increase by 49 percent, from the fiscal year 1997 level of $4.9 \nto $7.3 million. Overall, about 21 States would receive a substantial \nincrease in section 130 funds for grade crossing improvements, \nincluding: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.\n  While the Indiana Department of Transportation [INDOT] spends over \n$10 million a year to improve highway-rail grade crossings, a 49-\npercent increase in section 130 funds would allow INDOT and other State \ndepartments of transportation additional resources to improve hazardous \nhighway-rail grade crossings.\n  The Formula Enhancement Act addresses the allocation problem by \nadjusting the funding formula for the STP to include an apportionment \nof funds to States for the section 130 Program based on a 3-year \naverage of these risk factors. I want to express my appreciation to the \nFHWA and to the Federal Railroad Administration for their valuable \nassistance in preparing this legislation.\n\n  This legislation will help improve the way the Federal Government \ntargets existing resources to enhance safety on our Nation's highways \nand along our rail corridors. This legislation does not call for new \nFederal spending, but rather for a more equitable and effective \ndistribution of existing highway funds to States to enhance safety at \ndangerous highway-rail grade crossings.\n  This legislation addresses one aspect of the grade crossing safety \nproblem by refining a key provision of the existing ISTEA law. Using \nthis proposal as a foundation, I am hopeful the Congress will craft \nprovisions for the highway reauthorization bill that recognize the \noverall efforts of States to implement comprehensive rail safety \nprograms. An effective grade crossing safety program integrates \nconstruction improvement projects with driver education and awareness \nprograms, crossing closures, vigorous enforcement of crossing traffic \nlaws and assessments of crossing inventories to identify the most \nhazardous crossings in a State.\n  I will work with my colleagues this year to help assure Congress \npasses highway reauthorization legislation that makes the best use of \navailable Federal resources while encouraging States to continue \npursuing comprehensive efforts to address their public grade crossing \nsafety requirements. My intent with this legislation is not to penalize \ncertain States or to create winners or losers in the process of \ndistributing Federal highway funds, but to find the best solution that \nwill eliminate these preventable tragedies.\n  At this time, it is unclear what direction the next highway \nauthorization bill will take, what the Federal role will be in \nmaintaining the national transportation infrastructure, and what \ncurrent ISTEA programs will be renewed. Last year, I endorsed Senator \nWarner's reauthorization proposal to provide a more streamlined and \nflexible highway program that returns resources and authority back to \nthe States. My intent with this legislation during this reauthorization \nprocess is not to protect a particular highway program or specific \nFederal set-aside requirement of the expiring ISTEA law, but rather to \ncontinue emphasizing an issue of great importance to my State of \nIndiana and to other States experiencing rail safety problems. I will \nadvocate grade crossing safety as a priority within the context of \nother key funding and flexibility issues that are vital to the \ncontinued safety and mobility of Hoosiers traveling on Indiana \nroadways. I am hopeful this legislation will reinforce the importance \nof highway-rail grade crossing safety as the Congress moves forward \nwith the national discussion of U.S. transportation policy for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Continued emphasis on finding new and better ways to target existing \nresources to enhance safety at highway-rail grade crossings will \ncontribute to the overall effort in Congress and in the States to \nprevent accidents, save lives, and sustain a balanced and effective \ntransportation network for the Nation.\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Senator Lugar and I are introducing \ntoday legislation which will more effectively direct Federal funding to \nthose States which have the greatest needs with highway-rail grade \ncrossings.\n  We first introduced this bill in the 104th Congress after recognizing \na critical deficiency at rail grade crossings which has contributed \nsenseless, tragic deaths over the years.\n  This year as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA]\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\nis reauthorized, it is my hope that the committee will seriously \nconsider the needs of rail-intensive States, such as Indiana. While the \nfinal structure of ISTEA is still unknown, I will work to ensure that \nthe objectives of this legislation are incorporated in the final \nhighway bill.\n  Rail transportation is important in Indiana, playing a key role in \nthe State's agriculture and manufacturing economy. Much of the rail \nactivity goes through northwest Indiana which accounts for 75 percent \nof the State's rail crossing accidents. In 1994, Indiana ranked third \nin the Nation with 263 rail crossing accidents, resulting in the deaths \nof 27 people. Six percent of all rail crossing accidents in America \ntook place in Indiana and 5.9 percent of the fatalities occurred there.\n  Several years ago, I became aware that Indiana and a number of other \nStates had a critical problem with rail accidents. Senator Lugar and I \nasked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to examine the safety \nconditions in States with a high concentration of rail crossings. The \nGAO report, completed in August 1995, revealed that while Indiana had a \nlarge number of rail crossings--6,700, the sixth largest number of all \nStates--the State received only 3.4 percent of the Federal funding \navailable specifically targeted to prevent such tragedies.\n  The Section 130 Program was established in 1973 to help States reduce \naccidents, injuries, and fatalities at public railroad crossings. In \nthe first 10 years of the program, accidents declined by 61 percent and \ndeaths were reduced by 34 percent. Since 1985, little progress was made \ntoward further reducing these numbers.\n  The problem becomes apparent when you realize that many of the States \nwith the highest concentration of crossings, number of accidents, and \nfatalities receive less money than States that do not have as great a \nneed. Thus, the GAO included that the Federal Government should examine \nfunding formulas and consider using risk factors in determining how to \ndistribute section 130 highway dollars to States for rail safety \npurposes.\n  The current formula funding--based on 10 percent of a State's surface \ntransportation program [STP] funding--does not take into account such \nessential criteria as a State's total number of crossing, amount of \ntrain traffic, nor the number of accidents and fatalities. I believe it \nis critical that these risk factors be considered in determining how \nmuch money a State should receive for rail safety under the current \nfunding structure.\n  The formula enhancement bill would correct this flaw in the current \nformula. Based on the GAO report and work with the Federal Highway \nAdministration, we crafted this legislation to ensure that States with \nthe greatest risk receive more money. This bill does not increase \nFederal spending. Rather it ensures that money is targeted to those \nStates with the most serious safety concerns.\n  Using this more equitable way of disbursing funds, Indiana--which \nreceived $4.9 million in fiscal year 1997--could receive $7.3 million \nin fiscal year 1998. Overall, 21 States would benefit substantially \nfrom increased funding to help reduce rail crossing accidents.\n  Clearly, this bill addresses one aspect of law, providing a fairer \ndistribution of resources. But money alone will not solve all the \nproblems related to rail crossing accidents. A comprehensive plan to \neducate people about the dangers at rail crossings must be developed. I \nsupport the efforts of programs like Operation Lifesaver which works \neffectively to get information to citizens. Continued cooperation among \nall levels of government: local, State, and Federal is essential to \nstop these sort of tragedies.\n  There are many issues facing the Congress this year as we decide \nfunding levels, formulas, and determine the role of the Federal \nGovernment in the context of the highway authorization. I supported \nSenator Warner's legislation last year to provide for a streamlined, \nflexible, and equitable highway program. I continue to believe this \napproach is best for the States to address their fundamental needs and \npriorities. The STEP-21 proposal would ensure that States receive a \nfairer return on highway funding and the flexibility to spend the \nresources according to State and local priorities. My purpose in \nintroducing this rail legislation at this time is to draw attention to \nthis serious problem facing Indiana and other States and to show my \ndetermination to make rail crossing safety a priority as we make the \nkey decisions on ISTEA.\n  We cannot afford to neglect the safety of our citizens at rail grade \ncrossings. We must find ways to address these critical problems. \nOverall, the safety of our highways and rail is essential as we examine \nand make decisions on the future of our transportation system. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our focus is \nindeed comprehensive in addressing our transportation needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 285. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income any distribution from a qualified State tuition \nprogram used exclusively to pay qualified higher education expenses \nincurred by the designated beneficiary, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    THE TUITION TAX ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, the Tuition Tax Elimination Act, which will help make \ncollege more affordable for thousands of young people all across \nAmerica. I am pleased that Senators Sessions, DeWine, Hutchinson, \nFaircloth, Cochran, and Smith of New Hampshire have joined me as \noriginal cosponsors. This bill will eliminate a new Federal tax on the \ntuition expenses of students participating in State prepaid tuition \nprograms. Here is how the tax came about.\n  It is no secret that many families in our Nation are struggling to \nfinance their childrens' education. College tuition costs have \nskyrocketed in the past decade increasing 95 percent at private \ninstitutions and 82 percent at public institutions. Newsweek magazine \nreported last year that some families will spend more than $100,000 \njust to send one child to college.\n  To combat the high cost of a college education, many States, \nincluding Alabama, have set up prepaid tuition funds. These funds allow \nparents to make a tax-free investment, years in advance of their \nchild's enrollment in college, with the guarantee that the child's \ntuition will be paid for by the State when he or she enrolls in \ncollege.\n  Last year, the IRS attempted to impose taxes on States operating \nprepaid tuition funds by claiming that the funds were not legitimate \nfunctions of the State and thus not exempt from Federal taxation. If \nthe IRS had been successful in their attempt, many States would have \nbeen forced to terminate their prepaid tuition programs.\n  Fortunately, Senators McConnell, Graham, and I were able to get a \nprovision in the Small Business Job Protection Act which clarified that \nprepaid tuition programs should not be subject to Federal taxes, since \nthey are a legitimate function of State governments.\n  At the same time, the IRS was also attempting to impose a tax on the \nparents' contributions to these State prepaid tuition programs. What \nthe IRS wanted to do was to count the annual increased value of the \nparents' contribution as income and tax it. Again, Senators McConnell, \nGraham, and I put a provision in the minimum wage bill last year to \nprevent the IRS from taking those actions.\n  However, there was a provision of that bill which I did not support. \nIt provided that when a student enrolls in college under a prepaid \ntuition plan, the student must pay taxes on the difference between the \nvalue of the tuition costs, which are paid by the State, and the amount \nhis or her parent paid for the contract. Essentially, this provision is \na new tax on students. I attempted to offer an amendment to strike this \nprovision, but unfortunately, no amendments were in order.\n  Mr. President, prepaid tuition programs are a creative way many \nStates all across the country have developed to help more young people \nafford a college education. We need to do everything we can at the \nFederal level to encourage these types of programs.\n  The Tuition Tax Elimination Act will do that by relieving students \nfrom Federal taxes on their tuition expenses. This legislation will \nprovide\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nthat distributions from qualified prepaid tuition funds are not to be \ncounted as taxable income for the student, as long as the money is \nspent for the designated purpose.\n  This legislation is fully paid for with a provision which would \nsuspend the automatic inflation adjustments used to award the earned \nincome tax credit to individuals without children. President Clinton's \n1993 tax bill expanded the EITC to cover individuals without children, \nand currently, a childless individual earning between $4,220 and $5,280 \nis eligible for a maximum EITC amount of $323. Each year, these income \nlevels are adjusted upward for inflation. Many people have questioned \nwhether we should even be providing the EITC to individuals without \nchildren. However, that is a question which can be addressed in other \nlegislation. This offset does not eliminate the EITC for individuals \nwithout children; it simply eliminates the annual increase in the EITC \ncalculation for individuals who have no dependents. This provision \npassed the Senate last year as a part of welfare reform, but it was \ndropped in conference.\n  Mr. President, the cost of going to college is now more expensive \nthan ever, and is growing much faster than inflation. Eliminating the \ntax students will face on their tuition expenses is a real step toward \nmaking college more affordable for thousands of young people all across \nAmerica, and I hope my colleagues join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Frist, Mr. Nickles, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Shelby, Mr. Coats, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 286. A bill to provide for a reduction in regulatory costs by \nmaintaining Federal average fuel economy standards applicable to \nautomobiles in effect at current levels until changed by law, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n        THE CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation with \nSenators Levin and Ashcroft that would freeze the corporate average \nfuel economy standards--known as CAFE--at current levels unless changed \nby Congress.\n  Enacted in 1975, CAFE established Federal requirements regulating the \naverage fleet fuel economy of new passenger cars and light trucks. Now \nthere are a number of reasons why the CAFE standards should continue to \nbe frozen at their current level, and there is a great deal of \ninformation available which documents CAFE's harmful effects. Rest \nassured, I'll touch on both these topics in a moment. But there is one \noverriding reason this legislation needs to be adopted: control of CAFE \nstandards must reside with the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, the control of CAFE standards is too great a \nresponsibility to be entrusted to any entity other than the Congress. \nCAFE requirements were initiated over 20 years ago in response to an \noil crisis that has long since disappeared. New standards would \nconstitute the most tremendous regulation foisted on the automobile \nindustry in over two decades and would require a massive retooling, at \ngreat cost, by America's automakers.\n  This is an industry that employs 2.3 million Americans and is \nestimated to provide 4.4 percent of this Nation's GDP. Should the \nauthority to impose upon this industry a new regulation with \nquestionable goals and dubious results reside with unelected \nbureaucrats? Should regulators at the Department of Transportation have \nthe authority to change CAFE standards at any time, for any reason and \ndo so without congressional approval? The answer to these questions is \nclearly no. Such a decision in my view belongs with this legislature, \nthe body entrusted by our Constitution with the duty to determine \nwhether any proposed policy change is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  The other question we need to ask is why a CAFE increase should be \nconsidered at all. When CAFE was instituted, it was part of a larger \neffort to regulate oil consumption and reduce America's dependence on \nforeign oil. Today, however, it is clear that CAFE standards failed to \nachieve this goal. Domestic manufacturers have increased passenger car \nfuel economy 108 percent and light truck fuel economy almost 60 percent \nsince the mid-1970's. Rather than decreasing during this time, however, \noil imports have increased. In 1974 the United States imported 35 \npercent of its oil--last year this country imported between 45 and 50 \npercent of its oil.\n  Now, with CAFE's obvious failure to reduce oil imports, CAFE \nproponents cite the threat of potential global warming as the major \nrationale for increasing these standards further. Mr. President, the \nargument that CAFE standards will prevent or reduce global warming is \nas weak as the argument that CAFE would reduce this country's reliance \non foreign oil.\n  According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, cars \nand light trucks subject to CAFE standards account for only one and \n1\\1/2\\ percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing \nCAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon, as has been discussed, would \nresult in minuscule reductions in emissions--less than one-half of 1 \npercent.\n  There can be no doubt, Mr. President, that CAFE standards have failed \nto reduce America's dependency on foreign oil or significantly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. So what have they succeeded in doing? They \nhave succeeded in putting domestic automobile manufacturers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage and putting American families at risk of \nsevere injury and even death.\n  First, on competitiveness. CAFE standards apply to the average fuel \nconsumption standards for a company's fleet of cars--that is, the fuel \neconomy for all cars sold in one model year is averaged together to \ndetermine the fleet average. Due to the high price of gasoline in \nJapan, the Japanese have traditionally engineered smaller cars. \nConsequently their automobile fleets come in below the CAFE standards, \nthus allowing them to make larger, less fuel-efficient cars and still \nfall within the CAFE limits for their fleet. According to the National \nAcademy of Sciences, ``the CAFE system operated to the benefit of the \nJapanese manufacturers, and at the expense of the domestic \nmanufacturers.'' This system continues to this day.\n  Despite this inequity, the Department of Transportation continues to \npush for increased CAFE standards, and in 1994 issued an Advanced \nNotice of Proposed Rule Making that suggested setting light truck CAFE \nstandards for up to 9 years at levels up to 40 percent higher than they \nare today.\n  Compounding their potential harm to our light truck industry, these \nCAFE supporters fail to consider the differences between cars and \ntrucks. Many of the fuel efficient technologies used to make cars more \nefficient, such as front wheel drive and increased aerodynamics, cannot \nbe used for trucks. Trucks are designed specifically for hauling \ncapacity, off-road use and durability. Only one or two very small \ntrucks currently provide the level of fuel efficiency sought by CAFE \nproponents, and they account for less than 1 percent of light truck \nsales. The Department of Transportation's CAFE-mandated changes would \nnegatively affect American manufacturers by reducing the segment of the \nlight-duty truck market--the full-size trucks consumers desire--in \nwhich they predominate.\n  But, important as competitiveness is to our workers and consumers, \nthere is a more important reason to freeze CAFE standards: it will save \nlives. Why? Because higher CAFE standards will force automobile \nmanufacturers to downsize cars and trucks, and smaller vehicles are \nmore dangerous. Automobile experts estimate that almost 50 percent of \nthe fuel economy gains made since the mid-1970's are attributable to \nreductions in vehicle size and weight. And what was the cost? In 1991, \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that \nvehicle downsizing since the mid-1970's was responsible for an \nadditional 2,000 deaths and 20,000 serious injuries on America's \nhighways every year.\n  Other studies have reached the same, logical conclusion. To \nillustrate the relationship between size and safety, the Insurance \nInstitute for Highway Safety studied the occupant death rates of 11 car \nmodels that had been downsized since 1977. It found that death rates \nwere higher for 10 of the 11 vehicle types after downsizing. More \nrecently, the institute has determined that, even when equipped with \nairbags, smaller cars are still less safe than larger cars.\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\n The National Academy of Sciences also understands that emissions \ncontrols result in less protection in the event of an accident. \nAccording to the Academy, ``safety and fuel economy are linked because \none of the most direct methods of increasing gas mileage is reducing \nsize and weight.''\n  And what would happen if the new, increased CAFE standards are \nadopted? A study by the Harvard Injury Control Center estimates that an \nincrease to proposed CAFE levels would result in downsizing that would \nproduce an additional 1,650 deaths and 8,500 serious injuries on our \nhighways every year. This is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, what I find most troubling about efforts to increase \nCAFE standards is that they are simply unnecessary. American automobile \nmanufacturers are constantly striving to improve their current product \nand develop innovative new ways to power cars and trucks. And these \nefforts are beginning to show results. In recent weeks, Chrysler has \nannounced breakthroughs in fuel-cell technology. By converting gasoline \ninto hydrogen, Chrysler's new engine will increase fuel efficiency and \nreduce tailpipe emissions. Similarly, all three auto makers are working \nto develop a gas turbine engine that will combine better efficiency, \nlow emissions and quiet performance.\n  These technological advances are the result of open competition, not \nGovernment mandate. This kind of innovation is only produced in a free \nmarket. Thus, rather than shackling American manufacturers with costly, \noutdated regulations, we should be encouraging them to develop new \ntechnologies to take the automobile industry into the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that, \n``the CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects \nthat are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration.'' \nThis bill is a modest step in that direction. It will permit Congress \nto carefully consider and debate any increases to CAFE standards rather \nthan allow the administration to change the standards, at any time and \nfor any reason without congressional approval, as is currently the \ncase.\n  Specifically, this bill will freeze CAFE standards at 27.5 miles per \ngallon for passenger cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for light-duty \ntrucks. The transportation appropriations conference report we passed \nlast year included a 1-year freeze on CAFE standards. This bill would \nmake that freeze permanent unless changed by Congress.\n  CAFE standards did not reduce our country's reliance on foreign oil, \nand they are not saving the planet from ozone depletion. CAFE standards \nare hurting American manufacturers and putting American families at \nincreased risk of injury or death. All this when the automobile \nindustry has shown itself capable of producing the technological \nadvances necessary for increased efficiency on its own. Congress should \nfulfill its responsibility as our Nation's law-making body by \nprotecting the American people from this instance of excessive and \ncounterproductive bureaucratic rule making.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS.\n\n       Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the average \n     fuel economy standards established (whether directly or \n     indirectly) under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Transportation under chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n     Code, prior to the date of enactment of this Act for \n     automobiles (as that term is defined in section 32901 of \n     title 49, United States Code) that are in effect on the day \n     before the date of enactment of this Act, shall apply without \n     amendment, change, or other modification of any kind (whether \n     direct or indirect) for--\n       (1) the model years specified in the regulations;\n       (2) the applicable automobiles specified in the regulations \n     last promulgated for such automobiles; and\n       (3) each model year thereafter;\n\n     until chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, is \n     specifically amended to authorize an amendment, change, or \n     other modification to such standards or is otherwise modified \n     or superseded by law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 287. A bill to require congressional approval before any trade \nagreements entered into under the auspices of the World Trade \nOrganization; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the approval of trade agreements act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to restore the \nconstitutional balance to our trade policy and preserve the Congress' \nconstitutional obligation to regulate foreign commerce. The bill I \nintroduce requires that before a trade agreement negotiated under the \nauspices of the World Trade Organization is accorded the force of law, \nit must be ratified by the Congress. It is a simple bill, but I believe \nit protects a fundamental principle of our democracy, the separation of \npowers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 288. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfamilies with estate tax relief, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                The Family Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Family Estate Tax \nRelief Act of 1997. This legislation is nearly identical to my bill \nfrom the 104th Congress with one major change.\n  My new legislation still targets substantial estate tax relief to \nhelp preserve one of our Nation's most important economic assets--its \nfamily run small businesses. But it also increases the existing \n$600,000 unified estate and gift tax credit, which is available to \neveryone.\n  Of course, increasing the unified credit will further reduce the \nestate tax burden now imposed on many families trying to transfer their \nbusinesses to the next generation. It also will help any families \nwishing to pass along to the children or grandchildren some stock, \nproceeds from a life insurance policy or other assets acquired over \nmany years.\n  The main thrust of this legislation remains the preservation of \nfamily farmers and other family run businesses. These businesses are \nthe major creators of new wealth and jobs in this country. However, \nthey face a number of obstacles to succeeding, ranging from price \ngouging by tough international competitors to excessive U.S. \nregulations. That is why it is not surprising to find, for example, \nthat we have lost some 377,000 family farms since 1980, a decline of \nsome 23,500 family farms every year.\n  Since 1980, we have lost some 9,000 of our family farms in North \nDakota. At the same time, we see that only a small fraction of other \nfamily run businesses survive beyond the second generation.\n  When families have to sell their farms or board up their Main Street \nbusinesses, those families lose their very livelihood. Moreover, our \ncommunities lose the jobs and services those family businesses provide.\n  I have been approached on many occasions at town meetings by North \nDakotans who say it is virtually impossible for them to pass along \ntheir farm or business--which has been the family's major asset for \ndecades--to their children because of the exorbitant estate taxes they \nwould pay. They think it is unfair, and I agree.\n  Unfortunately, our estate tax laws force many family members who \ninherit a modestly sized farm, ranch, or other family business to sell \nit, or a large part of it, out of the family in order to pay off estate \ntaxes. This is especially onerous when the inheriting family members \nhave already been participating in the business for years and depend \nupon it to earn a living.\n  I think that we must take immediate steps to breathe new economic \nlife and opportunities into our family businesses and the communities \nin which they operate. It seems to me that a good first step is \ncorrecting our estate tax laws so they do not unfairly penalize those \nworking families.\n  There are a few provisions included in our estate tax laws to help a \nfamily keep its business running long after the death of the original \nowner. But for the most part, these provisions are either too modest or \ntoo narrowly drawn to do much good.\n  Now I also understand that there are some complicated estate tax \nplanning techniques available for those wealthy\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nenough to hire sophisticated and costly tax advisors. Clearly some \nestate planning devices may reduce the estate tax burden imposed on \nsome family businesses upon the death of a principal owner. But for \nthose less affluent families inheriting a family business--where such \nestate planning tools were unavailable for whatever reason--the estate \ntaxes will ultimately force them to amass a pile of debt, or to sell \noff all or a large part of a family business, just to pay off their \nestate taxes. I think that this is wrong, and it runs counter to the \nkinds of policies that we ought to be pursuing in support of our \nfamily-owned businesses.\n  That is why I am introducing the Family Estate Tax Relief Act to \nrectify this matter, and I urge my colleagues to consider joining me in \nthis endeavor.\n  The Family Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997 would provide three \nsignificant measures of estate tax relief to those families hoping to \npass along their businesses or other assets to the next generation.\n  First, my bill would increase the existing unified estate and gift \ntax credit from $600,000 today to $1,000,000 in the year 2004. The \namount of the existing credit has not been changed for nearly a decade, \nand its benefit has been reduced by more than 35 percent due to \ninflation over this period. Moreover, even 3-percent inflation for \nanother 7 years will rob an additional 20 percent of the real value of \nthe unified credit. This provision will prevent erosion of the credit's \nreal value by inflation.\n  Second, my bill allows a decedent's estate to exclude up to the first \n$1,000,000 of value of the family business from estate taxes so long as \nthe heirs continue to materially participate in the business for many \nyears after the death of the owner. The full benefit of this new \n$1,000,000 exclusion is available to couples trying to pass along the \nfamily business without the complicated tax planning tailored to one \nspouse or the other that is sometimes used today.\n\n  Together, these two proposals would eliminate estate tax liability on \nqualifying family business assets valued up to $2.0 million. This would \neliminate the burden of estate taxes for the majority of family run \nbusinesses.\n  Third, my bill would allow the executor of a qualifying estate who \nchooses to pay estate taxes in installments to benefit from a special \n4-percent interest rate on the payment of estate taxes attributable to \na family business worth between $2.0 and $3.0 million. In other words, \nmy bill would also lighten the estate tax burden on the next $1 million \nof estate assets.\n  The parts of my legislation targeted to family run businesses expand \nupon the well-tested approaches found in sections 2032A and 6601(j) of \nthe Tax Code.\n  For example, we currently provide a special-use calculation for \nvaluing real estate used in a farm or other trade or business for \nestate tax purposes, where a qualifying business is passed along to \nanother family member after the death of the owner. To benefit from the \nspecial-use formula under section 2032A, the inheriting family member \nmust continue to actively participate in the business operation. If the \nheir ceases to participate in the business, he or she may face a \nsubstantial recapture of the estate taxes which would have been paid at \nthe time of the original owner's death.\n  In enacting this provision, Congress embraced the goal of keeping a \nfarm or other closely held business in the family after the death of \nthe owner. However, in the case of family farms, special-use valuation \nprimarily helps those farms adjacent to urban areas, where the value of \nthe land for non-farm uses is often much higher. But section 2032A does \nnot help many farms located in truly rural areas of the country where \nfarming is the land's best use. This provision also provides little \nhelp for families transferring other nonfarm small businesses under \nsimilar circumstances. My legislation would correct these glaring \nshortfalls in current law.\n  In addition, my bill would increase the benefit of the existing \npreferential interest rates under section 6601(j) that apply to farms \nand other closely held businesses. The benefits of the current \nprovision have been significantly reduced by inflation over the past \nseveral decades, and my bill simply increases the amount of estate \ntaxes that qualify for a special 4-percent interest rate if paid to the \nIRS in installment payments over time.\n  Moreover, my bill includes several safeguards to ensure that its tax \nbenefits are truly targeted at the preservation of most family \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, I plan to offset any estimated revenue losses from this bill \nby offering another legislative package to close a number of outdated \nor unnecessary tax loopholes for large multinational corporations doing \nbusiness in the United States. As a result, passing my estate tax \nrelief proposals will not increase the Federal deficit. But passing the \nFamily Estate Tax Relief Act will help to preserve the economic \nbackbone of this country and to help thrifty parents to help their \nchildren.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this much-needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 290. A bill to establish a visa waiver pilot program for nationals \nof Korea who are traveling in tour groups to the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            The Korea Visa Waiver Pilot Project Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Stevens, \nInouye, Akaka and Thomas, am introducing the Korea Visa Waiver Pilot \nProject Bill of 1997.''\n  This bill addresses the problem of the slow issuance of United States \ntourist visas to Korean citizens. Koreans typically wait up to 3 weeks \nto obtain tourist visas from the United States Embassy in Seoul. As a \nresult, most of these spontaneous travelers decide to vacation in one \nof the other 48 nations that allow them to travel to their country \nwithout a visa, including both Canada and New Zealand.\n  This legislation provides a carefully controlled pilot program of \nvisa-free travel by small groups of Koreans to the United States. The \nprogram seeks to capture the Korean tourism market lost due to the \ncumbersome visa system. For example, New Zealand experienced a 2,400-\npercent increase in tourism from Korea after easing its visa \nrequirements in 1993.\n  The pilot program is designed to allow visitors in a tour group from \nSouth Korea to travel to the United States without a visa for up to 15 \ndays. However, it does not compromise the security standards of the \nUnited States. The program would allow selected travel agencies in \nKorea to issue temporary travel permits based on applicants meeting the \nsame preset standards used by the United States Embassy in Seoul. The \ntravel permits could only be used by supervised tour groups.\n  While the pilot project would allow small Korean tour groups to \ntravel to the United States without visas, the project includes many \nrestrictions. These are:\n\n       The Attorney General and Secretary of State can terminate \n     the program if the overstay rates in the program are over 2 \n     percent.\n       The stay of the visitors is less than or equal to 15 days.\n       The visitors must have a round-trip ticket and arrive by a \n     carrier that agrees to return them if they are deemed \n     inadmissible.\n       The Secretary of State should institute a bonding and \n     licensing requirement that each participating travel agency \n     post a substantial performance bond and pay a financial \n     penalty if a tourist fails to return on schedule.\n       The on-time return of each tourist in the group would be \n     certified after each tour.\n       Security checks will be done to ensure that the visitor is \n     not a safety threat to the United States.\n\n  This legislation's restrictions ensure that the pilot program will be \na successful program, and one that I hope will entice more Korean \ntourists to visit the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD:\n  S.J. Res. 15. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to clarify the intent of the \nConstitution to neither prohibit nor require public school prayer; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             public school prayer constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the English word ``irony'' comes to us from \nan Ancient Greek word meaning ``a dissembler in speech.''\n  The English word ``irony'' is defined as the contrast between \nsomething\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nthat somebody thinks to be true, as revealed in speech, action, or \ncommon wisdom, and that which an audience or a reader knows to be true.\n  Mr. President, permit me to give an example.\n  If anyone in the hearing of my voice will take out a U.S. one-dollar \nbill and turn that one-dollar bill over onto its obverse side, he or \nshe will read in clear script, ``In God We Trust.''\n  Permit me to introduce another example.\n  Every day of each new meeting of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, an official chaplain of each of those two chambers of \nCongress--or a designated substitute--will stride to the dais and \naddress a sometimes elegant prayer to the Deity.\n  Again, every day in courtrooms across this country, hundreds of \nwitnesses will take their place at the front of the court chamber, put \ntheir hands on incalculable numbers of Bibles, and swear to tell the \ntruth, ``. . . so help me God.''\n  We do the same. I have done it many times in my 50 years of service \nand elected office. We stand and swear on oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States, ``so help me God.''\n  Additionally, daily, thousands of men and women, in a variety of \ngroups and millions upon millions of boys and girls in our schools will \npledge allegiance to our flag, uttering, among other words, the words \n``under God.'' I was a member of the House of Representatives in June \n1954, when the House of Representatives, I believe on June 7th of that \nyear, added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance to the \nFlag. The next day, the Senate adopted a similar amendment, and then, \non June 14, the measure was signed into law adding the words ``under \nGod.'' I will always be proud of the fact that I was a Member of the \nCongress of the United States when those words were added to the Pledge \nof Allegiance--``one nation under God.'' Both Houses added the words \n``under God.''\n  Here is the irony. In spite of that chain of rituals I have just \nrelated, in situation after situation, anecdotal and documented both, \npublic school authorities, ostensibly following rulings of the Supreme \nCourt dating from at least the 1960's, have prohibited the utterance of \nprayers at school functions, in classrooms, or even in groups or \nprivately on public school property.\n  As I read my U.S. Constitution--and here it is--such a prohibition of \nprayer in school flies in the face of the first amendment, which \ndeclares that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment \nof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .''\n  Please note those words again: ``. . . or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof. . . .''\n  That passage was explicitly written into our Bill or Rights at the \ninsistence of none other than James Madison, based on direct appeals to \nMadison by baptist ministers in Virginia, who had been forced to \nsupport the official State church during the colonial era, and whose \npractice of their own religious choice had been officially denied, \nproscribed, or penalized by colonial officials.\n  It is ironic that from that understandable constitutional safeguard \nin support of the free exercise of religious faith, opponents of any \nreligion have turned that passage of the First Amendment on its head to \nprohibit--I say prohibit--the free exercise of religion in our public \nlife and, particularly, to drive religious faith out of our public \nschools.\n  It is equally ironic that, as religion is making a public resurgence \nin the long-atheistic former Soviet Union, our Nation, whose \nprotofoundations stand on the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of \nearly colonists whose primary inspiration in coming to America in the \nfirst--Congregationalists, Calvinists, Baptists, Jews, Catholics, \nOrthodox, and others--whose primary purpose in coming to America in the \nfirst place, I repeat, was a yearning for religious liberty against \nthose who would deny them the right of religious liberty--that our \nNation should be embarked on a course which, in effect, denies \nreligious liberty to many of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I have heard increasing concerns about the lack of \nmoral orientation among so many younger Americans--about a rising drug \nepidemic among our children, about rampant sexual promiscuity, about \nchildren murdering children, about gangs of teenage thugs terrorizing \ntheir neighborhoods, and about a pervading moral malaise among youth in \nboth our inner cities and suburbs.\n  Is there any wonder that so many young Americans should be drifting \nwith seemingly no ethical moorings in the face of an apparent effort to \nstrip every shred of recognizable ethics, of teachings about values, \nand spirituality from the setting in which those young Americans spend \nmost of their waking hours--our public schools?\n\n  Mr. President, in an effort to restore something of a spiritual \nbalance to our public schools and to extracurricular activities in our \npublic schools, I am today introducing a joint resolution to propose an \namendment to the Constitution clarifying the intent of the Constitution \nwith regard to public school prayer.\n  My amendment is an effort to make clear that neither the \nConstitution, or the amendments thereto, require, nor do they prohibit, \nvoluntary prayer in the public schools or in the extracurricular \nactivities of the public schools.\n  Let me read my amendment. Let me read my proposed amendment. It is \nvery short, very brief, very much to the point:\n\n       Nothing in this Constitution, or amendments thereto, shall \n     be construed to prohibit or require voluntary prayer in \n     public schools, or to prohibit or require voluntary prayer at \n     public school extracurricular activities.\n\n  So anyone who fears that the language of this amendment would allow \npublic schools to mandate the recitation of daily prayer, or that \nschool administrators will become the authors of such prayers, need not \nworry. Have no fear. You need not lose a moment of sleep. This \namendment does not supplant the clear proscription contained in the \n``establishment'' clause of the First Amendment. My amendment is an \neffort to make clear that the words that the Constitution uses with \nregard to religious freedom do not mean that voluntary prayer is \nprohibited from our public schools or our public school activities.\n  As I shall one day state on this floor, all of the Presidents in \ntheir inaugural speeches, and/or in other documents and writings, have \nreferred to the Deity, referred to the Almighty God, to Providence, all \nof them. I shall read from the words of each President's inauguration \nspeech in which he refers, in one way or another, to God Almighty, the \nGreat Judge of the world. We read those references in the Declaration \nof Independence and the Mayflower Compact, and all of the State \nconstitutions, as I shall show upon another occasion. Then to say that \nthe schoolchildren of the Nation cannot enter into voluntary prayer in \nthe public schools, or during commencement exercises is absurd, absurd, \nutter nonsense.\n  In short, I hope to end the three-decades-long tyranny of the \nminority in denying to the majority of Americans the least vestige of \nthe exercise of a liberty otherwise guaranteed by the Constitution--the \nright of believing children in our public school system to pray in \naccordance with their own consciences and in the privacy of their \nvoluntary associations within our public schools. That right I \nsincerely believe the Constitution already grants, but I want to spell \nout in that same Constitution by way of an amendment that permission to \npray voluntarily in our public schools does not constitute ``an \nestablishment of a religion.''\n\n  To deny any schoolchild in this country the right to voluntarily pray \nin academics maintaining that that constitutes establishment of \nreligion is pure nonsense.\n  With introduction, and I hope eventual adoption of my amendment, we \ncan finally begin the 7-year long process to answer the peoples' \nconcerns. We can begin to restore the spiritual compass that has been \nlost in the lives of so many of our citizens. And, most importantly, we \ncan begin to return to our children the moral orientation they so \ndesperately desire.\n  Tennyson said, ``More things are wrought by prayer than this world \ndreams of.''\n  So, Mr. President, I urge those who want to deliver on the wishes of \nthe American people to join me in this effort.\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\n  I send to the desk my amendment, and ask that it be printed and \nreferred appropriately to committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

MARY'S ANTIOCHIAN \n                      ORTHODOX CHURCH, LIVONIA, MI\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to Father George Shalhoub, pastor and spiritual leader \nof St. Mary's Antiochian Orthodox Church in Livonia, MI. Father George \nwill be celebrating 25 years as pastor at St.\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\nMary's on Saturday, February 15, 1997. In addition to his pastoral \nduties, Father George is a faculty member at Madonna University and is \non the board of directors of many Michigan community service \norganizations.\n  Father George's life has been filled with many wonderful events. Born \nin Hama, Syria, he came to the United States at the age of 20. He \nmarried his lovely wife Nina weeks before his ordination. One week \nafter his ordination, Father George was assigned to St. Mary's, a \nbrandnew parish without land and a church. In the following years, the \ncouple arranged for the purchase of land in Livonia and the \nconstruction of the church. The process culminated in the joyous first \nSunday of Great Lent in 1976, when Father George celebrated the first \ndivine liturgy in the new building. The church was formally dedicated \non May 1, 1977 by the Most Reverend Metropolitan Philip, Primate of the \nAntiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America.\n  For Father George, devotion to his family has always come hand in \nhand with his religious dedication. He has been blessed with four \nwonderful children: Lila Ann, Alex George, Alexa Marie, and Christa \nKatherine. Despite his busy family and liturgical schedule, Father \nGeorge managed to find the time to pursue scholastic endeavors as well. \nHe earned a bachelor of science degree in sociology and psychology from \nEastern Michigan University; a master of theological studies degree \nfrom St. John's Provincial Seminary; and a doctor of ministries in \npastoral counseling from the Graduate Theological Foundation in Notre \nDame, IN.\n  As Father George's family has grown and prospered, so has his parish \ncommunity. In 1980, St. Mary's added six Sunday school classes in the \nfellowship building and a new social hall. The groundbreaking for St. \nMary's Cultural Center was presided over by Metropolitan Philip on May \n8, 1988. The Cultural Center was completed in 1991, and dedication \nceremonies were held later that year, again under Metropolitan Phillip. \nThe success of the 2,000-family parish was made most evident in June \n1995, when St. Mary's hosted the 48th annual midwest parish life \nconference.\n  Father George has always been known as a man with great strength of \ncharacter. That strength was severely tested on April 5, 1996, when St. \nMary's was consumed by fire. The fire could not have come at a worse \ntime--it occurred right in the middle of Holy Week. It was a major blow \nto the parish, but Father George responded fantastically. He moved \nservices to St. Michael Russian Orthodox Church and immediately began \narranging for repairs. Thanks to Father George's hard work and \ndedication, parishioners were able to return to St. Mary's on October \n6, 1996. And the work wasn't limited to restoration. Plans are now \nunderway to build a new chapel and a K through 8 private school.\n  I have had the pleasure of personally knowing Father George for many \nyears. During that time I have sought his spiritual advice and \nguidance. His pastoral, scholastic, and fatherly attributes are evident \nin everything he does. The State of Michigan is very lucky to have \nFather George amongst its citizens, and all Americans should be very \nproud of his accomplishments. Congratulations, Father George, on 25 \nyears of success, dedication, and love. I would like to conclude by \noffering my hope that the next 25 years are just as blessed and \nfruitful as the previous 25 have been.\n\n\n \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1111-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF SEVEN MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR RECOGNITION AS \n                          BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I commend the attention of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to seven public elementary schools in my home \nState of Massachusetts which have been nominated for recognition as \nBlue Ribbon Schools.\n  This week, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton \ncalled on us to make education the first priority of this Nation, as we \nenter the 21st century. I could not agree more.\n  Fortunately, as I have traveled throughout Massachusetts in the last \nfew years, and particularly last year, it has been very apparent to me \nthat many communities have already taken on the President's challenge. \nIn scores of neighborhoods throughout the Commonwealth, parents, \nschoolchildren, teachers, principals, and community volunteers are \nworking with infectious enthusiasm to make their schools the best in \nthe world.\n  Each of the seven schools which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has \nnominated for the Blue Ribbon Schools Award this year has demonstrated \nthat we can achieve high standards in education in this country, and \nthat we can make good public schools a fundamental building block of \nstrong, vibrant communities.\n  The seven schools are located in communities all over Massachusetts, \nand represent Massachusetts in all its diversity: the Mason Elementary \nSchool in Boston; the Blanchard Memorial School in Boxborough; the \nEmerson Elementary School in Malden; the Tisbury School on Martha's \nVineyard; the Johnson Elementary School in Natick; the Steward \nElementary School in Topsfield; and the Jacob Hiatt Magnet School in \nWorcester.\n  Each school has embraced high standards and welcomed innovation in \nteaching; but, more important, each has brought parents, teachers, \nschoolchildren and the community together to make school an exciting \nplace where children can learn, want to learn, and do learn.\n  The U.S. Blue Ribbon Schools Review Panel will make its decision on \nthe winners of this year's Blue Ribbon Schools Award in a matter of \nweeks. Regardless of the decision, we in Massachusetts are proud of our \nnominees.

His death is a great loss--not only to his \nfamily and friends--but to our Nation, which has benefited over many \ndecades from his intellectual brilliance, vision, and moral clarity.\n  For more than 40 years, Albert Wohlstetter was involved in all \naspects of U.S. national security policy. Presidents, from Truman to \nBush, profited from his analysis of major defense and foreign policy \nissues. What students of strategic policy, what policymakers in the \nPentagon have not read, ``The Delicate Balance of Power''--and been \nawed by his penetrating insight? It speaks to his extraordinary, \nvisionary intellect that he influenced so many from outside the \nbeltway. Albert never joined any administration; he was never willing \nto take a position that may require compromise between truth and the \ndemands of politics.\n  As we approach the next century and the challenges it brings, we \nshould keep in mind that Albert Wohlstetter was one of the staunchest \nchampions of ``peace through strength''--before the term became popular \nduring the Reagan administration. Albert cautioned against the folly of \nseeking security in arms control agreements, and advocated placing our \ntrust in America's military strength and technological ingenuity.\n  As we look back on his article, ``Spreading the Bomb Without Quite \nBreaking the Rules,'' we can see so clearly that Albert was also ahead \nof his time--recognizing in the mid-1970's that the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty's peaceful nuclear cooperation provisions would \nfuel the proliferation of nuclear technology. As a result, America, our \nfriends and allies are faced today with a growing number of countries \nwho possess or are on the way to possessing, nuclear weapons.\n  Whether he was analyzing strategic issues or unveiling the hypocrisy \nof Western policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one could be sure of two \nthings: Albert Wohlstetter was intellectually honest and thoroughly \nprincipled. For 4 long years, in countless articles, Albert reminded \nour leaders that with America's superpower status came not only vast \nmilitary strength, but immense moral responsibility--and for those \nreasons, allowing a small nation in the center of Europe to become the \nvictim of genocide was unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, I have barely scratched the surface of Albert\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\nWohlstetter's tremendous contributions to our Nation. I ask that the \neulogy given by Richard Perle, former Assistant Secretary of Defense, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n                     Albert Wohlstetter, 1913-1997\n\n                           (By Richard Perle)\n\n       Not long before he died, Albert amused himself and--anyone \n     who would listen--by reading a poem by Wallace Stevens called \n     Six Significant Landscapes. Joan and Roberta thought I should \n     read it here. And when they faxed it to me in Washington, I \n     knew why: you can't hear this short poem without thinking \n     about Albert, without seeing, in your mind's eye, that \n     wonderful, warm, engaging smile which, prompted by a \n     recollection or an idea or a phrase, would fill a room. So \n     here it is, Landscape Six:\n\n     Rationalists, wearing square hats\n     Think, in square rooms,\n     Looking at the floor,\n     Looking at the ceiling.\n     They confine themselves\n     To right-angled triangles,\n     If they tried rhomboids,\n     Cones, waving lines, ellipses--\n     As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon--\n     Rationalists would wear sombreros.\n\n       Had I'd known the poem, or read it before telling a New \n     York Times reporter on Sunday that Albert was a rationalist, \n     I would have added that he was a rationalist who wore a \n     sombrero. Because if there is one thing Albert never did, it \n     was to wear square hats or confine himself to right-angles. \n     Albert, in fact, never confined himself, period. His vision \n     was wholly original, never conventional. And it was vast. \n     Whether the subject was the design of strategic forces or the \n     future of technology or the inadequacy of treaties and \n     agreements or the implications of new systems of \n     communication, or income distribution as a function of race \n     or nuclear proliferation or the impact of topography on the \n     stability of peace in Bosnia, Albert saw old issues in new \n     lights--and new issues before anyone else.\n       Albert's refusal to accept the conventional wisdom on any \n     subject fueled his unrelenting drive to comprehend, to know, \n     to learn, to understand. Thus he spent a lifetime searching \n     for evidence, digging for facts, unearthing details. His \n     appetite for documents was voracious. Maps, charts, \n     statistics, studies, findings, testimony--he devoured them \n     all, and on every conceivable subject. And thanks to \n     Roberta--a wellspring of warmth, affection, wisdom and such \n     order as could be detected at Woodstock Road--the ever rising \n     flood of material that eventually forced the purchase of a \n     second house, was there when needed.\n       As so many here know well, Albert's capacity to assemble, \n     analyze and absorb mountains of information was limitless. \n     This was bad news indeed for those square hats who made the \n     mistake of blundering into debates with him: anything they \n     had ever said or done was certain to be dissected and \n     delivered back. It would hit one right between the eyes. \n     Whether in articles or briefings or congressional testimony \n     or professional panels, when Albert set out to make a point, \n     the holders of opposing--especially conventional--views were \n     well advised to take cover. And all the while, over decades \n     of intense debate and controversy, Albert conducted the \n     discussion of public policy with style and wit, with humor \n     and civility and, above all, with reason and integrity. He \n     was on the front lines in countless battles over public \n     policy for decades. Yet not once, in the nearly 40 years I \n     was privileged to know him, did Albert exhibit even a sliver \n     of the small minded, ill-tempered discourse that so often \n     characterized the debate over issues of strategy. For half a \n     century, the high ground was his.\n       Albert's scoffing at conventional thinking sometimes had \n     its humorous side. A few years ago, when Leslie and I were \n     visiting at 2805 Woodstock, I watched Sam Tanaka, the \n     Wohlstetter's Japanese gardener, hard at work planting \n     something with great difficulty while muttering a stream of \n     what I suspected were Japanese expletives. ``What are you \n     doing?'' I asked. ``Oh,'' he said, resignedly, ``every year \n     Mr. Wohlstetter makes me plant water chestnuts. Every year I \n     tell him water chestnuts don't grow in southern California. \n     He won't listen. `Try again,' he tells me. Ten years--no \n     water chestnuts.''\n       Albert's motto might well have been ``All the world's a \n     school and all the people in it merely students.'' For he \n     made students of us all. It didn't take one very long to \n     understand that Albert's towering intelligence and vast \n     knowledge were gifts he felt impelled to share. I was in the \n     eleventh grade at Hollywood High School when I had my first \n     Wohlstetter tutorial, standing by the swimming pool at \n     Woodstock Road. ``The Delicate Balance of Terror'' had \n     recently appeared in Foreign Affairs, and Albert had just \n     completed 80 or 90 classified briefings over many weeks in \n     Washington. What a marvel of precision and compression that \n     article was, and how intricate and subtle was the underlying \n     analysis. I would never have pursued a career in strategic \n     policy without Albert's patient, gentle, generous teaching \n     which began one day in 1958 and continued for 40 wonderful \n     years. And I might be a good deal thinner if Albert had been \n     less successful instructing me in the joys of the Michelin \n     Guide.\n       To those of us who were fortunate enough to be his \n     students, Albert had so very much to teach, not only about \n     his chosen field, but about history and economics and music \n     and art and architecture and food and wine and, for the \n     really smart ones, mathematics and mathematical logic. There \n     was hardly a subject about which Albert did not know a \n     great deal and--invariably what was most important. Above \n     all, he taught us the importance of accuracy and \n     precision. He believed that one earned the right to \n     comment the old fashioned way--by setting and meeting the \n     highest standards of rigor and objectivity.\n       I won't even attempt to catalogue Albert's extraordinarily \n     rich intellectual legacy. He tackled a succession of vexing, \n     complex issues of public policy from the early days at RAND \n     in the 1950's until his death last Friday. He brought clarity \n     and wisdom to everything he studied. But I do want to say a \n     word about Albert's most recent work concerning Bosnia.\n       No one worked harder than Albert to make the case for \n     protection and just treatment for the victims of aggression \n     in Bosnia, or to explain the broad implications of a failure \n     to do so. In his eighties, when most men shed burdens rather \n     than acquire them, Albert took upon himself the burden of \n     gathering, analyzing and publishing the facts about the \n     genocide in Bosnia and fitting those facts into the context \n     of western security and values. In his customary manner, he \n     worked tirelessly, night and day, for a distant people about \n     whose plight he came to know everything important. His \n     articles in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere, his advice \n     and counsel to others, his mobilization of friends, \n     colleagues and students in the Bosnia cause were a wonderful, \n     moving testimony to his sense of rectitude. And his singular \n     effectiveness in shaping the opinion of thoughtful people \n     around the world is a tribute to the power of a great mind \n     hard at work.\n       As he confronted the nightmare in Bosnia, I was never \n     prouder of my friend and teacher.\n       In all its depth and richness, Albert's life was in every \n     sense a partnership. He and Roberta taught us all how far \n     beyond the sum of its parts a marriage so whole and complete \n     can reach. Those of us who marveled over the years at their \n     seamless collaboration know that it was no bow to the \n     feminist movement when Ronald Reagan awarded the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom jointly to Albert and Roberta.\n       Albert had many favorite things, among them a poem by Dylan \n     Thomas. It goes like this:\n\n     Do not go gentle into that good night,\n     Old age should burn and rave at close of day;\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     Though wise men at their end know dark is right,\n     Because their words had forked no lightning they\n     Do not go gentle into that good night.\n\n     Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright\n     Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\n     And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\n     Do not go gentle into the good night.\n\n     Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\n     Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     And you, my father, there on the sad height,\n     Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\n     Do not go gentle into the good night.\n     Rage rage against the dying of the light.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1112-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1113-S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMISSION ON STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE FEDERAL COURTS OF \n                            APPEALS--S. 248\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

WISE, JR.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to do again something \nI have done many times in the past--to say good things about Sam Wise. \nSam passed away during the early morning on Tuesday, January 21, 1997, \nafter a short illness. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife, \nMary, and the rest of his family in this most difficult time.\n  I first met Sam in 1981, when I came to the Senate as a freshman and \njoined the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is \nbetter known as the Helsinki Commission. I have worked with him, \ntraveled with him, relied upon him, trusted him as a staff member, a \ndiplomat, and a friend.\n  When I first served as the Helsinki Commission's chairman, in 1985 \nand 1986, Sam was already the pillar of wisdom, the font of all \nCommission and CSCE knowledge, and the balance wheel of good judgment \nthat kept things under control. At the Vienna CSCE Review Conference, \nwhich began under my chairmanship, Sam became the deputy head of the \nU.S. delegation, and was awarded the personal rank of Ambassador by the \nPresident. It was an honor hard-earned and richly deserved.\n  With the start of the 105th Congress, the Commission is suddenly and \nsadly lacking Sam's leadership, professionalism, and gravitas. The \nobituary published in the Washington Post on Thursday, January 23, \n1997, summarizes the facts of his life. But it doesn't tell the story \nof the arduous travel, the late nights, the haggling over bracketed \ntext, the personal integrity and ex-marine toughness that made seasoned \ndiplomats trust him and rely upon him and allowed him to close the deal \nwhen other people couldn't.\n  The measure of his loss will test us. In life, he taught and led, and \ngave of himself unstintingly in the service of his country, and in the \nservice of humanity. Retired from the Department of State in 1982, \nafter serving with the Commission on detail since 1977, the year after \nthe Commission's founding, he had his greatest impact on U.S. policy \nwith the Commission. He subsequently served as the Commission's staff \ndirector, and later as its director of international policy.\n  His skillful, steady hand helped guide the Helsinki Accords from a \ncontentious and little-known artifact of detente to a living, growing \ninternational process and organization that has brought much good to \nmany people, and has helped build peace, prosperity, and security for \nthe United States, our allies, and all of the people of Europe.\n  His work with the Commission specifically advanced the cause of human \nrights to its highest level of achievement in international relations. \nDuring the cold war, prisoners of conscience, refuseniks, persons whose \nfamilies had been separated, the oppressed of all kinds, had a friend \nand a skillful ally in Sam. Many cases were resolved--among them those \nof Anatoly Scharansky and Yuri Orlov--and many families were reunited. \nWe can make a list of individual people he helped, and every one of \nthese cases in whose resolution he had a hand adds luster to his name.\n  More importantly, in international meeting after international \nmeeting, Sam did the hard work of diplomacy, out of the spotlight, \nhelping bring together the United States, Canada, and the nations of \nEurope to agree, word by painfully negotiated word, on commitments that \nmade human rights a legitimate issue in international relations, not \none that an oppressive state could easily dismiss as outside \ninterference in its internal affairs.\n  This is hard work, building the foundation of human civilization. \nThat's what Sam helped do. The modern Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, and especially the established human rights \nstandards it embodies and advances, are a product, in larger part than \nthe world knows, of his dedication, skill, tireless effort, and \ncommitment to principle. While the world at large may little note his \npassing, those of us who know the Helsinki process and the demanding \nwork of establishing and protecting human rights, we know we have lost \none of the people who count. His achievements in life will serve as a \nlasting tribute to him, and will continue to do good for his country, \nour friends, and humanity in general for many years to come.\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\n  Nothing I can say, nothing anyone can do, can make up for his loss. \nWe can all, however, take some comfort in his accomplishments in life, \nand rededicate ourselves to the service of our country and to the \nadvancement of those causes we shared with him.\n  Sam, I will miss you. God bless you and God speed you home to His \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1114-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO PROCTOR JONES, STAFF DIRECTOR, SENATE APPROPRIATIONS \n        COMMITTEE--SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nProctor Jones on his retirement from the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Proctor Jones, a most distinguished professional staff \nmember, has served the Senate Appropriations Committee honorably since \n1971.\n  During my many years of interaction with Mr. Jones, I have observed \nthat his attention to detail and superb performance under pressure have \nearned him the respect and admiration of Senators and Senate staff \nalike. He distinguished himself rapidly as a professional who possessed \nan infectious demeanor, tremendous integrity, decisive leadership \nstyle, political savvy, and boundless energy.\n  Mr. Jones forged strong alliances and affiliations with a myriad of \ncongressional offices, committees, and Federal and civilian agencies to \npresent a cohesive approach in drafting a responsible energy and water \nappropriations bill each year.\n  Mr. Jones has had an opportunity to serve under a number of \ndistinguished Appropriations Committee chairmen: Senators Russell, \nEllender, McClellan, Magnuson, Stennis, Byrd, and most recently \nHatfield. Mr. Jones served as deputy staff director of the committee \nunder Senators McClellan and Stennis. Since 1973 he has been the Staff \nDirector, Subcommittee on Public Works for Water and Power Development, \nand Atomic Energy Commission Appropriations, which was renamed the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development in 1977.\n  In addition to handling the annual appropriation bill, he has been in \ncharge of numerous continuing resolutions, supplemental appropriations \nbills, rescission bills, and other measures relating to the \nappropriations process.\n  I understand Mr. Jones will be working here in Washington, with \nformer Senator J. Bennett Johnston, with whom he has been associated \nfor over 20 years. I know his expertise, professionalism, and \ndedication will serve him well in his new position. I want to \npersonally and publicly acknowledge my appreciation to Mr. Jones for \nhis exemplary service to this great institution and to bid him a fond \naloha and heartfelt mahalo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1115-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF HERB CAEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Herb Caen, \nPulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. Herb \nbegan his career in 1938. He left us this past Sunday, taking with him \nan irreplaceable part of the community he so dearly loved and that so \ndearly treasured him.\n  Although he is gone, he leaves a rich, woven history of a time, \nplace, and people.

He grew up in Sacramento, \nbut made San Francisco home not only for himself but for his legions of \nreaders--whether they lived in town or not. He captured the city's \nvivid colors and rhythms.\n  People read Herb Caen to find out what was going on. We looked for \nnames we recognized, places we might visit, and places we might avoid. \nFor nearly six decades, Herb was our connection to a place so dynamic, \nit seemed only he could divine its pulse and variety.\n  Every morning, Herb Caen started your day. Herb conjured humanity \nfrom a youthful heart and old typewriter daily--and we thank him.\n  My office in San Francisco overlooks Herb Caen Way--a beautiful \npromenade along the waterfront. From the widows, one can see the people \nof San Francisco moving from place to place, carrying on with the \nbusiness of living, and carrying memories of Herb with them. Although \nwe may be deprived of his words, how appropriate that even now Herb \ncontinues to lead us about his adopted town with which he conducted a \npublic love affair for almost 60 years.\n  In awarding the Pulitzer Prize to Herb Caen, the Pulitzer Committee \nreferred to his ``continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of \nhis city.'' His voice is no longer with us, but his joy in celebrating \nSan Francisco and its inhabitants will live on in generations of San \nFranciscans who read him and were touched by his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/06/senate-section/article/S1115-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1115-S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.
