But at this point we expect four votes on \namendments and final passage beginning at 10:30.\n\n  After that, the Senate will begin debate on the nomination of David \nSatcher to be Surgeon General. We do not know exactly how long will be \nneeded for that debate, but at least the balance of the afternoon is \nanticipated, and it could actually go over until tomorrow. Senators \nwill be notified if there are going to be additional votes today. There \ncould be a vote on the Satcher nomination late this afternoon if we \ncomplete the debate and Senators are ready to vote; otherwise, it is \nanticipated the vote would then occur on the Satcher nomination \ntomorrow.\n  We will consult with Senators about legislation that may come up \ntomorrow.

Mr. President, we will shortly be called upon to vote on an \namendment that I offered yesterday with Senator Torricelli to change \nthe name of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, in effect to take his \nname off the building and have it referred to as the FBI Building.\n  That underlying amendment is really about how we honor those who \nundertake the profession of public service. The amendment is about \nthose who serve the public and also contrasting that with those who \nabused its trust and violated the rights of thousands of public and \nprivate citizens.\n  Mr. President, we dishonor our undisputed reputation as the greatest \ndefender of civil liberties in the world by maintaining the name of J. \nEdgar Hoover on the FBI's headquarters. This amendment will remove one \nof the last vestiges of McCarthyism still on display in Washington.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, I talked about some of the things that he \ndid. I talked about some of the people he abused, such as Joe Louis.\n  Today, I am going to talk about a few more people whose civil rights \nhe violated. Irving Berlin, the man who wrote ``God Bless America,'' \nand ``White Christmas'' and hundreds of other songs, was a person that \nJ. Edgar Hoover investigated endlessly for\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nyears. Irving Berlin did not die until he was 101 years old, but he was \ninvestigated by J. Edgar Hoover for most of his life.\n  He conducted surveillance on Albert Einstein, Wernher Von Braun, Vice \nPresident Hubert Humphrey, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Rock Hudson, \nElvis Presley, Senator John Tower, Cesar Chavez.\n  Mr. President, in Chavez's case, the FBI seemed omnipresent, tuning \nin to the Reverend Jesse Jackson's radio broadcasts dealing with Cesar \nChavez when Jesse Jackson was simply appealing for support for the farm \nworkers. Chavez created so much concern by J. Edgar Hoover that they \nhad many FBI agents keeping tabs on a Valentine's Day dance at Grand \nRapids Junior College in Michigan where there was literature being \ndistributed about a grape boycott. He even had investigators following \npeople who were on a 12-man march dealing with the grape boycott.\n  We simply do not honor the historical record of this country by \nmaintaining this man's name on Bureau headquarters.\n  Mr. President, in a biography that I talked about yesterday, written \nby Curt Gentry, which he spent 10 years writing, Gentry says that \nHoover used his FBI files to advance the careers of numerous \npoliticians he liked, including President Nixon, and against those he \ndid not like, including the Kennedys, Estes Kefauver and Adlai \nStevenson.\n  Gentry further said that extensive records were maintained on the \nsuspected amorous adventures of President Kennedy. And Hoover ordered \nthe bugging of the entire Justice Department during Bobby Kennedy's \ntenure as Attorney General. Gentry isn't saying that he maintained \nwiretaps of various places in the Justice Department, but everything \nwas wiretapped in the Justice Department.\n  So the list is endless of people who this man thought was suspicious. \nThere is no question in my mind that he is the greatest violator of \nhuman rights during this century in this country. That says a lot. I \nhope that my colleagues will remove from that building something that \nis and should be an embarrassment to all people who believe in human \nrights.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to rise today to introduce the \nSurvivors of Torture Support Act and to ask my colleagues for their \nsupport, and I send the bill to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grams pertaining to the introduction of S. 1603 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1575, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1575) to rename the Washington National Airport \n     located in the District of Columbia and Virginia as the \n     ``Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.''\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid Amendment No. 1640, to redesignate the J. Edgar Hoover \n     FBI Building in Washington, District of Columbia, as the \n     ``Federal Bureau of Investigation Building''.\n       Dodd Amendment No. 1641, to establish a Federal Facilities \n     Redesignation Advisory Group to consider and make \n     recommendations for the renaming of existing Federal \n     facilities.\n       Daschle Amendment No. 1642, to require the approval by the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority of the renaming of \n     Washington National Airport as the Ronald Reagan National \n     Airport.\n       Robb Amendment No. 1643, to provide an orderly process for \n     the renaming of existing Federal facilities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1643\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form on amendment No. 1643 offered \nby the Senator from Virginia, (Mr. Robb).\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia, (Mr. Coverdell), is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nMy remarks were made last night. In essence, the amendment by my \ndistinguished colleague from Virginia vitiates or makes moot the entire \neffort of the bill. His amendment has the effect of nullifying what we \nhave been endeavoring to do throughout the week.\n  I might take another second to say that several of these amendments \nthat have been offered--and I see the Senator from Nevada here--have \nconsiderable merit and substance. The problem is that we have used the \nweek in a very inefficient way. I have been up very late last evening \nand early this morning endeavoring to resolve this matter and deal with \nsome of these amendments that don't nullify the legislation, but there \nis not time now to deal with this effectively with the House and meet \nthe attempt to have this occur on the President's birthday. So the week \nhas cost us the ability to resolve some of the other issues. In any \nevent, I would have been opposed to the amendment offered by the good \nSenator from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I suggest that the lack of time is part of \nthe problem that we are dealing with here, as just alluded to by the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia. This is not the right way to do \nwhat we propose to do, even if that is our objective.\n\n  This amendment, crafted by the minority leader's office, would simply \nprovide a procedure whereby there would be input from the local \njurisdictions. The problem right now is that this bill was introduced, \nheld at the desk, and there were no committee hearings, no committee \nvotes, no public hearings on the matter. We have heard from countless \npeople who have a local interest. Those jurisdictions--Alexandria, \nArlington, Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority, Greater \nWashington Board of Trade--are against it. Normally, even in judgeships \nwe give the local Senators input on whether the judge who would be \nsitting in their particular jurisdiction ought to go forward without \nsome additional debate. You do not have the support of either of the \nlocal Senators or the local Members of Congress on this. I normally \ndon't suggest this is scientific or pay that much attention to sheer \nnumbers, but the calls are overwhelmingly against proceeding with this. \nThis sets up a procedure so that we can consider it in an appropriate \nmanner.\n  With that, I think my two minutes are about up. I ask for the support \nof this amendment. Senator Daschle has an amendment that is even more \nprecise and specific, if we want to deal with this issue in a very \nshort period of time. But the problem is the lack of time to \nthoughtfully consider the implications for the renaming, as well as for \nall of the local jurisdictions concerned.\n  With that, I yield whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has approximately 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I just say that I think there has been \nsufficient time to consider a very uncomplicated issue here, renaming \nthe airport Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n  As I said to the Senator last evening, the Governor of his State does \nsupport this. This is not the Alexandria airport; this is a national \nairport.\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion occurs on amendment No. 1643, offered by the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Robb. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Coats) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided for each side on the amendment as modified.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to my colleagues \nhere, my intention, as I have said earlier, is to support the \nunderlying legislation to name the airport in honor of Ronald Reagan.\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\n  As I said yesterday, I certainly had no lack of disagreements with \nRonald Reagan during the 8 years of his stewardship but believe that a \ntwo-term President deserves to be recognized. And if it is the desire \nof his family and others to rename this airport, given the fact it has \nhad name changes over the years, I do not object to that. I had offered \nthis amendment for the purpose of dealing in the future with these same \nissues.\n  In a sense, Mr. President, it has become sort of a modern day \ngraffiti when we run around naming things here willy-nilly, both on the \nCapitol grounds and in this city. We are mere custodians of these \nfacilities; we don't own them, and we ought to have a process by which \nwe make solid determinations about whose names are associated with \ngreat monuments, buildings and rooms that we have. When we as an \ninstitution decided to decorate the reception room with five of our \nformer colleagues, it was Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy who chaired \nthat commission--I look to my colleague from West Virginia as our \nhistorian--where a deliberative process went forward and that decision \nwas made.\n  It seems to me we as a body ought to adopt something like this so \nthat we are not faced with these situations year in and year out.\n  Now, Mr. President, I gather from talking with my colleague and \nfriend from Georgia that my amendment to the underlying legislation is \ngoing to be rejected, but I hope that we might consider something like \nthis amendment at the appropriate place. Unfortunately, what happens in \nthe absence of a decision like this, these matters get shunted aside \nand we do not bring them up again until the next issue emerges. But I \nhappen to believe that setting up a commission that would deal with \nthese issues, having a commission made up of former Members to deal \nwith Capitol grounds, possibly the Architect of the Capitol included, \nis the way we ought to go about the process of naming rooms, buildings, \nand renaming facilities, Federal facilities, here in Washington and \nelsewhere.\n  Having said that, I know my colleague from Georgia will want to be \nheard on this. When he completes his comments, I will withdraw my \namendment and hope that at some point in the not too distant future we \ncan bring this matter up through the Rules Committee or other such \ncommittees where it would be appropriate. I see my colleague from Texas \nwho I know is interested in this as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time have we remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Texas be \ngranted 1 minute to make her comments on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Ms. HUTCHISON. I agree with what the Senator from Connecticut is \ndoing in laying this aside. I do think we need a process and procedure. \nI am on the Rules Committee. I will work with the Senator from Georgia \nand our leadership as well as the Democratic leadership. I would like \nto see us have a process in which all the views are represented and \nthen we can go forward. And I pledge to the Senator from Connecticut my \nsupport.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, who has time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for just 15 seconds?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might inform the Members there is a process. It is the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. If this bill had been referred \nto the proper committee, we would have gone through the proper process. \nThat committee has jurisdiction over public buildings. We have rules as \nto naming and when not to name buildings after whom and under what \ncircumstances. There is a process. One of the problems with this whole \nprocedure here today is the process was skirted. The process wasn't \nused.\n  Mr. President, this is a very difficult issue for me, but I am going \nto be voting against the underlying bill basically because I do not \nthink we should displace George Washington, our Founding Father, with \nwhat we might be doing here, and a whole host of other reasons which I \ndo not have time to get into.\n  There is a process. We are not following it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I should like to address my remarks to \nmy colleague from Connecticut. He appeared yesterday. He has been very \nfacilitating to the effort. I appreciate very much what he and my \ncolleague from Texas are endeavoring to do. As I said to him this \nmorning, I look forward to joining with him in his attempt to \nprospectively deal with these kinds of issues in the future. I am very \nappreciative of his collegiality.\n  I would say, as I have said repeatedly, that there are certain \nextraordinary conditions associated with the manner in which we are \ndealing with this issue. The former President's birthday is this \nFriday, and he is facing the most difficult battle he has faced in his \nlife. And he has faced many. This is a spontaneous response to that. I \nwill leave it at that. But I do want to again thank the Senator from \nConnecticut and make known that I intend to join with him in his \nefforts prospectively to deal with these sorts of matters.\n  I yield back all time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1641, As Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1640\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form on amendment No. \n1640 offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. My friend from Connecticut indicated that any amendment \nthat was offered to this bill was rejected. I have not heard that. I \nhave not heard a single person come forward and speak against the \namendment I have offered. I suggest that this amendment would not hold \nup this bill one bit; that anyone voting against this amendment is \nvoting against good Government. There is not an organization in this \ncountry that is concerned about human rights or civil rights that wants \nJ. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building. This is a building that \nhouses officials sworn to defend and protect the Constitution of the \nUnited States, our civil liberties, the liberties of all Americans. No \nofficial in the history of this country has done more to violate the \nrights of people than J. Edgar Hoover. Consider going after Irving \nBerlin, the man who wrote God Bless America. He is one of scores of \npeople I have talked about these last few days.\n  I think we should honor those who work in that building by removing \nthis man's name from the building. It is one of the most popular places \nto visit by visitors that come to this Nation's Capital, and they \nshould not be subjected to a building with this man's name on it.\n  Mr. President, Ronald Reagan stands for what is good about this \ncountry. J. Edgar Hoover stands for what is bad about this country. \nThis small man violated the rights of hundreds, if not thousands, of \npeople, famous and not so famous. He was a vindictive, petty man who \nharassed and abused untold thousands during his entire 48 years as the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We should remove the \nlast segment of the McCarthy era by deleting his name from one of the \nmost important buildings in this city.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, let me say to my colleague from Nevada I \nappreciate the remarks he made about the underlying bill. We do have a \nlogistical problem here in terms of--and we have\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nspent the better part of the week perhaps in a less efficient manner \nthan we could have, and it has robbed me of the opportunity to iron the \nway on the other side, so I regretfully will in a moment move to table \nthe amendment.\n  It may not be much comfort to the Senator from Nevada at this time, \nbut I would welcome working with him. Obviously, there have been a \nnumber of assertions made about the individual to which the Senator \nfrom Nevada takes umbrage. It is a complex issue, and as I said I \nsimply do not have time, given where we are in the week and what we are \nattempting to do, to resolve the matter in the House. So for that \nreason, Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator withhold for just a short moment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I withhold my motion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  I oppose this amendment. Yes, there are things that can be said, but \nthere are many things that have been accomplished during the tenure of \nHoover. I have to say there is a raft of FBI agents who would be very \noffended by this. And I don't think we should do it. As a matter of \nfact, if we go back through time, if you look at all the good things \nthat were done and all the many accomplishments of the FBI, you have to \nconclude there was an awful lot that we have to be proud of even though \nthere are some things that are certainly to be criticized and \nrightfully so.\n  When the Senate takes action to honor--or discredit--men and women \nwho have favorably shaped this nation, we should do so only after \ncareful reflection and deliberation. We must also be careful not to \nallow the faults or excesses of an individual overshadow the \ncontributions they have made to our country.\n  I think we need to consider the negative effect passage of this \namendment could have on an institution that has made a profound \ncontribution to the safety and security of this nation. The FBI is \ndeservedly recognized as the preeminent law enforcement agency in the \nworld. And whether we care to like him or not, unlike any other \ninstitution in our federal government, there is one person that is \ndirectly responsible for the FBI's rise in prominence, J. Edgar Hoover. \nUnder Hoover, the FBI was transformed from a small sleepy Washington \noffice, into the major force thwarting criminal activity in this \ncountry.\n  Hoover took over the FBI in May 1924 and placed the Bureau at the \nforefront in combating the major gangster activity of that era. The FBI \nwas directly responsible for the arrest of notable gangsters such as \nJohn Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson. During World War II the FBI \nspearheaded efforts to uncover Nazi saboteurs and spies infiltrating \nthe United States in an effort to disrupt the Allied war effort.\n  In the 1950's under Hoover's leadership the Bureau was instrumental \nin the identification and arrest of Soviet Spies of the likes of Sobel \nand Abel, as well as the arrest of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Remember \nalso, that it was the Hoover FBI that cracked the infamous Brinks \nrobbery in Boston, loudly touted as the ``Crime of the Century'' at \nthat time.\n  Among many other responsibilities, the FBI played a vital role in the \n1960's in fighting deep seated racism in the deep south. It was \nHoover's FBI that combated threats from the Ku Klux Klan. It was this \nsame FBI that investigated the infamous ``Mississippi Burning'' case \nthat brought to justice those responsible for the senseless murder of 3 \ncivil rights workers. It was this same FBI that brought James Earl Ray \nto justice. It was also the Hoover FBI of the 1960's that conducted an \nextensive investigation into organized crime that led to the \nidentification of an enormous criminal network stretching from Chicago \nto New York and Boston, and touched the lives of countless communities \nin between. Today we recognize this network as La Cosa Nostra.\n\n  This is merely a snap shot of the considerable accomplishments made \nby the FBI under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that the day after his death in 1972, Hoover's body was laid \nin State in the Rotunda of the Capitol--an honor bestowed upon only 21 \nother Americans in the history of this great nation.\n  In his death, despite revelations that have been made, it is \nundeniable that Hoover's legacy in building the FBI to its current \nstature continues to have a profound effect upon the safety and \nsecurity of this nation. From the investigation and arrest of those \nresponsible for the World Trade Center bombing, to the recent \nconviction of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski; from the arrest of CIA agent \nAldrich Ames for espionage, to the investigation that resulted in the \nconvictions of Timothy Macveigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma City \nbombing, the FBI continues to be recognized as a vital component of law \nenforcement. Let us honor the legacy of this honorable institution, by \ncontinuing to give appropriate recognition to Mr. Hoover, the principal \narchitect in its rise to prominence.\n  In reviewing my colleague from Nevada's reasoning for this amendment, \nit is clear that he believes he is doing the right thing. I do not \nquestion his sincerity. But I do not think the Senate should act on \naccounts contained in a single book.\n  More importantly, we are here today to honor President Reagan. I urge \neach of my colleagues to address this issue alone without being \ncompelled to bring other agencies or memorials into the equation.\n  So I hope our colleagues will vote against this amendment. I respect \nmy good friend from Nevada, but I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 1640 offered by the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Coats) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 5 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Coats\n     Moynihan\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1640) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. HATCH.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the manager of the \nbill for his good arguments.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we still do not have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is correct, we do not \nhave order. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the manager of the \nbill and others who voted against this amendment. I know it was \nsincerely brought, and I know that there may be some arguments that \nsome could raise. But in all honesty, the FBI has been one of our most \nvenerable institutions for all of these years.\n  We know that the former Director deserves most of the credit for \nbuilding it and that there are literally thousands of FBI agents who \nwould have been very upset if that amendment was adopted.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for having voted to table the \namendment, and I hope that we do not do this in the future. We do not \nput names on buildings idly, and we do not do them facetiously, and we \ndo not do them foolishly. Once they are there, we ought to remember the \ntraditions and history and the good things that really were done. All \nof us have faults, all of us make mistakes, and all of us need to work \nout our own repentance for things that we do from time to time.\n  So I thank everybody who did vote to table the amendment for having \ndone so, and I think they did the right thing.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Utah and others who \nvoted to table this amendment that I think it was a bad vote. The fact \nof the matter is, when the name was placed on this building, J. Edgar \nHoover's record was not clear to the American public. It was not clear \nthat he conducted investigations of Irving Berlin and hundreds and \nhundreds of other people.\n  I say without any qualification, there is no one this century who has \nviolated the human rights and civil rights of America's citizens more \nthan J. Edgar Hoover.\n  I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, my good friend, but on this issue, I think he is flat wrong, \nand I think we missed an opportunity to take a person's name off a \nbuilding that should be an embarrassment and is an embarrassment to the \npeople who work inside that building, as reflected in private \nconversations with an FBI agent today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1642\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form on amendment No. 1642 offered \nby the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, thank you. I had the opportunity to \ndiscuss this amendment last night. President Reagan stood for a lot of \nthings, but I think the things for which we identify him more than \nanything else is local control, the need to ensure that at the local \nlevel, government is given the greatest opportunity.\n  In 1987, President Reagan signed a bill into law that provided \nauthority to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority for all \ndecisionmaking regarding the operation of the Washington \nNational Airport. That was 11 years ago. My amendment, Mr. President, \nsimply says, let's keep the spirit of Ronald Reagan alive as we pass \nthis piece of legislation; let's ensure that the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, in keeping with local control, has an \nopportunity to voice its approval. That is what this amendment does.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order? There are pockets of \nconversation all over this Chamber, and I want my leader to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader deserves to be heard. \nConversations will cease or be removed from the Senate Chamber. The \nDemocratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my friend from Kentucky and I thank the \nPresiding Officer.\n  I simply conclude, Mr. President, by saying if we are for local \ncontrol, if we are for the spirit of what Ronald Reagan represented, \nthen we all ought to be supporting this amendment. This amendment, \nagain, simply says, let's give the Washington Airports Authority the \nauthority given to them by President Reagan in 1987, the opportunity to \nbe heard, to have a voice, to say yes. So I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Whatever time I have remaining I will be happy to yield \nto the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just say briefly to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, I support renaming the airport after President \nReagan, but using the logic of my friend from Utah, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, he said you should not change the name of existing \nbuildings. I assume that should also apply to airports. So if that \nlogic is carried through, I would think everybody on the other side of \nthe aisle would vote against renaming this airport for the President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the manager's time to my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think we all ought to understand that if \nthis amendment were accepted, it would kill our effort to rename \nWashington National Airport after President Ronald Reagan. So let's be \nvery clear about the effect of this amendment.\n  Second of all, again, I am intrigued by this continuous argument from \nthe other side that Washington National Airport, which identifies the \nairport as servicing Washington, DC, is somehow George Washington. \nObviously, we know that is not true.\n  If we want to give local control to National Airport and the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority, I strongly suggest to my \nfriend, the distinguished Democratic leader, that we repeal the \nperimeter rule which is a Federal law which prevents aircraft from \nflying any further west than the far western end of the runway at \nDallas-Fort Worth Airport, a law that was passed by former Speaker of \nthe House Jim Wright who happens, as we all know, to reside there.\n  So, if we are going to give truly local control, I hope the \ndistinguished Democratic leader would want to remove Federal laws that \nalso affect Washington National Airport which, frankly, has affected \nthe lives of millions of Americans for many years in preventing them \nfrom going from one end of this country to the other without stopping \nin between.\n  So I say to my colleagues, have no doubt about the effect of this \namendment. It would kill our ability to do an appropriate thing and, if \nI may add as an aside, I hope we get this done pretty soon, because I \nthink everybody knows how we and the majority of the American people \nfeel about this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1642 offered by the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as we move into a vote on final passage, it \nstill seems somehow impossible that 23 years have passed since that \ngenial American--the one who had starred in movies and television, who \nearly in his career had been a talented sports broadcaster, who served \nas a commissioned officer during World War II and who had served with \ndistinction as Governor of California--that this remarkable man yielded \nto the urgings of thousands of his fellow Americans and tossed his hat \nin the ring for consideration as the 1976 Republican presidential \nnominee.\n  But in the instance of Ronald Reagan, history proves that tempus does \nfugit. It has indeed been 23 years. Ronald Reagan has done all of the \nabove, and done them well. But when he agreed to be a candidate for the \nPresidential nomination, there were few who foresaw the profound effect \nthis remarkable American would have on his party, his country--and the \nentire world.\n  Mr. Reagan did not, of course, win the nomination in 1976. But he did \nlay the groundwork for 1980 when delighted Republicans chose him as the \nparty's standard bearer in the presidential election that year.\n  He won overwhelmingly and, as Paul Harvey always says, now you know \nthe rest of the story.\n  Mr. President, I had known Ronald Reagan for some years when he \nannounced in 1976--the year when I was in the middle of my first six \nyears in the U.S. Senate. Like Mr. Reagan I had once been a registered \nDemocrat--and I confess that I was stunned on that November 1992 \nevening when the election returns were coming in that I had become the \nfirst U.S. Senator ever elected by the people of North Carolina.\n  I was disappointed in 1976 when Mr. Reagan failed to win the GOP \nprimary for president because it seemed clear to me then, and clear to \nmillions of others, that Ronald Reagan was an eloquent and forceful \ndefender of conservative values. For that reason, and because of my \nfriendship with him, I became the first sitting Senator in 1976 to \nendorse Candidate Reagan for the Presidency--a fact that I shall \nforever note with pride because history is already clear that Mr. \nReagan was the outstanding President of the 20th Century.\n  There have been others who served well but it was President Ronald \nReagan who stout-heartedly defended Thomas Jefferson's counsel that the \nleast government is the best government.\n  Indeed, the enormity of President Reagan's domestic achievement \nboggles the mind. Consider the unprecedented Gross National Product \nexpansion and job creation after a period of failed statist economic \npolicies; declining interest rates that allowed entrepreneurs to enter \nthe market, bringing energy and innovation to countless industries; tax \ncuts that at long last allowed Americans to keep more of what they \nearned; a long overdue hiatus in the unchecked growth of the federal \nbureaucracy. Simply put, our economy is strong and vibrant today \nbecause Ronald Reagan had the courage to trust the free market.\n  Ronald Reagan did all of this, yes, but the real heart of his legacy \nwill forever rest upon in his courageous opposition to communism and \ntotalitarianism opposition that led to the birth of freedom in Eastern \nEurope and the end of the Cold War.\n  Two years before the remarkable fall of the Berlin Wall, Ronald \nReagan traveled to Berlin, stood at the Brandenburg Gate, and \nthundered: ``As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a \nwall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that \nremains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.''\n  In this cynical age, when so many ridicule anyone attempting to \ndivine the difference between right and wrong, Ronald Reagan dared to \nbelieve in democracy. It was, perhaps, his old-fashioned belief in the \ngoodness of America and all that it represented that led him to \nunderstand what so many so-called experts failed to understand: that \nthe Cold War was a struggle not of military might or economic theory, \nbut of the human spirit's longing to be free.\n\n  President Reagan never lacked detractors--it seems there is no easier \nway to arouse scorn than to stand up for traditional values--but even \nhis most vociferous opponents stood in awe of his amazing rhetorical \ngifts. They called him the ``Great Communicator.'' But President \nReagan--with his typical humility--rejected the moniker. In his \nfarewell address to the Nation, delivered on January 11, 1989, he said:\n\n\n       I never thought it was my style or the words I used that \n     made a difference: it was the content. I wasn't a great \n     communicator, but I communicated great things, and they \n     didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the \n     heart of a great nation--from our experience our wisdom, and \n     our belief in the principles that have guided us for two \n     centuries. They called it the Reagan revolution. And I'll \n     accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the great \n     rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common \n     sense.\n\n  Indeed, the Reagan years were a reclamation of traditional \nprinciples. And all Americans owe Ronald Reagan a great debt, one that \nthe simple renaming of an airport doesn't begin to repay. But this does \nnot lessen the importance that the name of Ronald Reagan be enshrined \nin national institutions.\n  In the same farewell address to which I referred a moment ago, \nPresident Reagan issued a warning for those who would forget history. \n``If we forget what we did,'' he said, ``we won't know who we are.'' He \nspoke of an ``eradication * * * of the American memory that could \nresult, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit.''\n  This Friday, Ronald Reagan will be 87 years old. All of us are \nsaddened by his illness, but we are inspired by the gracious manner in \nwhich he and his family have faced it. And while he is still with us, \nwe should heed his admonishment to remember the values he stood for, \nthe President he was, and the man that he is.\n  Today, our classrooms and our universities are a battlefield of \nrevisionist history and sometimes venomous ideology. But long after \ntoday's petty scholastic disputes lie forgotten in the pages of some \nacademic journal, the Washington Monument, and the Jefferson and \nLincoln Memorials, and other national shrines will continue to stand in \ntribute to achievements of great Americans.\n  Ronald Reagan richly deserves to be remembered for his achievements \njust as earlier great American patriots are remembered. I am proud to \nsupport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and I hope that \nAmericans will accept this gesture of deep and genuine appreciation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation. I disagreed \nwith President Reagan on many issues, but I believe this proposal is an \nappropriate honor for a distinguished former President. I also support \nit because of the many personal kindnesses that President Reagan and \nhis family have shown to the Kennedy family over the years.\n  In particular, I remember two extraordinary occasions. On a wonderful \nmorning in the Rose Garden in June of 1981, President Reagan presented \na Gold Medal authorized by Congress and honoring Robert Kennedy to our \nfamily, and he spoke about my brother. Four years later, on a \nmagnificant evening in June of 1985, President came to my home in \nMcLean, Virginia and spoke about President Kennedy. These are two of \nthe finest tributes that anyone has ever given to my brothers. I \nbelieve our colleagues will find these tributes of interest, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of President Ronald Reagan on Presenting the Robert F. Kennedy \n               Medal to Mrs. Ethel Kennedy, June 5, 1981\n\n       The President. Mrs. Kennedy, the Congress has authorized \n     the presentation of a medal\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\n     for you in recognition of the distinguished and dedicated \n     service which your husband, Robert Kennedy, gave to the \n     government and to the people of the United States.\n       Robert Kennedy's service to his country, his commitment to \n     his great ideals, and his devotion to those less fortunate \n     than him self are matters now for history and need little \n     explanation from me. The facts of Robert Kennedy's public \n     career stand alone. He roused the comfortable. He exposed the \n     corrupt, remembered the forgotten, inspired his countrymen, \n     and renewed and enriched the American conscience.\n       Those of us who our philosophical disagreements with him \n     always appreciated his wit and his personal grace. And may I \n     say I remember very vividly those last days of the California \n     primary and the closeness that had developed in our views \n     about the growing size and unresponsiveness of government and \n     our political institutions. Among the last words he spoke to \n     this Nation that night in Los Angeles were, ``What I think is \n     quite clear is that we can work together in the last \n     analysis, and that is what has been going on within the \n     United States--the division, the violence, the disenchantment \n     with our society; the divisions, whether it's between blacks \n     and whites, between poor and more affluent, or between age \n     groups or on the war in Vietnam--is that we can start to work \n     together. We are a great country, an unselfish country, and \n     compassionate country.''\n       Obviously, many of you here knew him better than most. You \n     knew him as husband, as brother, as father, and uncle. He \n     wrote to his son, Joseph, on the day of President Kennedy's \n     death, ``Remember all the things that Jack started. Be kind \n     to others that are less fortunate than we and love our \n     country.'' And it is in the final triumph of Robert Kennedy \n     that he used his personal gifts to bring this message of hope \n     and love to the country, to millions of Americans who \n     supported and believed in him. ``Come my friends,'' he liked \n     to quote the Tennyson lines, ``it's not too late to seek a \n     newer world.'' And this is how we should remember him, beyond \n     the distinguished public service or our own sadness that he \n     is gone.\n       His friend, composer John Stuart, said about him what he \n     said about the first fallen Kennedy and about us: that when a \n     chill wind takes the sky, we should remember the years he \n     gave us hope, for they can never die.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Remarks of President Ronald Reagan at a Fundraising Reception for the \n            John F. Kennedy Library Foundation June 24, 1985\n\n       I was very pleased a few months ago when Caroline and John \n     came to see me and to ask for our support in helping the \n     library. I thought afterwards what fine young people they are \n     and what a fine testament they are to their mother and \n     father.\n       It was obvious to me that they care deeply about their \n     father and his memory. But I was also struck by how much they \n     care about history. They felt strongly that all of us must \n     take care to preserve it, protect it, and hand it\n       They're right, of course. History has its claims, and \n     there's nothing so invigorating as the truth. In this case, a \n     good deal of truth resides in a strikingly sculpted library \n     that contains the accumulated documents, recollections, \n     diaries, and oral histories of the New Frontier. But I must \n     confess that ever since Caroline and John came by, I've found \n     myself thinking not so much about the John F. Kennedy Library \n     as about the man himself and what his life meant to our \n     country and our times, particularly to the history of this \n     century.\n       It always seemed to me that he was a man of the most \n     interesting contradictions, very American contradictions. We \n     know from his many friends and colleagues, we know in part \n     from the testimony available at the library, that he was \n     self-deprecating yet proud, ironic yet easily moved, highly \n     literary yet utterly at home with the common speech of the \n     ordinary man. He was a writer who could expound with ease on \n     the moral forces that shaped John Calhoun's political \n     philosophy. On the other hand, he possessed a most delicate \n     and refined appreciation for Boston's political wards and the \n     characters who inhabited it. He could cuss a blue streak--but \n     then, he'd been a sailor.\n       He loved history and approached it as both romantic and \n     realist. He could quote Stephen Vincent Benet on General \n     Lee's army: ``The aide de camp knew certain lines of Greek \n     and other such unnecessary things that are good for peace, \n     but are not deemed so serviceable for war.* * *''\n       And he could sum up a current statesman with an earthy \n     epithet that would leave his audience weak with laughter. One \n     sensed that he loved mankind as it was, in spite of itself, \n     and that he had little patience with those who could perfect \n     what was not really meant to be perfect.\n       As a leader, as a President, he seemed to have a good, \n     hard, unillusioned understanding of man and his political \n     choices. He had written a book as a very young man about why \n     the world slept as Hitler marched on. And he understood the \n     tension between good and evil in the history of man; \n     understood, indeed, that much of the history of man can be \n     seen in the constant working out of that tension. He knew \n     that the United States had adversaries, real adversaries, and \n     they weren't about to be put off by soft reason and good \n     intentions. He tried always to be strong with them and \n     shrewd. He wanted our defense system to be unsurpassed. He \n     cared that his country could be safe.\n       He was a patriot who summoned patriotism from the heart of \n     a sated country. It is a matter of pride to me that so many \n     men and women who were inspired by his bracing vision and \n     moved by his call to ``ask not,'' serve now in the White \n     House doing the business of government. Which is not to say I \n     supported John Kennedy when he ran for President; I didn't. I \n     was for the other fellow. But you know, it's true, when the \n     battle's over and the ground is cooled, well, it's then that \n     you see the opposing general's valor.\n       He would have understood. He was fiercely, happily \n     partisan. And his political fights were tough--no quarter \n     asked, none given. But he gave as good as he got. And you \n     could see that he loved the battle.\n       Everything we saw him do seemed to betray a huge enjoyment \n     of life. He seemed to grasp from the beginning that life is \n     one fast-moving train, and you have to jump aboard and hold \n     on to your hat and relish the sweep of the wind as it rushes \n     by. You have to enjoy the journey; it's unthankful not to.\n       I think that's how his country remembers him, in his joy--\n     and it was a joy he knew how to communicate. He knew that \n     life is rich with possibilities, and he believed in \n     opportunity, growth and action.\n       And when he died, when the comet disappeared over the \n     continent, a whole nation grieved and would not forget. A \n     tailor in New York put up a sign on the door: ``Closed \n     because of a death in the family.'' The sadness was not \n     confined to us. ``They cried the rain down that night,'' said \n     a journalist in Europe. They put his picture up in huts in \n     Brazil and tents in the Congo, in offices in Dublin and \n     Warsaw. That was some of what he did for his country, for \n     when they honored him they were honoring someone essentially, \n     quintessentially, completely American. When they honored John \n     Kennedy, they honored the Nation whose virtues, genius, and \n     contradictions he so fully reflected.\n       Many men are great, but few capture the imagination and the \n     spirit of the times. The ones who do are unforgettable. Four \n     administrations have passed since John Kennedy's death; five \n     Presidents have occupied the Oval Office, and I feel sure \n     that each of them thought of John Kennedy now and then and \n     his thousand days in the White House.\n       And sometimes I want to say to those who are still in \n     school and who sometimes think the history is a dry thing \n     that lives in a book: Nothing is ever lost in that great \n     house; some music plays on.\n       I've even been told that late at night when the clouds are \n     still and the Moon is high, you can just about hear the sound \n     of certain memories brushing by. You can almost hear, if you \n     listen close, the whir of a wheelchair rolling by and the \n     sound of a voice calling out, ``And another thing, Eleanor!'' \n     Turn down a hall and you hear the brisk strut of a fellow \n     saying, ``Bully! Absolutely ripping!'' Walk softly, now, and \n     you're drawn to the soft notes of a piano and a brilliant \n     gathering in the East Room when a crowd surrounds a bright \n     young President who is full of hope and laughter.\n       I don't know if this is true, but it's a story I've been \n     told. And it's not a bad one because it reminds us that \n     history is a living thing that never dies. A life given in \n     service to one's country is a living thing that never dies--a \n     life given in service, yes.\n       History is not only made by people; it is people. And so, \n     history is, as young John Kennedy demonstrated, as heroic as \n     you want it to be, as heroic as you are.\n       And that's where I'll end my remarks on this lovely \n     evening, except to add that I know the John F. Kennedy \n     Library is the only Presidential library without a full \n     endowment. Nancy and I salute you, Caroline and John, in your \n     efforts to permanently endow the library. You have our \n     support and admiration for what you're doing.\n       Thank you, and God bless you all.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this bill \nto rename the Washington National Airport ``Ronald Reagan National \nAirport.''\n  I am disappointed in the partisanship and delay tactics involved in \nstalling this legislation. Personally, I can think of no more fitting \ntribute to our 40th President then renaming the main airport facility \nfor visitors to our nation's capital.\n  During his eight years in as President, Ronald Reagan stood as a \nPresident of principle, integrity and optimism. He took America at a \ntime of great disillusionment--gasoline shortages, hyper-Inflation and \nAmerican diplomats held hostage abroad--and transformed our spirit \nthrough vision and leadership\n  President Reagan showed America that leadership is not making \npromises, it's keeping promises.\n  Ronald Reagan promised us a better future and he delivered. His \nmessage was simple: America can be better. His charm, wit and eloquence \ncombined to communicate exactly the message that Americans needed to \nhear. And the nation reacted:\n  Interest rates, inflation and unemployment fell faster under \nPresident Reagan than they did immediately before or after his \nPresidency;\n  The nation experienced a 31% increase in real, inflation-adjusted \ngross national product;\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n  Exports increased 92.6% and manufacturing increased by 48%;\n  Median family income grew every year during his Presidency for an \nincrease of nearly $4000, after years of zero-growth in pre-Reagan \nyears;\n  In short, during the Reagan era, economic growth was stronger, job \ncreation was faster, incomes were higher and productivity was \nhealthier.\n\n  President Reagan's accomplishments were achieved because he believed \nthat a healthy economy should create opportunities and reward \nresponsibility and work. In his first inaugural address he told us:\n\n       It is not my intention to do away with government. It is \n     rather to make it work work with us, not over us; stand by \n     our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must \n     provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not \n     stifle it.\n\n  Some people believe that President Reagan's greatest legacy was the \nrestoration of pride and optimism in America. He made us believe in \nourselves and told us: ``There are no such things as limits to growth, \nbecause there are no limits on the human capacity for intelligence, \nimagination and wonder.''\n  Americans reawakened to themselves as a great people with a great \nfuture. A notable Democrat, our former colleague, Majority Leader \nGeorge Mitchell said, ``Like President Roosevelt, President Reagan \npossesses a legendary ability to inspire in Americans pride in their \nnation and faith in its future.''\n  And, perhaps, our colleague Senator Ted Kennedy said it best in a \nquote from the Boston Globe in 1989: ``He (Reagan) has restored the \npublic's confidence in the presidency. For that alone, he deserves our \nappreciation.''\n  Not only did President Reagan restore our sense of purpose and \nmeaning as a great country, but it was because of his vision and \ncommitment to freedom and democracy that today there is no longer a \nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics. There is today, no longer a Berlin \nWall.\n  These two seminal events of the 20th century are a direct result of \nthe policies of President Reagan. Our children and grandchildren will \nknow a level of security and peace well into the next century because \nPresident Reagan understood that peace can only be achieved and \nmaintained when we provide the full measure of resources to our men and \nwomen in the military who stand guard to protect liberty 24 hours a \nday, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\n  Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to help demonstrate to \nPresident Reagan that appreciation. I ask my colleagues to help me in \npassing S. 1575.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to voice my opposition to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I certainly have respect for our former President, \nRonald Reagan. I served in the Senate during his two terms as President \nand we worked together on many pieces of legislation. One of my \nproudest achievements was the passage of the national minimum drinking \nage bill that established a national drinking age of 21.\n  That law, which President Reagan proudly signed, is credited with \nsaving nearly 1,000 young lives each year. I am thankful to President \nReagan for being a part of that fight. While I did not agree with him \non a number of other issues, I do respect him and believe his legacy is \na powerful one.\n  However, Mr. President, Washington National Airport in Alexandria, is \nalready named after a great American--George Washington, our first \npresident. George Washington's role in our nation's history and in this \narea's history is rich and well documented.\n  George Washington, the father of our country, the man who led our \ntroops against the powerful British army, the man who chaired the \nConstitutional Convention, the man who lived a short 15 miles away at \nMount Vernon in Virginia, certainly does not deserve to have his name \nstripped from the airport, and replaced by another, which this bill \nwould effectively do. If this legislation passes, most people will \nrefer to it as Ronald Reagan airport, and President Washington's name \nwill rarely be associated with this facility again.\n  Mr. President, a short time ago, Congress named the second largest \nfederal office building in the nation--second to the Pentagon--after \nRonald Reagan.\n  Naming the Federal Triangle Project in downtown Washington the Ronald \nReagan Building and International Trade Center is a fitting tribute to \nPresident Reagan, who signed the authorization for that project into \nlaw, and who believed strongly in free trade. In the wake of honoring \nPresident Reagan with that naming, this bill is not necessary.\n  Mr. President, I have other concerns with this legislation, and I \nbelieve that those issues would also concern President Reagan.\n  There is a serious question as to whether it is appropriate for \nCongress to change the name of Washington National Airport. The bill \nwould impose Congress's will upon the local authorities by forcing them \nto change the airport's name. This would be done with no input from the \nlocal communities. No hearings. No votes. No discussion. No opportunity \nfor public comment. Simply put, the airport authority must adopt the \nname as determined by Congress, the federal government. This clear \nmandate from the federal government, imposed on the local communities, \nis precisely what President Reagan would object to.\n  His legacy is clear on this matter. We should not offend that legacy \nin an attempt to honor the man himself.\n  I am not ruling out any legislation with respect to this issue, but \nthe underlying bill will have to be improved before I will vote for it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nbill designating Washington National airport as the ``Ronald Reagan \nNational Airport.'' Mr. President, I am honored to participate in \nrenaming this airport after such a distinguished American.\n  Ronald Reagan presided over an era of tumultuous change and great \nchallenge. His policies helped reverse stagflation and high interest \nrates, and unleashed the longest economic recovery in recent history.\n  His courage extended freedom around the world. Ronald Reagan knew \nthat weakness is provocative. He not only restored America's military \nstrength, but challenged the tyrants who would shed American blood and \ndeny freedom to others. He confronted terrorists boldly and \ndecisively--with or without the assistance of other nations. He defied \nconventional wisdom to challenge Mr. Gorbachev to ``tear down [this] \nwall.'' And the wall fell. He demonstrated that America would stand \nstrong--even when she stood alone.\n  But perhaps most importantly, Ronald Reagan helped restore faith in \nthe American dream. When Reagan took office, America, is was said, was \nsuffering from ``malaise.'' Reagan reaffirmed the vision of a ``shining \ncity on a hill.'' He spoke to the hopes and dreams of ordinary citizens \nfor opportunity, achievement, and growth. He helped dispel the public \ncynicism that had darkened politics for years, and celebrating the \ndawning of ``morning in America.''\n  President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said that ``the presidency \nis pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.'' It was in this area \nthat Reagan's leadership was the most significant. Reagan was always \nmore simple than subtle. The American people knew where he stood, and \nwhat he stood for. In times of economic or international crisis, \nAmericans knew that Reagan's word was true, and that his resolve would \nnot waver.\n  It is for these reasons that I offer my support for S. 1575, to honor \na man who honored America.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my vocal support to S. \n1575, the bill to rename Washington National Airport the ``Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport.''\n  Last year, I was the first co-sponsor of this measure. At the time, I \nthought I had just beat the rush, and that I would be merely the first \nof a long list of co-sponsors. I though that surely, if every Member of \nthis chamber was aware of the debt they and their country owe to Ronald \nReagan, this bill would have 99 co-sponsors.\n  Instead, I was surprised that only 35 others have co-sponsored \nSenator Coverdell's bill. I was surprised when I learned that this bill \nis encountering serious opposition. And I will be more than surprised \nif this bill does not pass. I will be shocked and I will be saddened. \nIt is not often we are able to consider a bill so simple and so right \nas this one.\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\n  Ronald Reagan can truthfully be called one of the greatest living \nAmericans. President Reagan's most important contribution to his \ncountry was the leadership he provided during the West's long struggle \nwith totalitarian communism. When he called the Soviet Union an `evil \nempire' media pundits scorned him. Today, we all know that he was \nright. But President Reagan provided far more than rhetoric in the \nstruggle against communism. In 1980, America was dangerously weak and \ndemoralized. President Reagan understood this and he directed the \nstrengthening of all aspects of our military, coordinating our efforts \nwith other members of the Western alliance.\n  From the point when Ronald Reagan entered the White House, no \nadditional territory fell to the Communists. From that point forward \nthe tide began to turn. On all fronts, the Reagan administration backed \nthe forces of freedom. Reagan supported Solidarity in Poland, he backed \nthe freedom fighters in Afghanistan, Grenada was liberated, and he \nhelped democratic struggles throughout Latin America. The Soviet Union \nwas everywhere confronted by a Western alliance that had finally \nawakened to the dangers of appeasement. The alliance was greatly \nstrengthened by the friendship and support of President Reagan's close \nfriend and ally, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Together \nthey thwarted Communism and made the Kremlin and its puppet states \naware that the free world intended to remain free. The West won the \ncold war, and Ronald Reagan deserves much of the credit.\n\n  President Reagan's second great triumph was his economic plan. He was \nthe first modern President to directly challenge the notion that more \ngovernment was good. In his view, Government does not solve problems, \nit subsidizes them. While this view is widely held today, it was \nridiculed throughout the 1960's and 1970's. During those years, Reagan \nwas nearly alone in his struggle against the endless growth of \ngovernment. But he never altered his message. Unlike other politicians, \nhe stood firm, and gradually the country moved his way. He stopped the \nslow socialist slide of our Nation, and instead implemented policies \nthat provided the catalyst for the unparalleled financial and economic \nsecurity and freedom we now enjoy.\n  The Reagan program of lower taxes and less regulation was a \ntremendous success. In the early Reagan years all income taxes were cut \nacross-the-board by 25 percent. The decade to follow witnessed the \nlongest peacetime economic expansion in the history of our Nation. All \nincome groups experienced significant income gains from 1980 to 1989. \nTwenty million new jobs were created, and the vast majority were high-\npaying professional, production, and technical jobs.\n  In the late 1970's inflation was as high as 18 percent, and interest \nrates rose to 21 percent. The Reagan economic program brought both of \nthese down dramatically. The 1970's malaise brought on by high \ninflation, skyrocketing interest rates, high unemployment, and high \ntaxes was replaced by an economy that fostered opportunity, growth, and \noptimism.\n  President Reagan rallied our Nation. He reminded each of us of our \nproud history and heritage. He was never afraid to proclaim his love \nfor America. Most important, he stood up for what he believed. He knew \nthe importance of strength and resolve. The result was the most \nsuccessful Presidency in decades. As Reagan himself reminded us:\n\n       History comes and goes, but principles endure and inspire \n     future generations to defend liberty, not as a gift from \n     government, but as a blessing from our creator.\n\n  I know that the Federal Triangle building will be opening soon. I \nknow that it is named after Reagan. But Ronald Reagan was a man of the \npeople, not of bureaucrats. When he was called ``The Great \nCommunicator'' it was not because of his skill with memos or inter-\noffice correspondence. It was because of his ability to speak with, and \nfor, the average American. Some good can come of the irony in naming \nthe second largest and by far the most expensive federal building in \nAmerica after Ronald Reagan. We can let the name of the Ronald Reagan \nbuilding stand as a direct counter to the waste and excess involved in \nits building. It will also be a constant reminder to the civil service \nworkers inside of President Reagan's belief in a small, responsible and \neffective government.\n  But again, Reagan was not a man who loved big government. He should \nnot be memorialized solely by a big government building. The Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport--an airport that is used by our \ngovernment, but more importantly, by our people, and by the free people \nof the world--should stand as the monument to the Great American \nPresident.\n  President Reagan's 87 Birthday is Friday. We need to approve this \nbill, and present him with a small but well deserved gift from the \ncountry he so ably served.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will not support the legislation to \nrename the Washington National Airport. This is not legislation to name \nan unnamed airport or a new airport. Washington National Airport \nalready has an appropriate name and has had that name since it opened \nin 1941.\n  We should have a normal and systematic process for the naming of \nbuildings, bridges, monuments, airports and other public facilities. \nThe names of these landmarks should not bounce around from name to name \nin response to current events. Such decisions should be made in a non-\npolitical and careful manner weighing the many factors which come into \nplay, including the concerns of local governments and authorities.\n  There are many past Presidents, admired by millions of Americans, and \nothers around the world, including Harry S Truman who have no monument \nin Washington, D.C.\n  We have already, quite appropriately, recognized the accomplishments \nof President Ronald Reagan in several appropriate ways, including the \nnew federal Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center at \nFederal Triangle (which is the largest building in D.C.) and the Navy's \nnewest Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.\n  The Washington Post, in an editorial this past Saturday titled \n``Don't Rename Washington National'' stated, ``It is a bad proposal on \nmany counts, all of them going well beyond any public wishes to honor \nthe former president.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \neditorial be printed in its entirety immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhbit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for all these reasons and others, I cannot \nsupport this legislation to precipitously strip Washington National \nAirport of the name it has borne for more than half a century.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1998]\n\n                    Don't Rename Washington National\n\n       With alarming speed and little serious thought, members of \n     the House and Senate are pushing a bill to strip Washington \n     National Airport of its time-honored name and call it instead \n     Ronald Reagan National Airport. It is a bad proposal on many \n     counts, all of them going well beyond any public wishes to \n     honor the former president. As it happens, this capital city \n     already has honored Mr. Reagan in a most impressive way, \n     naming a major new, heart-of-downtown federal office building \n     after him. As it also happens, the name Washington National \n     honors this country's first president, who lived just down \n     the road a bit from the airport site. In addition, the name \n     Washington National clearly identifies the airport's location \n     and market--an important aid to travelers and shippers all \n     over the world.\n       There is yet another solid reason to drop the proposal. \n     Former Virginia governor Linwood Holton, the first Republican \n     to hold statewide office in the Old Dominion since \n     Reconstruction and former head of the Washington Airports \n     Authority, cites the history, intent and spirit of \n     congressional legislation signed in 1986 by President Reagan. \n     That act transferred Washington National and Dulles \n     International to the regional authority, granting it control \n     and oversight of the two airports. Gov. Holton notes that the \n     purpose of the transfer, ``as recited in the lease itself, \n     was to achieve `local control, management, operation and \n     development' of the airports. I am very concerned that after \n     ten years of this lease arrangement, the Congress now \n     proposes to take unilateral action to change the name.''\n       Mr. Holton notes that in the past, any changes in the lease \n     at the request of Congress were done with agreement to secure \n     the consent of the regional authority. And in this instance, \n     the local governments involved oppose the change--not for any \n     partisan or political reasons but because of the name \n     recognition that Washington National Airport conveys in the \n     travel and commercial industries, as well as the costs that\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n     would have to be borne by businesses in and around the \n     airport (changing signs, business forms and promotional \n     materials, for example).\n       Yet the renaming proposal is being rushed along without \n     proper hearings in an attempt to make it law in time for Mr. \n     Reagan's birthday next week. Thoughtful members of Congress \n     should consider the negative effects of this measure. There \n     are many ways to salute Ronald Reagan--as has been done here \n     already--but stripping Washington National of its name and \n     history is not an appropriate way. There is no insult \n     attached to voting no; on the contrary, this is the \n     respectful and proper way to redirect and continue any \n     movement to honor President Reagan here or elsewhere in the \n     country.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today this body passed legislation \nto rename Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan National \nAirport. I rise today to express my opposition to that legislation. My \nopposition is in no way meant to dishonor President Reagan. Recently, \nwe have named the nation's second largest federal building after \nPresident Reagan and have named a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier after \nhim as well. Clearly, Ronald Reagan accomplished a great deal during \nhis Presidency, and he deserves to be recognized for that contribution \nto our country.\n  However, I do not believe that we should seek to honor President \nReagan by diminishing the honor that we have bestowed upon President \nGeorge Washington when we named the Washington National Airport--truly \none of our nation's greatest founding fathers. Mr. President, I \nrecently finished reading a biography of George Washington. I recommend \neveryone in this body do so also. It is important to remember and \nrecognize the many contributions that he made to this country. For it \nis largely through his efforts that the United States is a world leader \nin every sense of the word.\n  Because of his leadership, the thirteen individual colonies united to \nbecome the United States--a sovereign, independent nation.\n  After the Revolutionary War, George Washington took a lead role in \ncrafting our constitution and in the campaign for its ratification. The \nsuccess of Washington's campaign was assured by 1797, at the end of his \nsecond presidential term, and his legacy continues to be the basis of \nlaw today.\n  President Washington acted with Congress to establish the first great \nexecutive departments and to lay the foundations of the modern federal \njudiciary. He directed the creation of a diplomatic service. Three \npresidential and five congressional elections carried the new \ngovernment, under the Constitution, through its initial trials.\n  His policies procured adequate revenue for the national government \nand supplied the country with a sound currency, a well-supported public \ncredit, and an efficient network of national banks.\n  Above all, he conferred on the presidency a prestige so great that \npolitical leaders afterward esteemed it the highest distinction to \noccupy the chair he had honored. His work and leadership as President \nis a benchmark by which we should measure all those who serve in that \nhigh office.\n  Most of the work that engaged Washington had to be achieved through \npeople. President Washington found that success depended on their \ncooperation and that they would do best if they had faith in causes and \nleaders. To gain and hold their approval were among his foremost \nobjectives. He thought of people, in the main, as right-minded and \ndependable, and he believed that a leader should make the best of their \ngood qualities.\n  As a national leader he upheld the right of everyone to freedom of \nworship and equality before the law, condemning all forms of bigotry, \nintolerance, discrimination, and persecution.\n  Throughout his public life, Washington contended with obstacles and \ndifficulties. His courage and resolution steadied him in danger, just \nas defeat steeled his will. His devotion to his country and his faith \nin its cause sustained him. Averse to harsh measures, he was generous \nin victory. ``His integrity,'' wrote Thomas Jefferson, ``was the most \npure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known. He was, \nindeed, in every sense of the word, a wise, a good, and a great man.''\n  Therefore, Mr. President, despite the respect and admiration I have \nfor President Reagan, I cannot in good conscience support a bill which \nwill diminish the great contributions President George Washington has \nmade to our nation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, needless to say, I think we are all \ngrateful to be at this moment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There was not a position. This is a \ngesture from a people and grateful nation and a grateful Senate. And I \nthank my colleagues, those who disagree, for the collegiality in which \nthis matter was resolved.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to congratulate and express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Georgia for the leadership he has \nexhibited here. He kept calm and he got the job done. I think it was \nthe right thing to do, and I am very proud that the Senate, in a very \nbroad, bipartisan vote, voted to name this airport after former \nPresident Reagan. I had the opportunity to talk to a couple of \ncolleagues here in the well as we were voting --Democrats who came up \nand remembered acts of kindnesses they had experienced from former \nPresident Reagan, and they voted for the legislation.\n  I know some had reservations or misgivings, but I think it was the \nright thing to do and it was the right time to do it.

Mr. President, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act reauthorization, ISTEA--in other words, the highway \nbill--sets the authorization levels for the current fiscal year and the \nnext 5 years for our Federal highway construction, bridge, highway \nsafety, and transit programs. When the Senate found itself unable to \ncomplete action on S. 1173 at the end of the last session, it was \nnecessary to pass a short-term extension bill to tide these programs \nover from October of last year until May 1, 1998. I supported that \nshort-term extension measure, but I did so with the understanding from \nthe distinguished Senate majority leader, and others in the leadership, \nthat ``immediately following the President's State of the Union \nAddress,'' the Senate would return to the highway reauthorization bill.\n  It now appears that things have changed and that the distinguished \nmajority leader is being urged by a handful of Senators to delay action \non it and not bring up ISTEA until after Congress completes action on \nthe fiscal year 1999 budget resolution. Mr. President, as one who has \nbeen majority leader, I can understand the pressures that are upon our \nown distinguished majority leader at this time with reference to the \nhighway bill. I have had discussions with the able majority leader, and \nprior to the reconvening of the Senate, I had the pleasure of talking \nwith the majority leader in my office. He showed me the courtesy of \ncoming to my office, and we sat for 30 minutes and discussed this \nmeasure and other matters. I can understand the pressures that are on \nhim from other Senators in this body. Having been majority leader, I \nknow that one cannot please all Senators on his own side, much less \nSenators on the other side of the aisle. I am fully aware of that. And \nwhat I say with respect to the bill certainly is not in denigration of \nour majority leader. I have an excellent relationship with him, as I do \nwith my own leader on this side of the aisle, and I would not want to \ndo anything to impair that relationship.\n  But, Mr. President, having said that, this would be a very \nshortsighted approach to handling one of the most important matters to \ncome before this Congress--the highway bill. I understand that the very \nable chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, has expressed his \nhope and intention to proceed quickly with his hearings and the markup \nof the budget resolution. As Senators are aware, Section 300 of the \nCongressional Budget Act sets a date of April 1 as the deadline for the \nSenate Budget Committee to report the budget resolution each year. The \nCongressional Budget Act requires Congress to complete action on budget \nresolutions every year by April 15.\n  I was here, Mr. President, when we enacted the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, and I spoke for it, supported it, and had a considerable \nbit to do with the formulation of it. But in all of the years since the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, Congress has met the deadline for \ncompleting action on budget resolutions only 3 times. Those 3 years \nwere fiscal years 1976, 1977 and 1994.\n\n  I say to all Senators, but particularly to the leadership, that this \nis not a very good record upon which to base our hopes for early \ncompletion of the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution. Yet, that's what \nthe plan appears to be, as it relates to the highway bill. As I say, I \nimplored, I importuned, I beseeched, I pleaded with the distinguished \nmajority leader before this session was convened and urged that we be \nallowed to bring up the highway bill. That was the commitment that was \nmade. It was made to the Senate, it was made to the American people. As \nI say, I know the majority leader has a lot of pressures on him, and I \ncan understand those, having been majority leader. So I am not going to \nbe one to criticize the majority leader in this respect. Heavy and \nuneasy is the head that wears the crown.\n  We are being told we should just be patient and our State highways \nand transit authorities should not worry. We'll get around to enacting \nthe ISTEA bill after the budget resolution is finished. Mr. President, \nthat places our State highway departments in an extremely precarious \nand uncertain position as they struggle to continue, without \ninterruption, the Nation's critically important highway construction, \nbridge construction and repair, highway safety and transit programs.\n  Now, every highway department is being put into that position. How \ncan we be sure that the budget resolution will be completed at all, \nmuch less by the April 15 statutory deadline? Eventually, it will be \ncompleted, but how can we be sure that it will be finished in time to \nmeet that deadline? In the past 25 years, Congress has only met that \ndeadline three times, as I have already indicated. On all other \noccasions, the deadline was missed, sometimes by months, as it was in \nfiscal year 1985 when the budget resolution was not completed until \nOctober 1, 1984; and for fiscal year 1991, when the budget resolution \nwas not completed until October 9, 1990.\n  But even if it is passed, how can we afford to wait until that \ndeadline? How can we afford to wait until April? How can we afford to \nwait until April 15 to bring up the highway bill? Construction seasons \nare upon us. Construction seasons in the northern States, in \nparticular, are going to be constricted.\n  If the leadership continues to hold up the ISTEA bill, I am concerned \nthat Congress will not be able to act on a new highway bill prior to \nthe statutory deadline now in existence for the obligation of highway \nand transit funds. How many more days do we have, Mr. President until \nMay 1? May 1 is the drop-dead date with respect to highway \nobligations--new obligations by the highway departments throughout this \ncountry. May 1. How many more days remain? We don't count Saturdays and \nSundays, naturally. But only 41 session days remain. Only 41 session \ndays when the Senate will be in session. The States will hit the \nspending walls for highway transfer funding on May 1. I assure all \nSenators that we will hear from the American people if we continue to \nignore the basic transportation needs of this Nation in such a cavalier \nfashion. The disruption of these transportation projects will be \nmassive, massive in the Northeast, in the Northwest, in the Southwest, \nand in the Southeast--all over this country. The disruption of these \nprojects will be massive across the Nation as States will be required \nto stop obligating funds on May 1 for the highway and transit programs. \nCongress needs to get its act together!\n\n  This is an irresponsible and unnecessary course that threatens the \nvery lives of people as well as the economic well-being of the people \nthroughout the country. Does it take a crisis, Mr. President, to force \nus to act here in Congress? Do we have to have a bridge collapse and \npossibly have people killed before we wake up? I have not\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nforgotten the collapse of the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, WV, in \n1967. It killed 46 people.\n  Let us look out of the windows and observe the rains that are \npounding our area. Listen to the radio, or watch the television set--I \ndon't do much of that; but I do watch the weather--and watch what they \nare saying about the weather all over this country, about the storm, \nabout what is happening in States back to the west and to the north. \nThe snow, the ice, the ravages of winter will further pock-mark and \nerode our highways and bridges. We can't afford delays in stepping up \nto our responsibilities for public safety very much longer.\n  Mr. President, I have asked the journal clerk how much time the \nSenate wasted yesterday in quorum calls and in recesses. On yesterday--\none day alone--we spent 59 minutes, almost an hour, in quorum calls, \nand 2 hours and 18 minutes in recesses. That is 3 hours 17 minutes--\nwith a quick calculation--3 hours 17 minutes spent in quorum calls and \nrecesses here in the Senate yesterday. We could have been working on \nthe highway bill.\n  Strategy games in Washington may be fine for those who do not depend \non safe, modern highways to protect their livelihoods and their lives. \nBut, hand-sitting will not serve us well when the public realizes what \nis going on.\n  I implore the leadership to move this bill as soon as possible. The \nclock is ticking, Mr. President, and time is running out.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S342-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1601\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to object, I am troubled by moving to this measure because I \nhave sought information from this administration, from the Centers for \nDisease Control, and that information has not been forthcoming.\n  I thank the majority leader for his willingness to assist me in this \nrespect. He has been very gracious and helpful to me in seeking to get \nthe information that I have requested. I will continue to propound that \nrequest, and I have agreed that it would be appropriate to proceed with \nthe measure at this time.\n  I want to thank the majority leader. While I do not intend to object, \nI do want to say that I think it would be inappropriate to conclude the \ndebate on this matter in any respect, by a vote or otherwise, absent \nthe kind of cooperation that I think the Senate deserves, when the \nPresident has brought a nominee to the Senate and individual Members of \nthe Senate have asked for information.\n  With that in mind, I thank you for this opportunity to express myself \non this. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me note that I appreciate the \ncooperation of the Senator from Missouri, and I certainly agree with \nhim. When a U.S. Senator requests information from an agency or a \ndepartment like the Centers for Disease Control about a nominee--I have \nlooked over the list. This is certainly not an unreasonable request. It \nis one that should be able to be complied with very easily. That \nrequest has to be honored. I do have a call into the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Secretary Shalala, and will urge her to act \nexpeditiously this afternoon to get that information to Senator \nAshcroft. If that information is not forthcoming, then I certainly \nunderstand that there would be no way that this debate could be brought \nto a conclusion or a vote until all information that is requested by \nany Senator would be made available to this body.\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for not objecting at this time so we can \nproceed with the debate and make sure that all relevant information is \navailable to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of nomination of Dr. \nDavid Satcher to serve our nation as Surgeon General and as Assistant \nSecretary for Health. Dr. Satcher is a well-respected physician and \nmedical researcher who has devoted his career to serving the Nation's \npublic health.\n  I want to note at the outset that it is relatively unusual for one \nperson to be nominated to fill two such significant positions at the \nsame time. When I reviewed the history of these positions, however, I \nlearned that there is a historical precedent. From 1977 to 1981, Dr. \nJulius B. Richmond served ably in both positions. I believe that by \ncombining these responsibilities we will better serve the needs of the \nnation.\n  Dr. Satcher has demonstrated the kind of commitment to serving our \nNation's public health that will be required to faithfully fulfill \nthese responsibilities. At a time when many physicians and policy \nmakers failed to appreciate urban health care needs, he began his \ncareer serving low-income and other disadvantaged patients in \nneighborhood health centers and urban hospitals. In 1982 he became \nPresident of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry \nMedical College has trained more African American physicians than any \nother medical school in the country.\n  In 1993, Dr. Satcher became the Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention where he has served with distinction the past \nfour years. Under his leadership, CDC has placed greater emphasis upon \nthe prevention of disease. He has worked to increase childhood \nimmunization rates from 55% to 78%.\n  As a result, the incidence of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases \nhas been reduced to its lowest level ever and three vaccine preventable \ndiseases have been entirely eliminated.\n  In addition, participation in CDC's comprehensive breast and cervical \ncancer screening program has expanded from 18 to 50 states. As a result \nof this initiative, more than 1.2 million women have received \nscreening, over 2900 women with breast cancer have been identified and \nreferred for treatment and over 21,000 women with an early treatable \nstage of cervical cancer have been identified and referred for \ntreatment.\n  Dr. Satcher also used his leadership to dramatically upgrade CDC's \nability to detect and respond to new infectious diseases and foodborne \nillnesses. As a result, CDC played a lead role in responding to the \noutbreak of Salmonella in Oregon that was caused by contaminated food, \nand was responsible for the efforts to contain the multi-state outbreak \nof Cyclospora resulting from consumption of contaminated raspberries \nthat threatened the health of thousands of children. Dr. Satcher's \nefforts lay the groundwork for the development of a new early warning \nsystem for infectious disease and foodborne illness that promises to \nsave thousands of American lives each year.\n  Dr. Satcher will need to draw heavily upon all of this commitment and \nexperience to master the challenging duties for which he has been \nnominated. The Surgeon General occupies the ``bully\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\npulpit'' of public health and is charged with the responsibility to \nprotect the health of the Nation through public education.\n  The Surgeon General must advocate for effective disease prevention \nand health promotion programs and must serve as a powerful symbol of \nour national commitment to protecting and improving the Nation's \nhealth. Dr. Satcher's legacy at CDC demonstrates his fitness to fulfill \nthese responsibilities.\n  The position of Assistant Secretary for Health is a position of equal \nimportance. The Assistant Secretary serves as the Secretary's senior \nadvisor for public health and science. In this capacity, Dr. Satcher \nwill be required to provide Department-wide leadership in the \napplication of sound medical and scientific principles to public \nhealth. In addition the Assistant Secretary for Health has direct \nresponsibility for several key public health initiatives.\n  These include: Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Emergency \nPreparedness, HIV/AIDS Policy, International & Refugee Health, Minority \nHealth, Research Integrity, Women's Health, Population Affairs, and \nPhysical Fitness & Health.\n  Dr. Satcher's particular challenge will be to preserve the \nindependence of the Surgeon General while fulfilling the Assistant \nSecretary's responsibilities to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n  Dr. Satcher has revealed a profound understanding of the importance \nof these two positions and pledged to me that he will rely upon science \nand common sense rather than politics to guide his decision making.\n  Dr. Satcher enjoys unprecedented and overwhelming support from within \nthe medical and public health community. I believe that Dr. Satcher is \neager to continue his efforts on behalf of the nation's public health \nand that he will fulfill his responsibilities faithfully. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. President, we did a thorough examination of the history and of \nthe work of Dr. Satcher, and we too looked into some areas that may be \nof controversy. But, in conclusion, after that thorough investigation, \nI have absolutely no reason not to stand before you and do all I can to \nmake sure that his nomination is approved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent of the Senate \nthat several members of my staff be given floor privileges during the \npendency of this debate: Don Trigg, Annie Billings, David Ayres, Lori \nSharpe, and Sarah McElroy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, as I explained earlier when the unanimous consent was \nsought by the leader to bring this matter to the floor of the Senate, \nthere is an absence of some materials that are important and pertinent \nto an evaluation of this nominee as a result of the failure or lack of \ncooperation of this administration to provide to Senators information \nupon our request. So I indicate at this moment that there will be \nthings that are reserved for debate at a later time when we have that \nmaterial available to us.\n  I am pleased to go forward now and take this opportunity to outline \nsome of my reasons for opposing the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for \nU.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  While a case against Dr. Satcher is a compelling one, I must confess \nfrom the outset to being a grudging participant in these struggles over \npolitical nominees. It is really not one of the more pleasant tasks in \nthe Senate. It gives me no satisfaction to deny anyone an opportunity \nto serve his or her country. Nomination fights can be difficult, they \ncan be abrasive, they can be partisan, and sometimes they work neither \nto educate nor to unify the Senate. Yet, after three years in \nWashington, I believe that America deserves better, America deserves \nhigher quality, and America deserves higher standards of ethics than \nthe standard that has been sent to this Senate by the administration \nfor confirmation.\n  A nation, like a person, rarely loses its integrity, or its capacity, \nor its ethics all at once. Instead, our values tend to be lost little \nby little. And I think we have seen that in this administration.\n  I can remember a Surgeon General of this administration who wanted to \nlegalize drugs. We have seen Cabinet Secretaries come forward to admit \ntheir infidelity. Then one day the Vice President goes out and endorses \nand embraces Hollywood and all of the values that Hollywood would \npropound to undermine the ethics and character of America. The next day \nthe President vetoes a partial-birth abortion bill and basically \ndefends what Patrick Moynihan, the Senator from New York, has labeled \nas ``infanticide.'' And so it goes.\n  Finally, we wake up to find our President accused of a kind of \nconduct in the White House with employees that I wouldn't even want to \ntry to describe here on the Senate floor. Frankly, I don't know what is \nmore tragic: That the Office of the President has been so thoroughly \ndebased in the debate and comments and accusations in the society, or \nthat our values have been so demeaned, that it appears much of the \npublic doesn't believe that we can expect any better.\n  Frankly, if my time in government has taught me any one thing it is \nthat we teach when we govern. We are assigning values to things when we \ngovern. When we approve of something we say to the culture ``This is \ngood,'' and when we disapprove of something we say ``This is bad.'' In \nassigning values in a culture, the values of which have been under \nserious attack, asking questions is an important one of our \nresponsibilities.\n  Government and its officials teach, and what we are teaching these \ndays is wrong. Although Dr. Satcher is a person of incredibly strong \nmedical credentials in terms of his expertise and his capacity, his \neffort has been devoted in an area and in a number of ways which call \ninto serious question the values that we would be teaching and the kind \nof ethical standards we would be saying are OK, if we were to confirm \nhim.\n  While our Nation is challenged by the crisis of drugs, the tragedy of \nillegitimacy, and the breakdown of the family, our public officials \nhave been too busy accommodating America in these things, rather than \ncalling America to her highest and best. Piece by piece, our Nation's \nintegrity has been sacrificed, and too often the Senate of the United \nStates has participated in confirming nominations or ratifying \nproposals without looking carefully at the ethics involved or the \nvalues that are being challenged when a nomination is being confirmed.\n  Dr. Satcher's elevation to the post of Surgeon General of the United \nStates, Dr. Satcher's confirmation, would reject America at her highest \nand best and would simply say that we are willing to accept a series of \nvalues which are far beneath what the American people endorse. Dr. \nSatcher, for example, has embraced partial-birth abortion. He tolerates \nabortions for minor children without parents' consent. He supports free \nneedle programs, so that drug addicts would be aided and assisted in \nthe administration of their drugs by a Government program that provides \nfree needles.\n  I think this accommodates people where they are, at a low level, \ninstead of challenging people to where we need to be, at a high level. \nI think America deserves that kind of challenge for quality and \nintegrity and ethics. I question the value of a Government program and \nits ethics when it provides needles to drug addicts so they can \nadminister drugs in a way which is more healthy--if you could say that. \nWhy should the United States of America participate in that?\n  Consider the following information. Dr. Satcher has promoted research \non African women who were HIV positive. That research denied them \nknown, lifesaving drugs and therapy. Our Nation's top medical journal \nis the New England Journal of Medicine. Virtually everything that you \never hear, in terms of something new, something at the cutting edge of \nimproving medicine, is written of and announced in and discussed on the \npages of the New England\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nJournal of Medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine chastised Dr. \nSatcher, literally branding his research in these African HIV trials--\nin which some African women bearing children were given sugar pills or \nplacebos--as being unethical.\n  I think America deserves better. America deserves a Surgeon General \nwho repairs to the highest standard of ethics. America deserves better \nthan a Surgeon General who would experiment on the most vulnerable \nmembers of the world's population.\n  Dr. Satcher has championed blind tests that sent thousands of HIV \npositive infants home without parental notification. That happened in \nthis country, not in Africa. Infants were tested for HIV. The tests \nwere maintained as blind so that no parent would know if the child that \nwas tested, their baby, was testing positive for HIV. This practice \nintentionally left moms and dads without an awareness or understanding \nof whether their child was infected with the HIV virus.\n  It might be argued, ``Well, the moms and dads might be able to find \nthis out because they realized they were living in risky lifestyles or \nwere at high risk for HIV infection themselves.'' That might be true. \nIt might not be true. But what happens if that mom or that family \ndecides to give the child up for adoption? If there had been a test of \nthe child's blood which indicated whether or not it was HIV positive, \nthe adoptive parent might not be privy to that information, especially \nif the information isn't even available to the natural birth parent. I \nthink America deserves better. I think this country deserves better \nthan a Surgeon General who would have those kinds of tests conducted \nand not provide that kind of vital, potentially lifesaving information.\n\n  I understand that people might want this kind of information for \nstatistical purposes, so we could develop an awareness of the \nstatistics about AIDS and which communities have the highest levels of \nAIDS. But I think Government too often views people as statistics. I \nthink we need a Government that views people as human beings and \nunderstands the importance of individuals and parents and children. \nIgnoring the potential for an early diagnosis on the HIV virus is, I \nthink, something that would raise serious questions. I would not want \nto be a parent who was not told if my child had HIV, in spite of the \nfact that the Government had conducted a test which would reveal it.\n  Certainly, if I weren't the natural parent and I were in the shoes of \nsomeone adopting a child, I think I would want to know, not so that I \nmight not adopt the child, but so that I might take whatever measures \nwould be necessary. One might begin to take the steps which could \ncurtail the incidence of the kinds of diseases that can attend and \nparticipate in the eventual collapse of an individual who is HIV \npositive. There is progress being made in the area of AIDS research. \nBut it seems to me if you have some life extending knowledge, you would \nwant to make that available because you might extend a life to the time \nwhen a cure would become available.\n  America deserves better than a Surgeon General who is more concerned \nabout the secrecy of experiments than he is about the lives of the \nspecific patients involved. There are scientists and medical doctors \nwho are more concerned about statistics. It may well be that they \nshould be commended for their interest in statistics. But I think \nAmerica's family doctor, the Surgeon General of the United States of \nAmerica, should be one who reflects a concern about individual lives \nand about individual health conditions. He should call America to her \nhighest and best as it relates to health and should never, never settle \nfor America at her lowest and least.\n  Maybe this is what America has come to expect from Washington. It may \nbe what we expect, but it is less than we deserve. It is time for us to \nstand up and defend values--values like honesty, integrity and \ndecency--and it's time for us to demand a Surgeon General who will \nappeal to the better angels of our nature, who will attend the health \nof the Nation, not one who would participate in the ``clean needles'' \napproach to the drug problem.\n  These are issues that I intend to elevate in the Senate's \nconsideration of this nomination: The African HIV studies overseen by \nDr. Satcher during his supervision of the Centers for Disease Control \nand the ethical debate that swirls around these studies, including the \nindictment by the New England Journal of Medicine that these studies \nwere unethical; the domestic AIDS detection programs that refused to \nidentify the blood samples with the children so that the parents would \nnever be told as a result of that test whether their children had AIDS, \nsending parents home with AIDS-infected children without giving them \nthe benefit of what the studies could have shown; there are the clean \nneedles programs which, frankly, don't appeal to us at our highest and \nbest but accommodate the culture at its lowest and least and put the \nGovernment in the drug business.\n  I think there are real reservations about the kind of signals that \nsends. What does it teach? What does it teach a young person if a \njunkie says to him or her, ``You ought to try this,'' and the young \nperson says, ``Well, I don't know if I should.'' Then the junkie says, \n``Well, look, the Government gives us these clean needles,'' rips open \na pack, and says, ``so that you won't have any problem, so this will be \na safe procedure for you.'' I have real reservations about that. I \nthink the people of the United States of America deserve better than \nthat.\n\n  I think the United States of America deserves better than a Surgeon \nGeneral who is willing to endorse the President's position on partial-\nbirth abortion. It is clear to me that the people of this country \nunderstand the heinous terror, the horror, and the tragedy of partial-\nbirth abortion. We do teach by what we endorse, when, by confirming \nsomething, we authorize and ratify it. I think we have real problems \nwhen we would purport to confirm an individual who is endorsing \npartial-birth abortion, especially when it is now well understood by \nmedical authorities that it is not even a medically needed or indicated \ntherapy.\n  All of these things are interesting points. There are other matters \nwhich will be the subject of discussion. But America deserves better. \nWe deserve a family doctor who will lead us to our highest and best, \nrather than accommodate us at our lowest and least. I mentioned in a \ncolloquy, with the leader of this Senate, that we had sought \ninformation from the Centers for Disease Control and from the \nadministration about this nominee and we had not been sent that \ninformation. Some of the information which we will be using in the \ndebate has come as a result of Freedom of Information Act demands, \nwhich information hasn't been forthcoming without those kinds of \ninquiries. As a result, I think you can expect the debate to be more \nthorough as the information arrives.\n  These are the broad outlines. America deserves better. America ought \nto have a Surgeon General who calls us to our highest and best, not one \nwho accommodates us at our lowest and least. We should not have a \nSurgeon General who would participate in an assault on the values of \nAmerica, opposing 80 percent of Americans who believe partial-birth \nabortion is wrong. We should not have a Surgeon General who believes \nthat it would be OK to have clean needles programs that put the \nGovernment in the business of participating in the administration of \nillegal drugs. We should have real reservations about a Surgeon General \nwhose regard for Third World populations allows him to use your tax \ndollars to have lower standards in conducting medical research on \npeople overseas than the standards he would use in the United States of \nAmerica. I think that has implications for who we are as a people and \nit has implications for the way other nations view us, if we are \nwilling to do things with their population we wouldn't do with our own \npopulation. Obviously we would have reservations about the maintenance \nof a program which tests the blood of young children for HIV but does \nnot provide their parents with the information that would allow them to \nmake good judgments about their health care later on.\n  With those things in mind, I would just signal that, as the \ninformation becomes available, I would expect additional Members of the \nSenate to come to the floor and participate in this debate. We will \nhave a chance to examine each of those categories in detail with a view \ntoward assessing whether or not\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\nthis Senate should teach the kinds of things that would be taught to \nthe American public if we were to confirm this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \nfriend from Missouri. I was disturbed about these matters, as he was, \nwhen I initially looked into the background of Dr. Satcher. These were \nfully investigated. They were answered in detail by the nominee. The \nrecord of those requests, involvement in these particular issues--the \ntwo most dramatic ones being perhaps the so-called free needles, clean \nneedles, and also the AZT trials--the answers to those interrogatories \nare a matter of record and available to all Senators. In addition to \nthat, they are on the Internet so the public can freely look into them.\n  Let me very briefly give you an idea of the nature of the situation. \nThe Senator referred to the New England Journal of Medicine. That would \ngive you considerable credibility. But you should know that two members \nof the editorial board who were familiar with the AZT trials, which \nwere in Africa, and were familiar with the methodology used resigned \nfrom the board as a result of that journal editorial. They understood. \nAnd I will go into length later on these trials, but I do not desire to \ndo so now.\n  Also, the question of needles and drugs is a matter of AIDS as well, \nAIDS prevention, and therefore when you understand fully the issue you \nwill understand that this is a defensible way to prevent the spread of \nAIDS.\n  But with that brief discussion, I will yield to my good friend who \nhas been so very helpful on my committee, the Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Frist.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise because I think we \nhave before us a very important issue and one that we have not dealt \nvery well with, at least since I have been in the Senate. There will be \na lot of debate as we just heard on a number of issues and I am happy \nto debate those issues. I think they are important to the American \npeople. If the allegations that have been sent to me by fax machine, \nsome of which we have heard just expressed in the Chamber, are true, I \nwould agree that America does deserve better. What I hope that I can do \nis offer a reasoned voice, a voice based on some experience but more \nimportantly one that is close to science, one that has been involved in \nplacebo controlled trials, one who participates in ethical \ndecisionmaking in medicine, in health care, one who knows Dr. Satcher, \nwhom I hope we hear something about. In fact, I will take a few minutes \nand talk about Dr. Satcher, the man, the man who came before our \ncommittee, the man who has contributed so much throughout his life for \nthe betterment of public health, his fellow man and, more importantly, \nfor that next generation.\n  I do think we need a Surgeon General. I was in Africa last week and \nasked a lot about these AZT trials, and I hope to have a chance to \ncomment on those a little bit later. About a month ago, there was what \nwe thought was a new disease, what the world thought was a new disease \ncalled Rift Valley Fever, which killed about 400 people in Kenya over a \nperiod of 3 weeks. It came quickly. It came because of the flooding. \nThere was an awakening of a mosquito larvae that carried a deadly virus \nwhich could not be identified. There was mass confusion in the \nscientific community, really all around the world, about, is this a new \nvirus? It causes a huge hemorrhagic bleeding and terrible death. Is it \ngoing to extend beyond the borders of Kenya to Africa and to the United \nStates?\n  Amidst all that confusion there was not a single voice either in the \nUnited States or anywhere in the world to step forward and take that \navailable information to reassure the public, to point out what is \nknown by science.\n  Luckily, a few weeks later, the virus itself was described, the \nfloods actually got much better and hopefully we have seen the end of \nthat particular virus for hopefully the next decade. It is a virus that \ndoes stay around for decades and decades. But it made me think how \nimportant it is to have a reasoned, educated, articulate, concise \nvoice--we do not have it--in the United States right now to interpret \nthe innovation and changes in how health care is delivered today to the \nAmerican people.\n  Just yesterday on this floor we introduced a bill on cloning. It is a \ndifficult bill, a bill I have had to go back and spend a lot of time \non, putting on my hat as a scientist to understand, and it made me \nthink once again, wouldn't it be nice to have somebody whose sole job \nis to be the Nation's doctor and to help interpret science, help \ninterpret what we know, to talk directly to the American people. I am \ntalking really generically about the Surgeon General now, because many \nof my colleagues have come forward in the past and said, do we really \nneed a Surgeon General? Wouldn't it be easier to escape all the \npolitics?\n\n  Let me say I think much of the discussion we are going to hear about \nis straight politics, nothing beyond that, and I hope we show over the \nnext few hours and the next few days the lack of substance that has \nbeen demonstrated by a number of groups today in terms of getting down \nto reality, the truth, and that is what I want us to demonstrate in \nthis body not just to each other but the American people. Let's rise \nabove politics.\n  Now, unfortunately, some people point back to several years ago when \nthe position of Surgeon General appeared to be used for political \nagendas and social agendas which were outside of the mainstream and \nAmerica did at that time deserve better. The case I wish to make is \nthat Dr. David Satcher does better. He is the most appropriate person \nfor this position today and will carry it out with the integrity, with \nthe dignity, with the moral values and the forethought, the background \nand the training that we as Americans expect.\n  Now, what is this position of the Surgeon General? A lot of people \nsay, ``What does he do?'' I already told you my impression of what we \nneed in terms of that articulate, concise, straightforward voice that \ncan listen and talk to the American people.\n  In addition, the Assistant Secretary of Health oversees \nadministration of eight agencies of the Public Health Service, which \ninclude the office of Surgeon General. In these dual roles, Dr. Satcher \nwould serve as the public doctor, but in interpretation of what is \ngoing on, the direction we should go, looking into the health and the \nfuture welfare of our children, but also in advising the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. That is a void which we have today. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services does not have a person to come \nin and advise on the sorts of policy that will affect everybody in this \nChamber today and their children and that next generation.\n  I sat through a lot of meetings today with talk about how much money \nthe President can spend, and the President has proposals, the private \nsector has proposals, how many hundreds of millions of dollars can we \nspend on television to educate people so that their children won't \nstart smoking or how we can set up a new bureaucracy with new employees \nout of Washington, DC, or take an old bureaucracy and have them come in \nand educate our young people today.\n  I just want to throw up my hands and say, listen, let's go back to \nthose basic principles. You do not have to spend more money. You do not \nhave to set up big bureaucracies. Let's get that one vocal, \nintelligent, trained, articulate, eloquent spokesman who can speak for \nmainstream values, and that one position can be the Surgeon General, \nwithout spending all this money on this extra bureaucracy that we do \nnot know whether it will work or not.\n  We know the role of Surgeon General works. On this same issue, in \n1964, if you asked the world who is the one voice who has had the most \nimpact today on this issue of smoking and teenagers, it has to go back \nto the Surgeon General's report of 1964. Yes, way ahead of its time. \nBut who better than to have the Surgeon General? Is it better to have \nthe heads of the tobacco companies or the manufacturers or politicians \nor somebody who can intelligently go in and digest the available \nscientific data, who can reach out to the American people and interpret \nwhat is right and what is wrong for the public health?\n  I contend it is the Surgeon General, and if you look back over that \nlonger\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\nrecord, not just the last 6 years but back to 1964 and before, you will \nsee that the Surgeon General's voice has been effective.\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop in the 1980s, all of us remember, woke America up \nto an emerging public health threat. Some people wanted to hide in the \nsand and say it is not a problem; it is not affecting my family, my \ncommunity. Therefore, let's not make any progress. Dr. C. Everett Koop, \nas Surgeon General, stepped forward and he said we have an emerging \ncrisis. He said it is HIV positive. It is called AIDS. In candor, in \nrealism, let's help the public.\n\n  I needed help as a health professional at the time to help separate \nout the facts from the fiction, what you read in the press, what you \nreceive over your fax from some special interest group that wants to \ntake a tiny little topic and blow it out of proportion. Who sets that \nperspective? I would argue that if it is in the field of public health, \nthe Surgeon General sets that perspective for an audience of health \npractitioners as well as the public.\n  Although we have not been very effective in looking to this office. \nYet there the Surgeon General's reports have been very effective and \ninformative regarding public health. About a year and a half ago, the \nSurgeon General's office issued a report demonstrating that moderate \nphysical activity can reduce the risk of heart disease and some \ncancers. These very effective reports produced over time have helped to \ninterpret for the public the direction of living a healthier lifestyle.\n  Now, if you look back historically at these reports--and I went back \nand did it because I haven't been around that long, in terms of looking \nat what has been generated from the office of the Surgeon General--my \nconclusion is that there has been no political agenda in mind in these \nreports--I don't want to say without exception because I haven't read \nevery report, but the well being of the Nation, of the public health \nwas at the heart of each of these reports. And I guess as I was in \nAfrica 2 weeks ago as a scientist who looks at new viruses, who looks \nat the public health challenges, I thought we have public health \nthreats in this country, such as smoking and drug abuse. Just last year \nwe talked in this body about foodborne illnesses, alcoholism, emerging \ninfectious diseases, resistance to antibiotics which we feel so \ncomfortable with. I can tell you the resistance to antibiotics is one \nof the greatest challenges we have in this Nation but also the world \nthat stands before us. Who is going to help us interpret what that \nmeans? Is it going to be a Senator? I don't think so. Is it going to be \nthe Secretary of HHS? I don't think so. Is it going to be the \nPresident? No. It is going to be the Surgeon General.\n  Dr. Koop called this position of Surgeon General a ``high calling \nwith an obligation to interpret health and medical facts for the \npublic.'' A high calling. I will tell you, it is a high calling because \nyou put yourself through the sort of accusations which I will contend \nand hopefully show that many are false. They are totally untrue. They \nare accusations, totally unproven, and that is going to be the subject \nI think of much of our discussion today. I hope the American public \nkeeps faith in this institution and in the sort of debate we will \nengage in and at every case come back and ask those fundamental \nquestions about integrity, about looking at one's past record as we \nlook to the future.\n  I haven't said very much yet about Dr. David Satcher. Let me say at \nthe outset that I know Dr. David Satcher. I have known him for a long \ntime. I knew him as a physician, a fellow physician in Nashville, TN. I \nhave known him as an educator, as somebody who has run a medical \nschool. And as we look to the sorts of challenges we have in the \nfuture, medical education is one of those challenges--how we maintain \nthe excellent physicians that we have today in a world of managed care, \nreduced funding by the Federal Government.\n  Dr. Satcher is an administrator. I guess a lot of the focus is going \nto be on the large public health agency, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC). Over the next several days, I have a \nfeeling what is going to happen is that you have the head of a large \norganization and you have thousands of programs under that \norganization, and we are going to have people find in some program down \nat the community level where there is some tracing through the large \norganization to the fellow at the top who is held responsible, and he \nshould be responsible for it as long as the American people look at all \nof the other positive things that he--in this case, Dr. Satcher--has \ndone in leadership of that organization, which is the largest public \nhealth organization, not just in the United States but in the world.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues to paint the larger perspective as we go \nthrough, as these examples of local programs are brought forward that \nhave something that I don't agree with personally. We will come back to \nthat. So I hope we can get above the politics and look at the \nqualifications of this family physician.\n  As we move into this next millennium, we need to be thinking about \nfamily practice. He is a family practitioner. He has the endorsement of \nthe society that represents family practitioners. Dr. Satcher has \ntaught family practice and chaired a department of family practice.\n  Science. Again, I mentioned that yesterday I spent most of the day \ninterpreting what somatic cell nuclear transfer is to my colleagues, to \nthe media, and to the American people and that's good, but I am not \nsure a United States Senator needs to be spending so much time talking \nabout a specific scientific technique year after year after year. And \nhere we have somebody who is nominated to be the next Surgeon General \nwho has not only a medical degree but a Ph.D., another advanced degree \nin an advanced science, the science of cytogenetics, somebody who has \nwritten research papers, been in the laboratory, applied for grants and \nreceived those grants, somebody who understands what a clinical trial \nis, what peer review is, what a placebo control trial is, somebody who \nhas been in the room as we talk about medical ethics. And medical \nethics is tough. You can always find people within the field who \ndisagree.\n  But I will contend that as we look at these ethical issues, such as \nthe clinical trials in Africa and other parts of the world, we will \ncome to the conclusion that the appropriate ethical process was \nundertaken under the leadership of Dr. David Satcher.\n  Another hat. Dr. Satcher has a distinguished record of promoting the \npublic health, improving health based upon science, not one's feelings \nor one's politics, but on science.\n  I don't agree with everything that Dr. Satcher says or does, nor do I \nexpect to, but I do want to go back to what he has told me, what he \npresented to our committee, because it is important for the American \npeople and for my colleagues to fully understand what his vision is, as \nwell as his background, because there is going to be an attempt to \ninsert another agenda on Dr. Satcher which is not his agenda.\n  I think in the confirmation process, we have to ask a couple of \nquestions.\n  No. 1, does this man, Dr. David Satcher, have the commitment, the \nintelligence, the training, the experience, the honesty, and the \nintegrity to be the chief spokesperson for Americans on matters \nconcerning health?\n  I contend that he does.\n  And can he articulate those views?\n  He is a good spokesperson. For my colleagues who have had the \nopportunity to talk to him, he can articulate his views with dignity \nand with clarity as an eloquent spokesperson.\n  He has a demonstrated public service record, which has been reviewed \nby the chairman in part. He is a good manager. Scientific integrity I \nhave mentioned.\n  President of Meharry Medical School in Nashville, TN, how important \nis that? I contend it is important to have had that past experience. If \nyou had to go out and choose a physician to participate in \nunderstanding public health, I think that being the head of a medical \nschool is a wonderful credential to bring to the table. He has an \nunderstanding of population-based medicine, a broad understanding of \nthe health care delivery system and--I can tell you and I am sure over \nthe course of the day, a number of people will put in letters of \nendorsement by the medical societies and by his peers--he is a widely \nrespected physician by the medical community.\n  He is a scientist, I mentioned. I should also mention, because we are\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\ngoing to be talking about ethics so much, that he is a wonderful family \nman with a wonderful wife, wonderful children, teaches Sunday school, \nunderstands medical ethics. From everything that I know about Dr. \nSatcher, he is a reasoned, scientific voice, and he will represent us \nwell as the next Surgeon General.\n  Let me look a little bit more at his experience. I mentioned he \nreceived his medical degree and his Ph.D. The Ph.D. was in \ncytogenetics. It was at Case Western Reserve.\n  I think it important to have both, that understanding of individual \npatients--and he has practiced medicine--as well as an understanding of \nthe science and having that advanced degree, a Ph.D. in cytogenetics.\n  His experience is broad. We know about the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. We know about Meharry Medical College. What you \nmay not know, is that for 3 years, he was professor and chairman of the \nDepartment of Community Medicine and Family Practice--that was back in \n1979 to 1982--thus, demonstrating his concern for his local \ncommunities.\n  In a theme which he gave again and again, both in our committee and \nwith me directly, was his commitment to allowing decisions to be made \nby local communities instead of decisions dictated by the federal \ngovernment out of Washington, DC. I think that is important, because as \nwe look at a number of these programs and information we are reaching \nout for, I hope my colleagues will ask the question, did Dr. Satcher, \nthrough the CDC, make the decision on that program or did he allow a \nlocal community to make a decision using the resources that are \navailable?\n  I think his commitment, which has been made very clear to me, to have \nboth resources and decisions about public health made by local \ncommunities comes from his experience having been a chairman of the \nDepartment of Community Medicine and Family Practice at the School of \nMedicine in Morehouse College down in Atlanta.\n\n  Before that time, Dr. Satcher was a dean, an interim dean, at the \nCharles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School. He was also a professor \nand chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at the Charles R. \nDrew Postgraduate Medical School in Los Angeles. And, he was medical \ndirector of the Second Baptist Free Clinic.\n  His professional experience is interesting, because we talk about \npopulations, and I don't want to get too far into the science, but I \nthink it is important that whoever is the Surgeon General does \nunderstand what happens with large populations. The Surgeon General \nbecomes the Nation's doctor. And just like when I, as a physician \nbefore coming to this body, would see a patient who came in the door, \nit was my job to interpret, to educate, to listen to and to diagnose. \nThe Nation's doctor does the same for over 250 million people. \nTherefore, it is important he understands populations and disease in \npopulations.\n  It is interesting that Dr. Satcher also was an assistant professor of \nepidemiology, and that is the statistical study of population-based \ndiseases. Once again, a wonderful credential for the position of \nSurgeon General. That was at the School of Public Health at the UCLA \nSchool of Medicine in Los Angeles.\n  Does he understand medical problems? Yes.\n  Remember his many published articles--I don't need to go through the \narticles, but let me relate to you that he has written extensively \nabout hypertension, high blood pressure. Cardiovascular disease is the \nNo. 1 killer in the United States of America today. In the early 1970s, \nhe was director of the hypertension outreach program. He has done \nresearch. He understands the importance of preventive as well as \ntherapeutic medicine.\n  Board certification. His qualifications: 1994, fellow, American \nCollege of Preventive Medicine. Yes, this man understands what we need \nto do now to prevent, not just treat, the problems that we inevitably \nwill face and probably will face with increasing frequency in the \nfuture.\n  In 1980, fellowship, American Academy of Family Physicians. I have \nalready mentioned their broad support for their medical colleague in \nthis position.\n  1976, board certification, American Board of Family Practice.\n  Active in communities. I mentioned that he spent a large period of \nhis life in Nashville, TN, which is my home. These are the sort of \nthings we don't look at a lot here because we get lost in rhetoric. I \nthink a lot is how involved one is as a role model in their own \ncommunities. Dr. David Satcher was involved in his own community. I \nmentioned he taught Sunday school. He is active with the United Way and \nhas been on the board of United Way in middle Tennessee. He was chair \nof the Minority Health Professions Foundation. He was a board member of \nthe Boy Scouts of America for 10 years. Board member, Easter Seals \nSociety. This man understands his commitment to large populations. He \nunderstands public health. What is wonderful to me is it starts with \nhim as a role model, as a father, as an active participant in his own \ncommunity.\n  We are going to come back to a lot of the issues, issues which mostly \narose after the committee hearing on Dr. Satcher's nomination. At the \nhearing, Dr. Satcher had the opportunity to articulate his vision of \nwhat this Office of Surgeon General is. And, therefore, I would like to \nrefer back just very briefly to what he has said, to use it as the \nfoundation upon which the discussions about looking to the future will \nrest.\n  This is from the testimony before the Labor Committee. He basically \nsaid:\n\n       As Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General, \n     I would take the best science in the world and place it \n     firmly within the grasp of all Americans. I would not just \n     speak to Americans but would also listen to them, really \n     listen to them. I would want to hear about their expectations \n     and their experiences, their questions and their concerns \n     and engage them in an ongoing conversation about physical \n     activity, about good nutrition.\n\n  We haven't heard much about that thus far in this body, about Dr. \nSatcher's agenda.\n  I hope we talk about Dr. Satcher's plans for good nutrition.\n\n       For responsible behavior and passports to good health and \n     long life.\n\n  He says:\n\n       As Surgeon General, I would strive to provide our citizens \n     with cutting-edge technology in plain old-fashioned straight \n     talk. Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I \n     want to send the message of good health to the American \n     people.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       My goals as Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon \n     General are to be an effective advisor to the Secretary by \n     providing sound medical public health and scientific advice \n     as appropriate. I want to bring more attention, awareness and \n     clarity to the opportunities for disease prevention and \n     health promotion that are available to individuals, families \n     and communities in this country. I want to help make the \n     health of children and youth a greater priority for the \n     Nation and serve as a positive and inspirational role model \n     to them.\n\n  That is his vision.\n  One last quotation from that testimony, again more to get it in the \nRecord and have my colleagues understand where Dr. Satcher wants to go. \nHe said in closing:\n\n       I will challenge the American people to be the best they \n     can be and to respect the roles of parent, families and \n     communities. I will try to bring people together. That is who \n     I am.\n\n  Let's keep that in mind, that fundamental kernel in mind as we go \nthrough and listen to the various arguments made why he should not be \nSurgeon General.\n  As a way of introduction, because that is what we are doing in terms \nof setting the parameters, instead of going into each of the issues \nthat have been mentioned earlier, let me cite several of the \nallegations and start that debate as we go back and forth.\n  As I have said, a number of allegations have come forward, and I am \nsorely disappointed in the substance behind those allegations as they \ncome across the fax machine and are presented to me by well-meaning \nconstituents who came forward and said, ``What is it? Did Dr. Satcher \nreally do that?'' I hope to point out over the next day or so that, no, \nhe did not, and that our responsibility is to come to the truth behind \nDr. Satcher.\n  Position No. 1 is partial-birth abortions and the proposed ban, and \nthis is one I dealt with very early on, because\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\nI feel strongly that this body has a responsibility as trustees to the \nAmerican people to ban this procedure which offends the sensibilities \nof everyone.\n  The issue of partial-birth abortion also deeply troubles Dr. Satcher, \nand I hope that everybody who is concerned about this issue has sat \ndown and talked with him and listened to his statements.\n  In a letter dated October 28 to me, Dr. Satcher wrote the following:\n\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and \n     Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I \n     share no one's political agenda--\n\n  Let me read that one more time--\n\n       I share no one's political agenda, and I want to use the \n     power of these positions to focus on issues that unite \n     Americans, not divide them. If confirmed by the Senate, I \n     will strongly promote a message of abstinence and \n     responsibility to our youth, which I believe can help to \n     reduce the number of abortions in our country.\n  In the written responses to the Labor Committee--also it is important \nto refer at least to that in passing; we will probably come back to \nit--Dr. Satcher says he supports in concept the ban of this partial \nbirth abortion procedure, and then explains what his position is. But I \nthink what is important, if you look over his past, his 25 years as a \nprofessional, abortion has not been on his agenda in terms of promoting \nthe public health, and as you look forward, based on the statements he \nhas made to us directly to the committee and in our own conversations, \nabortion is not going to be on his agenda.\n  I think the people who feel so strongly about the litmus test on the \nstatement by Dr. Satcher that he thinks those sorts of decisions should \nbe made locally--if the litmus test is so strong, I can understand my \ncolleagues voting against Dr. Satcher. But I hope they look more \nbroadly since it is not going to be on his agenda for the future and \nhas not been over the last 25 years.\n  Number 2. Dr. Satcher's position regarding AZT, which is a drug that \nis used successfully, if it is given in a certain high-tech way, to \nprevent the transmission of the HIV virus from a mother to a child. We \nare going to come back to this a lot. It is a good issue. It is a good \nissue because there has been years of extensive debate on this very \nissue by the countries that are involved, by the United States, by \nscientists, by theologians, by trained ethicists. We can relive those \ndebates, if you would like.\n  But let me try to boil it down to several issues. I was in Africa \nlast week, in countries including Kenya. The per capita spending on \nhealth care for an individual in Kenya is about $5 annually.\n  Should we take a therapy, ethically, that in this country we know \nworks--the cost down there, if we adopted it, is about $1,000. This \ntherapy works in the United States. But in truth, from a practical \nstandpoint, logistically, because it is intravenous therapy, it \nrequires a series of doses with followup that extends over a long \nperiod of time. Practically, economically, logistically, that therapy \nhas zero chance--and nobody says otherwise--to become the standard \ntherapy in a country like Kenya today, zero chance.\n  Is it ethical, I ask, for us in the United States to take that arm, \nthat therapy to Kenya and experiment there when there is absolutely no \nchance that that therapy can ever be used to benefit that population? \nThe answer is, no. By international standards, the answer is, no.\n  That is the standard basically. If you are going to be using clinical \ntrials which are dealing with people directly, the therapy has to be in \nsome shape or form potentially beneficial to that population. And $5 \nper person is what is spent on health care totally--child care, \nprenatal care, treatment in the hospitals, clinics, medicines. And to \nthrust a therapy which cost $1,000 into a health care system that \ncannot support it is, to my mind, unethical. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, placebo control trials. What does that mean? It means \nbasically that someone comes in, you are looking to see whether an \nintervention works or not, the HIV virus is transmitted from mother to \ndaughter. What can you do to intervene to stop transmission of that \nvirus that is practicable, that is reasonable, that has some chance of \nbeing applied there broadly?\n  Well, the question is, can you take that very complicated, Western-\nstyle, intravenous $1,000 AZT therapy, which is the standard in America \nnow, can you in some way modify that so there is some chance that a \nshorter course, hopefully given orally, or maybe a shorter course with \none intravenous dose, but a shorter, less expensive course, works? \nBecause if it works, you can go out and prevent the transmission of HIV \nto the millions of babies who are born to mothers who are HIV positive.\n  How do you know if it works or not? You have to compare it \nto something. From an ethical standpoint, nobody has been in any one of \nthese AZT trials under discussion that informed consent has not been \nobtained. So when you go out and say this is like Tuskegee--we can go \ninto that--it is nothing like it. And I look forward to that, coming to \nthe floor in relation to that, because I received these faxes comparing \nit to a terrible, terrible experiment in this country. It is not like \nthat. We will come back to that. But every person had informed consent \nin these trials. That is very important because that is one of the \nnational, international norms.\n\n  AZT. Does it work or not? What do you compare it to? Well, the \nstandard today in clinical trials all over the world is that you have a \ncontrol population and a population that you intervene with. How else \nare you going to know what the difference is, whether this AZT therapy \nworks?\n  Yes, this was a placebo controlled trial. It is the standard of \ntherapy today. People do not get treatment right now for the \ntransmission of HIV. When I was down there as a physician asking, \n``What do you do?''--one out of four people in this community are HIV \npositive--``What do you do?'' they laughed. ``We can't do anything. Why \ndon't you help us devise a protocol?'' That is what happened.\n  These countries came to the United States of America, through the \nWorld Health Organization, and said, ``We have to design an \nintervention that will work, that is practical, that is consistent with \nit being applied in these countries.'' And the response, going through \nthe appropriate ethical channels, were these trials that we are talking \nabout.\n  Why placebo control? Why can't we use placebo controls, since we had \nthis control population, in the United States? Well, we do not know \ntoday whether AZT, this drug, interacts in some way with a background \nof malaria. And you have to have a placebo control trial because the \npopulation there is not the population in the United States of America \nor in France or in England or wherever these past trials have been \nconducted. The only way you can get the answer is through carefully \ndesigned placebo control prospective trials to be able to answer that \nquestion--does AZT work or not?\n  The third issue that has come forward is this needle exchange \nprogram. And I think we will get back to that. Let me just make the \nfollowing statement because it boils it down to everything.\n  Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer-funded needle exchange \nprograms for drug abusers. Dr. Satcher has recommended to Congress that \nwe allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with \nthis particular issue. Dr. Satcher believes strongly that we should \nnever do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The intravenous \nuse of illegal drugs is wrong. He has said that. He opposes the use of \nany illegal drugs.\n  Secretary Shalala, in a February 1997, report to Congress, concluded \nthe following in regard to this needle exchange program, because it can \nbe pulled out and draw up these images in people's minds of needles \ngoing into the arms of drug addicts, especially free needles. We have \nto step back and look at what the scientific studies show.\n  In the letter that she sent to Congress, the following conclusions \ncould be made. Needle exchange programs--and I quote--``can be an \neffective component of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and \nother bloodborne infectious diseases in communities that choose to \ninclude them.'' That is what the science said. We can argue that and we \ncan talk about the social policy. That is what the science says today. \nBut most importantly, the department itself has not yet concluded that \nthe\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nconditions set forth by Congress on Federal funding of needle exchange \nprograms have yet been met. We in Congress have crafted a protection to \ndisallow federal funding of needle exchange programs unless the science \nshows that such programs will not only reduce HIV infection, but also \nnot increase drug use.\n  Fourth, is Dr. Satcher's position on the survey of childbearing \nwomen, the blinded surveys. We have heard already this morning, and we \nwill continue to hear, that opponents of Dr. Satcher have erroneously \nclaimed--and I use the word ``erroneously;'' and I underline it--that \nthe infants known to be HIV positive were sent home without parental \nnotification after being tested specifically for HIV. And this is \nsimply untrue. It is not true.\n\n  Again, it takes some understanding of how science today, and the \nmedical community and the public health, obtains baseline data from a \npopulation so you will know where you are starting, whether or not \ninterventions work or not, how much of a public health issue it should \nbe.\n  In this particular case, samples were gathered from left over blood \nspecimens that were taken for standard tests. The rest of the blood is \ndiscarded and put over in a cabinet, typically thrown away.\n  Under this study, all personal identifying information is taken off. \nBut that blood has some useful purpose from an epidemiologic \nstandpoint, from a public health standpoint because we can see what the \nbaseline of something like HIV positivity actually is. The information \nthat was gathered from these surveys of this discarded blood is not \nlabeled, is not attached to an individual--Why not? For reasons of \nprivacy, something that we all respect. We do not want people taking \nblood from us, having our name attached to it, testing it, and then \nreleasing it to the world. However, those same women were counseled \nabout the benefits of being tested and offered an HIV test that would \nallow them to know their and their baby's HIV status. The allegation is \nthat this was a secret test. Yet, women were offered and encouraged to \nbe tested and to be aware of their HIV status.\n  This blind survey was critical. We can look how far we have come and \nthe progress that has been made, in terms of treating HIV infection, \nwith our public health officials, because it was the only totally \nunbiased way to provide a valid estimate of the number of women \ninfected with HIV as well as their demographic distributions.\n  Thank goodness we have access to such information. But again, this \nwhole accusation that infants known to be HIV positive were sent home \nwithout telling their parents they were being diagnosed with HIV is \nsimply untrue. This survey yielded population-based numbers of the \nincidence of HIV, not linked to individuals unless they gave their \ninformed consent.\n  Well, as you can tell, I feel strongly about this position of Surgeon \nGeneral. I will bring my remarks to a close for this time around. I \nfeel strongly that we need a Surgeon General who can articulate the \nneeds, the challenges of public health, which are inevitably there. We \nneed a Surgeon General who can advise the administration because the \nadministration is making decisions every day that affect the public \nhealth whether it be in the area of disease or prevention or managed \ncare, organization and delivery of our health care system.\n  Secondly, I feel very strongly that Dr. David Satcher is the man for \nthis position. He is a scientist. He is a family man. He is committed \nto local decisionmaking. He is an educator. He is a spokesperson. He is \nan eloquent spokesperson. But most importantly, he is committed to his \nfellow man, to improving the public health.\n  I look forward to the debate. I hope our colleagues do participate in \nthe debate. And I think that at the end of the day, hopefully, we will \nget to the truth and the kernels of truth that lie behind all the \naccusations and ultimately confirm Dr. David Satcher.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for a \nwell-documented, very thorough and careful examination of the nominee.\n  I now yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, my esteemed \nranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Are we under a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two fellows in my office, \nCaroline Lewis and Diane Robertson, be granted floor privileges for the \nconsideration of the Satcher nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join in commending my friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, for an \nexcellent presentation. During the consideration of the nominee, he was \ncareful with his questions, probing with his questions, and obviously \nprepared prior to the time of the nominee's presentation and during the \ncourse of the hearings.\n  I think today we see the result of some very hard and disciplined and \ninformed judgment based upon his evaluation of this extraordinary \nnominee for the position of Surgeon General and the Assistant \nSecretary. I listened with great interest to his very detailed \ndescription of the great opportunities for this Nation when we gain the \nservice of Dr. Satcher in that position as Surgeon General and \nAssistant Secretary for Health.\n  I heard with great interest, again, his response to a number of the \nallegations, quite frankly, misrepresentations that have been made \nabout Dr. Satcher's record. I must say that I find myself in agreement \nwith his understanding of Dr. Satcher's position, and as to his \nrepresentation to the committee during the course of the nominee's \npresentation, and in response to various questions.\n  I also want to commend the chairman of our committee, Senator \nJeffords, for the work that he has done in both scheduling Dr. Satcher \nfor the hearings, for the way that the hearings were conducted, the \nbalance and the fairness which is so much a part of everything that he \nis associated with, and for his compelling statement as well.\n  I am very hopeful that the Senate will have the opportunity to vote \non this truly outstanding nominee in the not too distant future. This \nposition has been vacant for a very considerable period of time. We \nhave an outstanding recommendation by the President, a truly \noutstanding nominee, an outstanding candidate, an outstanding \nindividual on the issues of public health. The position of Surgeon \nGeneral needs to be addressed if we are going to be responsive to the \nconcerns of our families in this country. We have had, quite frankly, \nenough delay on this outstanding nominee. It is time to act.\n  Mr. President, I commend the leadership for bringing to the floor the \nnomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary for Health. Dr. Satcher is extremely well qualified for this \nposition. In fact, his life story is a tribute to the strength and \nvitality of the American dream. Dr. Satcher was raised on a farm in \nrural Alabama. He was one of 10 children. His mother was a homemaker \nand his father was a foundry worker. Neither of his parents finished \nelementary school, and between them, they never earned more than \n$10,000 a year.\n  The defining moment of Dr. Satcher's extraordinary life may well have \noccurred when he was a toddler. It was then, at the age of two, that he \nsurvived a near fatal attack with whooping cough. Although whooping \ncough had been a leading cause of death among young children in the \nUnited States, it would become much rarer by the time he was born. But \nthe vaccine was not available to Dr. Satcher's family. They were poor \nAfrican Americans living in the rural South. They had limited access to \nmedical care, and none of the white doctors who practiced in the area \nwould treat black patients. Fortunately, Dr. Satcher's father was able \nto talk a black physician in the area into making a house call and, \nagainst all odds, Dr. Satcher survived this dire illness. Largely as a \nresult of this experience, he decided he wanted to become a doctor. He \nstated that he wanted to ``make the greatest difference for the people \nwho I thought have the greatest need.''\n  Mr. President, he repeated that during the course of these hearings. \nAnyone who was in that room at that time\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nand had an opportunity to listen to Dr. Satcher make that statement and \nmake that commitment would not be on the floor of the Senate now urging \nrejection of this nominee. His commitment was to make ``the greatest \ndifference for the people who I thought had the greatest need.'' That \nwas a statement made with extraordinary humility. By someone else, it \nmight have a different ring. But when you were there listening to Dr. \nSatcher make that statement, you could not help but know that he has \nbeen committed to that cause over the course of his extraordinary life, \nand it has been an extraordinary life.\n  Dr. Satcher's parents wanted their children to get the best education \nthey could as black children attending segregated schools in rural \nAlabama. Dr. Satcher was valedictorian of his high school class. He was \none of only three students, out of a class of seventy, who went on to \ncollege.\n  He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, which awarded him a full \nscholarship. He graduated magna cum laude and was elected Phi Beta \nKappa.\n  I have heard comments on the floor that ``the United States is \nentitled to the best.'' Three out of seventy graduated from his high \nschool and he goes on to college with a scholarship and graduates magna \ncum laude. We have the best, Mr. President. We have the best in this \nnominee.\n  He went on to medical school at Case Western Reserve University, a \nfirst-rate, tough medical school. I have had the opportunity to visit \nthat excellent school, and it is one of our best, and it's tough \nacademically, it's vigorous. He was one of only two African American \nstudents. He became the first black student to receive a Ph.D. degree \nand M.D. degree simultaneously.\n  He was also elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. After \nfinishing his residency at the University of Rochester, Dr. Satcher \nwent to Los Angeles to join the hypertension clinic at the \nMartin Luther King, Jr. General Hospital in Watts. I have had the \nchance to go to that hospital, and it is right on the firing line, in \nterms of trying to meet human need. He went on to direct research on \nSickle Cell Anemia at the King-Drew Sickle Cell Center there, and he \nfounded and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. He \nopened a free clinic in Watts, in the basement of a Baptist church that \nhe had joined, and he served as its medical director until 1979.\n\n  Mr. President, just keep following along this extraordinary life of \ncommitment to others, and of excellence, in terms of the practice of \ncompassion and reaching out to those who are the hardest pressed.\n  From 1974 to 1979, he taught epidemiology at UCLA, one of the top \nmedical schools. Dr. Satcher then returned to Morehouse College to \nchair the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice. In \n1982, he became president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville and \nserved in that capacity for 10 years, where he is credited for helping \nto deal effectively with the college's financial problems.\n  Whether you are talking about going out into the most difficult areas \nand opening a free clinic in the bottom of a church and trying to help \nand assist people, whether you are talking about being in the \nclassrooms at UCLA as an instructor to the brightest minds in our \ncountry, whether you are talking about being a college president, he \nhas done it all. He has done it all, Mr. President. But his heart is \nout there with the underserved people. You can't look at his record, \nand you can't read about it and listen to him and not understand it.\n  Since 1992, Dr. Satcher has ably led the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention in Atlanta, the agency responsible for protecting the \nNation's health and preventing disease, injury and premature death. In \nthis capacity he has played a leading role in safeguarding and \nimproving the health of all Americans.\n  In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, CDC developed and \nimplemented a very successful childhood immunization initiative. Before \nthe initiative, only a little more than half of the Nation's children--\n55 percent--were immunized. Today, the figure is 78 percent, and \nvaccine-preventable childhood diseases are now at a record low.\n  Dr. Satcher would be the first to say: I don't deserve all the credit \nfor this. He would say: I don't even deserve a great deal of the \ncredit, or even a little of the credit.\n  But he would tell you that he was out there fighting every step of \nthe way with those who do deserve the credit. He was there, and he \ndeserves great credit for this because he made it a priority. It was in \nterms of not only the availability and accessibility of vaccines, but \nit was working to try and overcome the kinds of resistance that exists \nin so many communities locally across this country that he was able to \ndevise strategies to work this through. I find that in my own State of \nMassachusetts, in a number of different communities, there is a great \nhesitancy or resistance to move ahead with immunizations for children, \nfor many different reasons--those individuals that have difficulty with \nthe English language and those that have cultural kinds of problems in \nmoving forward, in terms of vigorous vaccination regimes, the \nrepetitiveness in making sure children are going to keep up to speed in \nterms of the number of times that we have to go back and get these \nvaccinations. There is a lot of complexity in terms of making sure that \nchildren are going to receive those vaccines. But we have gone from 55 \npercent to 78 percent on his watch. He deserves credit.\n  Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to deal more effectively with \nthe infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses. Our Nation relies on \nCDC to provide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease \nand protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC is implementing a \nstrategy against new and re-emerging infectious diseases, like TB, with \nbetter surveillance and detection. Many of us thought we had moved past \nTB, the time of tuberculosis. Yet, we find pockets of it that still \nexist in many different communities in this country. It is associated \nso much with the problems of poor housing, poor sanitary conditions, \nand generally the problems associated with poverty. We have it in many \nof our communities. We still have it and we can't forget it, and we \nshould not forget it. We need a doctor that understands the response to \nrecent food poisoning incidents. He has been a leader in developing a \nnew early warning system to deal with such illnesses. He has earned \nmany distinguished tributes during his extraordinary career. In 1996, \nhe received the prestigious Nathan B. Davis Award from the American \nMedical Association for outstanding service in advancing the public \nhealth.\n  In 1986, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National \nAcademy of Sciences in recognition of his outstanding leadership.\n  Dr. Satcher is a respected family doctor. Ask those families out \nthere in the Watts area. Ask the families down in the southern parts of \nour country in rural communities. I think for any of us that took the \ntime to sit through those hearings and listen to him can understand \nthat he has--I suppose the best description is the ``bedside manner.'' \nThere are other words that are more eloquent to describe it. But he has \nit, and anybody that has ever met him and known him, or talked to him, \nor, I am sure, have been treated by him would understand and respect \nhim. He is a respected scholar that has been elevated to the most \nprestigious positions in our country, voted on by those of his peers \nwho understand his scholarship, and he is a respected public leader \nrecognized for his service in public health.\n  His career has emphasized work in patient care, health policy \ndevelopment and planning, education, research, health professions \neducation, and family medicine. His range of skills and experience, and \nstrong commitment to improving public health make him well qualified to \nbe the country's principal official on health care and health policy \nissues--America's doctor. America is a healthier nation today, and it \nis healthier in large part because of Dr. Satcher's leadership. He is \nan excellent choice to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \nHealth. The Nation faces significant public health challenges.\n  We need a Surgeon General who can speak with candor, and advise the \nnation on smoking, AIDS, teenage pregnancy, the link between diet and \ndisease, and other major health concerns. In the 1940s, Surgeon General \nThomas Parran used blunt talk to warn the public about venereal \ndisease. In 1964,\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\nSurgeon General Luther Terry first alerted the public to the dangers of \nsmoking and the link between smoking and lung cancer. Surgeon General \nC. Everett Koop used his position to raise awareness about AIDS and \nother major health issues. People listen when the Surgeon General \nspeaks. Dr. Satcher is well-qualified to follow in this distinguished \ntradition.\n  Dr. Satcher's nomination has broad bipartisan support. He's been \nendorsed by a large number of health groups, including the American \nMedical Association, the American Nurses Association, and a wide range \nof academic health centers and public health organizations. I look \nforward to working closely with him in the future, and I urge the \nSenate to give him the overwhelming vote of support he deserves.\n  Mr. President, I have about 10 or 15 more minutes. But I see my \nfriend and colleague from Maryland. I would like to be able to conclude \nmy remarks after the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was supposed to be here at 2 to give a short speech and \nintroduce a bill. Would it be all right with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland if I do that? I have to chair the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I can enter my statement into the Record. I am not \ndebating the merits, if my colleague will yield--but just to affirm the \ncompetency.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would rather hear from the Senator. If I can't, and if \nwhat I have outlined is not satisfactory, I would rather let the \nSenator speak, and I will take my chances. Could we have the Senator \nspeak for 10 minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will speak for less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could go immediately following the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we recognize \nthe Senator from Maryland for whatever time she expects, and following \nthat the Senator from Utah, and then if I could ask that I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \narrangement.\n  Mr. President, It is a great honor for me to support the nomination \nof Dr. Satcher.\n  I enthusiastically support his nomination to be Surgeon General and \nAssistant Secretary of Health.\n  This position, which serves as the nation's spokesperson on public \nhealth issues, has been vacant far too long. When I decide whether to \nsupport a nominee, I look at the nominee's competence and personal and \nprofessional integrity. Dr. Satcher is highly competent. Dr. Satcher \nhas the greatest personal and professional integrity of any nominee who \nhas come before our Committee in recent years. Dr. Satcher has a truly \nremarkable story. He's overcome substantial odds and hardships. He \ngraduated from that great institution Morehouse College in Atlanta, \nGeorgia, where Dr. Martin Luther King graduated and thousands of \nAfrican-American men.\n  At a time when there were few African-American physicians in our \ncountry, Dr. Satcher attended Case Western University in Cleveland, \nOhio, where he received his medical degree. Dr. Satcher was the first \nAfrican-American to earn an M.D. and a Ph.D. at Case Western. He was \nlater a professor at Charles R. Drew Medical School in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia and returned to his alma mater, Morehouse, to become the \nhead of the school of Medicine there. He served as president of Meharry \nMedical School in Nashville, Tennessee from 1982 to 1993 before \nbecoming the director of the Centers for Disease Control.\n  I have worked closely with Dr. Satcher, when he was the head of the \nCenters for Disease Control. He was enormously helpful and responsive \nwith my state's psfesteria crisis.\n  During his tenure at the Centers for Disease Control Dr. Satcher \nestablished himself as a very capable leader in the arena of public \nhealth. He aggressively took on the responsibilities of promoting \nhealth and preventing disease, injury and premature death. Whether it \nwas increasing childhood immunization rates, expanding the breast and \ncervical cancer screening program, researching effective treatments for \nAIDS, or stressing preventive measures in pursuing good health, Dr. \nSatcher has done an excellent job.\n  I admire his work on the issues of minority health, especially sickle \ncell anemia, which affects mostly African-Americans. I also admire Dr. \nSatcher's courage to look at the link between guns and the public \nhealth. Too many young African-American men are being killed by gun \nviolence in our cities. I was also pleased with the way Dr. Satcher \ntook on the issue of food safety.\n  I am very concerned about recent incidents which have forced us to \ntake a good look at the safety of our food supply.\n  Dr. Satcher was on cue when he laid the groundwork for a new Early \nWarning System to detect and prevent food-borne illnesses. This \ninitiative will help respond to outbreaks of food-borne illness \nearlier, and give us the data we need to prevent future outbreaks.\n  The work Dr. Satcher has accomplished at CDC, along with his \nexperience as a physician and scholar before that, directly prepare him \nfor the role of a good surgeon general.\n  As Surgeon General, Dr. Satcher will be America's advisor on public \nhealth issues and the national leader in developing public health \nstrategies.\n  I know Dr. Satcher will provide this country with a strong voice for \npublic health. I wholeheartedly endorse this nominee. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Dr. Satcher's nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch and Mr. Cleland pertaining to the \nsubmission of S.J. Res. 40 are located in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have questioned Dr. \nSatcher's support for clinical trials of the drug AZT in foreign \ncountries as part of the all-out international public effort to halt \nthe mushrooming epidemic of mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS \nvirus. Every day more than 1,000 babies in developing countries are \nborn infected with HIV. Clinical trials in the United States in 1994 \nshowed that it is possible to reduce the mother-to-infant transmission \nof HIV by administering AZT during pregnancy, labor and delivery. \nHowever, it is recognized that such treatment would not be feasible in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Senator Frist talked about this briefly in his presentation. It is \ntoo expensive, and it requires ongoing therapy which is not possible in \nremote areas. It also prohibits breast feeding. For these reasons a \ngroup of international experts convened by the World Health \nOrganization in June 1994 recommended that research be carried out to \ndevelop a simpler, less costly treatment. The idea was to make it \naffordable in terms of the limited resources for African countries and \nalso that would be culturally suitable in terms of the breast feeding \nand in terms of the amount of times that individuals would have to come \nback for treatment. The idea was to tailor the regime to the existing \ncultural, economic and social regimes which exist in areas of the world \nwhere we have high concentrations of HIV but recognizing that one of \nthe very encouraging areas with regard to HIV is trying to intercept \nthe passage of the HIV into newborn children.\n  Recognizing the possibilities for trying to reduce the communication \nof HIV to these infants, the challenge was, can we develop an \nalternative regime that would prevent the babies of those infected with \nHIV from contracting this disease, and do it in a way which is \naffordable, culturally acceptable, and effective? So, responding to \nthis urgent need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and other \ninternational experts worked closely with scientists from developing \ncountries to develop a treatment that is usable in these countries and \ncan reduce the devastating toll of HIV on their children.\n  Dr. Satcher has acted entirely ethically and responsibly on this \nissue. The World Health Organization and the developing countries \nurgently requested\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nthe CDC and NIH to provide assistance in designing and conducting these \ntrials, in cooperation with the research communities in the host \ncountries.\n  In a letter to NIH dated May 8, 1997, Edward K. Mbidded, chairman of \nthe AIDS research committee of the Uganda Cancer Institute wrote:\n\n       These are Ugandan studies conducted by Ugandan \n     investigators on Ugandans. Due to lack of resources, we have \n     been sponsored by organizations like yours. We are grateful \n     that you have been able to do so. There is a mix-up on issues \n     here, which needs to be clarified. It is not NIH conducting \n     the studies in Uganda, but Uganda's doing the study on their \n     people for the good of their people.\n\n  Dr. David Ho, the director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center \nin New York City and Time's 1996 Man of the Year, has stated:\n\n       These clinical trials were created for Africans by Africans \n     with the good of their people in mind and with their informed \n     consent. The studies were designed to be responsive to local \n     needs through the constraints of each study site. African \n     scientists have argued that it is not in their best interests \n     to include a complicated and costly AZT regime for the sake \n     of comparison, for such a regime is not only unaffordable but \n     logistically indefensible.\n\n  Before patients were enrolled in the clinical trials, they were \nspecifically informed of their AIDS status and counseled about the \nrisks and benefits of participation, including the fact they might be \nin a study group that received a placebo instead of an AZT anti-virus \ndrug.\n  This is the critical issue or one of the very major issues that \nobviously distinguish it from the Tuskegee study where there was no \ninformed consent. At the time when the study started with the African \nAmericans, blacks in this country, in the South, primarily in Alabama, \nthose who participated in the venereal disease studies were never told \nthat there was a cure. They were never informed that there was medical \ninformation that could make these individuals healthy. They were \nmaintained, effectively, by the U.S. Public Health Service, in their \nstage of sickness. And some of them even died.\n  This whole issue of informed consent was a matter of very \nconsiderable debate and discussion here in the U.S. Senate in the early \n1970's. I had the opportunity of chairing the hearings during that \nperiod of time. After those series of incidents, we required informed \nconsent. Every Member of this body and everyone who is listening to \nthis knows that every time they go into a doctor's office and they sign \nthat little sheet, ``informed consent''--they never did that before \n1975. That was as a result of Senate hearings. Any tie-in with Tuskegee \nis a distortion and misrepresentation and a disservice and inaccurate.\n  In Tuskegee there was no ethical review. In these studies there was \nan ethical review. There was no oversight of those kinds of studies. In \nthis study there is an oversight. There was no counseling about the \ntransmissibility. In this study there was. No informed consent. In this \ncase--yes. It is entirely different.\n  Now, as a practical matter, the only AZT treatment--to come back to \nthe proposal again that was approved for the African countries--as a \npractical matter the only AZT treatment available to any women in these \ndeveloping countries is the treatment provided to participants in the \nstudy. There was no other kind of treatment. The HIV-infected women in \nthese countries do not have access to AZT because, as has been pointed \nout, it costs too much.\n  Ethics Committees in both the United States and the developing \ncountries conducted continuous, rigorous ethical reviews of the trials. \nThe committees were made up of medical scientists, ethicists, social \nscientists, members of the clergy, and people with HIV. The role of \nthese committees guaranteed that the trials would conform to strict \nethical guidelines for biomedical research, including the Declaration \nof Helsinki and the International Guidelines for Biomedical Research \nInvolving Human Subjects.\n  The AMA president-elect, Dr. Nancy Dickey, has stated that these \nstudies are ``scientifically well founded'' and ``in the long run will \nprovide serious answers and are not the kind of superficial, unethical \nresearch that the critics are trying to make them out to be.''\n  Dr. Neil Halsey, the Professor and Director of the Division of \nDisease Control of the Department of International Health at Johns \nHopkins University; Dr. Andrea Ruff, Associate Professor at Johns \nHopkins, wrote to Secretary Shalala on October 24, 1997 stating:\n  ``. . . we strongly believe that these trials are ethical and \nessential for identifying effective, practical regimes that could be \nimplemented in most developing countries.''\n  Even those within the scientific community who have raised concerns \nabout these trials, such as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the director of the \nPublic Citizen Health Research Group, have expressed their support for \nDr. Satcher.\n  So, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \narticles that indicate the broad ethical support for the conduct of \nthese trials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the New England Journal of Medicine, Oct. 2, 1997]\n\n  Ethical Complexities of Conducting Research in Developing Countries\n\n          (Harold Varmus, M.D. and David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D)\n\n       One of the great challenges in medical research is to \n     conduct clinical trials in developing countries that will \n     lead to therapies that benefit the citizens of these \n     countries. Features of many developing countries--poverty, \n     endemic diseases, and a low level of investment in health \n     care systems--affect both the ease of performing trials and \n     the selection of trials that can benefit the populations of \n     the countries. Trials that make use of impoverished \n     populations to test drugs for use solely in developed \n     countries violate our most basic understanding of ethical \n     behavior. Trials that apply scientific knowledge to \n     interventions that can be used to benefit such populations \n     are appropriate but present their own ethical challenges. How \n     do we balance the ethical premises on which our work is based \n     with the calls for public health partnerships from our \n     colleagues in developing countries?\n       Some commentators have been critical of research performed \n     in developing countries that might not be found ethically \n     acceptable in developed countries. Specifically, questions \n     have been raised about trials of interventions to prevent \n     maternal-infant transmission of the human immunodeficiency \n     virus (HIV) that have been sponsored by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC). Although these commentators \n     raise important issues, they have not adequately considered \n     the purpose and complexity of such trials and the needs of \n     the countries involved. They also allude inappropriately to \n     the infamous Tuskegee study, which did not test an \n     intervention. The Tuskegee study ultimately deprived people \n     of a known, effective, affordable intervention. To claim that \n     countries seeking help in stemming the tide of maternal-\n     infant HIV transmission by seeking usable interventions have \n     followed that path trivializes the suffering of the men in \n     the Tuskegee study and shows a serious lack of understanding \n     of today's trials.\n       After the Tuskegee study was made public, in the 1970s, a \n     national commission was established to develop principles and \n     guidelines for the protection of research subjects. The new \n     system of protection was described in the Belmont report. \n     Although largely compatible with the World Medical \n     Association's Declaration of Helsinki, the Belmont report \n     articulated three principles: respect for persons (the \n     recognition of the right of persons to exercise autonomy), \n     beneficence (the minimization of risk incurred by research \n     subjects and the maximization of benefits to them and to \n     others), and justice (the principle that therapeutic \n     investigations should not unduly involve persons from groups \n     unlikely to benefit from subsequent applications of the \n     research).\n       There is an inherent tension among these three principles. \n     Over the years, we have seen the focus of debate shift from \n     concern about the burdens of participation in research \n     (beneficence) to equitable access to clinical trials \n     (justice). Furthermore, the right to exercise autonomy was \n     not always fully available to women, who were excluded from \n     participating in clinical trials perceived as jeopardizing \n     their safety; their exclusion clearly limited their ability \n     to benefit from the research. Similarly, persons in \n     developing countries deserve research that addresses their \n     needs.\n       How should these principles be applied to research \n     conducted in developing countries? How can we--and they--\n     weigh the benefits and risks? Such research must be developed \n     in concert with the developing countries in which it will be \n     conducted. In the case of the NIH and CDC trials, there has \n     been strong and consistent support and involvement of the \n     scientific and public health communities in the host \n     countries, with local as well as United States-based \n     scientific and ethical reviews and the same requirements for \n     informed consent that would exist if the work were performed \n     in the United States. But there is more to this partnership. \n     Interventions that could be expected to be made available in \n     the United States might be well beyond the financial \n     resources of a developing country or exceed the capacity of \n     its health care infrastructure. Might we support a trial in \n     another country that would not be offered in the United \n     States? Yes, because\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\n     the burden of disease might make such a study more compelling \n     in that country. Even if there were some risks associated \n     with intervention, such a trial might pass the test of \n     beneficence. Might we elect not to support a trial of an \n     intervention that was beyond the reach of the citizens of the \n     other country? Yes, because that trial would not pass the \n     test of justice.\n       Trials supported by the NIH and the CDC, which are designed \n     to reduce the transmission of HIV from mothers to infants in \n     developing countries, have been held up by some observers as \n     examples of trials that do not meet ethical standards. We \n     disagree. The debate does not hinge on informed consent, \n     which all the trials have obtained. It hinges instead on \n     whether it is ethical to test interventions against a placebo \n     control when an effective intervention is in use elsewhere in \n     the world. A background paper set forth our views on this \n     matter more fully. The paper is also available on the World \n     Wide Web (at http://www.nih.gov/news/mathiv/mathiv.htm).\n       One such effective intervention--known as AIDS Clinical \n     Trials Group protocol 076--was a major breakthrough in the \n     search for a way to interrupt the transmission of HIV from \n     mother to infant. The regimen tested in the original study, \n     however, was quite intensive for pregnant women and the \n     health care system. Although this regimen has been proved \n     effective, it requires that women undergo HIV testing and \n     receive counseling about their HIV status early in pregnancy, \n     comply with a lengthy oral regimen and with intravenous \n     administration of the relatively expensive antiretroviral \n     drug zidovudine, and refrain from breast-feeding. In \n     addition, the newborn infants must receive six weeks of oral \n     zidovudine, and both mothers and infants must be carefully \n     monitored for adverse effects of the drug. Unfortunately, the \n     burden of maternal-infant transmission of HIV is greatest in \n     countries where women present late for prenatal care, have \n     limited access to HIV testing and counseling, typically \n     deliver their infants in settings not conducive to \n     intravenous drug administration, and depend on breast-feeding \n     to protect their babies from many diseases, only one of which \n     is HIV infection. Furthermore, zidovudine is a powerful drug, \n     and its safety in the populations of developing countries, \n     where the incidences of other diseases, anemia, and \n     malnutrition are higher than in developed countries, is \n     unknown. Therefore, even though the 076 protocol has been \n     shown to be effective in some countries, it is unlikely that \n     it can be successfully exported to many others.\n       In addition to these hurdles, the wholesale cost of \n     zidovudine in the 076 protocol is estimated to be in excess \n     of $800 per mother and infant, an amount far greater than \n     most developing countries can afford to pay for standard \n     care. For example, in Malawi, the cost of zidovudine alone \n     for the 076 regimen for one HIV-infected woman and her child \n     is more than 600 times the annual per capita allocation for \n     health care.\n       Various representatives of the ministries of health, \n     communities, and scientists in developing countries have \n     joined with other scientists to call for less complex and \n     less expensive interventions to counteract the staggering \n     impact of maternal-infant transmission of HIV in the \n     developing world. The World Health Organization moved \n     promptly after the release of the results of the 076 \n     protocol, convening a panel of researchers and public health \n     practitioners from around the world. This panel recommended \n     the use of the 076 regimen throughout the industrialized \n     world, where it is feasible, but also called for studies of \n     alternative regimens that could be used in developing \n     countries, observing that the logistical issues and costs \n     precluded the widespread application of the 076 regimen. To \n     this end, the World Health Organization asked UNAIDS, the \n     Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, to coordinate \n     international research efforts to develop simpler, less \n     costly interventions.\n       The scientific community is responding by carrying out \n     trials of several promising regimens that developing \n     countries recognize as candidates for widespread delivery. \n     However, these trials are being criticized by some people \n     because of the use of placebo controls. Why not test these \n     new interventions against the 076 regimen? Why not test them \n     against other interventions that might offer some benefit? \n     These questions were carefully considered in the development \n     of these research projects and in their scientific and \n     ethical review.\n       An obvious response to the ethical objection to placebo-\n     controlled trials in countries where there is no current \n     intervention is that the assignment to a placebo group does \n     not carry a risk beyond that associated with standard \n     practice, but this response is too simple. An additional \n     response is that a placebo-controlled study usually provides \n     a faster answer with fewer subjects, but the same result \n     might be achieved with more sites or more aggressive \n     enrollment. The most compelling reason to use a placebo-\n     controlled study is that it provides definitive answers to \n     questions about the safety and value of an intervention in \n     the setting in which the study is performed, and these \n     answers are the point of the research. Without clear and firm \n     answers to whether and, if so, how well an intervention \n     works, it is impossible for a country to make a sound \n     judgment about the appropriateness and financial feasibility \n     of providing the intervention.\n       For example, testing two or more interventions of unknown \n     benefit (as some people have suggested) will not necessarily \n     reveal whether either is better than nothing. Even if one \n     surpasses the other, it may be difficult to judge the extent \n     of the benefit conferred since the interventions may differ \n     markedly in other ways--for example, cost or toxicity. A \n     placebo-controlled study would supply that answer. Similarly, \n     comparing an intervention of unknown benefit--especially one \n     that is affordable in a developing country--with the only \n     intervention with a known benefit (the 076 regimen) may \n     provide information that is not useful for patients. If the \n     affordable intervention is less effective than the 076 \n     regimen--not an unlikely outcome--this information will be of \n     little use in a country where the more effective regimen is \n     unavailable. Equally important, it will still be unclear \n     whether the affordable intervention is better than nothing \n     and worth the investment of scarce health care dollars. Such \n     studies would fail to meet the goal of determining whether a \n     treatment that could be implemented is worth implementing.\n       A placebo-controlled trial is not the only way to study a \n     new intervention, but as compared with other approaches, it \n     offers more definitive answers and a clearer view of side \n     effects. This is not a case of treating research subjects as \n     a means to an end, nor does it reflect ``a callous disregard \n     of their welfare.'' \\2\\ Instead, a placebo-controlled trial \n     may be the only way to obtain an answer that is ultimately \n     useful to people in similar circumstances. If we enroll \n     subjects in a study that exposes them to unknown risks and is \n     designed in a way that is unlikely to provide results that \n     are useful to the subjects or others in the population, we \n     have failed the test of beneficence.\n       Finally, the NIH- and DCD-supported trials have undergone a \n     rigorous process of ethical review, including not only the \n     participation of the public health and scientific communities \n     in the developing countries where the trials are being \n     performed but also the application of the U.S. rules for the \n     protection of human research subjects by relevant \n     institutional review boards in the United States and in the \n     developing countries. Support from local governments has been \n     obtained, and each active study has been and will continue to \n     be reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring \n     board.\n       To restate our main points: these studies address an urgent \n     need in the countries in which they are being conducted and \n     have been developed with extensive in-country participation. \n     The studies are being conducted according to widely accepted \n     principles and guidelines in bioethics. And our decisions to \n     support these trials rest heavily on local support and \n     approval. In a letter to the NIH dated May 8, 1997, Edward \n     K. Mbidde, chairman of the AIDS Research Committee of the \n     Uganda Cancer Institute, wrote:\n       These are Ugandan studies conducted by Ugandan \n     investigators on Ugandans. Due to lack of resources we have \n     been sponsored by organizations like yours. We are grateful \n     that you have been able to do so. . . . There is a mix up of \n     issues here which needs to be clarified. It is not NIH \n     conducting the studies in Uganda but Ugandans conducting \n     their study on their people for the good of their people.\n       The scientific and ethical issues concerning studies in \n     developing countries are complex. It is a healthy sign that \n     we are debating these issues so that we can continue to \n     advance our knowledge and our practice. However, it is \n     essential that the debate take place with a full \n     understanding of the nature of the science, the interventions \n     in question, and the local factors that impede or support \n     research and its benefits.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times Oct. 15, 1997]\n\n        AIDS Experts Leave Journal After Studies Are Criticized\n\n                        (By Lawrence K. Altman)\n\n       Two internationally recognized AIDS experts are resigning \n     from The New England Journal of Medicine's editorial board \n     over the content and handling of articles criticizing the \n     ethics of Federally financed studies of AIDS treatments in \n     third-world countries.\n       The countries seek a drug regimen less costly than those \n     used in the United States to thwart transmission of the AIDS \n     virus from mothers to infants. In trials involving more than \n     12,000 infected pregnant women in Africa, Thailand and the \n     Dominican Republic, some women receive the drug AZT, which \n     has worked in studies in the United States, while others \n     receive dummy pills.\n       The journal's attack on the studies, which compares them to \n     the infamous Tuskegee experiment, has led to wide discussion, \n     including harsh criticism of the journal itself, and focuses \n     attention on the role of the 25-member editorial aboard and \n     the two who are resigning in protest, Drs. David Ho and \n     Catherine M. Wilfert. The two objected to not being consulted \n     before publication of an attack on research that could save \n     lives, and Dr. Ho worried that the attack itself could \n     jeopardize future research on experimental AIDS vaccines.\n       Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, the journal's chief editor, said \n     the board's function is to give advice on broad issues and \n     suggestions of authors for editorials and reviews, but that \n     the board was not routinely consulted.\n       Dr. Ho, a virologist at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research \n     Center in Manhattan, and Dr. Wilfert, a pediatrician at Duke \n     University in Durham, N.C., are the journal board's chief \n     advisers on AIDS.\n       A third board member, Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of \n     medicine at the Medical\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\n     College of Virginia in Richmond, said in an interview that he \n     agreed with much of Dr. Wilfert's criticism but was \n     withholding a decision about resigning until after the issue \n     was discussed at the board's annual meeting in December.\n       Drs. Ho and Wilfert said in separate interviews that they \n     had resigned independently largely because the journal had \n     not consulted them before publishing an editorial that \n     likened the new experiments to the Tuskegee experiment, in \n     which poor black men suffering from syphilis were left \n     untreated.\n       Dr. Ho, Dr. Wilfert and others have taken issue with the \n     Tuskegee comparison in part because the subjects in the AZT \n     studies were told that some would get dummy pills. In the \n     Tuskegee study the men were not told that penicillin had \n     became available while the study was under way, and so did \n     not know that effective treatment was being withheld.\n       A full-time staff of editors produces the weekly journal, \n     but Dr. Ho said that ``the reason you have an editorial board \n     to help with policy is to get some input when you have major \n     issues like this one, and that clearly did not take place.''\n       In the editorial process, ``it was clear that my role was \n     not crucial,'' he said.\n       Dr. Ho said he was deeply concerned about how the critical \n     editorial would affect the future of studies to evaluate \n     experimental AIDS vaccines in developing countries.\n       Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning because the journal \n     published the editorial and another critical article on Sept. \n     18 without presenting the other side.\n       ``It was like ignoring half of it on purpose,'' Dr. Wilfert \n     said.\n       Because her name was on the masthead, ``It implied that I \n     agreed with it when I didn't,'' she said.\n       ``It is an error and bad policy'' and ``a grievous misuse \n     of the journal's power,'' Dr. Wilfert said.\n       ``Those are not decisions that a few people in the \n     editorial office ought to feel comfortable with, because no \n     one small group of persons, no matter who they are, can cover \n     the waterfront well enough'' in translating health policy and \n     practice in developed countries to those in developing \n     countries, Dr. Wilfert said.\n       Dr. Wilfert said she was resigning effective Dec. 31 in \n     order to ``vent my spleen'' at the annual meeting. She said \n     she feared that if she resigned sooner ``the issue might not \n     be discussed at the meeting.''\n       The journal published a rebuttal two weeks after its \n     attack. It was written by Dr. Harold Varmus, the head of the \n     National Institutes of Health, and Dr. David Satcher, the \n     head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     and would not have been printed so quickly had not Dr. \n     Varmus received a leaked copy of the original editorial \n     before publication, those involved in the dispute said.\n       Dr. Marcia, Angell, the journal's executive editor, wrote \n     the editorial.\n       Dr. Wenzel, the board member from Richmond, said that if \n     the authors of the critical articles ``really knew the facts \n     they would have done a better job.''\n       The journal's chief editor, Dr. Kassirer, said he regretted \n     Dr. Ho's said Dr. Wilfert's decisions to resign and was \n     unaware of any similar resignations at the journal, which was \n     founded in 1812.\n       The editorial board members, who have no set term, Dr. \n     Kassirer said, are named by the chief editor, who can elect \n     not to renew them as members and has done so.\n       Dr. Kassirer said that Dr. Wilfert ``wanted to have prior \n     consultation of the material in the journal, which is just \n     not acceptable to me because prior consultation is not what \n     the editorial board is for.''\n       He said the journal intentionally did not strive to present \n     all sides of an issue ``because if you did you would end up \n     with a kind of Talmudic discussion in ``which readers could \n     end up having no particular view one way or the other and it \n     would be rather boring.''\n       Dr. Varmus, the National Institutes of Health director, \n     said that ``The New England Journal of Medicine is trying to \n     attract more attention by making political ethical \n     philosophical and economic statements that have traditionally \n     not been in that journal in such an inflammatory way.''\n       But he also said that ``before you inflame the public and \n     attract so much attention, you might want to ask experts on \n     the editorial board what they thing.''\n       The Massachusetts Medical Society owns The New England \n     Journal of Medicine. Dr. Ronald A. Arky, a Harvard Medical \n     School professor who heads the society's publications \n     committee to which Dr. Kassirer reports, said he learned of \n     the resignations last Friday.\n       ``The committee will want to hear from the editor about the \n     resignations'' at their next meeting in early November, Dr. \n     Arky said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From Time Magazine, Sept. 30, 1997]\n\n It's AIDS, Not Tuskegee--Inflammatory Comparisons Won't Save Lives in \n                                 Africa\n\n                         (By David D. Ho, M.D.)\n\n       In the current issue of the New England Journal of \n     Medicine, Peter Lurie and Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the advocacy \n     group Public Citizen charge that some U.S.-sponsored AIDS-\n     research projects in Africa are unethical. The journal's \n     editor, Dr. Marcia Angell, goes even further, comparing these \n     studies to the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which black \n     men in the South were deliberately deceived and denied \n     effective treatment in order to determine the natural course \n     of syphilis infection. This comparison is inflammatory and \n     unfair and could make a desperate situation even worse.\n       Doctors in the U.S. have known since 1994 that the drug AZT \n     can substantially reduce the chance of transmission of the \n     AIDS virus from an infected woman to her newborn child. \n     Unfortunately, administering AZT to pregnant women is \n     complicated and quite expensive--about $1,000 per mother. \n     That's far beyond the means of most developing countries, \n     where 1,000 newborns are infected each day.\n       Hoping to find an AZT regimen they could afford, African \n     researchers sought sponsorship from U.S. health agencies and \n     launched a number of scientific studies in which some mothers \n     were given short treatments with AZT and some, for the \n     purpose of comparison, received a placebo. It is the \n     inclusion of these placebo groups that the critics find \n     objectionable. Giving a sugar pill to an AIDS patient is \n     considered ethically unacceptable in the U.S. To give one to \n     a pregnant African, Dr. Angell writes, shows a ``callous \n     disregard of [a patient's] welfare for the sake of research \n     goals.''\n       These clinical trials, however, were created for Africans, \n     by Africans, with the good of their people in mind and with \n     their informed consent. The studies were designed to be \n     responsive to local needs and to the constraints of each \n     study site. African scientists have argued that it is not in \n     their best interest to include a complicated and costly AZT \n     regimen for the sake of comparison when such a regimen is not \n     only unaffordable but logistically infeasible. They have, \n     instead, opted for a study design that is achievable in \n     practice and is likely to provide lifesaving answers \n     expeditiously, even though it includes a group of women \n     receiving a placebo. While the inclusion of this placebo \n     group would not be acceptable in the U.S., the sad truth is \n     that giving nothing is the current standard of care in \n     Africa.\n       The ethical debate here is obviously a complex one, without \n     a clear distinction between right and wrong. Comparisons to \n     Tuskegee don't help; neither does the imposition of Western \n     views, or what Dr. Edward Mbidde of Uganda calls ``ethical \n     imperialism.'' Calm and careful deliberations are in order. \n     Insisting on the infeasible in the name of ethical purity is \n     counterproductive in the struggle to stop this deadly virus.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone. I had \nsome other remarks, but I will either make them later in the afternoon \nor include them in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I say to \nSenators who are out here for the debate, I shall not take long.\n  I rise to support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be the next \nSurgeon General of the United States and Assistant Secretary of Health. \nDr. Satcher is a man above reproach, whose life path has brought him \nhere today to serve as the 17th Surgeon General. We should not delay in \nconfirming this nomination.\n  What is it that makes Dr. Satcher such a wise appointment for Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States? Look back over this man's life, for the \nfabric of a person is woven over the course of a lifetime. Dr. \nSatcher's fabric is tight knit, vibrant, trustworthy and strong.\n  Where does he come from? Is it from his childhood, growing up in \nrural America in a poor family with poor access to medical care, nearly \ndying at the age of 2 from whooping cough? Is that what makes him such \nan outstanding spokesperson for childhood immunization, for childhood \nnutrition, for preventive health? Is that what makes him such a \npowerful role model for children to follow their dreams?\n  Or is it from the tragic loss of his first wife, the mother of his \nchildren, at a very young age from cancer? This man knows the tragedy \nof disease, not just on an academic level, not just on a professional \nlevel, but also on a very personal level.\n  Or is it from his professional, academic and public service careers \nthat truly do make him very special? This is a man who has used his \nconsiderable skills to serve those people in our country who were quite \noften the poorest of poor and, in particular, I have in mind poor \nchildren all across our Nation.\n  After graduating from Case Western Reserve Medical School, his life \nhas been spent caring for patients, teaching students and promoting \npublic health, and he has done it well. His most recent position has \nbeen as Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  In his 4 years as Director for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, Dr. Satcher had--a little bit of\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nevidence--spearheaded initiatives that have increased childhood \nimmunization rates from 55 percent in 1992 to 78 percent in 1996; \nimproved the Nation's capability to respond to emerging infectious \ndiseases; laid the groundwork for a new early warning system to detect \nand prevent foodborne infections; expanded the CDC's comprehensive \nbreast and cervical cancer screening program from 18 States to all 50 \nStates; and under Dr. Satcher's stewardship, the CDC has directed its \nattention to the causes and consequences and prevention of an epidemic \nwhich has long been a concern of my wife Sheila and of concern to me, \nand that is the epidemic of domestic violence against women in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I frequently come to the floor to talk about fairness, \nwhat is the right thing to do, what is the fair thing to do. And today \nI want to talk about fairness; yes, to Dr. Satcher, but even more so to \nfairness to the people in our country who are waiting for leadership \nfrom this Surgeon General; fairness to the families and children of \ninner cities I have visited all across America who are waiting for a \nspokesperson to tell them how to improve some of the unsafe conditions \nthat they live under, how to improve their health care for themselves \nas parents and for their children; fairness to the residents of rural \nAmerica who are medically underserved and are waiting for new ideas to \nmake health care accessible; fairness to the youth of America who have \nbeen waiting for a clear and credible voice to lead them away from \ntobacco addiction before they light their first cigarette; and fairness \nto the victims of domestic violence and cancer and drug and alcohol \nabuse who are waiting for Dr. Satcher to speak from his bully pulpit \nabout preventing these terrible tragedies.\n  Mr. President, it is not fair for us to delay any longer Dr. David \nSatcher's nomination. We have the responsibility to vote. We have the \nwisdom, or should have the wisdom, to vote for this man who can do so \nmuch for our country. Elementary justice demands that the United States \nSenate vote for confirmation of Dr. David Satcher as Surgeon General \nand Assistant Secretary of Health. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, that was an excellent statement by my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Dr. David Satcher \nfor confirmation both as the Surgeon General of the United States and \nAssistant Secretary for Health. In so doing, I want to speak both to \nthe position of Surgeon General itself and to the qualifications of \nthis nominee.\n  From 1871 until the present, 16 individuals have had the honor to \nserve as this nation's chief advisor on public health matters. These \nindividuals served to protect, improve, and advance the health of all \npeople in the United States. While there are those that criticize and \nmay disagree with the position, in many ways the Surgeon General serves \nas the health conscience for the country.\n  Many Americans may not know the history of this position and can name \nfew of the 16 individuals who have served as Surgeon General. However, \nmost Americans can point to ground breaking reports or initiatives that \nwere conducted by Surgeon Generals. For instance, they are aware of the \nrole of the Surgeon General in programs to immunize millions against \npolio. Most can cite the important declaration in 1964, by the Surgeon \nGeneral that: ``smoking can be hazardous to your health.'' Indeed, past \nSurgeon Generals have issued benchmark reports on smoking, nutrition, \nwater fluoridation, and HIV and AIDS.\n  The public deserves to have this position filled; it has been vacant \nfor too long. We have been without a Surgeon General since December of \n1994. We need an identifiable, objective leader as we deal with the \nbroad spectrum of health care issues before the country. Dr. David \nSatcher is that leader.\n  Dr. Satcher is a distinguished family physician, academician, and \nleader in the arena of public health. Indeed, he has headed the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention since 1993. He has written that he \nwill utilize the position of the Surgeon General to focus on issues \nthat unite Americans. I am particularly interested in his commitment \nto, and expertise on, the issues of health promotion and disease \nprevention. During his confirmation hearing before the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources, he emphasized his desire to promote healthy \nlifestyles and focus on issues of critical importance such as better \nnutrition and exercise. Dr. Satcher recognized the opportunities for \nlifestyle modification as a way of improving the health of Americans. \nHis performance in this arena in the past and his stated agenda for the \nfuture, place prevention as a focal point.\n  Mr. President, the accomplishments of Dr. Satcher at the CDC have had \na direct impact in my home state of New Mexico. For New Mexico, border \nhealth issues are of utmost importance. Dr. Satcher has helped develop \nan innovative strategy to combat threats from new and reemerging \ncommunicable diseases like tuberculosis which cause problems in our \nborder region. Greater outreach to the general public and health \nprofessionals has resulted in four straight years for declining TB \nrates.\n  Additionally, he has worked to improve the quality and quantity of \nimmunization services. He has promoted better community involvement in \nthe immunization programs. Nationwide, childhood immunization rates \nrose to a record 78 percent under his leadership at the CDC.\n  Another initiative, the CDC comprehensive breast and cervical cancer \nscreening program, has flourished under Dr. Satcher's leadership. This \nprogram has undeserved and minority women has grown from being offered \nin the initial eighteen states, to including 50 states, the District of \nColumbia, 5 U.S. territories, and thirteen Native American \norganizations. Outreach efforts such as this lead to increased access \nand are key to reaching low income minority and older women. They \nafford the opportunity as well to educate at risk women on early \ndetection of cancers.\n  In closing, Dr. David Satcher is eminently qualified to speak out for \nthe public's health and the nation's health needs. The nation deserves \nto have this position filled now. His commitment to public health will \nbe a credit to this country. Please join me in supporting Dr. David \nSatcher for Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  There have been a number of charges made and some pretty strong \nlanguage suggested, as well as a lot of repetition and volume regarding \nsome of the circumstances surrounding the conduct of Dr. Satcher in his \nrole as an individual involved both in domestic health situations and \ninternational health situations.\n  Let me begin by going through a number of these issues and referring \nto what notable authorities and investigators have indicated.\n  When I raised the issue of the CDC, under the direction and in \ncooperation with Dr. Satcher, being involved with blind HIV testing for \nnewborns--and while learning about the level of HIV present in the \nnewborns not providing information to parents and sending newborns home \nwithout that kind of information--there was a pretty vociferous \nresponse, indicating that there were things in the studies that were \nworth learning. I don't challenge that. There are things that are worth \nlearning that can be learned from medical research. As a matter of \nfact, it is sometimes easier to learn a lot of things more quickly if \nyou don't really pay much attention to the ethics that are involved. \nYou can learn the most, probably, with research that might be damaging \nto individuals.\n  So the mere fact that there are items to be learned and that there is \nvalue in terms of statistical data that can be assembled from the \nstudy, doesn't justify the existence of a study. As a matter of fact, \nwhen you are running rats\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\nin a study, you can learn a lot of things very quickly. The reason we \nuse animals in a lot of studies is because we accord to human beings a \nkind of standing that says the learning objective is not the end of all \nthat we do: we also have to respect the dignity of the individuals \ninvolved.\n  So I just wanted to mention a couple of the kinds of things that were \nsaid around the country and by authorities regarding these so-called \nblind HIV tests.\n  Here is what was said in the New York Daily News on the 27th of June \nin 1995. They put it this way:\n\n       Only politics, radical politics, explains the separate \n     standard for AIDS.\n\n  Meaning there is a separate approach:\n\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention carried this \n     illogic to an absurd end by requiring testing of newborns, \n     then keeping the results secret. That let officials track the \n     epidemic but denied treatment. Fearful of the push to use the \n     results for actual care, the CDC turned churlish and quit \n     testing.\n\n  It is kind of interesting to me that the New York Daily News, which \ndoesn't have an ax to grind here, indicates that there was a set of \ncircumstances that resulted in the CDC pursuing a logic to an absurd \nend, including testing newborns and keeping the results secret. And \nthen when it was suggested that the CDC provide information to parents, \ninstead of approaching the problem this way, the CDC just decided to \nquit the program altogether rather than provide information to parents.\n  My view is that our objective in health, in confirming one who would \nbe a health voice for all the people, should not be that one promotes \ncontroversial health measures by just keeping people from knowing about \nthe situation. We should be informative and have a culture of \ninformation for people. If people have trouble accepting the \ninformation, we should work with them to help them get into a position \nwhere they digest the information appropriately and take steps to \ncurtail the risks.\n  The Washington Post made a pretty clear statement about this at the \nsame time. I think it is important for us to understand that the \nWashington Post isn't some sort of organization that would be unfair in \nits assessment of this kind of situation:\n\n       For the last 10 years, the Federal Government's Centers for \n     Disease Control has urged doctors and hospitals to advise \n     pregnant women at risk for AIDS to be tested for the disease. \n     Now the CDC has recommended extending this effort to all \n     pregnant women.\n\n  The Washington Post goes on to say:\n\n       This expansion is due primarily to completion of a study \n     showing that administering the drug AZT to an infected mother \n     during pregnancy and delivery and to her baby for a period \n     after birth reduces incidence of transmission of the disease \n     from 25 to 8 percent. If only those pregnant women known to \n     be at risk are tested, others with the affliction will \n     inevitably be missed and their babies won't receive the drug \n     therapy that has proven to be so effective. Congress is now \n     considering legislation that will make the AIDS testing of \n     newborns mandatory. The congressional effort to include AIDS \n     in this category deserves support.\n\n  I think that's important:\n\n       A positive test of a child is a sure indication that the \n     mother has the disease. With this information, breastfeeding, \n     which transmits this disease, could be avoided.\n\n  I think it is very important to note that if you had provided \ninformation about the existence of the HIV virus to the parent, then \nthey would know to avoid breastfeeding in certain situations. And \nbecause some of the babies, as Senator Kennedy has noted, first test \npositive for HIV and then later remit that indicator spontaneously, \nthose babies shouldn't be breast fed by mothers with risk of additional \ncontamination.\n  The article makes another interesting point:\n\n       And finally it is particularly important that the status of \n     children who are placed in foster care be known. The CDC \n     enumerates all these reasons supporting voluntary testing for \n     all pregnant women. In fact, they are of sufficient weight to \n     require the routine testing of all newborns for AIDS.\n\n  The point is this, that testing newborns for AIDS should be attended \nby being able to take advantage of the appropriate therapies and the \nappropriate remedial action.\n  Arthur J. Ammann, who is the professor of pediatrics at the \nUniversity of California Medical Center in San Francisco and who was \nthe man who discovered both pediatric AIDS and blood transfusion AIDS, \nreally was distressed about a program of this kind testing blood \nsamples from unidentified children and collecting the epidemiological \ndata but not telling parents whether or not kids have AIDS.\n  Dr. Ammann is a noted authority who, incidentally, was invited by the \nLabor committee to give a briefing just this week. And he put it this \nway. He indicated that the policies were a violation of the \ninternational Nuremberg code. ``The failure to inform the guardians of \nknown HIV-infected infants, when treatment is available, violates both \ninternational and national codes of ethics.'' The quote comes from an \nAugust 3, 1995, Wall Street Journal article.\n  I think it is important for us to note that there are very serious \nquestions about the kind of testing and the information resulting from \nthe tests and the ethics involved therein. And there may be ways in \nhindsight to come back and say, ``Well, there was value to what was \nlearned and, therefore, it was appropriate for us to do what was \ndone.'' But I do not think this adequately answers the questions. It \ndoes not really adequately address the question why, when we could have \nmoved toward identification and notification, we simply acceded to the \npolitics of the situation.\n  The New York Daily News said that only radical politics explains the \nseparate standard here, in referencing the fact that there are so many \nother diseases which, if you had that kind of information, would have \nbeen made available immediately.\n  Another item which I raised earlier about Dr. Satcher was the idea of \nneedle exchanges. The U.S. Congress has expressed itself on needle \nexchanges. And the American people are, I think, loathe to be \nparticipants in a program which would promote needle exchanges.\n  A Member of this body came to the floor to say that Dr. Satcher had \nnever supported the expenditure of any resources to provide clean \nneedles at Government expense. I think that is technically true. Dr. \nSatcher and the CDC have, I think, not had a program. They have had \nstudies in which clean needles were provided, and those have been \nfunded.\n  The Berkeley study in California was a study funded by the CDC which \nprovided so-called ``clean needles'' to drug addicts. As a matter of \nfact, the group known as the Harm Reduction Group, which means trying \nto reduce the harm of IV drug use through needle exchanges, put on a \nconference called the Atlanta Harm Reduction Working Group Conference. \nIt was a 2-day meeting designed to advance harm reduction in the \nSoutheastern United States by providing government-sponsored or other \nprivately sponsored needle exchange programs.\n  The CDC was a sponsor or provided funding for this. So it is \ntechnically true, almost in a sort of lawyerspeak sense, that the CDC \ndid not engage in a program of needle exchange. It has just had studies \nwhere the needle exchanges are used. And they have not exactly advanced \nthe policy in some respect of needle exchanges, they have just \nundertaken to do it by sponsoring conferences for private groups, whose \nprime objective is to sponsor these so-called clean needle programs.\n  We will have more to say about clean needle programs in the future \nbecause one of the things that is very difficult about clean needle \nprograms is that they frequently provide clean needles to so-called \ndrug addicts, and then the needles are not appropriately disposed of. \nAnd in a variety of settings those needles then are available in the \nculture because they are left laying around. It is dangerous to have \nthose needles available.\n  Let me move to the ethics of some of the studies that have been \nconducted. It is important to know that challenges have been made to \nthe suggestion that the studies in Africa involved breaches of ethics. \nThe study in Africa is said to involve a serious breach of ethics, as \nstated by the New England Journal of Medicine, a very important medical \njournal.\n  The point was raised by supporters of the studies that two members of \nthe board of directors resigned from the New England Journal of \nMedicine when the criticism of the studies was made.\n  Let us look at what that means. According to one article, there are \n25\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\nmembers of the board of directors. There were two who agreed \nsufficiently with the nature of the studies to resign and 23 who \nthought that their resignations were inappropriate and apparently did \nnot think they should resign.\n\n  If we are to infer that the two who did resign supported the ethics \nof the way the study was conducted, we might infer that the 23 that did \nnot resign opposed the ethics of the study.\n  It is pretty clear that in our culture there are separate standards, \nin a lot of ways, for AIDS as a disease and for the HIV virus as a \ndisease.\n  I think some of that took place as a result of the early acquaintance \nof the culture with the HIV virus. Then people who had the disease \ncould not get treatment and individuals would not get close to them, \nand there were elevated desires to have privacy. So HIV was treated in \na different way than other viruses or deadly viruses would be treated.\n  But the only individuals who resigned were individuals who were \naccustomed to the special ethical standing, if it is appropriate to say \nthat, or the special rules for HIV. They were AIDS individuals. The \npeople in the conventional medical community did not resign.\n  Dr. Jerome Kassirer, the editor in chief of the New England Journal \nof Medicine--which is published by the Massachusetts Medical Society--\nwas asked about his response. He said he was surprised and dismayed at \nthe resignations, but he said it was never policy to have editorial \nboard members review editorials or other opinions before they were \npublished.\n  And these individuals who were interested in, I suppose, having the \nopportunity to screen what would be said about these kinds of studies \nsimply had not been accorded that opportunity because the medical \njournal itself did not want to accord any special status or \ndifferential treatment here.\n  A lot has been said about the ethics of the studies. Others indicated \nthat maybe we should not have followed the ethical requirements because \nnot much money is spent on individuals in Africa for health care on an \nannual basis.\n  I think there was a statement made about $5.50 being spent per year \nin some of the countries. It varies in different countries in Africa. I \nbelieve the study that is most sharply in focus would have occurred in \nthe Ivory Coast. The key is, some experts said we could not have used \nas a part of the study the 076 AZT regime which has been proven to be \neffective in reducing the number of HIV and AIDS cases among newborn \nchildren of HIV infected mothers.\n  They said we could not use 076 because that treatment is a \nsubstantial regime and has substantial costs. They were trying to find \na way for a lower-cost regime. And they were going to compare low doses \nof AZT to a placebo to find out whether low doses could be effective. \nHowever, that can be accomplished by comparing low doses to the \nstandard, proven regime.\n  As a matter of fact, the latter comparison is what ethics requires. \nAccording to the New England Journal of Medicine, published by the \nMassachusetts Medical Society, ``Only when there is no known effective \ntreatment is it ethical to compare a potential new treatment with a \nplacebo.'' Again, the use of a placebo is ethical ``Only when there is \nno known effective treatment.''\n  We have had effective treatments substantiated and approved in the \nUnited States and internationally with the 076 AZT regime. Now, it \nwould be possible to compare a lower level of AZT with this effective \nknown treatment to find out whether the low levels were as efficacious \nas the 076 regime. But we chose instead--and I use the word advisedly, \nsaying we ``chose'' instead--to use the unknown, low dosage with a \nplacebo, with a sugar pill, which has a known consequence.\n  We are not comparing two unknowns here. We are comparing a known \nconsequence of no treatment, that is the placebo, with the unknown \nconsequence of a treatment. But this is not the proven treatment. And \nthe real approach we have to understand here is that the ethics of \nmodern medicine in America, in a country that cares about individual \npatients as well as about scientific data can be generated, would not \nallow such research. Even though one can generate a lot of data in \nstudies that are very dangerous to the people, our standards of ethics \nwould not allow it. When there is a known treatment, we compare new \ntreatments to the known treatment rather than comparing new potential \ntreatments to something that we know will have no beneficial effect.\n\n  And here is the way the editorial in the New England Journal of \nMedicine went forward. It said:\n\n       Those requirements are made clear in the Declaration of \n     Helsinki, of the World Health Organization, WHO, which is \n     widely regarded as providing the fundamental guidelines of \n     research involving human subjects. It states in research \n     ``The interests of science and society should never take \n     precedence over considerations relating to the well-being of \n     the subject.'' And in any medical study every patient, \n     including those of a control group, if any, should be assured \n     of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.\n\n  Now, there was a proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. It was the \n076 regiment which has been proven in the United States and \ninternationally. Instead of comparing low dosages of AZT to the best \nproven therapy and diagnosis, they chose to compare low doses of AZT to \na known placebo. And to say to individuals, ``Well, those of you that \nget the placebo are destined to have no therapy''--and we know what \nthat means when it comes to the HIV virus.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine noted, ``Further, the Declaration \nof Helsinki requires control groups to receive the best treatment, not \nthe local one.'' Individuals have raised in the study the idea that \n``Well, people wouldn't be getting good treatment over here anyhow, so \nwe are eligible to disregard the treatment standards for them.'' They \nobserve that these are poor people. These are African individuals. We \ncan adopt a different standard there. We certainly could not do this in \nthe United States, but we can do this over there because things are not \nwhat they ought to be over there.\n  And here is what the New England Journal says: ``Acceptance of this \nethical relativism''--this is important--``Acceptance of this ethical \nrelativism could result in widespread exploitation of vulnerable Third \nWorld populations for research programs that could not be carried out \nin the sponsoring country.''\n  Now, additionally, it has been suggested that the reason researchers \ncould not use the 076 regime, which is an expensive regime as in \ncomparison to the low dose of AZT, is that there is not enough money in \nthese African countries ever to give people the high-dose program. \nTherefore, we cannot experiment with any high-dose programs and find \nout, using them, whether or not the low-dose program would also work.\n  The truth of the matter is, you can learn a great deal by comparing \nthe low-dose program to the high-dose program. I submit that you have \nthe opportunity to learn about as much, if not more, than you have by \ncomparing the low-dose program to the placebo. But more importantly is \nthat this is consistent with the ethical standards.\n  It was suggested that the reason you could use the no-treatment \nprogram as part of the study--the placebo--is because there was a low, \nlow amount of money to be spent per capita on health care in these \ncountries. And it said you could not use an $800 program in the test \nbecause the people could not afford it. They only spend $5 a year on \nmedicine. Why is it, then, that you could use the low-dose program, \nwhich is a $50 program? If one can't afford but $5, one is ineligible \nfor $50 just like he would be for an $800 regime. I do understand that \nwe are not talking about a regime for trying to give everybody the $800 \nprogram. Theirs was an effort to try and prove that a $50 program might \nwork. So all they needed to do was to be able to compare the $50 \nprogram to subjects who were getting the full program. If the less \nexpensive program it worked just as well, they would at least have the \ncost down to the $50 level.\n\n  But the point being made by the proponents of the research as it was \nconducted was that it is ethical, because of the costs involved. My own \nview is that if you only have $5, you can't really buy a $50 treatment \nany more than an $800 treatment. To say $50 is close enough and $800 \nisn't misses the point. If you are trying to develop the availability \nof the $50 treatment, the tests themselves could be measured against a \ntherapy which is more costly.\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\n  The last point I make is that if none of the treatments would be used \nin the countries where the tests are being made, it is unethical to \nconduct tests there. It's clear from international standards, whether \none is talking about the Nuremberg Code or other standards, you only \nconduct tests in countries where there is a chance that the therapy \nwould be used. If the testimony of those who argue against the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine and these individuals is that you might \nhave used the low dose, that is fine, we can conduct them there. \nHowever, you don't make laboratory rats out of people in the conduct of \nthose tests merely because there is not a sufficient level of medical \nresources there to justify the more expensive program being used in the \nUnited States.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine directly indicates that ``The \ntest directly contradicted Department of Health and Human Services' own \nregulations governing U.S.-sponsored research in foreign countries, as \nwell as joint guidelines for research in the Third World issued by the \nWHO and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Science, \nwhich require that human subjects receive protection at least \nequivalent to that in the sponsoring country.''\n  Now, here you have another standard. It is not that this fell short \nof the ethics of one part or another part, or one little fraction, or \nanother little fraction. In the first instance, you never use a placebo \nwhen an effective treatment is known. Secondly, control groups are \nrequired to receive the best current treatment, not the local one. \nThirdly, you don't do, in a Third World country, what you could not do \nin your own country.\n  Now, it is pretty clear that there are a number of settings in which \nthat idea of using other countries might be productive. But one might \nhave trouble getting agreement to this, especially in the light of some \nof the controversy that has existed in the United States. Dr. Satcher \ntestified at one time, ``What may not be readily apparent to all is how \nthe CDC and the U.S. learned and benefited from international public \nhealth activities, including those related to HIV protection. It is \nclear that, in some instances, research relevant to both developing \ncountries and the U.S. can be conducted more efficiently and \nexpeditiously in developing countries because of the magnitude of the \nproblem in those settings and, therefore, we have utilized that \napproach.'' Yes, it's more efficient and expeditious, if it is only \nbecause there is a bigger population. I think that justifies the \npotential if we follow the ethical guidelines. But if we say that we \ncan do it more efficiently and effectively there because we don't have \nto provide real medicine, we say to the people of those countries that \nwe don't care as much about your lives as we care about lives in our \nown country. If we say these things, we have then also embarked on a \ncourse of action that has very serious ethical complications.\n  I would like to quote from Dr. Arthur Kaplan, the Director of the \nCenter for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania:\n\n       If you tried to do this study in the U.S., you would have \n     to do it through a throng of demonstrators and a sea of \n     reporters,'' he states. ``I would not do this study without a \n     design that would let me run it without a placebo. I think \n     you owe that to your subjects, even if they are not educated \n     enough or savvy enough to demand it from you.\n  Now, that is strong language. I have no doubt that Dr. Satcher is an \nindividual of tremendous achievement and great scientific capacity. I \nhave not sought to question that, and I certainly don't want to \nquestion his achievement, his capacity, his intellect, or the fact that \nhe does represent the American dream. But I will question the ethics of \nthe studies in which individuals were given placebos when it's clear \nthat placebos are only ethical in comparisons when there is no known \neffective treatment. I will question the ethics of the studies when we \nowe treatment to our subjects and we fail to give it to them because \nthey are in a culture where it's not normally expected. I think Dr. \nArthur Kaplan is right. I wouldn't do this study without a design that \nwould let me run it without a placebo. I think you owe that to the \nsubjects. ``Subjects'' is a kind of interesting term there; it is \nreally talking about the people who are in the medical study. ``. . \n.Even if they are not educated enough, savvy enough to demand it from \nyou.''\n  Here is another article titled ``An Apology is Not Enough.'' This was \nprinted in the Boston Globe on the 18th day of May, 1997:\n\n       No research in developing countries is ethically justified, \n     unless the treatment developed or proven effective will \n     actually be made available to the population.\n\n  We have had testimony here that the treatments could not be \navailable, they would be too expensive. The low dosage treatment \nresearchers were seeking to develop was estimated to cost $50. It might \nbe possible to create a less costly regimen. But the components of the \nstudy should be performed ethically, regardless of what the ultimate \nobjective is. Even though the objective was a $50 treatment, that \ndoesn't mean that there could be no components greater than $50 in the \nstudy. Because ethics requires it you should be measuring the $50 \ntreatment that is being experimented with and comparing it to the best \nknown treatment. You don't compare it to a placebo.\n  A lot of comment has been made about informed consent. I would just \nlike to take a few minutes to talk about informed consent, because I \nthink it is important for us to try dealing with this problem in the \ncold light of what the international ethical requirements are. All \nguidelines stress the importance of obtaining informed consent from \nindividuals asked to participate in the studies. Informed consent isn't \njust signing a paper. I would indicate in a setting where you are \ngiving individuals sugar pills and it is known that the individuals who \nget sugar pills are going to have no treatment, that the level of \ninformation in the consent should be more than a ``sign here,'' or a \nrush to consent. It should be an informed, considered, deliberate \nconsent.\n  Let's see what the international standards are on informed consent. \nThe Declaration of Helsinki, which the New England Journal of Medicine \ncited, makes informed consent a sort of touchstone of ethics \nrequirements. The Declaration says:\n\n       In any research on human beings, the potential subject must \n     be adequately informed of the aims, the methods, anticipated \n     benefits, and potential hazards of the study and the \n     discomfort it may entail.\n       Guideline 10: When obtaining informed consent for the \n     research project, the physician should be particularly \n     cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him \n     or her or may consent under duress.\n\n  Certainly, in the African studies where these individuals are in a \nsituation where the health care availability is not substantial, these \npeople are in a dependent relationship to the physicians. In that case, \nthe informed consent should be obtained by a physician who is not \nengaged in the investigation or is completely independent of this \nofficial relationship.\n\n  Another guideline is from the Council of International Organizations \nof Medical Sciences--international ethical guidelines for biomedical \nresearch involving human subjects. We are not talking about running \nrats through a maze, or animal trials, taking the heart out of a pig \nand seeing if it will work in a variety of circumstances, but rather \nthe international ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving \nhuman subjects. The Council of International Organizations of Medical \nSciences, CIOMS, in collaboration with the World Health Organization \nmake these statements regarding informed consent.\n\n       Guideline 1: For all biomedical research involving human \n     subjects, the investigator must obtain the informed consent \n     of the prospective subject.\n       Guideline 2: Before requesting an individual's consent to \n     participate in research, the investigator must provide the \n     individual with the following information, in language that \n     he or she is capable of understanding: Each individual is \n     invited to participate as a subject in research and the aims \n     and methods of the research.\n\n  So they have to be told that they are invited to participate as a \nsubject and what the aims and methods are.\n\n       The benefits reasonably to be expected to result to the \n     subject, or to others, as outcome of the research, and any \n     foreseeable risks for discomfort to the subject associated \n     with participation in the research; any alternative \n     procedures or courses of treatment that might be as \n     advantageous to the subject as the procedure or treatment \n     being tested.\n       Guideline 3: Obligations of investigators regarding \n     informed consent. The investigator has a duty to communicate \n     to the prospective subject all the information necessary for \n     adequately informed consent.\n\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\n\n  All the information necessary. This is a technical area. All the \ninformation in a technical area like this might include being informed \nthat there is a known therapy and that it is unethical to conduct a \ntrial without providing the known therapy, according to the Helsinki \nDeclaration and a variety of other ethics guidelines.\n\n       Guideline 4: Subjects may be paid for inconvenience and \n     time spent and should be reimbursed for expenses incurred in \n     connection with their participation in the study, and may \n     also receive free medical services. However, the payment \n     should not be so large on the medical services, so extensive \n     as to induce prospective subjects to consent to participate \n     in the research against their better judgment.\n\n  The idea here is, if you are going to offer a bunch of medical care \nfree to a person, they might make a judgment about getting involved in \nyour program and might look aside and not be aware of, or be sensitive \nto, the risks that would otherwise inure to them as an individual \nparticipant.\n  There is a specific science guideline, No. 8, for research involving \nsubjects in underdeveloped countries.\n\n       Before undertaking research involving subjects in \n     underdeveloping communities, whether in developed or \n     developing countries, the investigator must be sure that \n     every effort is made to ensure that the ethical imperative of \n     consent of the individual subjects be followed.\n\n  The first guideline of the Nuremberg code relates to informed \nconsent.\n  Here we are with another code. We have been through the Helsinki, \nthrough the CIOMS, which was the Council of International Organization \nof Medical Sciences, and now we go to the Nuremberg code.\n\n       The voluntary consent of human subjects is absolutely \n     essential.\n\n  This means that the person involved should have the legal capacity to \ngive consent.\n\n       . . . should be so situated as to be able to exercise free \n     power of choice without the intervention of any element of \n     fraud, force, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior \n     force, constraint, or coercion, and should have knowledge and \n     comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved \n     to enable him to make understanding and enlightened \n     decisions.\n\n  I could go further.\n  The truth of the matter is that Dr. Satcher claims that there was \ninformed consent here. And there has been a lot of statements on the \nfloor about the nature of informed consent. The facts of the matter, as \nI have come to understand them--it could be that I need to be \ncorrected--is that the informed consent has not been as thorough as \nthose who have joined in this debate would want to lead people to \nbelieve.\n  Dr. Satcher, in an article that he wrote with Dr. Varmus states that \nthere was informed consent in their studies.\n\n       In the case of the NIH and CDC trial, there has been the \n     same requirements for informed consent that would exist if \n     the work were performed in the United States.\n\n  Well, was there informed consent?\n  It is kind of interesting. The New York Times sent a reporter to the \narea, and decided that there wasn't the level of informed consent that \nshould exist in these cases. The New York Times article says:\n\n       According to the CDC, before deciding about entering the \n     studies, women who were potential study participants were \n     provided information about HIV and AIDS and about the \n     intended study, and the possible risks and benefits for their \n     children. It was clearly intended that women involved, their \n     children, and others receive a placebo, a capsule without \n     active medication. There would be no way for them to tell \n     which group they were in. Women must give informed consent \n     before participation commences.\n\n  That is what the CDC says. That is in a CDC study, to prevent HIV \ntransmission in developing countries, and their report of April 30, \n1997.\n  So the CDC, in the case of everybody being given all of the \ninformation, and that there is an informed consent.\n  Here is what happened when the New York Times sent a reporter, and \nthe New York Times article brings into question whether many of these \nwomen truly gave ``informed consent.''\n  I indicate to you that I have blotted out the names of the actual \nindividuals involved here respecting their privacy. Here is an excerpt \nof the article, along with the accompanying photograph of one of the \nwomen who participated in the study. According to the article--we will \ncall this woman ``AB,''--a 23-year-old, illiterate, HIV-infected mother \nand patient in the study ``still does not grasp, even after repeated \nquestioning, exactly what a placebo is, or why she might have been \ngiven that instead of real medicine.''\n  They gave me a bunch of pills to take and told me how to take them. \nSome were for malaria, some were for fever, and some were supposed to \nbe for the virus. I knew there were different kinds. But I figured if \none didn't work against AIDS then one of other ones would.\n\n  This is a picture of AB.\n  The reason to enroll in the study last year was clear. It offered her \nand her infant free health care and a hope to shield her baby from \ndeadly infection. Unmarried and unemployed, this new mother, like many \nothers, said the prospect of health as she brought her baby into the \nworld made taking part in the experiment all but irresistible. Still \nthe question of whether she and other pregnant women knew of the \nimplications of consenting to a placebo test hangs over the subject.\n  Let me give you what the New York Times said about this individual's \ncircumstance, AB. This is CD? I have the initials on the individuals--\n\n       Minutes after she was informed for the first time that she \n     carried the virus, one pregnant woman--\n\n  This is her picture, CD.\n\n     still visibly shaken by the news, was quickly walked through \n     the details of the test, as well as general advice about \n     maintaining her health and protecting others from acquiring \n     the disease, in less than 5 minutes.\n\n  This is the eyewitness testimony of how this so-called ``informed \nconsent'' was obtained ``in less than 5 minutes in which the previously \nunknown concept of a placebo was briefly mentioned.''\n\n       The session was over and DC.--\n\n  Unemployed, and illiterate--\n\n     had agreed to take part in the test. One of the most highly \n     educated of the women who spoke to a reporter, a 31-year old \n     single mother with a degree in law who gave her name only as \n     X, said she had never been made to understand that the \n     medicine being tested, ATZ, was already known to stop the \n     transmission of the virus DURING pregnancy.\n\n  So what we have here is a feint toward ``informed consent.'' We have \npeople with formal training with a law degree not knowing about \neffective therapies, not knowing what the real options are, not knowing \nwhat the real facts are, and we have a situation where we are using a \nplacebo knowing that the utilization of placebo in that setting is \ngoing to result in the absence of any treatment for a disease which is, \nunderstandably and acknowledged, to be fatal in virtually every \nsituation.\n  I think this New York Times article suggests to us that some of the \nso-called highly touted ``informed consent'' wasn't as informed as it \nshould have been, and by just reading what the international \nconventions and the international declarations require you know that it \nis virtually impossible for a person even of great and substantial \nmedical awareness to understand about ``informed consent'' in a 5-\nminute interval.\n  This is obviously a difficult situation.\n  I said when I started that America deserves better. I think Africa \ndeserves better than this kind of treatment. I think people in Africa \ndeserve to be treated with the same kind of dignity that the people \nAmerica ought to be treated. I don't think we should say local \nconditions over there are different and that changes our ethics. I \ndon't think our character is determined by the people we are dealing \nwith. It is not OK to do things that are not ethical because you are \ndealing with people who are less well endowed than you are. I don't \nthink it is OK to do things that are unethical or wouldn't meet the \nethical standards here at home because the people are poorer than you \nare, or because they don't have the education. I think as Americans we \nunderstand that character is not a condition of circumstance. \nCircumstances may reveal character. But character is something on the \ninside that is determined by character itself--not by the circumstances \noutside.\n  I really think these are very serious questions about the conduct of \nmedical experimentation. No question in my mind that there is a lot to \nbe gained from these studies. But the truth of the matter is time and \ntime again people, because they have had a a lot to gain from studies \nwho haven't been as sensitive to ethics as we have been, have\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\ndone things that are inappropriate or ashamed of. There was something \nto be gained from the study. I am not saying this was Tuskegee. There \nwas something to be gained by it. And the people who excused it said, \n``Well, these are just poor individuals, and they are not very \nintelligent individuals. So we can treat them differently than we treat \nother individuals.'' And I think the Nation has a real tug in its \nheart. We realized we were wrong. It was inappropriate, and it was \nappropriate that there be an apology. And an apology obviously doesn't \nsolve that situation.\n\n  I think we have to ask ourselves whether or not we can excuse away \nthe absence of the right ethical standards based on local conditions, \nbased on local education, based on the individual's intelligence, based \non any circumstances. I believe that we have a responsibility to adhere \nto the guidelines. And in the absence of our commitment to those \nguidelines there is a serious deficiency. I believe if we do not have a \nstrong commitment to ethics in the office of Surgeon General that we \nwill not have a strong commitment to serving the people of this country \nin the way that they should be served.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know that there are others that \nchoose to speak. So I will not take long.\n  Just in a brief response, we have on the one hand the life of Dr. \nSatcher when we talk about ethics. And if there is any real kind of a \nquestion about his judgment and his failing a duty in terms of ethics, \nI think we ought to take a look at what the facts are and also take a \nlook at what kind of life he has led in terms of the service of the \nunderserved in his professional life, and the work that he has done. \nAnd you will see, this extraordinary light that shines brightly in \nterms of working for the disadvantaged and those that are left out and \nleft behind, those that do not have good health and medical services, \nand those that are the sickest and neediest in our society.\n  To try to take a situation here about informed consent when we have \nthose that have been involved in the programs themselves who describe \nthe various ways that they went about informing potential subjects to \nbe involved in these trials--particularly with the statements of the \nin-country personnel and to try to use anecdotal information based upon \nthe conversations with one or two of those people that are involved in \nthe trials--as being somehow a reflection of the failure of Dr. Satcher \nto reach a high ethical standard is a pretty far stretch.\n  Madam President, I listened with great interest to my friend from \nMissouri talk about the Helsinki accords, and about the importance of \nmaking available the known, effective treatment, that we shouldn't have \nvarious kinds of research being conducted if we are denying known \neffective treatment to these individuals. Well, understand the regimen \nare talking about when we are talking about known effective treatment \nbecause it was the judgment of the medical professions that if we took \nthe known effective treatment that is used here in the United States \nthat there was serious doubt as to whether it would be effective. That \nis why the lower dose regimen is being tested in developing countries.\n  What do I mean? By using the known effective treatment that is used \nhere in the United States that is referred to by the Senator from \nMissouri, you have to stop breast feeding. You can't use that regimen \nand continue to breast feed. It was the judgment of the Centers for \nDisease Control that if you used the 076 regimen you might also be \nexposing these subjects to other health risks, such as high levels of \ndrug toxicity due to their entirely different diet. It must be \nrecognized that the 076 regimen is not known to be an effective regimen \nfor populations in developing countries. It was known at the Centers \nfor Disease Control if you are going to use the 076 treatment the \nstandard in the United States, you have to have 100 milligrams of AZT \nfive times. You have to have treatment for 12 weeks of pregnancy and \nyou need to receive intravenous AZT during labor and pregnancy. In \norder to do this, you have to have a sufficient health infrastructure, \none which is going to bring these various infected individuals and \nbring them back to the center frequently. This infrastructure just is \nnot available.\n\n  Senator, get real; the regimen that is effective in the United \nStates, the majority of the scientists at the Centers for Disease \nControl do not believe it could be effective over there. So when you \nsay, they have no effective treatment, we have this treatment here in \nthe United States of America and we are denying those people that \neffective treatment and it is violating all those ethical \nconsiderations, I have to disagree. Understand what is happening in \nthese situations. Understand the these regimens. These developing \ncountries just do not have the infrastructure. You cannot get them to \nstop breast feeding so they have to follow a different regime, one that \npermits them to breast feed, one that doesn't require them to come to a \nclinic on a frequent basis, one that says they do not have to have the \nelaborate infrastructure that is necessary under the 076 regimen.\n  The idea to put out on the floor that Dr. Satcher is not qualified, \nnot qualified to be Surgeon General because of this kind of a situation \nis the most extraordinary stretch in terms of misrepresentation and \nfailure to understand what these trials are really about. I am just \namazed as we get further and further into it how weak that case is.\n  The Senators who are opposed to Dr. Satcher better do a lot better \ntonight and tomorrow in their opposition than they have done today. I \nhave listened to these arguments, and I can't believe any one of our \ncolleagues who has been following them can believe that there is very \nmuch to it. Take this man whose total life has been committed to his \nfellow human beings, and try and do the acrobatics and gymnastics and \ntrapeze work in terms of misinterpreting these kinds of studies to show \nthat he is basically flawed in terms of his ethical standards, my \ngoodness, Madam President, give us a break. Give us a break.\n  So, Madam President, I will have more to say on some of these other \nquestions, on the other misrepresentations. There were a series of \nothers. I will just mention in addition one further area that has been \nraised during the consideration here earlier in the afternoon. Critics \nhave also charged that Dr. Satcher at CDC supported HIV studies on \nnewborns that allowed them to be sent home without telling their \nparents of their HIV status.\n  This survey was part of an effort to obtain a better idea of how HIV \nwas spreading in different populations.\n  It was implemented by State and local health departments across the \ncountry with support from CDC. The survey began at a time when little \nwas known about the impact of HIV on women and their children.\n  The studies were designed to check for the presence of antibodies to \nHIV infection in newborns. The presence of such antibodies would \nindicate that the mother is infected with HIV and that her child has \nbeen exposed to the virus. Approximately 25 percent of children exposed \nto HIV develop HIV infection, too.\n  That is the point I made in the debate earlier in the afternoon. That \nis why this whole area of study is so important and so exciting, and \nthe consequences so important, because this is an area in medical \nresearch that offers some really important potential breakthroughs for \nbabies whose mothers are infected.\n  The studies were carried out using blood samples that were left over \nfrom other routine purposes and that otherwise would have been \ndiscarded. The samples were not identified as coming from specific \nindividuals. At the time, AIDS was not well understood. CDC was \nsurveying newborns as a group to learn more about the incidence of the \ndisease in particular communities. No treatment was available for \nnewborns at that time--none. This was in 1988.\n\n  This study was part of a responsible scientific effort to learn more \nabout the prevalence of HIV, so that resources could be targeted \nquickly and effectively. The survey followed strict ethical principles \nand was approved by the Office for Protection from Research Risks at \nNIH. A task force of ethicists, lawyers, civil liberties advocates, gay \nrights proponents, and public health officials met at the Hastings\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nCenter, a bioethics think tank, to consider the issue. No objection was \nraised to these studies.\n  The Hastings Center is one of the important resources in this country \nin terms of bioethical issues. They have a number of very thoughtful \nteachers and scholars who have testified before our committees over the \nyears. And they have been included in this review of this particular \nproject. A 1988 review of the issue by a Canadian work group also gave \nits approval to the studies. So did the World Health Organization's \nGlobal Program on AIDS.\n  The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences \nreviewed the survey and approved it as a well- established approach to \npublic health surveys.\n  Here you have it. You have the NIH Office for Protection from \nResearch, you have the Hastings Center, which is one of the leading \nbioethic think tanks in this country, approving it. No objection was \nraised. The Canadian group also reviewed the work and so did the World \nHealth Organization's Global Program on AIDS. The Institute of Medicine \nof the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the survey and approved it \nas a well-established approach to public health surveys. All of these \nbodies have approved these surveys.\n  The information in the surveys was used by communities for education, \nscreening, and treatment.\n  The surveys ended in 1995, when new treatments for infants exposed to \nHIV and other ways to monitor HIV population trends in women of \nchildbearing age became available.\n  In September of 1997, Dr. Satcher recommended the study be formally \nterminated, and HHS agreed. So Dr. Satcher terminated it. It was going \non when he became the head of the Centers for Disease Control, but he \nterminated the survey. CDC continues to work with States to identify \nways to monitor trends of HIV in women of childbearing age.\n  Now, Madam President, I was in the Senate during this period of time. \nIt was in 1988 that we had the first initiatives on pediatric AIDS. My \ngood friend from Ohio, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, on the Health and \nHuman Resources Committee--and I will include the exact references \ntomorrow in the Record--was the one who offered the first amendment. It \nwas $10 million to try to help and assist in the area of pediatric \nAIDS. It was a brand-new challenge in public health. And these studies \nhave been referred to as something we would not subscribe to today, but \nat a time when we were attempting to find out the nature of the threat \nin terms of mothers and the extent of the challenge for communities and \nStates in our Nation, these surveys were considered and reviewed and \napproved.\n  To try to use today's standard for an earlier period of time when we \nvirtually knew nothing about how to deal with pediatric AIDS--and there \nwas enormous resistance in this body to doing anything about it then, \nenormous resistance to get into it at all. People forget all of that. \nWhy get involved in this kind of disease research? We went through all \nof that. We eventually had the work with the Ryan White bill and \nseveral other breakthroughs that were important that moved us into a \ndirection which respected the science rather than the ideology of the \ntime. But during this period of time, and I remember very clearly, it \nwas extremely difficult. We were trying to find out more as a nation \nand as a people about the prevalence of this disease within the \npopulation, and so this kind of survey took place. It is easy to \nflyspeck it now in terms of how surprising it is that any such study \ncould possibly take place today. And it is always useful and valuable \nto be a Monday morning quarterback. The studies that were done then had \nbeen reviewed in terms of their ethical considerations. Maybe some \nagree, some differ. We could all certainly find criticisms of it \nknowing what we know today, but that isn't the question.\n\n  The fact is this issue was actually started under a Republican \nadministration and ended by Dr. Satcher.\n  Now, it is nice to come out here and say, well, he should have ended \nit earlier and therefore he is not qualified. If that is your argument, \nso be it. But it is not, nor should it be, an argument that is elevated \nto a serious reason for having any second thoughts about this \noutstanding nominee.\n  Finally, I just say, Madam President, as I started out today, we have \nan extraordinary doctor who has been willing to take on the \nresponsibilities of Surgeon General and tend to our nation's public \nhealth concerns. These are tough issues. They deal with the most \ndifficult kinds of problems that we can possibly imagine. We understand \nthat. And Dr. Satcher deserves great credit for being willing to stand \nup and say I want to continue to serve, as he has his whole life.\n  We are very fortunate to have such a person willing to stand up, and \nwe are fortunate to have the President nominate him. I am going to be \nproud to vote in support of him, and I am confident we will have an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate to do so.\n  As I said, I have been proud to respond to the questions that have \ncome up today and look forward to further debate and discussion on this \noutstanding nominee. Hopefully, we will get the opportunity of having a \nchance to approve him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, sometimes my colleague from Massachusetts \nand I disagree openly, sometimes loudly, on different issues, but he \nand I will not disagree today on the integrity or the excellence of the \nindividual before us, David Satcher. But we will disagree. Nobody \ndeserves a break on the truth or the facts as it relates to the \nperformance of an individual.\n  So let the Senator from Massachusetts and I agree that David Satcher \nis an outstanding individual of high quality. We agree. But because of \ndifferences in philosophy that sometimes produce politics we will \ndisagree. I think my colleague from Missouri was doing that today. And \nso no breaks are given to anyone, nor should they be given. We are \ntalking about building a record that is tremendously important as we \nreach out to decide whether this gentleman should become America's \nfamily doctor as the Surgeon General of the United States and therefore \nthe record and the facts as they relate to this individual's \nperformance and what he has done in the past are relevant and very \nimportant.\n  There is no question that David Satcher will probably be confirmed as \nthe Surgeon General, and as he is confirmed and as the American public \ngets to know him it is important that they know a little bit about his \nbackground so they can be ready and aware of what he might do along \nwith what he will be required to do as our Surgeon General.\n  I would like to talk about two areas that I think are very important \nto our country as a whole. As I have said, his philosophy is generally \nvery different from my own, and that means that I will and do \nfundamentally disagree with the views of many of his efforts and my \nview, my politics, my philosophy is different from our President's. And \nso it is not unusual that he might nominate somebody that I would not \nagree with nor would I want to vote to confirm. But I also recognize \nthe reality and the importance of our President being able to nominate \nthose whom he feels would serve best under his Presidency based on his \nphilosophy and his vision of how the country ought to be. So, while I \nbelieve the President's choice deserves some deference, I do not \nbelieve the Senate should automatically rubberstamp any decision that \nour President makes. This is one that he has made. It deserves \nreasonable debate on the floor. I believe I can offer some of that this \nafternoon.\n\n  David Satcher comes to us with a background that includes service as \na Federal officer. In his capacity as Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control, he was made aware of serious concerns that I and other \nMembers of both the House and the Senate had talked about and had \nvisited with him about. I was privileged to have that conversation in \nmy office some time ago with Dr. Satcher. I was pleased that he would \ncome, sit down and engage in a thoughtful and earnest way about \nsomething that was of concern to me and a very large constituency in \nthis country; that I felt he and the tax dollars engaged at the \nNational Centers for Disease Control were being misused.\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\n  The House and the Senate had concerns about a crusade mounted by the \nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control about certain kinds \nof things, and our director, the Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl, Dr. Satcher, went in a different direction. He launched a \nstudy against private firearms ownership in this country.\n  Now, you have to scratch your head a bit and say, ``What? Firearms? \nGuns? Centers for Disease Control?'' I did. I scratched my head and \nsaid, ``Dr. Satcher, where are you coming from?'' Well, he was quoted \nto say this, that his efforts and the studies he was putting forth were \n``to convince Americans that guns are first and foremost a public \nhealth menace'' and to that end they had ignored years of study by \ncriminologists, people much more directed in the area of guns and crime \nthan the Centers for Disease Control. But Dr. Satcher being politically \ncorrect for his President moved on. And therefore went on to say that \nthey had labeled violence as an ``epidemic,'' and concluded that gun \ncontrol was the way to cure it.\n  What they failed to recognize, and they should have recognized if \nthey are good clinicians, is that the state and the condition in which \nthe individual is raised produces a violent person, and that a violent \nperson will reach out in his or her act of violence and use any tool \navailable to them. But, no, because it was politically correct, they \nchose firearms.\n  Dr. Satcher, firearms are not an epidemic in this country, they are a \nconstitutional right and you ought to understand that. And, while you \nwere being politically correct for this President and your philosophy, \nyou were being unconstitutional. You were directing the energies and \nthe taxpayers' dollars of this country against something that in my \nopinion was, frankly, none of your business. But you chose to move \nahead, for all the reasons I think I have just stated.\n  In short, the so-called research done by that agency was, in my \nopinion, both politically motivated and from a scientific point of \nview--and we have heard about his tremendous scientific credentials \nthis afternoon--seriously flawed. Although Dr. Satcher did not \npersonally conduct the research, he used his position to defend it. \nEven worse, his leadership at CDC caused it to continue even after it \ncame under criticism. So you have to question. My job is to question. I \nthink my argument today is legitimate. Dr. Satcher, you were acting \nbeyond your professional credentials and, therefore, your science in my \nopinion was flawed. Now he wants to be America's family doctor.\n  Mr. President, law abiding gun owners are not a public health menace. \nViolent people are, and have demonstrated by their actions that they \ncan become a menace to people's health. It is outrageous that the head \nof any Federal agency would endorse using taxpayers' dollars in a \npolitical campaign against a constitutionally protected right of the \ntaxpayer who paid for the campaign. But the gentleman this Senate is \nabout to vote on did just that. He very openly talked to me about it in \nmy office and I respect him for coming to visit about it. His only \nargument was he just thought it was important to do.\n  I noted that he was very much in sync with the President, and \ntherefore he was obviously doing the right thing politically. But I \nthink it is time we question him on that issue.\n  This is not the only area where Dr. Satcher's extreme views, I think, \ngenerate some concern. He also supports the legality of partial birth \nabortions. His position on this controversial procedure is at odds with \nwhat most polling data suggest today is 80 percent of the American \npeople, and with the professional and ethical judgment of the American \nMedical Association. In taking this position, Dr. Satcher clearly \nchooses the President's political agenda over the views of his medical \ncolleagues. So I think it is important, when there are some who get a \nbit exercised here that somehow we are questioning this gentleman's \nsincerity, or most important his professional integrity, that this man \nis quite often very willing to politicize beyond science something that \nhappens to fit the agenda of the President that he serves.\n  His views on this particular procedure are so far in the minority, \nand I think it is important that we recognize that. Many Members of \nCongress who advocate abortion voted in favor of banning partial birth \nabortion. Dr. Satcher and President Clinton say the decision to have an \nabortion should be between a woman, her conscience, and her doctor; and \nthat abortion should be safe and legal. The partial-birth abortion \nprocedure is indefensible on any of those grounds. The procedure we are \ntalking about is one of causing and then stopping delivery of a child. \nI could go into the details of that. That isn't necessary to do. It has \nbeen talked about for a long time on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I \nthink Senators, in a large majority now, fit the understanding of the \nAmerican people on this issue.\n  So, let me conclude by saying that my intent this afternoon is not to \nimpugn the talent or the integrity of Dr. Satcher. It is, though, to \nclearly demonstrate that he is a political nominee who can operate in \npolitical ways and has chosen to do so to stay in step with the \nPresident who nominated him and to be out of step, not only with the \nConstitution of this country, but in many instances the vast majority \nof the American people.\n  I am not going to attempt to predict the outcome of the vote on the \nfloor but my guess is that when the vote settles, Dr. David Satcher \nwill be the next Surgeon General of the United States. I and others \nwill watch him very closely, hoping he will serve with integrity and \nresponsibility, and that he will not choose to use his bully pulpit as \na leverage against fundamental constitutional rights in our country, or \nwhat a vast majority of the American people think would be a wrong \nprocedure, a wrong process, or an unnecessary law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination. If my \ncolleagues will permit me to tell a short personal story, my father was \na medical doctor and he practiced the last half of his career in the \ngreater metropolitan area of the Nation's Capital, largely in Virginia. \nHe was a marvelous man. His whole life was his family and medicine. He \nwas sort of in that vintage of the old timers who, when you called, he \ngot in his car or he walked or whatever the case may be, and he went to \nthe homes and the hospitals and tended to the sick and the needy.\n  I can remember in the Depression days, people would come to our front \ndoor and he never hesitated to give his God-given brains and expertise \nto the assistance of others. I have to tell you, Mr. President, I have \nsaid this before, if I had half the brains of my father I would have \ngone to medical school but I came up short and had to sort of accept \nthe lot that was cast me.\n  The nominee came to visit me, as I am sure he did with many others, \nand I talked to him at great length. He impressed me as a man of \nconsiderable skills in the medical profession, not in one narrow area \nbut a very broad area. His education, his demeanor--I was very \nimpressed with him. And I then sought, as all of us do, the \nconsultation of our constituents, people who might have known him or \nhad a judgment. I found in the State of Virginia he is highly regarded \nprofessionally. As a matter of fact, one of the most eminent physicians \nin Richmond VA, Frank S. Royal, Sr., whom I have known now for more \nthan 30 years personally as a friend, and who has been a friend and a \ncounsel to a number of Governors--indeed, Republican Governors. He was \nthe late Governor Dalton's physician and closest friend. Anyway, he \nknew the nominee very well, all the way beginning back in his \neducation. And he wrote me this letter which I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record following my remarks, giving an unequivocal \nendorsement of the nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. That letter, together with the endorsement of other \nrecognized medical organizations and physicians in my State, \ncorroborated my own findings. For that reason I am privileged and \npleased to cast my vote for the nominee.\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\n  I regret, however, that he does not hold all the views that I hold. \nParticularly, I am opposed to partial-birth abortion and have \nconsistently and will consistently vote to try to end that tragic \npractice. But we cannot expect this nominee or the nominee for \nSecretary of State or Defense to hold views which are consistent in \ntheir entirety with the views of individual Senators. I have been here, \nthis is my 19th year now. I have cast many votes for nominees, and \noften you do so based on the totality of the credentials.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord other documentation which I feel is important to this nomination \nand those reviewing it, and indicate in my own personal judgment we are \nfortunate to have a man of this depth of experience and dedication, who \ncould obviously earn many times over a Government salary in private \npractice, to step forward and volunteer to help the ever-increasing \nproblems associated with America's health system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                      East End Medical Center,\n\n                                 Richmond, VA, September 30, 1997.\n     The Hon. John W. Warner,\n     The U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am very pleased to lend my support \n     to the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to the position of \n     Assistant Secretary for Health & Human Services and Surgeon \n     General. I am confident that all will benefit from his \n     continued advocacy in his new role.\n       I am very familiar with Dr. Satcher's creative and \n     innovative approaches to increasing access to health care \n     services for all people through public-private partnerships. \n     His unique proposal to consolidate the acute hospital \n     services offered by Nashville's Metropolitan General Hospital \n     and Meharry Hubbard Hospital into one modern facility on the \n     Meharry campus is scheduled to come to fruition in January \n     1998.\n       Dr. Satcher is uniquely qualified for this position because \n     of his dedication to two causes-improving the diversity and \n     quality of the educational experience of health professionals \n     and enhancing the capacity of our public health \n     infrastructure to address the needs of the nation's \n     communities.\n       I pledge my support for this nomination and request that \n     Dr. Satcher be confirmed for this position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Frank S. Royal, Sr., M.D.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very \nexcellent words about the nominee, Dr. Satcher, as we work in order to, \nhopefully, bring about his confirmation.\n  I would like to make a few comments while we wait and see if someone \nelse is ready to talk.\n  I think it is important to briefly go through, and I am going to do \nit again another time with perhaps a little visual presentation of what \nwe are talking about when we talk about the AZT trials and the \nresponsibility of Dr. Satcher and Dr. Varmus, who is the head of NIH.\n  We are talking about trials which were designed in Africa, by \nAfricans, for Africans, after the review of many boards and groups that \nwere working toward a solution to this problem. We are not talking \nabout trials in the United States. Those of you who have visited Africa \nknow the incredible AIDS epidemic that is going on in those nations. We \nthink we have a problem here. The problems in the African nations where \nthere is some evidence that the AIDS epidemic started--there are \nmillions of pregnant women who are in danger of transmitting HIV to \ntheir children--are unimaginable.\n  The question was, how do you handle that situation? It was decided by \ndoctors and health officials in the host countries that they had to \ndesign some sort of a treatment protocol where they would know what \nwould happen when they administered certain doses of drugs. So what \nthey did--out of the huge pool of HIV infected pregnant women--was \ninvite a group of them to participate in this trial.\n  They invited these women--who were not going to receive any treatment \nfor their HIV infection--and they said to them that, ``We would like \nyou, if you are willing, to participate in our trial; some of you will \nget medicine which might help your baby, some of you will receive a \nsugar pill. You may stop participating in this trial anytime you want. \nThe only way we can determine whether the medicine is safe for you and \nyour baby, however, is to do it in this way.''\n  So it is not a question of whether these HIV infected pregnant women \nhad an alternative to go out and get help someplace else. They did not. \nParticipation in this trial was the best hope for getting any treatment \nthat might prevent them from giving HIV to their babies. Not only that, \nmost of these women were not in a situation, for instance, where they \ncould have used the 076 regimen even if it had been made available as \npart of the drug trial. They could not buy infant formula; thus, they \nended up having to nurse anyway. The 076 regimen requires that women \ngive up nursing.\n  There are a lot of differences--differences in culture and \ndifferences in circumstances--between here and in Africa. The host \ncountries and the international organizations involved discussed all of \nthese issues and finally agreed on this regimen for testing. They did \nso because they believed it provided the greatest hope for their own \npeople.\n  Now they get criticized because these pregnant women who would never \nhave gotten any help were invited to participate in a trial where they \nmight get some help. They are criticized for doing this, because the \nparticipants didn't know whether they would receive the medicine or the \nsugar pill. It is a difficult situation, but it can be misleading if \nyou don't understand the dynamics of the situation which the various \ncountries were facing.\n  I hope as we go forward to make an additional point to my \ncolleagues--and I am going to try to explain this a little more \narticulately and specifically later. The heads of CDC and NIH were \nseparated a long, long ways from what was going on, and they had all \nsorts of review boards and organizations approving this regimen. It is \nnot like Dr. Satcher and Dr. Varmus were over there in Africa \nconducting these trials. It was something that Dr. Satcher and Dr. \nVarmus have responsibility for as leaders of CDC and NIH, but certainly \nthe design was something which came about by virtue of the many U.S. \nand international organizations trying to figure out how to take care \nof this terrible epidemic and how to, hopefully, save as many of the \nyoung babies as they can from being infected.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments to wind up \ntoday's comments on truly an extraordinary nominee of the President and \nan incredibly gifted and talented medical professional doctor, Dr. \nSatcher.\n  I want to just mention at this time and I will read part of an \nexcellent letter that was made available to us. It was written to our \nfriend and colleague, Senator Ashcroft, from the Morehouse School of \nMedicine. It is from Dr. Louis Sullivan, who was the Secretary of HHS \nunder President Bush and had a very distinguished career there and has \nhad over the course of his lifetime a very distinguished career.\n  I will read this part, and I will submit the letter in its entirety \nfor the Record:\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: I understand that in a dear \n     colleague letter you recently questioned the ethics and \n     leadership of Dr. Satcher because of his support of AZT \n     trials to reduce perinatal HIV transmissions in developing \n     countries. You also questioned his role in the HIV-blinded \n     ``Surveys of Childbearing Women'' which started in 1988 and \n     was suspended in 1995. As a biomedical scientist, former \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     under President Bush, and one who has known and worked with \n     Dr. Satcher for twenty-five years, I write to respectfully \n     take exception to your assessment of the studies and \n     especially Dr. Satcher. I share the view of the World Health \n     Organization, UNAIDS, the National Institutes of Health and \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that these \n     studies were ethical, appropriate and critical for the health \n     of babies in developing countries. I also agree with public \n     health leaders at every level of government that the HIV-\n     blinded survey which was started five years before Dr. \n     Satcher entered government were ethical, appropriate and \n     critical during the early phase of the AIDS epidemic. More \n     importantly, I agree with those such as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, of \n     Public Citizen, who, while questioning the AZT trials in \n     Africa, strongly attest to the ethics and leadership of Dr.\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\n     Satcher and strongly support his nomination for Surgeon \n     General.\n\n  Then it goes on in a very, very important way in this letter. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record. It gives \nboth the history and the background on these AZT tests and responds to \nall the various issues that I think have been raised on that particular \nprogram.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Morehouse School of Medicine,\n\n                                    Atlanta, GA, January 30, 1998.\n     The Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: I understand that in a dear \n     colleague letter you recently questioned the ethics and \n     leadership of Dr. Satcher because of his support of AZT \n     trials to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in developing \n     countries. You also questioned his role in the HIV-blinded \n     Surveys of Childbearing Women which started in 1988 and was \n     suspended in 1995. As a biomedical scientist, former \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (DHHS) under President Bush, and one who has known and worked \n     with Dr. Satcher for twenty-five years, I write to \n     respectfully take exception to your assessment of the studies \n     and especially of Dr. Satcher. I share the view of the World \n     Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) that these studies were ethical, appropriate \n     and critical for the health of babies in developing \n     countries. I also agree with public health leaders at every \n     level of government that the HIV-blinded survey which was \n     started five years before Dr. Satcher entered government were \n     ethical, appropriate and critical during the early phase of \n     the AIDS epidemic. More importantly, I agree with those such \n     as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, of Public Citizen, who, while \n     questioning the AZT trials in Africa, strongly attest to the \n     ethics and leadership of Dr. Satcher and strongly support his \n     nomination for Surgeon General.\n       In 1994 scientists in the United States found a regimen \n     using the drug AZT that dramatically reduces the transmission \n     of the HIV virus from mothers to newborns. As a result of \n     this breakthrough, perinatal AIDS transmission in the United \n     States has dropped by almost half since 1992. Naturally, such \n     an advance raises hopes of making dramatic reductions not \n     only in the developed world, but in developing nations, where \n     1,000 babies are born each day infected with HIV.\n       Unfortunately, it is generally agreed that the regimen that \n     has worked so well in the United States is not suitable for \n     these developing nations. Part of the problem is that the \n     cost of the drugs involved is beyond the resources of \n     developing nations. In Malawi, for example, the regimen for \n     one woman and her child is more than 600 times the annual per \n     capita allocation for health care.\n       Just as important, developing nations lack the medical \n     infrastructure or facilities required to administer the \n     regimen, which requires (1) that women undergo HIV testing \n     and counseling early in their pregnancy, (2) that they comply \n     with a lengthy therapeutic oral regimen, and (3) that the \n     anti-HIV drugs be administered intravenously at the time of \n     birth. In addition, mothers must refrain from breast feeding; \n     the newborns must receive six weeks of oral drugs; and both \n     mothers and newborns must be closely monitored for adverse \n     effects of drugs.\n       Given the general recognition that this therapy could not \n     be widely carried out in developing nations, the WHO in 1994 \n     convened top scientists and health professionals from around \n     the world to explore a shorter, less costly, and less \n     complicated drug regimen that could be used in developing \n     countries. The meeting concluded that the best way to \n     determine efficacy and safety would be to conduct research \n     studies that compare a shorter drug regimen with a placebo--\n     that is, no medicine at all.\n       After the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published \n     its editorial criticizing the AZT trials in developing \n     countries, two of the three AIDS experts on this editorial \n     board resigned in protest because they disagreed. Many other \n     outstanding biomedical scientists and ethicists have since \n     taken issue with the NEJM editorial.\n       As one who feels strongly about what happened in Tuskegee, \n     let me say that it is utterly inappropriate to compare these \n     trials with Tuskegee where established treatment was withheld \n     so that the course of the disease could be observed while \n     these men died. The AZT trials being carried out in \n     developing countries are for the purpose of developing \n     treatment that is appropriate, effective and safe to prevent \n     the spread of HIV from mother to child. Unlike Tuskegee, \n     these programs have a very strong informed consent component.\n       Likewise, I do not believe that your criticism of the \n     blinded-surveys of childbearing women is inappropriate. These \n     surveys, which started in 1988, five years before Dr. Satcher \n     came to government, were supported by public health leaders \n     at every level. They were considered to be the best way to \n     monitor the evolving epidemic during that very difficult \n     period when we knew so little of the nature of the problem \n     and virtually no treatment was available. These surveys use \n     discarded blood from which all indentifying information had \n     been removed, to measure the extent of the HIV problem in \n     various communities and groups. The information was \n     invaluable to state and local communities in planning \n     education and screening programs. Using these surveys we were \n     able to document that the percentage of women infected with \n     HIV grew from 7% in 1985, to almost 20% in 1995. At no time \n     was any baby, known to be positive for HIV, sent home without \n     the parent being informed.\n       Again, I acknowledge your right to criticize Dr. Satcher, \n     the nominee for Surgeon General. But, I believe that Dr. \n     Satcher's long and distinguished career speaks for itself \n     relative to his commitment to ethical behavior, service to \n     the disadvantaged, to excellence in health care and research \n     and to human dignity.\n       Should you wish, I would be happy to review any of the \n     areas where there is any remaining confusion or questions.\n       With best wishes and regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in another letter from Dr. Sullivan to \nSenator Lott that was made available to all the membership, he said:\n\n       I enthusiastically support the nomination of David Satcher, \n     M.D., for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant \n     Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       In light of the recent debate about issues regarding his \n     nomination, I wish to communicate with you my experience \n     with, and opinion of, David Satcher. I have known David for \n     over twenty-five years, and I can state unequivocally that he \n     is a physician. . .of [extraordinary] integrity, conviction, \n     and commitment. As Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of \n     Health, I know that David has no intention of using those \n     positions to promote issues related to abortion or any other \n     political agenda. He has worked throughout his career to \n     focus on health issues that unite Americans--not divide them.\n\n  And the letter goes on.\n  Both of these letters are from a very, very distinguished leader of \nthe Department under President Bush and someone who has made, in his \nown way, an extraordinary contribution to public health and to health \npolicy generally. Someone who has known Dr. Satcher for a long period \nof time should have a very important influence, I would think, and \nweight with our colleagues.\n  I just mention, finally, Mr. President--and I am sorry my friend from \nMissouri is not here, Senator Ashcroft. He talked about the State \nsurveys that were taken, and he was highly critical of the State \nsurveys.\n  It has been brought to my attention that the surveys went into effect \nin 1988, and then were concluded in 1995. Dr. Satcher came to the \nCenters for Disease Control--started under a Republican administration. \nBut it is interesting that Senator Ashcroft was Governor of Missouri \nduring this period of time, and he signed on for these various State \nsurveys, and supported them.\n  It just has to have somewhat of a ring here today as we are \nconsidering these surveys and as the point is being raised about how \neffective or how wise these surveys will be, that the person who is \nraising this and the most critical is someone who was a Governor of a \nState that actually endorsed and signed the applications. I do not \nthink it is necessary, but we will have those available for the Record \ntomorrow.\n  I think this is just, again, interesting. If these are the best cases \nthat can be made against someone who has such a distinguished record, \nsuch a powerful life record in terms of the public interest and \nservice, then we should be about the business of moving ahead and \nsupporting this nomination.\n  We look forward to the further debate. I am puzzled about where those \nare that have the serious reservations. We have been out here ready to \ndebate this record. We look forward to debating it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher to the position of Surgeon General. As \nmany colleagues have noted, he is exceptionally\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nwell qualified for this position. He has been involved, throughout his \nprofessional career, in a very broad range of health issues and has \nchampioned improvements in all the areas that he has been involved \nwith.\n  I find it somewhat unusual that this appointment to an important \nposition, though not a Cabinet-level position, seems to always attract \nsuch debate and such controversy. Certainly, we want someone with real \nleadership skill to serve as the Surgeon General; but why, time after \ntime, do we find ourselves embroiled in a debate over who that person \nmight be? Some critics will say it is the fault of President Clinton \nfor bringing names before the Senate that are so controversial. Yet, I \nthink if history serves me correctly, I believe Dr. Koop, an appointee \nof President Reagan's, was a controversial nominee. Dr. Koop caused a \nlot of people some concern. He had some rather strongly held personal \nviews on a controversial issue, the issue of abortion. The Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress wrestled with his nomination and came to the \nconclusion that Dr. Koop's medical credentials and in the area of \npublic health were so compelling that he should be given a chance to \nserve, even though a majority of the Democrats might disagree with his \nposition on the issue of choice or abortion. It is a good thing we did \nbecause, despite our differences with Dr. Koop on that issue, he proved \nto be an exceptional leader on public health issues for America. In \nfact, some of the initiatives that Dr. Koop really spearheaded, I \nthink, were so timely and so important that history will treat him very \nkindly. For example, alerting America at that moment in time to the \ndangers of HIV/AIDS was a controversial thing to do. Yet, he did it \nwith the approval of the Reagan administration, at a time when it was \nappropriate. I think lives were saved as a result of that. So I have \nalways drawn from the experience of Dr. Koop, who has become a friend \nof mine on the tobacco issues, that you should not judge a person on \none life experience or one issue, but you should look at the totality \nof the circumstances, look at their values and principles and try to \ndetermine whether or not that person, man or woman, can do the job.\n  That is why it is easy today to rise in support of Dr. David Satcher \nto fill the spot as our Surgeon General of the United States. Some of \nthe areas he has worked in have been extraordinary. From increasing \nchildhood immunization rates, to improving breast and cervical cancer \nscreening, Dr. Satcher has been a leader.\n  I want to focus on one aspect of his work at the CDC, in improving \nthe Nation's food safety programs. Make no mistake--and I want to \nunderline this, if I can--America is blessed with the safest and most \nabundant food supply in the world. You need only travel to any other \ncountry and take a look at the alternative to appreciate what I have \njust said. But we can do better.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 33 million \nAmericans will suffer food poisoning this year, and more than 9,000 \nwill die from it, primarily infants and elderly people. The annual cost \nof foodborne illnesses in this country may rise to as high as $22 \nbillion a year.\n  Since 1993, the CDC, under Dr. Satcher's direction, has played a \ncritical role in modernizing our food safety programs and responding to \nchallenges created by the large amount and variety of food now \navailable in the United States.\n  As part of this effort, the CDC has led rapid response to outbreaks \nof foodborne illnesses, conducted research into the cause and \ntransmission of foodborne illness, and expanded outreach to health \nofficials and the public on treatment and prevention of foodborne \nillness.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne \nillnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the \nnext decade. Such estimates make increased vigilance even more \nimportant. Both early detection and rapid response are critical to \nminimizing health hazards from unsafe food.\n  Building on these efforts, President Clinton announced in January \n1997 that the CDC will join forces with the Federal, State, and local \nagencies on new efforts to improve the safety of our Nation's food \nsupply.\n  CDC and Dr. Satcher have played a key role in the new early warning \nsystem to help try to catch and respond to outbreaks of foodborne \nillness earlier and to give us the data we need to prevent future \noutbreaks.\n  In 1995, the CDC, with the FDA, Department of Agriculture, and State \nhealth departments, established this network of ``sentinel'' \nsurveillance sites in five States that conducted in-depth surveillance \nfor foodborne illness and related epidemiological studies.\n  Since becoming operational in 1996, the network already has \nidentified an outbreak of salmonella caused by contaminated alfalfa \nsprouts and an outbreak of E. coli from lettuce.\n  I hope we can do more. We need a Surgeon General in place who is \nsensitive to that need. I think that we can start to consolidate under \none Federal agency the many disparate Federal agencies that now try to \nkeep our food supply safe. Isn't it a curious thing that when you take \nsomething as common as an egg, and if that egg is broken and served as \na product, it is the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. \nIf that egg remains in the shell and is sold as a product, it is the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Consumers have to shake \ntheir heads in wonderment that we would make such arbitrary \ndistinctions between products which families view as the same thing, as \nfar as they are concerned. It calls for leadership not only in the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the FDA, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Department of Commerce, and many other agencies, but it \ncalls for the leadership of a Surgeon General, and that vacancy should \nbe filled by Dr. Satcher, sooner rather than later.\n  Dr. Satcher, as head of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, has dramatically expanded the CDC's landmark ``National \nBreast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program,'' which offers \ncomprehensive breast and cervical cancer screening services to \nmedically underserved women nationwide.\n  Prior to Dr. Satcher's tenure and leadership at CDC, 18 States had \nthe program. Today, all 50 States do, as well as 5 U.S. territories, \nand 13 American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations have programs. This \nexpansion was based on strong scientific evidence showing that breast \nand cervical cancer screening can save women's lives.\n  As of 1996, more than 1.2 million cancer screening tests were \nprovided by the program. There are some critics of Dr. Satcher who \nmight dwell or focus on one or two controversial things. I hope they \nwill judge the man in his totality, and that they will judge his \ncontribution fairly, because if you look at his work in public health, \nit is truly extraordinary.\n  There is one area I would like to speak to that has been brought up \non the floor, and I would like to close with this. Some have been \ncritical of the efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to address \nthe whole issue of firearm injuries in the United States. Many believe \nthat this is entirely too political for an agency that is supposed to \nbe dedicated to public health. I disagree. Over 38,500 Americans are \nkilled each year with firearms in America; 17,800 homicides; 18,700 \nsuicides; 1,300 unintentional deaths; 5,800 children and teenagers die \nin America each year from firearm injuries; they are the leading cause \nof death among African American teenagers and the second leading cause \nof death among white teenagers.\n  In the city of Chicago, IL, there is a hospital that we all admire so \nmuch, Mount Sinai. Next to it is a facility known as the Schwab Rehab \nInstitute. Mount Sinai Hospital is in a tough neighborhood. In fact, a \nvisit there on any weekend evening would be a sobering experience for \nall of us, because the people who come in there, the victims of \ndramatic injury and gunshot wounds, unfortunately, are in great number. \nThose physicians, nurses, and medical personnel scramble to do their \nbest to try to keep these people alive. They manage, in many cases, to \ndo that, and it takes the miracle of medicine to do it. Those folks \nmight find themselves, a few weeks or months later, across the street \nat the rehab institute, Schwab Rehab, where I visited a few times to \nspeak to victims of gunshots, and to talk to men in wheelchairs, \nparaplegics and quadriplegics, who will never have a chance to enjoy\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\nfull physical mobility, because they were so victimized. It is not a \nsurprise to me that many of the Nation's largest medical organizations \nand physician groups are now starting to focus on firearm injuries as a \nnational epidemic --not only because of their number, but because of \nthe severity of injury that is suffered. What day goes by in a major \ncity in America where we don't hear or read about some innocent victim, \nmany times a child waiting for a school bus, or a child who is out \nfront playing on a bicycle, who is sprayed by random bullets and \nbecomes a victim and is perhaps even killed? In that situation, we \nshould step back and say, what can we do not just to treat the injury, \nbut to reduce the likelihood that that injury will occur.\n\n  I think the CDC, which really tries to improve public health across \nAmerica, should include firearm injuries on the agenda. I am happy that \nDr. Satcher feels the same way, and I hope CDC does not relax its \nefforts in this area in any way whatsoever.\n  Finally, let me say, over the years, I have worked with the CDC on \nthe issue of tobacco and tobacco-related diseases. They have really \nbeen leaders. They have brought out sound, credible evidence of the \ndevastation caused by tobacco in America. They have talked about what \nwe need to do to reduce what is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in \nAmerica from occurring. I think the CDC has that responsibility.\n  Our Surgeon General, in the past, has exhibited the same kind of \nleadership. We have seen those men and women come forward to the post \nand try to identify those issues that are important to Americans. Some \nfriends of mine are managers of television stations. Since most of us \nspend a lot of our waking moments watching television, I sometimes say \nto them, ``When you are scheduling your programming for television, \nwhat do you look for? What are people interested in? What are American \nfamilies anxious to watch and hear about?'' An interesting thing has \noccurred over the last 10, 12 years. You will notice it if you watch \nthe news tonight, or any other night for that matter, or any morning. \nAmericans are interested in public health issues. They are primarily \ninterested in breakthroughs in medical discoveries. You see it every \nday. Since talking with this one station manager in Decatur, IL, 10 \nyears ago, I have been focusing on it. Most news programs include a \nstory about medicine. America's families want to hear what we know and \nwhat we can share with them that might improve the quality of their \nlives. I think that is a indication of why this debate over the \nappointment of the Surgeon General is so important, and why we should \nnot delay it or in any way sidetrack this debate over some tangential \npolitical issue. What is important is that we put a person of quality \nin this position, who can address the important public health \nchallenges facing America. I think that is our responsibility here.\n  Let me tell you, after reviewing his background, I think there is \nnobody better qualified for that position than Dr. David Satcher. I am \nhappy to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon not just in support \nof but in strong support of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  I also want to state that I have a personal prejudice because I have \nworked closely with Dr. Satcher over the last 5 years since he became \nhead of the Centers for Disease Control.\n  There is a current cute saying making the rounds in Washington, and \nunhappily it is true. This is the only nation on Earth where a person \nis presumed innocent until they receive a Presidential nomination.\n  We have had a lot of contentious debate on this floor about various \nnominations. I have not participated in many of those debates. But I am \nparticipating and I will continue to participate in the nomination of \nDr. Satcher because I think he is one of the finest medical people in \nthe United States. I also happen to think that he is one of the finest \nmen, one of the finest people in the United States. I believe that the \nPresident could not have chosen better for this position.\n  Mr. President, it is a real travesty to me that people who want to \nserve their Government in a position such as this are subjected to such \na contentious process. Admittedly, the position of surgeon general \ndoesn't have a lot of clout, but it does have a lot of public relations \nvalue. There are a lot of public appearances made by the Surgeon \nGeneral. They take a lot of different positions on medical techniques \nand medical practices in this country. In some respects, I can \nsympathize with the Senator from Missouri who is opposed to this \nnomination, apparently based on Dr. Satcher's presumed feelings about \nthe issue of partial-birth abortion. I happen to agree with Dr. Satcher \non partial-birth abortions, but I recognize it is a very, very \ndifficult moral question for everyone. I also have to confess to the \nSenate that I voted against Dr. Koop's confirmation to be Surgeon \nGeneral because of his position on that issue, and have lived until \nthis day to regret my vote because he turned out to be one of the \ngreatest surgeon generals this country has ever had. I didn't know Dr. \nKoop. If I had known him maybe I would have voted differently.\n  I do know Dr. Satcher in a very personal, intimate way because I have \nworked closely with him for 4 years. But aside from that, I ask my \ncolleagues to look at his credentials. Look at the life of this African \nAmerican who has risen from a poor rural community to become prominent, \nto become a role model. He went to Morehouse College, the same school \nDr. Martin Luther King graduated from. Do you know what he did there? \nHe was Phi Beta Kappa, which means that intellectually he was superior; \na good student. From there he went on to get his MD and Ph.D. from Case \nWestern Reserve in Cleveland. He did that in 1970, and then went into a \ncareer of academic and public health medicine.\n  So far that is pretty impressive, is it not? A man who has spent his \nentire life since 1970 in public health and was a Phi Beta Kappa with \nthe highest degrees you can get in medicine. After he graduated he \nserved on the faculty at the UCLA Medical School, and as Dean of Family \nMedicine at King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was then \nappointed president of Meharry Medical College in 1982. He was \nPresident of Meharry Medical College until 1993 until President Clinton \nchose him to head up the Centers for Disease Control, an agency to \nwhich we turn time and time again every year. Whether there is an EColi \nbreakout, or a virus breakout in Africa, or whether it is mad cow \ndisease in England, or whether it is an avian flu virus in the chickens \nof Hong Kong, it is the Centers for Disease Control who the world calls \non, and they respond. They respond always in a very professional and \neffective way.\n  I don't know what else may be involved in this, other than partial-\nbirth abortions. I have heard that some people take exception to the \nrole of the Centers for Disease Control in conducting research in \ndeveloping countries aimed at reducing transmission of HIV from \npregnant mothers to newborns through AZT therapy. Let me say, first of \nall, that tests to measure the effectiveness of long-term AZT therapy \non pregnant women were started long before Dr. Satcher came to the \nCenters for Disease Control. Let me also say those tests were expanded \nupon to measure the effectiveness of short-term drug therapy, because \nthe public health infrastructure in Africa could not support the \nlonger-term regimen. Getting AZT to pregnant African women during their \nentire pregnancy was almost impossible because of logistics. It was \njust not practical. The short-term regimen provides massive doses to \npregnant women just before they deliver. And it is this short-term \napproach that holds out hope for the thousands of HIV-infected children \nwho are born in Africa each week. In every experiment, the health \nministers of each African country in which the trials were conducted \napproved the study design.\n\n  But whether you like that or whether you do not like that, or whether \nyou don't think the tests should have been conducted, or if they were \nnot conducted correctly, the entire process started long before Dr. \nSatcher came to CDC. And the process was a joint effort of NIH, CDC and \nthe World Health Organization. And what difference should\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\nit make when we consider the nomination of this outstanding candidate \nfor the post of surgeon general?\n  Mr. President, there is also controversy on the question of \npreventing AIDS transmission through needle exchange and on the issue \nof making condoms available in public schools. Regarding the former, \nDr. Satcher has said that science rather than politics should determine \nour policy. On the issue of condoms, Dr. Satcher has stated that such \ndecisions should be made in local communities by parents, teachers and \ncommunity leaders. Who here can disagree with those positions?\n  Mr. President, on the issue of partial-birth abortion, the American \nMedical Association came out and said they are opposed to it but here \nis what they say about Dr. Satcher.\n\n       The American Medical Association continues to \n     enthusiastically support Dr. David Satcher . . .'' [The \n     surgon general's office] ``has been vacant far too long,'' \n     [and] ``the American public needs a credible voice they can \n     turn to in times of a public health crisis. . . . We urge \n     Congress to look at the totality of Dr. Satcher's expertise \n     and experience. He is a physician, administrator, educator, \n     and outstanding public health leader.\n\n  Why is it we turn to the agencies like the AMA when we agree with \nthem and want to ignore them when we don't agree with them?\n  Mr. President, I want to go back to say that Betty Bumpers, my wife, \nand I have devoted a large part of our public life, which now spans 27 \nyears, to improving the immunization of children. It was Betty's idea. \nIt was not mine. And until this day she is extremely active. She and \nRoslyn Carter have their own program, and have had it for 7 years, \ncalled ``Every Child by Two.'' They go around the country and work with \ngovernors and community groups to educate parents and providers on the \nimportance of immunizing our young children by age two. I have paid \nclose attention to CDC's immunization program ever since I came to the \nSenate, and over the past five years under Dr. Satcher's leadership, \nour nation has achieved the highest immunization levels and the lowest \nrates of childhood disease in our country's recorded history. What \nparent in the United States wouldn't take great pride in that \nachievement? What Senator would not applaud Dr. Satcher for the role he \nhas played in eradicating polio from the Western Hemisphere? Who would \nnot applaud Dr. Satcher's efforts to eliminate polio in Africa? The \nelimination of polio in the United States alone saves the taxpayers of \nthis country $250 million a year. He had whooping cough when he was a \nchild. It made an indelible impression on him, and it was the reason he \nwent into medicine.\n  So when I think of the many conversations and meetings I have had \nwith Dr. Satcher in my office, he is always at the highest professional \nlevel. I have never heard him utter a statement that didn't reflect \ncredit on him personally and didn't reflect credit on his total \ncommitment to the health of the people of the United States. What in \nthe name of God else do you want--would we reject a man who came up \nfrom nothing to become one of the preeminent medical people in this \ncountry simply because we disagree with him on one or two things?\n  I notice people who do not want Washington telling them what to do \noften want Washington to tell the rest of the country what to do. If an \natheist invented a cure for cancer, would you refuse to take it because \nhe was an atheist? Of course you wouldn't.\n  That is the kind of logic we are confronted with here because you may \ndisagree on a policy that really is not a policy. You want to deprive \nthis man of the post that the President nominated him for. And what did \nhe say in answer to a letter from Senator Frist from Tennessee? What \ndid he say to Senator Frist about the issue of partial-birth abortion? \nI see Senator Frist on the floor. He knows exactly what he said and it \nis this:\n\n       Let me say unequivocally that I have no intention of using \n     the position of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon \n     General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no \n     one's political agenda, and I want to use the power of these \n     positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide \n     them. If confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a \n     message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which \n     I believe can help reduce the number of abortions in our \n     country.\n\n  Where can you find a more noble or professional statement than that?\n  I say to my colleagues: Let us not divide ourselves over an \nappointment of this importance and destroy a man who has devoted his \nentire life to the well-being of the children of this country as well \nas its adults.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are many reasons to support the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon General. An experienced \nphysician, Dr. Satcher has distinguished himself as the Chairman of the \nMorehouse School of Medicine, the President of the Meharry Medical \nCollege, and most recently as the Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC). In recognition of his achievements, Dr. \nSatcher recently received the Surgeon General's Medallion for \nsignificant and noteworthy contributions to the health of the nation.\n  Heading an agency with eleven major branches and responsibility for \npromoting health and preventing disease, injury and premature death is \nno easy task. Since 1993, Dr. Satcher has met the challenge with \ninitiative, poise and professionalism. Under his direction, the CDC has \nbeen instrumental in increasing childhood immunization rates, reducing \nvaccine-preventable childhood diseases, and improving national and \ninternational defenses against food-borne illnesses and infectious \ndiseases.\n  Under Dr. Satcher's leadership, the CDC has done its best to respond \nto the threat that infectious diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, \nAIDS and malaria pose to Americans and people everywhere. In 1994, the \nCDC introduced a strategy to improve early disease detection, \nsurveillance and outbreak containment worldwide. The CDC is also \ndeveloping and implementing new diagnostic tests and prevention \nguidelines, and providing training, equipment, and supplies for public \nhealth personnel and national and international institutions.\n  The U.S. has a central role to play in the international fight \nagainst infectious diseases. By providing $50 million to strengthen \nglobal surveillance and control of infectious diseases in the FY98 \nForeign Operations Appropriations Bill, Congress clearly indicated the \nurgent need for U.S. leadership in this area. As Surgeon General, Dr. \nSatcher would be able to bring together U.S. agencies such as the CDC, \nthe Agency for International Development, the Department of Defense and \nthe National Institutes of Health in a united effort against emerging, \nre-emerging and endemic diseases. He would also provide an important \nlink to the World Health Organization and the health ministries of \nforeign governments.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that Dr. Satcher would bring the same \ndegree of dedication, commitment, and vision to the position of Surgeon \nGeneral that he has to the CDC. If Dr. Satcher is confirmed, and I hope \nhe is, I look forward to working with him in the fight against \ninfectious diseases.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to go into morning \nbusiness for a period of 45 minutes, that my comments be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record, and that Senator Enzi's comments \nfollow my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard and Mr. Enzi pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1608 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher to the positions of Surgeon General and \nAssistant Secretary for Health.\n  I commend the president for selecting him to serve as a voice for the \nNation's public health needs and goals.\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\nDr. Satcher is a renowned physician, scholar and public health leader. \nDuring his tenure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nthe nation saw a dramatic increase in childhood immunization rates as \nwell as an increased capacity to respond to and detect emerging \ninfectious diseases. In addition, while under Dr. Satcher's leadership, \nthe CDC placed a significant emphasis on prevention programs, including \nefforts to screen low-income women for breast and cervical cancer. I \nalso applaud his quest to protect the health of our nation's children \nby supporting research into prevention of deaths and injuries from gun \ninjuries.\n  Dr. Satcher, as has been noted on numerous occasions, is a remarkable \nindividual of distinguished accomplishment. This Nation will be richer \nand better off were he to fill the job of Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary of Health.\n  I am distressed that there are some who want to make another issue of \nDr. Satcher's nomination. There are those who would argue that there is \nno need for a position of Surgeon General. That has been raised in the \npast. I think that is a legitimate debate, although I happen to believe \nthat having an Office of Surgeon General has been tremendously valuable \nto this country, having someone who can speak on behalf of the Nation \nin a clear voice about issues of national concern. No one better \nepitomized that role than Dr. C. Everett Koop, who led the Nation on \nnumerous health care issues over the years, speaking very clearly. To \nthis day he plays a very important role as a former Surgeon General of \nthe United States.\n  The position of Surgeon General has been vacant since December of \n1994. We are now going to the fourth year not having filled this \nposition. That is inexcusable. This Nation deserves to have a Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  As I said a while ago, if there are those who want to eliminate the \nposition altogether, then offer legislation that will do that. But we \nhave a position that needs to be filled, a position that can play an \nimportant role, as shown by various Surgeons General over the years, \nleading this Nation in the debate on health care issues. So I hope \nwithin the coming days here we can complete this nomination process and \nsend it to the President and allow Dr. Satcher to assume the job of \nSurgeon General and Assistant Secretary for health.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I have a bill I want to \nintroduce. I inquire as to whether or not it would be permissible for \nme to do so in this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be permitted to do so should \nthe Senate, by unanimous consent, consent to that act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Bingaman pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 1610 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, may I inquire as to the state of the \nproceedings? What is the position of the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in executive session and is \nconsidering the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General and \nAssistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to continue my debate with respect to the nomination of Dr. \nDavid Satcher, a nomination for two positions, that of U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, very much.\n  Madam President, there has been some considerable discussion today \nsurrounding the ethics of the Centers for Disease Control and the \nstudies that they have conducted regarding the transmission of AIDS \nfrom mothers to newborns--those studies having been conducted not here \nin the United States, but having been conducted in the underdeveloped \ncountries of the world.\n  These studies were conducted and have continued to be undertaken \nunder the auspices of the Centers for Disease Control, under their \nauthority and during the time which Dr. Satcher has had responsibility \nfor the Centers for Disease Control.\n  It is troublesome to me that a number of these studies have not \nreally provided the same kind of guarantee in terms of the care which \nwould be accorded to individuals if those individuals participating in \nthe study were in the United States. Basically what I am saying is that \nthe studies were conducted in such a way that they would probably be \nunacceptable in the United States of America.\n\n  A disregard for individuals who participate in clinical trials or \nmedical studies is, unfortunately, something that we have had problems \nwith before. Not long ago, the United States apologized to a number of \nindividuals who are part of what was called the Tuskegee experiment \nbecause the participants in the study had simply been left without \ntreatment as doctors watched the progression of the disease.\n  I think the Nation's conscience was shocked as a result of the fact \nthose conducting the experiment were interested in scientific data that \ncould be developed by watching people suffer and die. It was \ntroublesome that we would somehow decide we could allow people to have \nbeen involved in that kind of experiment. When we discovered the nature \nof the Tuskegee experiment, the country was shocked and saddened by \nwhat had occurred.\n  What was even perhaps more shocking is that after we had been through \nall the problems in assessing the difficulties of Tuskegee, there were \nrevelations about these studies in Africa. The Boston Globe, on the \n18th day of May of 1997, published an article entitled ``An apology is \nnot enough.'' The article stated that ``Even as the President laments \nthe Tuskegee experiment, the United States is conducting questionable \nresearch in Africa.'' This particular article--while it does not \npurport to say that the African research is similar in every respect to \nthe Tuskegee situation, did point out that there are some real problems \nwith what is being done in Africa. One of the problems is that in \nAfrica individuals who are a part of the study are not given the best \nknown medical help. They are not being accorded medical treatment which \nwould be required by ethical standards. They were given, however, sugar \npills or placebos in the face of a virtually always fatal virus. They \nwere given capsules which had no real medicinal value.\n  This was so shocking to the medical community and individuals who \ncared about medical ethics that it found its way into the editorial \npages of the Massachusetts Medical Society's journal, the New England \nJournal of Medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine is the most \nwidely respected medical journal in the world. Virtually no major \nannouncements of medical import are made in the United States without \nappearing in the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England \nJournal of Medicine is prudent with regard to what it publishes. The \nJournal does not publish medical findings just because they have \nscientific value. It is alert to the dangers of science which would \ncause people to set aside ethics.\n  For instance, in an editorial of the Journal's, the publication \nstates clearly that reports of unethical research will not be \npublished, regardless of their scientific merit. You could have reports \nthat would be very valuable scientifically, but they could be \nunethical. You could probably learn some things by watching people die \nwithout treatment, and that data would be valuable scientifically. As a \nmatter of fact, that is what happened in the Tuskegee setting. But it \nwas clear that kind of experiment was wrong and improper. This medical \njournal takes a stand against that. It says it refuses to publish \nreports, even if they are scientifically meritorious, if those reports \nare the result of unethical research.\n  Now, the research which was conducted in Africa was controversial for \na couple of reasons. The first point of contention was the use of the \nplacebo, or the sugar pill that doesn't have medicine, as part of the \nstudy. The New\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nEngland Journal of Medicine indicates clearly, ``Only when there is no \nknown effective treatment is it ethical to compare a potential new \ntreatment with a placebo.'' In other words, if you know that you can do \nabsolutely nothing, there is no known way to cure something, no known \nway to impair or stop the progress of a disease, then you are allowed \nto try something and measure it against nothing--which is basically the \nplacebo. But when you know, in fact, that there is something that \nworks, it is unethical, according to the New England Journal of \nMedicine, to use a placebo against some other proposed remedy.\n\n  I think that is the reason the New England Journal of Medicine took \nexception with the CDC studies, particularly as it related to the Ivory \nCoast. Prior to the time of these studies it was pretty clear that a \nregimen had been developed which had been effective in substantial \nmeasure in curtailing the transmission of the HIV virus from women to \ntheir children. As a matter of fact, the AZT treatment is called the \nAZT 076 regimen. That regimen has had pretty good results. Normally in \nnewborns, 25 percent of those that are born to mothers with HIV carry \nthe HIV virus themselves. But the studies indicated that if you \nfollowed the AZT regimen, the AZT 076 regimen, instead of having 25 \npercent, or 1 out of every 4 children emerge with the HIV virus, that \nyou could cut it down to 8 percent. So from one-quarter of all the \nbabies, 1 out of every 4 babies, to 1 out of every 12 babies. Now that \nis a substantial improvement. It is a clear demonstration, accepted by \nmedical authorities, that it is a regimen of treatment that has \npromise, it is effective, and it is worth doing.\n  So when you go to Africa to conduct a study, to do it ethically, \naccording to the New England Journal of Medicine, it would require that \nindividuals in the study compare proposed new treatments not with a \nplacebo, but since there is a known effective treatment, new treatments \nwould have to be compared against the known effective treatment.\n  I quote from the New England Journal of Medicine: ``Only when there \nis no known effective treatment is it ethical to compare a potential \nnew treatment with a placebo.'' Now, what we have in the studies in \nAfrica is the comparison of a known effective treatment with a placebo. \nThis is not appropriate. Only when there is no known effective \ntreatment is it ethical to compare a potential new treatment with a \nplacebo.\n  In reaching this conclusion--this isn't just the opinion of the \neditorialists at the New England Journal of Medicine. They cite the \nDeclaration of Helsinki of the World Health Organization as providing \nwhat is widely regarded as the fundamental guiding principles of \nresearch involving human subjects. In research on man, they say, ``The \ninterests of science and society should never take precedence over \nconsiderations related to the well-being of the subject,'' and ``In any \nmedical study, every patient, including those of the control group, if \nany, should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic \nmethod.''\n  It is pretty clear that the best, proven diagnostic and therapeutic \nmethod is not the placebo, not the sugar pill. The best, proven \ntherapeutic and diagnostic method is the 076 regimen, which cut the \ntransmission rates from 1 out of every 4 to 1 out of every 12 infants \ninfected with HIV. That is a substantial cut. I think it is always \nimportant for us to understand that we are talking about a nearly \nalways fatal virus. We are not talking about a situation where maybe a \nfew more people are threatened. The HIV virus, as it ultimately \ndevelops into a condition known as AIDS, is a final and fatal \ncondition. So I don't think it behooves us to take it lightly. As a \nmatter of fact, medical authorities have not taken it lightly.\n  I will just point out that even those individuals who were involved \nin the very discovery of AIDS and the transmission of AIDS in the birth \nprocess do not take it lightly. As a matter of fact, studies of \nintensive treatment of AZT ended in 1994, just as soon as it was shown \nthat the drug sharply reduced HIV transmission to infants. Four years \nago, we made it clear that the use of the placebo was over. You would \nnot be doing placebo-based tests any longer, because it had been \ndemonstrated that the drug sharply reduced transmission of the virus \nfrom mothers to their babies. That is from the New York Times article, \n``AIDS Research in Africa; Juggling Risks and Hopes.''\n  The Third World studies, however, were in progress in 1995. They \ncontinue to be in progress. Apparently, they were ongoing as of late \nJanuary. Now, the CDC provided funding for the studies on the Ivory \nCoast. The study was simply designed to determine whether a new course \nof AZT--a short course, as opposed to the 076 regimen--whether that new \nshort course would have an impact of curtailing the virus in the \nchildren born to HIV-infected mothers. As we indicated before, the 076 \ncourse cuts transmission of HIV from 25 percent of all infants down to \n8 percent of all infants, or approximately a two-thirds reduction. The \nstudies were designed to determine if a smaller dose of AZT would have \nany impact.\n  CDC decided to use a technique known as the placebo controlled study, \nand it was their methodology of choice. Now it seems to me that we have \na clear problem here, and that is that we have an ethical standard for \na medical test and trial that says you don't use placebos when there \nare effective known treatments. You have had a clearly established \ntreatment since 1994, recognized in the United States as a treatment \nthat is effective in reducing the incidence of HIV in new-born infants \nby two-thirds.\n  One of the reasons that the CDC chose to move forward with the \nplacebo-based trials is that the trials are well understood to be very \ninformative scientifically. Those who have come to the floor of the \nSenate on repeated occasions during the day have talked about how \nwonderful this was to get this information. I really don't want to get \ninto a big argument about whether or not you can get good scientific \ndata in trials where you let people die because you give them sugar \nwater or sugar pills instead of real medicine. I think it is very \nlikely that you can get good scientific data. I think it is very likely \nthat the outcomes of your tests will be scientifically valid. You can \nprove that certain kinds of therapies are better than sugar and water. \nBut we are not here just to find out what could be scientifically \nadvantageous. I think it is important that we remind ourselves of that.\n  There were scientists who thought they learned a lot from the \nTuskegee studies. The mere existence of advantageous or helpful data at \nthe end of a test or the mere facility with which scientific data can \nbe collected doesn't really determine what the standard should be for \nus. The standard should be that we have our tests conducted in a way \nthat is consistent with the ethical standards and with the requirements \nthat have not only been developed for the United States, but are \nrecognized in the international community.\n  Among the guidelines in the international community for tests that \nare clinical and designed to inform our health care procedures is a \nguideline that says you should never test in a culture what the culture \nis totally unlikely to be able to implement. In other words, one \nculture is not allowed to go to another culture that isn't ever going \nto be able to use the therapy and say, ``We are going to use you as \nguinea pigs, we don't want to endure this on our own.''\n\n  There is another standard that is relevant, whether we are talking \nabout Helsinki or a number of the other codes. We have the Helsinki \nDeclaration; the Nuremberg Protocols; the WHO Guidelines developed in \nGeneva--a variety of guidelines. Another one of these ethical standards \nis that you should not test for a therapy in a country that can \nprobably never use it. And you should not test where the cost of using \na therapy will make it virtually inaccessible.\n  That is one of the reasons that I think individuals want to support \nwhat was done by the Centers for Disease Control in this situation. \nThey want to say, well, the 076 regimen is very expensive, therefore, \nit could not be part of a test to discover a less expensive regimen. \nIt's important to understand that it is the expense of the outcome, the \ntherapy that you are seeking to develop that should define whether or \nnot a country or a society would be able to use it. It's not the \nexpense of conducting the test that is the key issue, but\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\nthe expense of using the therapy after the test is over. Unless the \nproponents of these tests want to argue that they were really hoping \nthat sugar pills, which are very cheap, would be the ultimate therapy, \nthey have to say that the ultimate therapy they were proposing is \napproximately the $50 therapy that CDC was experimenting with, which \nwas the short course, or more confined schedule of administering AZT. \nThat is a $50 dose. The 076 regimen, already proven effective, is an \n$800 dose. There is a big difference.\n  The point I make is that what you are seeking to test in the country \nis not the $800 dose. That has already been established. That was \nestablished in the United States, and it was established in France. \nWhat you are seeking to test is not the placebo. We all know that is \nuseless and worthless. You don't even have to be a medical \npractitioner. That is understood. What you are testing is the $50 dose. \nAnd so you have to ask yourself the question, is the $50 dose something \nthat might someday be available and utilized there? If it is, that is \nthe test. It doesn't change the need to treat people humanely in \nseeking to provide a basis for using that $50 test.\n  So what we really have here is a question of whether or not the \nUnited States Centers for Disease Control treated individuals in Africa \nwith the same kind of respect that they would have treated individuals \nin the United States. The real question is whether or not they followed \nthe guidelines which require us to treat individuals as distinct and \ndifferent from the way we would treat, say, laboratory animals where we \nmight disregard their health and safety.\n\n  Of course, the New England Journal of Medicine says when effective \ntreatment exists a placebo may not be used, and it cites the \nDeclaration of Helsinki saying that any medical study of patients, \nincluding those of a control group, should be assured of the best \nproven diagnostic and therapeutic method.\n  I don't think there is any other way of saying it. No matter how thin \nyou slice this, it is still baloney. It is clear that the placebo is \nnot the best therapeutic method. It simply cannot be categorized as the \nbest therapeutic method, which is the method, according to the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine, that participants in the study are \nrequired to have.\n  This afternoon I took the time to go through the assurance of \nprotection document entered into by the Ivory Coast and the CDC that \nlays out the guidelines, principles, and procedures that the parties \nagree to follow in the research. I believe that in the assurance of \nprotection document mention was made of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n  In biomedical research, involving human subjects and international \nethical guidelines for them, the protection document states that \nresearch must be conducted in accordance with established international \nstandards for protection of human subjects--for example, the \nDeclaration of Helsinki, or CIOMS. Those are examples. But it says we \nmust live in accordance with those established international standards.\n  The signature page for the relevant officials says that the research \nwill be conducted in accordance with the established international \nstandards for the protection of human subjects.\n  It is kind of interesting that the assurance of protection was not \nobtained until July of 1997, according to Dr. Satcher's written \nresponses to questions from the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. We were dealing with these individuals in the Ivory Coast in \na way which did not even provide them with a guarantee of the \nprotections included in the Declaration of Helsinki and other relevant \ninternational guidelines. We did not see the guarantees until we had \narticles appearing in major newspapers in the United States that \ncriticized the African studies--articles which compared them to the \nTuskegee experiment.\n  Dr. Satcher has claimed that the studies complied with all the rules. \nIn the New England Journal of Medicine article with Dr. Harold Varmus \nof the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Satcher asserts that the NIH \nand CDC support trials have undergone a rigorous process of ethical \nreview, including not only the participation of the public health and \nscientific communities in developing countries where the trials are \nbeing performed but also the application of the U.S. rules for the \nprotection of human research subjects by relevant institutional review \nboards.\n  Dr. Satcher also relies on World Health Organization guidelines \ndeveloped in Geneva in 1994 as authority for the studies. He said that \nthe CDC chose to use a placebo controlled study because such an \napproach has been recommended by a WHO conference of international \nexperts, including those from many developing countries.\n  This World Health Organization conference to which Dr. Satcher refers \ntook place in Geneva in June of 1994. Marcia Angell and Michael Grodin \nof Boston University criticized the conference recommendation, saying \nthat the CDC and the researchers involved developed the recommendations \nsimply to justify their desire to conduct the AZT trials in Third World \ncountries.\n  I would like to review some of the international guidelines. It is \npretty clear that people around the country and around the world \nunderstand that you shouldn't use placebos when there is an effective \ntreatment, particularly if you are conducting a trial that includes \nvictims of deadly viruses.\n  Again, I mentioned that Dr. Marcia Angell said in the New England \nJournal of Medicine that only when there is no known effect or \ntreatment is it applicable to compare a potential new treatment with a \nplacebo.\n  The director of Harvard's Human Subjects Committee has stated that \nuse of placebos would be unethical in such cases. The New England \nJournal of Medicine reports that in 1994 a researcher at the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health applied for NIH funding for an equivalency \nstudy in Thailand in which three shorter AZT regimens were to be \ncompared with the regimen similar to the 076 regimen. The journal \nindicates that the NIH study section pressured the researcher and his \ninstitution to conduct a placebo trial, which prompted the director of \nHarvard's Human Subjects Committee to reply in a letter. The conduct of \na placebo controlled trial for AZT in pregnant women in Thailand would \nbe unethical and unacceptable since an active controlled trial is \nfeasible.\n  So here we have medical authorities resisting efforts by our \nGovernment to accept and conduct a trial which is ethically \nsubstandard. You have them saying it is unethical; it is unacceptable \nbecause there are actively controlled trials that are feasible. \nBasically this is a reflection for which we can be grateful in the \nmedical community. We don't use sugar pills when we have known capacity \nfor treatment.\n  I could go through the guidelines as I did this afternoon. I do not \nwant to do this. The point is the simple ethics of the matter come down \nto this: If there is a known treatment which is a therapeutic treatment \nit can make a difference. It is unethical instead of giving patients \nthat treatment to provide them with sugar pills, or with placebos. The \nknown treatment is well established. It is well documented in the \nmedical literature. Its availability makes impossible the use of \nplacebo studies in the United States in this kind of setting, and to \necho the statements of many experts, I think it should make it \nimpossible in Africa as well.\n  Some of those who have commended the unethical studies overseen by \nDr. Satcher in the Centers for Disease Control have indicated that \nthese are poor people and they will never be able to afford the 076 \nhigh-dosage, long-schedule regimen of AZT.\n  The truth of the matter is this was a study to experiment with lower \ndoses, shorter schedules, and could have been conducted in a manner \nconsistent with medical ethics by using as a control group the 076 \nregimen. There are medical authorities that will provide testimony to \nthat extent.\n  The truth of the matter is that we would not do in the United States \nwhat we did in Africa. And I think that is an important point.\n  Dr. George Annas, a bioethicist and professor of health law at Boston \nUniversity, and health law professor Michael Grodin have criticized the \nAIDS work in Africa not only on the basis of the placebo but they said \nthat these studies with lower ethical standards were imposed on a \npopulation that will never receive the fruits of the research.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\n  It seems to me that there are so many ethical questions surrounding \nthis particular AZT trial that demand answers that we should look \ncarefully at this study.\n  One of the answers of individuals who have commended these tests is \nthat ``The individuals knew what was happening''--that participants had \ngiven their informed consent.\n  I will concede that there is virtually always an ironclad, high \nstandard of informed consent that is required for medical trials and \nexperimentation to take place, and virtually every one of the \nprotocols--whether it is the Helsinki Declaration, the Council of \nInternational Organizations of Medical Sciences, the Nuremberg Code, or \nany number of other CDC or Federal regulatory items--they almost all \nrequire that participants give their informed consent. Those who would \ndefend these AZT trials seem to want to emphasize that since there was \ninformed consent, we can overlook breaches in the ethics that might \nhave taken place in the design of the studies and in the implementation \nof the trials.\n  First of all, the presence of informed consent does not authorize \nunethical activity. The mere fact that people would agree to engage in \nunethical activities and unethical trials with our Government or with \nagencies of our Government does not mean that our Government can or \nshould do that. We have standards that require a certain respect for \nhuman beings and that do not allow our health organizations to treat \nthem as experimental subjects. Whether or not there is consent does not \nobviate or does not alleviate or does not mitigate the demand of our \nethical codes for treating people like human beings and not \nexperimental subjects.\n  But there still is a real question about the level of the so-called \nconsent that was given. This afternoon I had the opportunity to refer \nto an article in the New York Times which talked about a woman who, 5 \nminutes after she was informed for the first time that she carried the \nHIV virus, still shaken by the news, was walked through the details of \nthe so-called trials and tests, as well as given general advice about \nwhat she should do to help herself and her baby. In less than 5 minutes \nshe was given a quick explanation of what a placebo was. The session \nwas over and this unemployed, illiterate individual had agreed to take \nthe test. Asked what had persuaded her to do so, she said, ``The \nmedical care they're promising me.''\n  Here is a situation where this is a mockery of informed consent. \nPeople who don't even know what a placebo is agreeing to participate in \na medical study where they have a 50-50 chance of getting the placebo, \na sugar pill.\n  The New York Times article talked about another individual. One of \nthe most highly educated women in the test spoke to a reporter. She was \na 31-year-old single mother with a degree in law who gave her name only \nas ``X.'' She said she had never been made to understand that the \nmedicine being tested, AZT, was already known to stop transmission of \nthe virus during pregnancies. One of the fundamentals of informed \nconsent is helping people understand what kind of therapeutic, known \ncures or known treatments exist, and she wasn't even told about that. \n``I am not sure that I understand all this so well,'' she said, ``but \nthere were some medicines that they said might protect the child, and \nthey wanted to follow the evolution of my pregnancy and the \neffectiveness of the treatment.''\n  People have talked about the situation of following the evolution of \nthe pregnancy and the effectiveness of treatment. We have seen \nsituations where we have followed the evolution of disease and the \neffectiveness of nontreatment and for half the people in this study we \nare talking about the effectiveness of nontreatment. There is no \nevidence in terms of this woman's testimony that she would have gotten \nreal treatment rather than a sugar pill.\n  ``Pressed further, X, like other mothers, said that she had not been \ntold the results of the tests on her 1-year-old. Asked how she would \nfeel if she learned tomorrow she received a placebo when proven \ntreatment existed, X's tone changed abruptly,'' according to the New \nYork times. ``I would say quite simply that that was an injustice,'' \nshe said.\n  Well, it appears to me she has a good understanding of ethics if she \ndoes not have a good understanding of medicine. She understands that to \nprovide individuals with a placebo, with a fake pill, and not to tell \nthem that there is a real treatment that is available, would be an \ninjustice. I could not agree more.\n  One of the important concepts about medical ethics is that you should \nonly use treatments that host countries could reasonably be expected to \nuse. As I mentioned earlier, those who support the studies say that we \ncould not use the 076 regimen because it was too expensive. We could \nuse the $50 treatments. However, that doesn't comport with their \nstatistics which also state that the average expenditure for health \ncare is $5. If the per capita spending in these countries is often less \nthan $10 per person, as the CDC says, how can these countries afford \neven the $50 treatment.\n  Dr. George Annas, whom I mentioned, from Boston University, was \npublicly critical of the AIDS studies on the grounds that ``they were \nbeing carried out with lower standards in a population who will never \nreceive the fruits of the research.''\n  These same authors talk about the research being largely unrelated to \nthe potential for treatment in these countries. ``No research in \ndeveloping countries''--and I am quoting again from these same two \nauthors, Dr. George Annas and Michael Grodin of Boston University--``No \nresearch in developing countries is ethically justified unless the \ntreatment developed or proven effective will actually be made available \nto the population. And the best CDC can say about its new AZT regimens, \nif they work, is that they would be a far more feasible option for the \ndeveloping world.''\n  More feasible, yes, but would they be attainable? No evidence of the \nfact they would be attainable. I resume quoting. ``This is a far cry \nfrom assuring that they will actually be made available.'' And then \nthey say, ``In the absence of such assurance, the African women and \ntheir children are being used purely as guinea pigs. They will be \nsubjected to the intrusions and risks of research without any hope, \nmuch less any expectation, that they or their communities can ever \nbenefit from the studies.''\n  The problem of treating individuals as experimental subjects is a \nserious problem. It is an ethical problem. And it is one which was so \nproblematic that it caused the New England Journal of Medicine and a \nvariety of other scholars to say that this is unacceptable.\n  As we are debating whether or not we have a nomination for a Surgeon \nGeneral that should be the doctor for America's families, the leader in \nterms of what America should be and can be, I think the ethics of the \nresearch conducted at his specific direction and under his control are \nimportant and legitimate concerns.\n  I am saddened that Dr. Satcher chose to get involved in \nexperimentation in Africa which would have been unacceptable here, \nwhich medical ethicists have indicated could not have been done here, \nwhich would have occasioned an outcry from the public and from \nauthorities here, but which he thought could be done in Africa because \nthese individuals have a different standard of living and that local \nconditions are different than ours. The situation of ethics is not \nsomething that relates to the economic standing of people, and it \nshould not be related to a capacity on the part of a nation to transfer \nexperimentation which it would not allow in its own country to be \nundertaken in another country.\n  I believe America deserves the highest and best when it comes to \nethics. I believe we deserve a Surgeon General who would criticize \nrather than implement this kind of anemia in the ethical world. I \nbelieve we deserve a Surgeon General who understands that human beings, \nregardless of their wealth, social station, national origin or \ncitizenship, deserve to be treated as human beings and not as \nlaboratory experiments. I regret that too often in Washington we have \ncome to the place of thinking that if we can get a big value, or if \nthere is a lot of scientific knowledge to be gained, we can disregard \nethics--that if the payoff is big enough, and particularly if the price \nto be paid is not in our own families, that we can look away from the \nethics.\n  I really don't think that ethics and integrity are divisible. Just \nlike we\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nshould be one Nation, indivisible, I think we should have one ethical \nstandard that is indivisible, and I think it should be a high one. I \nthink America deserves better than a Surgeon General who is willing to \nadjust on a relative scale of values the ethics that relate to those in \nanother setting as compared to individuals who would be here in the \nUnited States. It is time for us to demand a Surgeon General who will \nappeal to the better angels of our nature, not bow to our basest \ndesires.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I would indicate the African AZT trials and \nthe ethical problems surrounding them are just one aspect of the \nserious difficulties I have with this nomination, difficulties that \nlead me to oppose this nomination. This nominee endorses the practice \nof partial-birth abortion. This nominee has indicated a willingness to \nfund studies for the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts. He \nhas indicated a willingness to fund conferences to promote the \ndistribution of clean needles to drug addicts, to put the Government in \nthe business of facilitating the administration of illegal drugs.\n  He has reserved, in a technical statement, that he had never provided \nfunding for a Government program to provide clean needles to addicts. \nBut he has provided funding for Government studies and he has provided \nfunding for other programs to promote the distribution of such needles. \nHe has indicated that if he could get the right result from the studies \nhe would be willing to have a program that distributed clean needles. \nIt may be true that clean needles might help some people avoid illness, \nbut frankly I don't know that we should be in the business of assisting \nindividuals in the administration of IV drugs merely because there \nwould be some ``health benefit'' in a discrete situation where the \nGovernment provided a sterile instrument for the administration of \nillicit substances.\n  Individuals have come to this floor also indicating that they don't \nbelieve firearms are a disease. As you know, and I think as Senator \nCraig of Idaho indicated pretty clearly, the Centers for Disease \nControl has sought to limit or otherwise conduct studies which might be \nused in seeking to limit the availability or eligibility of people to \nown firearms in this country because they say that firearms are \ndangerous to a person's health. Frankly, the provision that guarantees \nthe right of individuals to bear arms in America is the second \namendment to the Constitution of the United States and I don't believe \nthat the Bill of Rights is a disease. I think if we have resources that \nneed to be devoted in our culture to the abatement and mitigation of \ndiseases, we ought to deploy those resources to fight diseases and not \nto try and build a case for depriving Americans of a right guaranteed \nthem by the Bill of Rights.\n  In all of these settings the cumulative effect of this candidate, \nthis nominee of the President, shows us that we are not being offered \nthe kind of Surgeon General to lead the American people in ways that I \nthink are appropriate and consistent with the ambitions and aspirations \nof Americans. For these reasons--in addition to my focus today on the \nethical deficiencies of the African AIDS studies--I think this nominee \nshould be defeated.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I speak here \nin the U.S. Senate this evening. I share a story of a wonderful and \ntalented young woman, Miss Jenny Lynn Stiles Hudson, whose life was \nlost tragically in an automobile accident a week ago today, on January \n28.\n  Jenny was only 21 years old at the time of her death and had just \nbegun a career as my deputy director for eastern Washington. While \nJenny was with the Gorton organization only for a few short weeks, she \nhad already demonstrated the talents to be a valuable member of my \norganization.\n  But Jenny Hudson will not be remembered for being a Gorton staffer. \nRather, she will be remembered as an amazing and dynamic young woman \nwho accomplished so much in her 21 years and who touched the lives of \nall around her.\n  Jenny grew up in Lyman and Hamilton, in rural Skagit County, north of \nSeattle. She was a joy and a delight to her family and a participant in \nalmost all of the school and community activities offered to her in \nthat rural setting.\n  Jenny graduated from Washington State University only in December of \nlast year. At the university she was active in the Block and Bridle \nClub, the Livestock Judging Team, the Washington Cattlemen's \nAssociation, all while raising and showing Limousin beef cattle \nthroughout the State of Washington.\n  Jenny enjoyed swimming and singing. At the same time, she maintained \na strong belief in God, working as the youth director of her local \nchurch.\n  Jenny Hudson will be missed by all who knew her. In her short 21 \nyears, Jenny inspired those around her with her vibrant outlook on \nlife, her ambition and her many accomplishments. An early death reminds \nus of the sanctity and the fragility of life. Let the lesson of Jenny \nHudson's remarkable life be no less deep.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Jenny's parents, to her husband of \njust 6 months, Tipton, and to her countless friends and relatives as \nthey deal with this difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, as he has every day taken \nthe floor regarding the need for the U.S. Senate to address S. 1173, a \nbill that I named the ISTEA 2 authorization bill, since it came through \nmy subcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I joined with Senator Byrd, the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, \nand the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, who is the ranking \nmember on my subcommittee and the full committee, in an amendment which \nwill ensure that a greater amount of funds will go to the Nation's \ninfrastructure of highways.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Byrd, the four of us on this \nparticular amendment have been talking to a number of Senators. We are \nvery pleased to announce that we are up to 52 cosponsors. I met earlier \ntoday with a group of Governors who have an organization termed \n``trust,'' and they have visited the Nation's Capitol to speak \nparticularly with Senators on the urgency of addressing this bill and \npassing the needed legislation so funds can flow to the new \nconstruction programs for this calendar year.\n  The most fervent appeals for prompt consideration of this bill \nunderstandably come from the States in the northern tier of the United \nStates of America, because they have a very short season within which \nto do the needed construction because of the severity of the weather. \nThe distinguished Presiding Officer has some specific knowledge about \nthe needs based\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\non his own experience in this field. We have talked about it many \ntimes. It is my understanding he is also a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm-\nWarner-Baucus amendment.\n  The Senate has very few legislative days comparatively this session, \nperhaps as few as 100, given that we, by necessity, must leave early in \nthe fall given the elections this year, and, therefore, it would be my \nhope that the leadership could judge this period within the next few \nweeks as a suitable time within which to bring up this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  It had been my hope and understanding based on commitments made last \nfall that the Senate would be debating this bill at this time.\n  I want to share with my Senate colleagues my strong concerns about \nthe impacts of a prolonged delay in considering this bill on our state \ntransportation partners and on employment in many industries engaged in \nhighway and bridge construction activities.\n  This important legislation to reauthorize our nation's surface \ntransportation programs was reported unanimously from the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works on October 1, 1997.\n  We all know of the difficulties that delayed consideration of this \nbill last October. Because of this, a short-term extension of ISTEA was \nenacted to provide a modest amount of funding to our states to keep our \nsafety, highway construction and transit programs going.\n  Many expressed reservations about the wisdom of providing a brief \nextension of ISTEA funds for fear that Congress would not promptly \nconsider the full reauthorization bill early this session. Regrettably, \nthose concerns appear to be coming true.\n  Mr. President, since October 1, our states have been struggling to \nmanage their safety, highway and transit programs on a temporary, stop-\ngap basis. The ISTEA Extension Act provided only approximately six-\nmonths worth of funds--enough to last from October to this March. So, \nin approximately 7 weeks, our states will have exhausted the funds \nreleased in the short-term ISTEA Extension bill.\n  I want to be sure that my colleagues also understand the impacts of \nthe May 1st deadline provided in the ISTEA Extension bill. That \nprovision prohibits states from spending any federal highway dollars \nafter May 1st. So, states who want to prudently manage their federal \ndollars are prohibited from stretching them out to last during the \nsummer construction season.\n  During consideration of the short-term extension bill last October, \nthis May 1st limitation was viewed as a way to ensure that all states \nwould be in a similar position--absent passage of a new surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill.\n  It was my view that based on the assurances that S. 1173, the ISTEA \nII reauthorization bill, would be the first order of business this \nsession, the May 1st deadline seemed appropriate.\n  If the Senate does not turn to consideration of this critical \nlegislation until after the Budget Resolution, as some of my colleagues \nare requesting, the entire highway construction season for many states \nis in jeopardy.\n  Waiting for the completion of the Budget Resolution before proceeding \nto ISTEA is an irresponsible course of action, especially since the \nestimated completion of the Budget Resolution varies greatly.\n  Mr. President, according to AASHTO, the Association of State \nSecretaries of Transportation, approximately 70 percent of all road and \nbridge construction, including critical maintenance work, occurs during \nthe peak summer months of June, July and August.\n  States must be able to plan today for that work to occur this summer. \nProjects must be advertised, contractors selected and bids awarded \nbefore projects are ready for construction. This process takes months \nto complete. Our states today are not proceeding with this planning \nbecause there is no certainty as to when new transportation funds will \nbe forthcoming.\n  We already know that many states are beginning to severely cut back \non their construction schedules.\n  For these reasons, I believe the Senate must move promptly to \nconsider this legislation. Time is slipping by and millions of jobs are \nhanging in the balance--awaiting our action.\n  These jobs are not just road builders and contractors, but thousands \nof suppliers of asphalt, stone, steel, and heavy manufacturing \nequipment. All work will be idle this summer unless we take action \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to note that delay in considering \nthis legislation not only impacts highway construction activity in our \nstates, the delay also puts our nation's safety and transit programs in \njeopardy.\n  Highway safety grant programs received only half a year funding in \nthe ISTEA extension bill. Without additional funds major safety \ninitiatives involving safety belt use, child seat use, drunk driving \nprevention and motor carrier safety programs will cease.\n  Mr. President, we must make every effort to ensure that these serious \ndisruptions in our nation's highway, safety and transit programs do not \noccur. Let's move forward today to consider legislation that was \nunanimously supported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I commend the senior Senator from \nVirginia for his very helpful remarks. I am a very strong believer that \nwe must take immediate action on ISTEA. I think it is critical for the \nNation, especially in my State, which as the Senator pointed out, those \nof us in the northern tier probably have about the shortest season, \nalong the State of Maine and the top of New Hampshire. So we are \ndesperate for action.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. I \nwish to add, it is not only the short season but the funding profile. \nIn a number of these States, the reserves are going to expire in that \nperiod of time. It is my judgment that we cannot pass an extension in \norder to allow them a period within which to have these expenditures \nbeyond May 1. So that is a second reason. I thank the Senator for his \nkind remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S373-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I voted in support of renaming \nWashington National Airport as the Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n  I am aware of the concerns about the need for local control over the \nairport. That's why I voted in favor of the Daschle Amendment that \nwould have given the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority the \nfinal say over renaming the airport. I have always been a strong \nsupporter of local control over National Airport.\n  However, in the end, I decided that the decision to rename National \nAirport should rise above party politics. My decision to support S. \n1575 was a personal one.\n  It's no secret that I didn't always agree with President Reagan's \npolicies. As a matter of fact, when it came to politics, President \nReagan and I disagreed quite often. However, Ronald Reagan and I shared \none important thing: our respect for the Presidency.\n  President Reagan devoted much of his life to serving the people of \nthis country--first as the Governor of California, then as our \nPresident. For that reason, he deserves our respect. He has mine. No \nmatter how different our political viewpoints were, I have always \nrespected President Reagan and always will.\n  In the twilight of his distinguished life, President Reagan and I \nhave something else in common. Like the President, my father suffered \nfrom Alzheimer's disease. I know how devastating this illness is and \nthe strength it requires from a family. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith Mrs. Reagan and all of the President's family. One thing I learned \nduring my father's illness was the importance of gestures. Renaming \nNational Airport as the Ronald Reagan National Airport is a gesture \nthat I support.\n  Today, like many of my fellow Senators, I saluted President Reagan. \nWhile I would have preferred that the decision was made by the Airports \nAuthority, I believe it is the end that matters, not the means. That is \nwhy I voted in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a fair amount of discussion \nin the last few days about the desire that many Members of the Senate \nhave that we be able to debate a highway bill here on the floor of the \nSenate. I want to add my voice to that of Senator Byrd and Senator \nGramm of Texas, Senator Baucus and so many others who have come to the \nfloor of the Senate and indicated the importance of the Senate \nproceeding ahead to deal with the highway bill.\n  I know that there are those who say, ``Well, the House of \nRepresentatives indicates it is not going to proceed on a highway bill \nuntil some point much later, perhaps following the decisions made on \nthe budget.'' There are those who say in the Senate that we ought not \nproceed until we deal with the budget.\n  The fact is, the highway bill was supposed to have been done last \nyear and was not. It ought to be done now. If we wait, we will move \nright to that May 1st drop-dead date on the highway short-term \nextension, and we will leave a good many States out there wondering \nwhat on Earth are they going to do with respect to their roads and \nbridges that need repair and rebuilding? Now, the highway bill does not \nsound very sexy or very interesting to some. But the investment in \nhighways is very important to this country. It represents an investment \nin infrastructure, it represents jobs and economic activity and \nopportunity. It is very, very important.\n  We take for granted so many things in this country, almost every day. \nBut go, for example, to Honduras and get on a road going south from \nTegucigalpa, and then think to yourself, as you drive along that road, \nwhat a different kind of infrastructure there exists in some countries \nversus what we have done in this country. We take roads for granted \nuntil we go elsewhere in the world and discover what we have done in \nthis country to make this a better place.\n  I come from a very, very rural area of America, a county the size of \nthe State of Rhode Island that has only 3,000 residents. I know from \nthat background how important roads have been to my hometown--the \nopportunity to move grain to market, the opportunity to get to a \nhospital, the opportunity to go back and forth for purposes of \ncommerce. It unlocks economic opportunities in all parts of our \ncountry. That is why building and maintaining the network of roads and \nbridges in our country has been so important.\n  One of the wonderful examples of progress in this country was when we \ndecided as a country that we were going to build an interstate highway \nsystem and it was going to be an American system, a national system. \nThey did not decide, you know, we should debate whether the interstate \nhighway should go through a State like North Dakota. They did not say, \n``Well, when it gets to Fargo, ND, on the Minnesota border, we have to \nstop there because there aren't enough people living between Fargo, ND, \nand Beach, ND, over by the Montana side to justify building four lanes \nof highway calling it an interstate.'' They don't say that.\n  They built an interstate highway all across this country to connect \nthis country even through remote rural areas because we knew it was a \ngood investment for this country.\n  Roads, infrastructure--it represents an awfully good investment for \nthis country. What has happened to us--and I am not laying partisan \nblame at all--what has happened to us is we have gotten embroiled in \ndebates about a lot of other issues here in the U.S. Senate when in \nfact it is our duty and responsibility to take up the issue of highway \nreauthorization and get it done.\n  We have a very short construction season in some of our northern \nStates. We have to know what kind of money is available, what kind of \ninvestment can be made, what kind of resources will be available to us \nto proceed and develop the plans needed to maintain our roads and \nbridges. I worry very much that what is going to happen to us is we \nwill come up to the May 1st deadline and not have done the highway bill \neven this year, when in fact it should have been done last year. So the \nquestion before the Senate is not whether we are going to do a highway \nbill. The question is when. And the question of when is very, very \nimportant.\n  I know the majority leader told the Senate that it would be the first \norder of business when we come back after the first of the year. I also \nknow there are others in the Senate who are tugging at his sleeves \nsaying, well, we do not want the highway bill to come up until after \nthe budget. So I know the majority leader wants to bring the highway \nbill up, but he has other Members suggesting that it be brought up \nlater.\n  I urge the majority leader, in the strongest terms possible, to heed \nthe call of Senator Gramm from Texas, Senator Byrd, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Chafee, so many other Senators who say this is a critically \nimportant issue. Let's do this. Let's do it together in a bipartisan \nway, and let's tell the Governors and the mayors and the legislators \nand the folks out in our country in the countries and the cities that \nhere is our highway bill, here are the resources, here is our \ninvestment in infrastructure. We are proud of it. We want to do it \nbecause it is good for the country. Let's do it soon.\n\n  So we will continue, in the coming days, to call for action on the \nhighway bill. It is not meant in any way as a partisan call, because \nthere are both Republicans and Democrats who feel very strongly that it \nought to be placed right at the top of the agenda right now. Some say \nthat when the highway bill comes to the floor, there will be 100 or 200 \namendments. Well, if there are 100 amendments, we could have gotten rid \nof a lot of them last week and this week. Let's work our way through it \nand pass this legislation and send a message to the folks out in the \ncountry that this Congress values the investment in infrastructure in \nour country, this Congress understands the importance of a highway \nprogram that provides certainty to the American people about our \ninvestment in infrastructure.\n  The National Council of State Legislatures, today, has written the \nmajority leader saying:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's State legislators, the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures reiterates its continuing, \n     firm support for immediate action on ISTEA reauthorization.\n\n  That is the highway bill.\n\n       It is crucial that a long-term reauthorization be enacted \n     before March 31.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The National Council of State Legislatures feels that \n     immediate action is essential. States face imminent \n     shortfalls in various program accounts at the end of March, \n     1998, shortfalls which can have serious ramifications for \n     State transportation programs. For example, contractual \n     relationships for future highway construction can be \n     compromised, transit agencies can be unable to apportion \n     funds without the passage of authorizing legislation, and \n     highway safety programs can come to a halt in certain States. \n     State legislators remain greatly concerned about the \n     possibility of these disruptions.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 1998.\n     Hon.

But, the words he spoke \n     and wrote made a powerful impact on this state.\n       Reese, of Jackson, died Sunday at age 65. For 28 years, he \n     worked for United Press International (UPI), covering some of \n     the biggest stories of the civil rights era here.\n       Since 1985, he provided the calming voice that was the \n     bridge between the fractious media and sea of egos that is \n     the Legislature, serving as House public relations officer.\n       He was as calm, thoughtful and informative during the heat \n     of a legislative battle as he was during those thorny times \n     in the '60s when chaos seemed to reign supreme.\n       Reese had a soft, quiet voice, filled with humor and \n     respect for all he met and lending reason in times of \n     turmoil. But, his impact was thunderous. His integrity was \n     unimpeachable, his reputation solid, his trust sure.\n       Reese is to be buried today.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending January 30, the U.S. imported 6,811,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 329,000 barrels fewer than the 7,140,000 \nimported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on \nforeign oil for 51.7 percent of their needs last week, and there are no \nsigns that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, \nthe United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply \nfrom foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, \nforeign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. \nproducers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.--now \n6,811,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S376-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S376-S378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAQ--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 92\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport of July 31, 1997, concerning the national emergency with respect \nto Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990. \nThis report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  Executive Order 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all property \nand interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including the \nCentral Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United States \nor within the possession or control of a United States person. That \norder also prohibited the importation into the United States of goods \nand services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, \nservices, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The order \nprohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the \nperformance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, \nor governmental project in Iraq. United States persons were also \nprohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government \nof Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order 12724, which was issued in order to align the sanctions \nimposed by the United States with United Nations Security Council \nResolution (UNSCR) 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders 12724 and 12817 (the ``Executive \nOrders''). The report covers events from August 2, 1997, through \nFebruary 1, 1998.\n  1. In April 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 986 \nauthorizing Iraq to export up to $1 billion in petroleum and petroleum \nproducts every 90 days for a total of 180 days under U.N. supervision \nin order to finance the purchase of food, medicine, and other \nhumanitarian supplies. UNSCR 986 includes arrangements to ensure \nequitable distribution of humanitarian goods purchased with UNSCR 986 \noil revenues to all the people of Iraq. The resolution also provides \nfor the payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression and for \nthe funding of other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. On May 20, \n1996, a memorandum of understanding was concluded between the \nSecretariat of the United Nations and the Government of Iraq agreeing \non terms for implementing UNSCR 986. On August 8, 1996, the UNSC \ncommittee established pursuant to UNSCR 661 (``the 661 Committee'') \nadopted procedures to be employed by the 661 Committee in \nimplementation of UNSCR 986. On December 9, 1996, the President of the \nSecurity Council received the report prepared by the Secretary General \nas requested by paragraph 13 of UNSCR 986, making UNSCR 986 effective \nas of 12:01 a.m. December 10, 1996.\n\n  On June 4, 1997, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 1111, \nrenewing for another 180 days the authorization for Iraqi petroleum \nsales and purchases of humanitarian aid contained in UNSCR 986 of April \n14, 1995. The Resolution became effective on June 8, 1997. On September \n12, 1997, the Security Council, noting Iraq's decision not to\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nexport petroleum and petroleum products pursuant to UNSCR 1111 during \nthe period June 8 to August 13, 1997, and deeply concerned about the \nresulting humanitarian consequences for the Iraqi people, adopted UNSCR \n1129. This resolution replaced the two 90-day quotas with one 120-day \nquota and one 60-day quota in order to enable Iraq to export its full \n$2 billion quota of oil within the original 180 days of UNSCR 1111. On \nDecember 4, 1997, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 1143, \nrenewing for another 180 days, beginning December 5, 1997, the \nauthorization for Iraqi petroleum sales and humanitarian aid purchases \ncontained in UNSCR 986. As of January 2, 1998, however, Iraq still had \nnot exported any petroleum under UNSCR 1143. During the reporting \nperiod, imports into the United States under this program totaled about \n14.2 million barrels, bringing total imports since December 10, 1996, \nto approximately 23.7 million barrels.\n  2. There have been two amendments to the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, \n31 C.F.R. Part 575 (the ``ISR'' or the ``Regulations'') administered by \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the \nTreasury during the reporting period. The Regulations were amended on \nAugust 25, 1997. General reporting, recordkeeping, licensing, and other \nprocedural regulations were moved from the Regulations to a separate \npart (31 C.F.R. Part 501) dealing solely with such procedural matters \n(62 Fed. Reg. 45098, August 25, 1997). A copy of the amendment is \nattached.\n  On December 30, 1997, the Regulations were amended to remove from \nappendices A and B to 31 C.F.R. chapter V the name of an individual who \nhad been determined previously to act for or on behalf of, or to be \nowned or controlled by, the Government of Iraq (62 Fed. Reg. 67729, \nDecember 30, 1997). A copy of the amendment is attached.\n  As previously reported, the Regulations were amended on December 10, \n1996, to provide a statement of licensing policy regarding specific \nlicensing of United States persons seeking to purchase Iraqi-origin \npetroleum and petroleum products from Iraq (61 Fed. Reg. 65312, \nDecember 11, 1996). Statements of licensing policy were also provided \nregarding sales of essential parts and equipment for the Kirkuk-\nYumurtalik pipeline system, and sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq, \npursuant to United Nations approval. A general license was also added \nto authorize dealings in Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products \nthat have been exported from Iraq with United Nations and United States \nGovernment approval.\n  All executory contracts must contain terms requiring that all \nproceeds of oil purchases from the Government of Iraq, including the \nState Oil Marketing Organization, must be placed in the U.N. escrow \naccount at Banque Nationale de Paris, New York (the ``986 escrow \naccount''), and all Iraqi payments for authorized sales of pipeline \nparts and equipment, humanitarian goods, and incidental transaction \ncosts borne by Iraq will, upon approval by the 661 Committee and \nsatisfaction of other conditions established by the United Nations, be \npaid or payable out of the 986 escrow account.\n\n  3. Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions \ncontinue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. \nSeveral cases from prior reporting periods are continuing and recent \nadditional allegations have been referred by OFAC to the U.S. Customs \nService for investigation.\n  On July 15, 1995, a jury in the Eastern District of New York returned \na verdict of not guilty for two defendants charged with the attempted \nexportation and transshipment to Iraq of zirconium ingots in violation \nof IEEPA and the ISR. The two were charged in a Federal indictment on \nJuly 10, 1995, along with another defendant who entered a guilty plea \non February 6, 1997.\n  Investigation also continues into the roles played by various \nindividuals and firms outside Iraq in the Iraqi government procurement \nnetwork. These investigations may lead to additions to OFAC's listing \nof individuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated \nNationals (SDNs) of the Government of Iraq.\n  Since my last report, OFAC collected civil monetary penalties \ntotaling more than $1.125 million for violations of IEEPA and the ISR \nrelating to the sale and shipment of goods to the Government of Iraq \nand an entity in Iraq. Additional administrative proceedings have been \ninitiated and others await commencement.\n  4. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued hundreds of \nlicensing determinations regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or \nIraqi assets since August 1990. Specific licenses have been issued for \ntransactions such as the filing of legal actions against Iraqi \ngovernmental entities, legal representation of Iraq, and the \nexportation to Iraq of donated medicine, medical supplies, and food \nintended for humanitarian relief purposes, sales of humanitarian \nsupplies to Iraq under UNSCR 986 and 1111, diplomatic transactions, the \nexecution of powers of attorney relating to the administration of \npersonal assets and decedents' estates in Iraq, and the protection of \npreexistent intellectual property rights in Iraq. Since my last report, \n88 specific licenses have been issued, most with respect to sales of \nhumanitarian goods.\n  Since December 10, 1996, OFAC has issued specific licenses \nauthorizing commercial sales of humanitarian goods funded by Iraqi oil \nsales pursuant to UNSCR 986 and 1111 valued at more than $239 million. \nOf that amount, approximately $222 million represents sales of basic \nfoodstuffs, $7.9 million for medicines and medical supplies, $8.2 \nmillion for water testing and treatment equipment, and nearly $700,000 \nto fund a variety of United Nations activities in Iraq. International \nhumanitarian relief in Iraq is coordinated under the direction of the \nUnited Nations Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator of Iraq. \nAssisting U.N. agencies include the World Food Program, the U.N. \nPopulation Fund, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the World \nHealth Organization, and UNICEF. As of January 8, 1998, OFAC had \nauthorized sales valued at more than $165.8 million worth of \nhumanitarian goods during the reporting period beginning August 2, \n1997.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from August 2, 1997, through February 1, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are reported \nto be about $1.2 million, most of which represents wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nInternational Organization Affairs, the Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the U.S. Mission to \nthe United Nations, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and the \nDepartment of Transportation (particularly the U.S. Coast Guard).\n\n  6. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with relevant United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions. Iraqi compliance with these resolutions \nis necessary before the United States will consider lifting economic \nsanctions. Security Council resolutions on Iraq call for the \nelimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi recognition of \nKuwait and the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release \nof Kuwaiti and other third-country nationals, compensation for victims \nof Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities, the return of Kuwaiti assets stolen during \nIraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait, renunciation of terrorism, an end \nto internal Iraqi repression of its own civilian population, and the \nfacilitation of access of international relief organizations to all \nthose in need in all parts of Iraq. Seven and a half years after the \ninvasion, a pattern of defiance persists: a refusal to account for \nmissing Kuwaiti detainees; failure to return Kuwaiti property worth \nmillions of dollars, including military equipment that was used by\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nIraq in its movement of troops to the Kuwaiti border in October 1994; \nsponsorship of assassinations in Lebanon and in northern Iraq; \nincomplete declarations to weapons inspectors and refusal to provide \nimmediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to sites by these \ninspectors; and ongoing widespread human rights violations. As a \nresult, the U.N. sanctions remain in place; the United States will \ncontinue to enforce those sanctions under domestic authority.\n  The Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its \nown citizens through systematic repression of all forms of political \nexpression, oppression of minorities, and denial of humanitarian \nassistance. The Government of Iraq has repeatedly said it will not \ncomply with UNSCR 688 of April 5, 1991. The Iraqi military routinely \nharasses residents of the north, and has attempted to ``Arabize'' the \nKurdish, Turkomen, and Assyrian areas in the north. Iraq has not \nrelented in its artillery attacks against civilian population centers \nin the south, or in its burning and draining operations in the southern \nmarshes, which have forced thousands to flee to neighboring states.\n  The policies and actions of the Saddam Hussein regime continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and \nsecurity. The U.N. resolutions affirm that the Security Council be \nassured of Iraq's peaceful intentions in judging its compliance with \nsanctions.

A bill to provide a comprehensive program of support for \nvictims of torture; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE SURVIVORS OF TORTURE SUPPORT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, most people do not realize that torture is \npracticed or condoned in more than 100 countries.\n\n  We all agree that torture is a horrible act. It is designed to \nphysically and emotionally cripple individuals, to render them \nincapable of mounting an effective opposition to a regime or a system \nof beliefs.\n  Torture does not affect just the victim--it sends a strong message to \nthe victim's family, community, and nation that dissent will not be \ntolerated. Torture is not used as a weapon just against an individual--\nit is used as a weapon against democracy.\n  As a nation, we cannot stand by and continue to let the victims of \ntorture suffer in silence. We must do more than proclaim that the \npractice of torture is abhorrent. We must provide assistance to torture \nsurvivors, for they truly are not able to help themselves.\n  The ``Survivors of Torture Support Act'' will assist victims of \ntorture both here and abroad. While the practice of torture is not a \nproblem in this country, many victims of torture flee to the United \nStates to seek refuge.\n  As many as 400,000 torture survivors now live in the United States. \nMany of the survivors may not be getting the assistance they need. \nOther survivors of torture remain abroad; they deserve effective \ntreatment as well.\n  The ``Survivors of Torture Support Act'' makes changes in U.S. \nimmigration policy to account for the special needs of torture \nsurvivors.\n  This bill designates torture victims as refugees of special \nhumanitarian concern.\n  It ensures expedited processing for asylum applicants who present \ncredible claims of subjection to torture. It also establishes \nprocedures for taking into account the effects of torture in the \nadjudication of such claims.\n  This bill grants the presumption that such applicants shall not be \ndetained while their asylum claims are pending, and provides exemption \nfrom expedited removal procedures for individuals in danger of being \nsubjected to torture.\n  Many times, torture survivors are not identified by U.S. officials \nbecause consular, immigration, and also asylum personnel have not \nreceived adequate training in either the identification of evidence of \ntorture or the techniques for interviewing torture victims.\n  The ``Survivors of Torture Support Act'' requires that the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of State provide training necessary for these \nofficials to recognize the effects of torture on victims, and the way \nthis can affect the interview or hearing process.\n  It also requires special training in interview techniques, so that \nsurvivors of torture are not traumatized by this experience.\n  Torture survivors can be productive members of American society if \nthey have access to treatment. That is why this bill provides $50 \nmillion over three years for treatment of victims of torture in the \nUnited States and abroad.\n  My home state of Minnesota is fortunate to have the first \ncomprehensive treatment center in the United States for victims of \ntorture.\n  The Center for Victims of Torture has treated more than 500 patients \nsince it was established in 1985, and by helping those patients \novercome the atrocities suffered in their homelands, has assisted them \nin becoming productive members of our communities.\n  In addition to providing treatment to persons who have been tortured \nby foreign governments, the Center has been active in providing \ntraining and support for treatment centers abroad. I have learned a \ngreat deal from visiting the Center and meeting its clients and staff.\n  Support for legislation to assist torture survivors has been \nincreasing since Senator Dave Durenberger first introduced it in 1994.\n  I have worked closely with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, in developing legislation to address the very real needs of \nthese survivors. While we have chosen different paths in bringing this \nissue before the Senate, our bills differ primarily in approach.\n  Therefore, I applaud his efforts and look forward to working closely \nwith him to move legislation forward in 1998 that will assist victims \nof torture who reside in the U.S. and also abroad.\n  The United States should take a leading role in encouraging the \nestablishment of additional treatment programs both at home and also \nabroad.\n  We are making progress in this direction. The U.S. is now the largest \ncontributor to the United Nations voluntary fund for victims of \ntorture. We must continue to support treatment centers, like the one in \nMinnesota, which help those who cannot help themselves.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1604. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the restriction on payment for certain hospital discharges to \npost-acute care of imposed by section 4407 of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  MEDICARE TRANSFER REPEAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nrepeal a provision of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that is \nparticularly onerous and unfair to New York's and our nation's \nhospitals. The provision is one that expands the definition of a \nMedicare transfer and it is inherently counterintuitive to assuring the \ndelivery of appropriate health care services to patients.\n  As many of my colleagues might recall, I was actively involved during \nthe Senate's debate of the BBA in fighting for the elimination of the \ntransfer provision. I thought then, and I still believe now that it is \nbad health care policy that runs counter to the mission that we should \nbe advocating when we make policy: to encourage the providers of health \ncare in our communities to provide the most appropriate care for the \ngood of their patients. Along with my colleague Senator Dodd, last \nyear, we were able to mitigate the impact of the original transfer \nprovision in the final BBA that was enacted. Unfortunately, we were not \nable to eliminate it from the BBA and that is why I am here today, \noffering legislation to finish the job we started last summer.\n  Included in the BBA was a provision that would expand the definition \nof a Medicare acute care transfer to include discharges to any \nrehabilitation or psychiatric hospital, nursing home or home health \nagency. This policy is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1998, \nfor 10 Medicare hospital procedures that will be determined by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. What this means for hospitals \nthat transfer patients is that the hospital would no longer get paid \nthe appropriate payment (a DRG payment)--they would instead get paid a \nlesser amount--just because the patient was discharged to receive a \nmore appropriate level of care. This policy would only apply for \npatients that are transferred in under the average length of stay.\n  Let me give you an example: a patient goes into the hospital for one \nof the 10 designated procedures, for example, a hip operation, which \nhas an average length of stay of 10 days. At 7 days, the patient's \ndoctor wants to transfer him to a rehabilitation hospital to continue \nhis recovery. This is where the transfer policy would have an effect: \nthe hospital that discharged him would no longer receive the payment \nthat is due to them--the DRG payment. Instead, they would receive a \nlesser per diem payment, merely because the patient was discharged to \nreceive a more appropriate, cost effective level of care.\n  Let me spend a moment here talking about the hospital payment system. \nThe DRG system was put into place by Congress to create the proper \nincentives for providing an appropriate level\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\nof care for patients. It is a system that is built on average: patient \ncases that have higher lengths of stay are ``underpaid'' and cases that \nhave lower than average lengths of stay are ``overpaid'' because, \nregardless of the length of stay, hospitals get the same payment. The \nnew transfer policy would begin a serious erosion of the DRG system \nand, as a result, create the wrong incentives for hospitals. Hospitals \nthat are faced with receiving a lesser payment for providing the \nappropriate care for a patient, will undoubtedly change their behavior: \nthey will end up keeping a patient in the hospital longer--until the \naverage length of stay is reached, and then transfer the patient to a \npost-acute care facility. As a result, the transfer policy creates a \ndisincentive for hospitals to efficiently provide the most appropriate \nlevel of care for their patients.\n  The transfer policy is not necessary. Patients that use post-acute \ncare services tend to have more complicated health care needs and \nlonger hospital stays than those patients that don't use post-acute \ncare. For this reason, the transfer policy does not address a problem \nin the Medicare system that needs fixing. Even the Prospective Payment \nAssessment Commission rejected this policy change because they believed \nit was bad health care policy and that it provided the wrong incentives \nfor a hospital prospective payment system.\n  It also creates billing documents for our hospitals who would be held \nresponsible for the future actions of former patients. This sets up our \nhospitals for future allegations of fraud. For example, a hospital \ndischarges a patient, who goes home from the hospital, expecting to be \ncared for by a family member. Suddenly, the family member becomes ill \nand unexpectedly cannot care for a patient. The patient's doctor calls \nthe local home health care agency, who now sends a nurse out to the \npatient's home for 3 weeks of home care. The hospital has no knowledge \nof this and will bill Medicare for the full DRG because it believed \nthat the patient was discharged and at home recovering. The hospital is \nunaware of actions of the patient and therefore would have no reason to \nbill the Medicare program differently. The government later could cite \nthe hospital for fraud because they billed the Medicare program \nimproperly. Hospitals are faced with the impossible and untenable task \nof tracking the future actions of patients that left their care.\n  Repeal of the transfer policy is the only way to right a very \nmisguided policy that was adopted last year. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport legislation that will eliminate a provision of the BBA that is \nbad health policy and disruptive to a system that aims to assure that \npatients receive the right care in the most appropriate setting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF RESTRICTION ON MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR \n                   CERTAIN HOSPITAL DISCHARGES TO POST-ACUTE CARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1886(d)(5) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)), as amended by section 4407 of \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat. \n     401), is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (I)(ii), by striking ``not taking in \n     account the effect of subparagraph (J),'', and\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (J).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33; 111 Stat. \n     251).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1605. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help States, \nunits of local government, and Indian tribes to purchase armor vests \nfor use by law enforcement officers.\n\n\n              THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I are \nintroducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, a bill to \nestablish a matching grant program to help State, Tribal and local \njurisdictions purchase armor vests for the use by law enforcement \nofficers. We are pleased to be joined in this effort by the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, Hollings, Johnson, Kennedy, \nReid, Torricelli and Dodd. This bill expands on legislation I \nintroduced last month to help law enforcement.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the \nrisks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines \nprotecting our communities.\n  Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and \ndeadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law \nenforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and \nlocal officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests.\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed \nby a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, \nbulletproof vests save lives.\n  Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to \npurchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of \n1998 would form a partnership with state and local law enforcement \nagencies in order to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $25 million \nper year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. \nThe program would provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law \nenforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing \nbulletproof vests and body armor. To make sure that no police \ndepartment is left out of the program, the matching requirement could \nbe waived for those jurisdictions that cannot afford it.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an \nofficer can have and often means the difference between life and death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had the protection \n     of an armor vest while performing their hazardous duties;\n       (2) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that more \n     than 30 percent of the almost 1,182 law enforcement officers \n     killed by a firearm in the line of duty could have been saved \n     if they had been wearing body armor;\n       (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing an armor vest is 14 times higher than for officers \n     wearing an armor vest;\n       (4) the Department of Justice estimates that approximately \n     150,000 State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, \n     nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor;\n       (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite decreases in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''; and\n       (6) many State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, \n     especially those in smaller communities and rural \n     jurisdictions,\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n     need assistance in order to provide body armor for their \n     officers.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide those officers with armor \n     vests.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Armor vest.--The term ``armor vest'' means body armor \n     that has been tested through the voluntary compliance testing \n     program operated by the National Law Enforcement and \n     Corrections Technology Center of the National Institute of \n     Justice (NIJ), and found to comply with the requirements of \n     NIJ Standard 0101.03, or any subsequent revision of that \n     standard.\n       (2) Body armor.--The term ``body armor'' means any product \n     sold or offered for sale as personal protective body covering \n     intended to protect against gunfire, stabbing, or other \n     physical harm.\n       (3) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the Department of \n     Justice.\n       (4) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)).\n       (5) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n     officer'' means any officer, agent, or employee of a State, \n     unit of local government, or Indian tribe authorized by law \n     or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the \n     prevention, detection, or investigation of any violation of \n     criminal law, or authorized by law to supervise sentenced \n     criminal offenders.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands.\n       (7) Unit of local government.--The term ``unit of local \n     government'' means a county, municipality, town, township, \n     village, parish, borough, or other unit of general government \n     below the State level.\n\n     SEC. 4.

APPLICATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Director shall promulgate regulations to carry out \n     this Act, which shall set forth the information that must be \n     included in each application under section 4(b) and the \n     requirements that States, units of local government, and \n     Indian tribes must meet in order to receive a grant under \n     section 4.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROHIBITION OF PRISON INMATE LABOR.\n\n       Any State, unit of local government, or Indian tribe that \n     receives financial assistance provided using funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may not \n     purchase equipment or products manufactured using prison \n     inmate labor.\n\n     SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       In the case of any equipment or product authorized to be \n     purchased with financial assistance provided using funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act, it \n     is the sense of Congress that entities receiving the \n     assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only \n     American-made equipment and products.\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for each \n     of fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, in 1996, one violent crime was committed \nevery nineteen seconds in the United States. According to the Uniform \nCrime Reports, firearms were the weapons used in 29% of all murders, \nrobberies and aggravated assaults, collectively, that year. When a \ncrime occurs, no matter what the crime or the weapons used, the first \naction taken is to call the police. Law enforcement rushes to the \nrescue, risking their own lives in the process.\n  It is imperative that we do all we can to assist the police in \nhandling these volatile situations. That is why I join with Senators \nCampbell and Leahy in introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Act--a bill that will provide funding for equipment that is \ncritical to preserve the lives of our law enforcement. The \n``equipment'' of which I speak is a bullet proof vest. Under this bill, \nthe federal government will pay half the cost for the purchase of armor \nvests for a State and local law enforcement.\n  This bill promotes the purchases of these life-saving vests. The need \nfor them is proven over and over again. Nationwide, the FBI estimates \nthat nearly one third of the 1,182 law enforcement officers killed by a \nfirearm in the line of duty since 1980 would be alive if they had worn \na bullet proof vest.\n  Just this past December, Rochester, New York was rocked by the \nshooting of three police officers. Rochester Police Officers Mark G. \nDibelka and Thomas DiFante were both shot in the chest and Sgt. Michael \nKozak was shot in the arm. All three men lived --thanks to the \nbulletproof vests. These heroes will live to see the judicial process \nat work against the criminal charged with three counts of first degree \nattempted murder. Due to the bullet proof vests, we are able to wish \nthese men a speedy recovery.\n  In New York City, the lives of two officers were saved with a \nbulletproof vest. A convicted drug dealer is accused of shooting two \nofficers, firing three shots at Detective Wafkey Salem in the chest and \nshot at Detective Lourdes Gonzalez' shoulder. These officers lived to \ntell their stories.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Protection Act of 1998 \nauthorizes $25 million of federal funds to be matched with State and \nlocalities funds for the purchase of armor vests. Any agent or officer \nthat prevents, detects or investigates crimes, or supervises sentenced \noffenders, will be able to receive a bulletproof vest with the \nassistance of this grant--that includes law enforcement and correction \nofficers.\n  Special attention is paid to rural areas, with at least 50% of the \nfunds available to jurisdictions with populations of 100,000 or less. \nEach state would receive a minimum of .75% of the total federal funds, \nincluding Puerto Rico. The bill also includes a maximum of 5% that can \nbe drawn to each state, including the grantees of that state. The only \nrestriction is that the armor vests are not made by prison labor, a \nvery reasonable requirement, especially in light of the nature of the \nlife-saving equipment. This legislation also recognizes that the \nequipment purchased with federal assistance should be made in the \nUnited States.\n  Law enforcement officers risk their lives for people, and we owe it \nto them to make sure the risks are at a minimum. We owe it to the men \nand women who go to work everyday and have no idea what dangerous \nsituation awaits them--and we owe it to their families. This bill \nshould be passed, swiftly and, I hope, with the full support of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am proud to co-sponsor a bill \nwhich\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\nwill be an essential component of the war on crime. The Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Act, which was introduced today, will save the lives \nof law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor.\n  Providing body armor to more law enforcement agencies will greatly \nreduce injuries and fatalities among officers. The FBI estimates that \nmore than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed in the line of duty \nby a firearm since 1980 would have lived had they worn bullet-resistant \nvests. In fact, the FBI considers the risk of death to officers not \nwearing armor to be 14 times greater than that for officers wearing \nbody armor.\n  Mr. President, today 150,000 law officers in the United States do not \nhave access to this essential equipment. This is unacceptable. These \nbrave men and women risk their lives every day to enforce the law and \nprotect and serve the public. The least we can do is afford them the \ngreatest degree of protection possible as they fight crime in our \ncommunities.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will provide state and \nlocal law enforcement officers with the critical equipment they need to \nprotect their officers in the line of duty. This bipartisan bill will \ncreate a $25 million grant program in the Department of Justice to \nprovide matching funds to state and local law enforcement agencies to \npurchase body armor. I would like to underscore the importance of the \nword ``Partnership'' in this bill. This grant program will continue the \neffective federal-state-local partnerships that have proved so \nsuccessful in the war on crime.\n  One of the greatest features of this bill, Mr. President, is that it \nprefers law enforcement agencies that cannot now provide body armor for \ntheir officers. This is especially helpful to small and rural \njurisdictions. In fact, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act requires \nthe Justice Department to provide at least 50% of the grant program's \nfunds to small jurisdictions comprising fewer than 100,000 people. This \nprovision is especially important in states like South Carolina, where \nthe vast majority of jurisdictions fit this description.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police, National Sheriff's Association, \nInternational Union of Police Associations, and Police Executive \nResearch Forum all endorse this bill, Mr. President. These groups \nunderstand better than anyone the importance of this legislation. They \nknow from firsthand experience that body armor often can mean the \ndifference between life and death for an officer.\n  If we are serious about fighting crime, we must ensure the safety of \nour law enforcement officers. The best way to do this is to provide \nstate and local law enforcement agencies with the funds to purchase new \nequipment such as body armor for their officers. Though we cannot \nprotect every law officer from danger, we can and must ensure that they \nhave the best equipment available to protect themselves while in the \nline of duty.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act will do all these things. I am \nproud to co-sponsor it, and I encourage all my colleagues to support \nthis bipartisan legislation. Let us do our part in the war on crime.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bullet \nProof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 introduced by Senator Leahy and \nSenator Campbell. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and I \nwant to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues for their work \nin addressing this issue. This bill is about saving lives and \nprotecting the men and women in law enforcement who keep our \ncommunities safe. There are few opportunities for the Congress to help \nlocal law enforcement, and I thank Senators Leahy and Campbell for \nbringing this grant program to the attention of the Senate.\n  The Bullet Proof Vest Partnership Act will establish a $25 million \nmatching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state, \nlocal and tribal law enforcement agencies purchase needed body armor. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, approximately 150,000 state and \nlocal law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body \narmor. Justice estimates that the risk of fatality for officers while \nnot wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers equipped \nwith protection on the job.\n  While law enforcement in my rural state of South Dakota does not face \nthe volume of high risk and hazardous situations that police forces in \nNew York or California contend with every day, one preventable death is \ntoo many, and this program will help every community protect their \nofficers. To that end, Senators Leahy and Campbell were careful to \nstructure this program to guarantee access for rural states and \ncommunities. Under the small state minimum in the Leahy-Campbell bill, \nSouth Dakota would be eligible for at least $187,000 per year in \nfederal matching grant funds. The bill also gives the Department of \nJustice the discretion to lower or waive the matching requirement for \ncommunities facing financial hardship. Life saving body armor can run \n$500-700, keeping bullet proof vests out of reach for many small and \nrural communities with extremely limited resources.\n  I also strongly support the recognition of Indian tribal law \nenforcement needs included in this bill. Juvenile crime and gang \nactivity are on the rise on rural reservations, and resources are \ncontinually scarce. This bill will allow tribes to access funds on \nequal footing with state and local police forces. I am committed to \nencouraging cooperation between tribal and non-tribal law enforcement \nagencies in my state and throughout the country for the important and \nshared goal of combating crime nationwide. Recognizing tribal law \nenforcement through this grant program is an important step forward.\n  Mr. President, the need to protect our law enforcement officers is \npressing. This legislation will outfit our law enforcement officers \nwith the equipment necessary to protect themselves while protecting our \nfamilies. I encourage speedy Judiciary Committee consideration of this \ninitiative and urge full Senate support for this much needed grant \nprogram.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senator Campbell and I are \nintroducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, along with \nSenators D'Amato, Dodd, Hatch, Hollings, Johnson, Kennedy, Reid and \nTorricelli. I am particularly pleased that the Chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, is an original cosponsor of this \nbill. Our bipartisan legislation is intended to save the lives of law \nenforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law \nenforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor.\n  Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while \nserving to protect our citizens. According to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a \nfirearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they \nhad been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of \nfatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher \nthan for officers wearing it.\n  Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies \ncannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the \nprotection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates \nthat approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, \nnearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor.\n  In countless incidents across the country everyday officers sworn to \nprotect the public and enforce the law are in danger. Last year, an \nhorrific incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to \nprovide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, \nfederal, state and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New \nHampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. He had \nshot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims \nearlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the \nauthorities, Drega was killed.\n  During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore \nbulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For \nexample, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, was \nseriously wounded in the incident. I am glad that Officer Pfeifer is \nback on the job after being hospitalized in serious condition. Had it \nnot\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\nbeen for his bulletproof vest, I fear that he and his family might well \nhave paid the ultimate price.\n  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega \nwere not so lucky. We all grieve for them and our hearts go out to \ntheir families. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective \nvests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous \nofficers because of the high-powered assault weapons, but the tragedy \nunderscore the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether \nfederal, state or local, deserve the best protection we can provide, \nincluding bulletproof vests.\n  With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will \ncontinue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law \nenforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will help by creating a \nnew partnership between the federal government and state and local law \nenforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by \nproviding the resources for each and every law enforcement officer in \nharm's way to have a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create \na $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice \ndedicated to helping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase \nbody armor.\n  In my home State of Vermont, our bill enjoys the strong support of \nthe Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and \nmany Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state \nlaw enforcement officials. Just last week I was honored to be joined by \nVermont Attorney General William Sorrell, Vermont Commissioner of \nPublic Safety James Walton, Vermont State Police Director John \nSinclair, Vermont Fish and Wildlife Lieutenant Robert Rooks, South \nBurlington Police Chief Lee Graham, South Burlington Vermont Officer \nDiane Reynolds as we spoke about state and local law enforcement \nofficers' need for body armor.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont \nhas the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, \nwork and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the \nhard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we \nshould do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes \nto our attention.\n  Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.'' In fact, the National Association of Chiefs \nof Police just reported that 21 police officers were killed in the line \nof duty last month, nearly double the toll for the month of January in \nboth 1997 and 1996. More than ever, each and every law enforcement \nofficer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof \nvest.\n  Senator Campbell and I have the support of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice and many other law enforcement groups for this proposal. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and its quick \npassage into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1606. A bill to fully implement the Convention Against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to \nprovide a comprehensive program of support for victims of torture; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     THE TORTURE VICTIMS RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Torture \nVictims Relief Act of 1998. I am joined today by Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Harkin as original cosponsors of this measure. This legislation \noutlines a comprehensive strategy for providing critical assistance to \nrefugees, asylees, and parolees who are torture survivors in the U.S. \nand abroad. It also protects asylum seekers from being involuntary \nreturned to a country where they have reasonable grounds to fear \nsubjection to torture. This legislation provides a focus and a \nframework for a newly re-energized debate about where torture \nsurvivors, and our response to the practice of torture by other \ncountries, fit within our foreign policy priorities.\n  Late in the 103rd Congress, I introduced with Senator Durenburger the \nTorture Victim's Relief Act, which laid down a bipartisan marker on the \nissue. I reintroduced it in the 104th, along with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, pressing forward on several fronts.\n  I hope that enactment of this legislation will be a watershed in the \nmovement to garner broader public and private support, both here and \nabroad, for much-needed torture rehabilitation programs. Specifically, \nthe Torture Victims Relief Act would authorize funds for domestic \nrefugee assistance centers as well as bilateral assistance to torture \ntreatment centers worldwide. It would also change our immigration laws \nto give a priority to torture survivors and provide for specialized \ntraining for U.S. consular personnel who deal with torture survivors.\n  Finally, the bill would allow an increase in the U.S. contribution to \nthe U.N. Voluntary Fund for Torture Victims, which funds and supports \nrehabilitation programs worldwide. In 1997 this fund contributed about \n$3.4 million to nearly 100 projects in more than 50 countries. I \nbelieve that continuing to expand the U.S. contribution to the fund is \nnecessary as a show of genuine U.S. commitment to human rights, and I \nwill continue to push until these programs receive the funding they \nneed and deserve.\n  Mr. President, the practice of torture is one of the most serious \nhuman rights issues of our time. Governmental torture, and torture \nbeing condoned by officials of governments, occurs in at least 70 \ncountries today. We need look no farther than today's headlines about \nAlgeria, Turkey, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, China and Tibet to know that we \nwill be dealing with the problems that torture victims face for many \nyears.\n  In many countries torture is routinely employed in police stations to \ncoerce confessions or obtain information. Detainees are subjected to \nboth physical and mental abuse. Methods include beatings with sticks \nand whips; kicking with boots; electric shocks; and suspension from one \nor both arms. Victims are also threatened, insulted and humiliated. In \nsome cases, particular those involving women, victims are stripped, \nexposed to verbal and sexual abuse. Medical treatment is often \nwithheld, sometimes resulting in death.\n  In China, torture of detainees and prisoners is not uncommon, as \nexemplified by Chen Longde's case. In 1996, one month after his \nconviction without trial, Chen leapt from a two-story prison walkway in \nan attempt to avoid repeated beatings and electric shocks from a senior \nprison official as punishment for his refusal to write a statement of \nguilt and self-criticism.\n  Richard Oketch was tortured by the Ugandan military. He was \nimprisoned for a total of a year in various military compounds near his \nhome. His hands were shackled to his feet, he was denied food and \nsleep, and he was beaten regularly. Oketch managed to flee Uganda and \neventually, with the help of the United Nations, he made it to the \nUnited States. However, the emotional scars of watching his family \nmembers and dozens of friends slaughtered left him for a time, unable \nto function in society.\n  Today Oketch holds a master's degree and works as a program \nspecialist for the St. Paul Public School. He credits his \ntransformation to the treatment he received at the Minnesota Center for \nVictims of Torture. There Oketch received the services he needed to \ndeal with his grief and become an active member of his community. \nUnfortunately, Oketch's story is the exception, not the rule. Most \ntorture survivors, even those who are granted asylum in the United \nStates, never receive the treatment they need.\n\n  We can and must do more to stop horrific acts of torture, and to \ntreat its victims. Treating torture victims must be a much more central \nfocus of our efforts as we work to promote human rights worldwide.\n  Providing treatment for torture survivors is one of the best ways we \ncan show our concern for human rights around the world. The United \nStates and the international community have been increasingly aware of \nthe need to prevent human rights abuses and to punish the perpetrators \nwhen abuses take place. But too often we have failed to address the \nneeds of the victims. We pay little if any attention to\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nthe treatment of victims after their rights have been violated.\n  This commitment to protect human rights is one shared by many around \nthe world. In 1984 the U.N. approved the United Nations' Convention \nAgainst Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment. The U.S. Senate ratified it in April of 1994. \nAlthough Congress has taken some steps to implement parts of the \nConvention, we have not yet taken action to provide sufficient \nrehabilitation services in the spirit of the language of Article 14 of \nthe Convention which provides that the victim of an act of torture has: \n``the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible.''\n  We have also failed to adopt implementing legislation for Article 3 \nwhich states that ``No State Party shall expel, return or extradite a \nperson to another State where there are substantial grounds for \nbelieving that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.'' \nWithout legislation implementing this article, it is possible for the \nUnited States to return someone to a country even where there are \nsubstantial grounds for believing the person would be subjected to \ntorture. This legislation would help ensure that the U.S. is fulfilling \nits obligation under the Convention Against Torture.\n  There also exists a great need for the rehabilitation programs \nsupported by this legislation. Without active programs of healing and \nrecovery, torture survivors often suffer continued physical pain, \ndepression and anxiety, intense and incessant nightmares, guilt and \nself-loathing. They often report an inability to concentrate or \nremember. The severity of the trauma makes it difficult to hold down a \njob, study for a new profession, or acquire other skills needed for \nsuccessful adjustment into society.\n  In Minnesota, we began to think about the problem of torture, and act \non it, over ten years ago. The Center for Victims of Torture in \nMinneapolis is the only fully-staffed torture treatment facility in the \ncountry and one of just a few worldwide. The Center offers outpatient \nservices which can include medical treatment, psychotherapy and help \ngaining economic and legal stability. Its advocacy work also helps to \ninform people about the problem of torture and the lingering effects it \nhas on victims, and ways to combat torture worldwide. The Center has \ntreated or provided services to hundreds of people since its founding \nin 1985.\n  Some of the often shrill public rhetoric these days seems to argue \nthat we as a nation can no longer afford to remain engaged with the \nworld, or to assist the poor, the elderly, the feeble, refugees, those \nseeking asylum--those most in need of aid who are right here in our \nmidst. The Center for Victims of Torture stands as a repudiation of \nthat idea. Its mission is to rescue and rehabilitate people who have \nbeen crushed by torture, and it has been accomplishing that mission \nadmirably over the last ten years. It is a light of hope in the lives \nof those who have for so long seen only darkness, a darkness brought on \nby the brutal hand of the torturer.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished human rights leaders who \nhelped craft this bill, including those at the Center for Victims of \nTorture in Minneapolis and others in the human rights community here in \nWashington and in Minnesota. Without their energy and skills as \nadvocates for tough U.S. laws which promote respect for \ninternationally-recognized human rights worldwide, the cause of human \nrights here in the U.S. would be seriously diminished. I salute them \ntoday. We must commit ourselves to aiding torture survivors and to \nbuilding a world in which torture is relegated to the dark past. My \nhope is that we can help bring about a world in which the need for \ntorture treatment programs becomes obsolete. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this bill, and I urge its timely passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a partial list of organizations \nsupporting the Torture Victims Relief Act be printed in the Record with \na copy of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Torture Victims Relief \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American people abhor torture by any government or \n     person. The existence of torture creates a climate of fear \n     and international insecurity that affects all people.\n       (2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage \n     caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual \n     personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are \n     long term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the \n     survivors and affect future generations.\n       (3) By eliminating leadership of their opposition and \n     frightening the general public, repressive governments often \n     use torture as a weapon against democracy.\n       (4) Torture survivors remain under physical and \n     psychological threats, especially in communities where the \n     perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, \n     even those who treat torture survivors are threatened with \n     reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical \n     duties to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and \n     their treatment providers should be accorded protection from \n     further repression.\n       (5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering \n     the United States have been victims of torture. Those \n     claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their \n     applications for political asylum to minimize their \n     insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now \n     live in the United States. They should be provided with the \n     rehabilitation services which would enable them to become \n     productive members of our communities.\n       (6) The development of a treatment movement for torture \n     survivors has created new opportunities for action by the \n     United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and \n     other acts of torture.\n       (7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect \n     and support torture victims and their treatment providers, \n     together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.\n       (8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect \n     their families, the United States can help to heal the \n     effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.\n       (9) The United States became a party to the Convention \n     Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment on November 20, 1994, but has not \n     implemented Article 3 of the Convention.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided, the terms \n     used in this Act have the meanings given those terms in \n     section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1101(a)).\n       (2) Torture.--The term ``torture'' has the meaning given \n     the term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, \n     and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual \n     violence by a person acting under the color of law upon \n     another person under his custody or physical control.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF PERSONS FEARING \n                   SUBJECTION TO TORTURE.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the United States shall not expel, remove, extradite, or \n     otherwise return involuntarily an individual to a country if \n     there is substantial evidence that a reasonable person in the \n     circumstances of that individual would fear subjection to \n     torture in that country.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``to return involuntarily'', in the case of an individual, \n     means--\n       (1) to return the individual without the individual's \n     consent, whether or not the return is induced by physical \n     force and whether or not the person is physically present in \n     the United States; or\n       (2) to take an action by which it is reasonably foreseeable \n     that the individual will be returned, whether or not the \n     return is induced by physical force and whether or not the \n     person is physically present in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES FOR TORTURE VICTIMS.\n\n       (a) Covered Aliens.--An alien described in this section is \n     any alien who presents a claim of having been subjected to \n     torture, or whom there is reason to believe has been \n     subjected to torture.\n       (b) Consideration of the Effects of Torture.--In \n     considering an application by an alien described in \n     subsection (a) for refugee status under section 207 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, asylum under section 208 of \n     that Act, or withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) \n     of that Act, the appropriate officials shall take into \n     account--\n       (1) the manner in which the effects of torture might affect \n     the applicant's responses in the application and in the \n     interview process or other immigration proceedings, as the \n     case may be;\n       (2) the difficulties torture victims often have in \n     recounting their suffering under torture; and\n       (3) the fear victims have of returning to their country of \n     nationality where, even if torture is no longer practiced or \n     the incidence of torture is reduced, their torturers may have \n     gone unpunished and may remain in positions of authority.\n       (c) Expedited Processing of Refugee Admissions.--For \n     purposes of section 207(c) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(c)), refugees who have been subjected to \n     torture shall be considered to be refugees of special \n     humanitarian concern to\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\n     the United States and shall be accorded priority for \n     resettlement at least as high as that accorded any other \n     group of refugees.\n       (d) Processing for Asylum and Withholding of Removal.--\n     Section 235(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new clause:\n       ``(iv) Special procedures for aliens who are the victims of \n     torture.--\n\n       ``(I) Expedited procedures.--With the consent of the alien, \n     an asylum officer or immigration judge shall expedite the \n     scheduling of an asylum interview or a removal proceeding for \n     any alien who presents a claim of having been subjected to \n     torture, unless the evidence indicates that a delay in making \n     a determination regarding the granting of asylum under \n     section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or the \n     withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of that Act \n     with respect to the alien would not aggravate the physical or \n     psychological effects of torture upon the alien.\n       ``(II) Delay of proceedings.--With the consent of the \n     alien, an asylum officer or immigration judge shall postpone \n     an asylum interview or a removal proceeding for any alien who \n     presents a claim of having been subjected to torture, if the \n     evidence indicates that, as a result of the alien's mental or \n     physical symptoms resulting from torture, including the \n     alien's inability to recall or relate the events of the \n     torture, the alien will require more time to recover or be \n     treated before being required to testify.''\n\n       (e) Parole in Lieu of Detention.--The finding that an alien \n     is a person described in subsection (a) shall be a strong \n     presumptive basis for a grant of parole, under section \n     212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1182(d)(5)), in lieu of detention.\n       (f) Exemption From Expedited Removal.--Section 235(b)(1)(F) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1225(b)(1)(F)) is amended by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``, or to an alien described in \n     section 5(a) of the Torture Victims Relief Act''.\n       (g) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Attorney General should allocate resources sufficient to \n     maintain in the Resource Information Center of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service current information \n     relating to the use of torture in foreign countries.\n\n     SEC. 6. SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR CONSULAR, IMMIGRATION, AND \n                   ASYLUM PERSONNEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide \n     training for immigration inspectors and examiners, \n     immigration officers, asylum officers, immigration judges, \n     and all other relevant officials of the Department of \n     Justice, and the Secretary of State shall provide training \n     for consular officers, with respect to--\n       (1) the identification of torture;\n       (2) the identification of the surrounding circumstances in \n     which torture is most often practiced;\n       (3) the long-term effects of torture upon a victim;\n       (4) the identification of the physical, cognitive, and \n     emotional effects of torture, and the manner in which these \n     effects can affect the interview or hearing process; and\n       (5) the manner of interviewing victims of torture so as not \n     to retraumatize them, eliciting the necessary information to \n     document the torture experience, and understanding the \n     difficulties victims often have in recounting their torture \n     experience.\n       (b) Gender-Related Considerations.--In conducting training \n     under subsection (a) (4) or (5), gender-specific training \n     shall be provided on the subject of interacting with women \n     and men who are victims of torture by rape or any other form \n     of sexual violence.\n\n     SEC. 7. DOMESTIC TREATMENT CENTERS.\n\n       (a) Amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act.--\n     Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1522) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(b) Assistance for Treatment of Torture Victims.--The \n     Secretary may provide grants to programs in the United States \n     to cover the cost of the following services:\n       ``(1) Services for the rehabilitation of victims of \n     torture, including treatment of the physical and \n     psychological effects of torture.\n       ``(2) Social and legal services for victims of torture.\n       ``(3) Research and training for health care providers \n     outside of treatment centers, or programs for the purpose of \n     enabling such providers to provide the services described in \n     paragraph (1).''.\n       (b) Funding.--\n       (1) Authorization of appropriations.--Of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Health \n     and Human Services for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, but \n     not from funds made available to the Office of Refugee \n     Resettlement, there are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out section 412(g) of that Act (relating to assistance \n     for domestic centers and programs for the treatment of \n     victims of torture), as added by subsection (a), the \n     following amounts for the following fiscal years:\n       (A) For fiscal year 1999, $5,000,000.\n       (B) For fiscal year 2000, $7,500,000.\n       (C) For fiscal year 2001, $9,000,000.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to this subsection shall remain available until expended.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1998.\n\n     SEC. 8.

A bill to amend the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 \nto authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 for the Next \nGeneration Internet program, to require the Advisory committee on High-\nPerformance Computing and Communications, Information Technology, and \nthe Next Generation Internet to monitor and give advice concerning the \ndevelopment and implementation of the Next Generation Internet program \nand report to the President and the Congress in its activities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           the next generation internet research act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, advances in computer networking have led to \nsome of the most significant developments of the last decade. We have \nall been touched one way or another by the Internet and the networking \nprotocols that form the World Wide Web. Its presence is being felt in \nschools, businesses and homes across the country. Many people already \ncome to rely on the Internet as their source for news and information. \nNow, electronic commerce is beginning to emerge as a significant source \nof network traffic, so it appears that more individuals are relying on \nthe Internet for purchases as well.\n  By any measure, the Internet is a success. It is a fast-paced living \nlaboratory where every day brings new innovation and applications. The \nInternet's culture of rapid innovation stems from its days as a \nresearch vehicle sponsored by the Defense Advanced Projects Research \nAgency (DARPA). This original federal investment in university based \nresearch and development has grown to pay dividends to our country in \nthe form of new technology, new jobs and economic growth. The Internet \nhas also served as a case study in the proper role of the federal \ngovernment in science and technology. Although the research was first \nsponsored by the Department of Defense, multiple agencies have come to \nplay a significant role in the development and commercialization of the \nInternet. In particular, the National Science Foundation demonstrated \nhow to successfully transition the management of an operational system, \nthe Internet, from the public to the private sector.\n  Today's Internet is a flexible, robust network, but already some of \nits limits have been reached. There are fascinating applications \nrunning in the laboratory that simply cannot be run on the Internet as \nit is today. Recently, I had a first hand look at a prime example: the \nvirtual reality ``Immersion Desk'' collaboration. As a physician, I \nfound it fascinating to take a guided tour of a human ear, seeing its \nstructure in three dimensions, and able to interact with the guide and \nthe structure in real time. It was immediately obvious to me the \neducational benefits that will come from putting similar devices in the \nhands of our nation's teachers and students. However, until the \nInternet's infrastructure limitations have been overcome, these \napplications will remain outside the reach of those who can benefit the \nmost.\n  Some of the limits that now impede advanced applications can be \novercome through a straightforward application of existing technology, \nbut there is an entire class of problems that requires new approaches. \nI believe that our nation's research and development enterprise holds \nthe key. That is why I rise today to offer the ``Next Generation \nInternet Research Act of 1998.'' This legislation funds the agencies \nthat are involved in creating advanced computer networking technology \nthat will make tomorrow's Internet faster, more versatile, more \naffordable, and more accessible than today. The agencies funded by this \nlegislation: The Department of Defense (DOD), the National Science \nFoundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DoE), the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology (NIST), each have a role to play in moving \nforward the state of the art in computer networking and network \napplications. The NGI program will provide grants to our universities \nand national laboratories to perform the research that will surmount \nthese technical challenges and create a network that is 100 to 1000 \ntimes faster than the current Internet.\n\n  Today, many that are located in rural areas of the country such as \nportions of eastern Tennessee, find that high speed access to the \nInternet is too expensive and difficult to obtain. Researchers from \nselect states enjoy access to high bandwidth Internet connections at \ncosts that are sometimes one-eighth the rate of their rural colleagues. \nThis legislation acknowledges this geographical penalty and encourages \nnetworking researchers to look at this problem as a research challenge. \nEmphasis must be placed on finding new technology that permits high \nspeed information access without leaving large sections of the country \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the passage of this legislation will \ncontinue the tradition of prudent and successful federal investment in \nscience and technology. The Internet truly is a success story. One that \ncould not have been written without federal support. One that has \nalready paid for itself through the creation of jobs and technology for \nAmericans. The last chapter of the Internet success story is far from \nbeing written, and with this legislation, we are helping to ensure that \nthe Internet will reach its potential to provide greater educational \nand economic benefits to the country. I ask for support in passing this \nkey legislative initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Next Generation Internet \n     Research Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Frist in introducing legislation to authorize the Next \nGeneration Internet (NGI) Program for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. This \nbill funds the NGI program, which actually involves six agencies, at \n$102.5 million for FY99 and $115 million for FY2000. It would also \nrequire the Advisory Committee on High Performance Computing and \nCommunication Information Technology and Next Generation Internet to \noversee the program and report to the President and the Congress on its \nactivities.\n  As everyone in the Senate knows, I have been a long and ardent \nsupporter of the Internet and Internet-related research. In fact, I \nwould point to the current Internet as an example of what the \ngovernment can do right. When the Internet was started, it was a \ngovernment funded network for researchers and military personnel. It \nwas expected to grow, but not into the commercially supported network \nwith a $250 billion market base that it is today, and it is still \ngrowing. This rate of return on a rather modest government investment \nis something that any investment banker would love to achieve. An added \nbenefit is that this modest government investment has allowed U.S. \nindustry to become the world leader in most Internet-related markets.\n  I also want to commend the Clinton Administration for their steadfast \ncommitment to a clearly needed leadership role in charting the future \nof the Internet, and yet in also working closely with the affected \nindustries, the academic community, and many others whose contributions \nto future applications and possibilities are almost endless. I am \npleased to now work with Senator Frist, the dedicated chairman of the \nSenate's Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space, to \nprovide a further foundation for this important work through this \nlegislation.\n  The current Internet is a victim of its own success. As more and more \npeople come on-line, the network gets more and more crowded. People are \nbeginning to think that the ``www'' in Internet addresses stands for \n``world-wide wait'' rather than ``world-wide web''. Therefore, I fully \nsupport the idea of increasing the speed, reliability and usefulness of \nthe Internet. With increases in speed and efficiency of data transfer, \nhopes of distance learning with real-time video and audio, remote \naccess image libraries, and more use of telemedicine, will become \npractical realities. In addition, with increases in bandwidth, I am \nsure that U.S. researchers will come up with new applications that we \ncannot even think of today.\n  Do not think that it is a coincidence that all the applications I \njust listed have to do with remote access to data. The ability to give \nthose that do not have easy physical access quick and reliable \nelectronic access to resources is, I feel, one of the Internet's \ngreatest benefits to society. As history has shown us, it would be \nextremely easy for a situation to arise in which there are states with \nNGI capabilities and states without, if there is not balanced \nrepresentation in the decision-making process. Due to the increased \ncomputing power and ability to collaborate with other NGI network \ninstitutions,\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nNGI states could have a large advantage over non-NGI states when \napplying for grants and participation. With this in mind, I am glad to \npoint out that this bill formally addresses geographic concerns for \nrural institutions and users.\n  As I stated earlier, I have always been a firm supporter of the \nInternet, and will continue to support research in this area. This bill \nauthorizes an innovative inter-agency program to increase the speed, \nreliability and usefulness of the Internet. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Bumpers, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1610. A bill to increase the availability, affordability, and \nquality of child care; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    the child care a.c.c.e.s.s. act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the bill I send to the desk I send on \nbehalf of myself and 24 of my colleagues whose names are included on \nthe introduction of the legislation. The bill I have sent to the desk \nis called the Child Care and ACCESS bill, ``ACCESS'' standing for \nAffordable Child Care for Early Success and Security. As I said, I am \npleased to be joined by 24 of my colleagues. There may be others in the \ncoming days who care to join us in presenting what we believe is a \ncomprehensive approach to dealing with an issue that I think all \nAmericans--certainly I hope all in this Chamber--will recognize as a \ncrisis: That is the crisis of child care.\n\n  Almost on a daily basis, we read stories of children in child care \nsettings who are left alone and then are discovered either with serious \ninjury or worse. Many of them are left in certified and accredited \nchild care centers. These stories highlight the critical importance of \nthis issue. This is an issue that now affects 13 million children, the \noverwhelming majority of whom come from families where there is either \na single parent or both parents must work in order to provide for the \nbasic needs of their families.\n  We have often felt in this country that we should not ask parents to \nmake a choice between the job they need and the children they love, so \nchild care has become a necessity. The question now is can we make it \naffordable for families? At a cost of $4,000 to $10,000 a year per \nchild, is care accessible for parents who need it? Is the care they \nfind going to be in a quality setting, where a child is safe? If the \nprovider is a qualified parent, obviously her or she can provide for \nthe needs of the child. But in this country, we know that too often \nqualified parents, in order to provide for the economic needs of their \nfamily, must provide a child care setting for their children.\n  There's the issue of after-school care. 5 million children are home \nalone in this country. Any chief of police in this Nation will tell you \nthat the most dangerous time for these children is not after 11 p.m. at \nnight when many of the curfews are invoked, but rather between 3 and 8 \no'clock, in the afternoon, when children are unsupervised. We don't \nhave after-school programs for these kids where they can either stay in \nschool or be involved in a worthwhile outside academic experience. So, \nthere is a need here.\n  When we discuss child care, we must also consider recent findings \nconcerning early child development. We know how important these first \n36 months of a person's life are, about the development of synapses \nthat occur, about the nurturing that must go on in those years. We must \nmake sure that parents can find quality care where there children will \nbe intellectually stimulated, not simply warehoused.\n  What we are doing today is presenting a piece of legislation which \ntries to deal in a comprehensive way with this issue of child care. \nThis bill recognizes the needs of parents, working parents, middle-\nincome families, those who are striving to achieve a middle-income \nstatus, poorer families in this country, providers who want to provide \ngood child care but don't have the resources to do so, businesses that \nwant to help their employees either by providing a child care setting, \nand businesses that want to assist their employees with help in \nattaining child care support.\n  This legislation also includes an expansion of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, a piece of legislation that was signed into law 5 years ago \ntomorrow. It has already benefited literally thousands and thousands of \nfamilies across this country.\n  Today as part of this legislation we are calling for an expansion of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act by lowering the threshold from 50 \nemployees to 25. We think by including 13 million more Americans who, \nwhen faced with the crisis of choosing between their children and their \njobs, ought not to be asked to make that choice.\n  So this legislation includes an expansion of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act.\n  At any rate, the challenge before us is certainly a significant one, \nand that is to create a child care system that works for America's \nfamilies. As I said, for far too many families today when it comes to \nchild care, they either have no choices or very bad choices. Here are \nsome of the appalling statistics. They are incontrovertible, \nundeniable.\n  Child care quality: Only one in seven child care centers provides \ncare that promotes healthy development; child care at one in eight \ncenters actually threatens children's health and safety.\n  Infants and toddlers, our youngest and most vulnerable children, fare \nthe worst. Almost half of infant and toddler care in our country \nendangers the health and safety of those who are in those centers.\n  No State in this Nation has child care regulations in place that can \nbe characterized as good quality standards. Two-thirds of the States \nhave regulations that don't even address the basics--care giver \ntraining, safe environments, appropriate provider-child ratios.\n  Even though we know that well-paid, educated and trained providers \nmake a difference between poor and good quality child care, we pay \ncaregivers in this country--almost all of them women--abysmally, some \nof them at well below the poverty levels, even though they're caring \nfor our most precious possessions.\n  As someone said not too long ago, children represent 27 percent of \nAmerica's population, but they represent 100 percent of our future. \nThese are the children that will be asked to be good employees, good \nemployers, good citizens, and good parents, making a contribution to \nthis Nation in the 21st century.\n  Yet, for the 13 million children who are in child care environments \ntoday, the results are not good at all. We can either recognize that in \nthis country and try and do something about it, or we can sit back and \nallow our system to continue to deteriorate and then face the judgment \nof history as to why we didn't stand up and try and put up some of the \nresources that we have to help these families.\n  How does a family making $20,000 or $25,000 or $30,000 a year, with 2 \nor 3 children, afford care at $7, $8, $9, $10 thousand per year per \nchild. The cost of some child care settings is in excess of some \nuniversities.\n  Child care providers and centers workers average only $12,000 a year \nin pay, Madam President. That is just at the poverty level for a family \nof three. Home based providers average $9,000 a year. That is their \nincome.\n  Those are the people we are asking to provide for our children, \nmaking several thousand dollars below the poverty level.\n  These numbers and statistics, by the way, come from national surveys \nand studies done by child care centers around the Nation. As I \nmentioned earlier, full day child care costs run from $4,000 to $10,000 \nper child. Because of a lack of funding, only an estimated one out of \n10 eligible families actually received help in paying for care through \nthe child care block grants which Senator Hatch and I authored eight \nyears ago in this very Chamber.\n  Good quality child care does cost more than mediocre quality, but not \na lot more. An investment of only an additional 10 percent has a \nsignificant, positive impact on quality.\n  And many types of child care remain unavailable at any cost, Madam \nPresident. Many new parents are dismayed\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nto learn that care for infants is virtually nonexistent, and the \nproblem is only getting worse. The General Accounting Office estimates \nthat by the time the 50-percent work participation goal is reached in \n2002, 88 percent of infants needing child care will not be able to find \nit. This corresponds to 24,000 young children in Chicago alone without \nchild care.\n  Let me repeat that. The General Accounting Office, not a partisan \norganization, estimates that by the time we reach the 50-percent work \nrequirement in 2002, 4 years from now, 88 percent of infants in this \ncountry that need child care--we are not talking about choices now, it \nis not a question that someone is in an income category where they have \na choice as to whether or not they are going to put a child in child \ncare or stay home. We are talking about people who absolutely have to \nhave child care. Eighty-eight percent of them will not be able to find \nit.\n  We cannot let that happen, and this ought not to be a partisan debate \nabout whether or not we see the facts. We know what is going to occur. \nDo we stand up and try and address it?\n  In addition, there is a glaring lack of after-school programs. As I \nmentioned earlier, 5 million children are home alone. Eighth graders \nleft home alone after school reported a greater use of cigarettes, \nalcohol, marijuana, the gateway drugs, than those who are in adult-\nsupervised settings.\n\n  The challenge, again, facing us is a straightforward one: to find a \nway to support families in the choices about how their children are \ncared for. I know that some will argue that child care is a private \nproblem, one that families should be left to solve on their own. \nHowever, we don't expect families to shoulder the financial costs of \neducating their children alone. We provide public schools. We don't \nexpect families to shoulder the burden of providing health care for \ntheir children alone. The vast majority of families have that cost \nsubsidized through their employers. And as a nation, we have an \ninterest in well-educated and healthy children, and so we accept that \nthe Federal Government, States and employers play a role in getting us \nto these laudable goals of public education and health.\n  Yet, when it comes to child care, we set families adrift. We tell \nthem that it is a private problem, you have to solve it alone. The \nresult is a system in which parents have less, not more, choices. The \nresult is a nation in which child care is too often unaffordable, \nunavailable and unsafe. I believe that it is a compelling national \ninterest in making sure that our children are safe and well cared for.\n  I rise today to offer this plan that I have sent to the desk that \nwill broadly improve the ability of families to make the right choice \nwhen it comes to their children's care. Twenty-four of my colleagues \nand myself--25 of us--have offered this bill. There are several main \nparts in our initiative. Let me touch on them briefly.\n  One, improving the affordability of child care. Our legislation would \nprovide an additional $7.5 billion over 5 years through the child care \nand development block grant, that I mentioned that Senator Hatch and I \nauthored some eight years ago, to increase the amount of child care \nsubsidies available to working families. This investment will double \nthe number of children served by the block grant to 2 million by the \nyear 2003.\n  Secondly, we enhance the quality of child care in early childhood \ndevelopment. This legislation will provide some $3 billion over 5 years \nto encourage States to invest in activities known to produce \nsignificant improvements in the quality of child care. For example, we \nhelp the States with this $3 billion to bring provider-child ratios to \nnationally recommended levels.\n  Again, I think most people understand this. Even if you have a well-\ntrained adult, if they have too many children they are watching over, \nit doesn't work well. So we get to these ratios that those who \nunderstand this issue think are acceptable. With smaller infants, it is \na very small ratio. As the children get a little older, the ratios can \nbe a little broader.\n  We improve the enforcement of quality standards by conducting \nunannounced inspections.\n  Let me, as an aside, say that we had the head of the Defense \nDepartment's child care program testify the other day before a group of \nus. This is the best child care program in the world, by the way. Our \nArmed Forces serve 200,000 children all over the world everyday.\n  The Defense Department would be the first to tell you not too many \nyears ago they had the most dreadful system which was the subject of \nsevere criticism as a result of national reports that were done on \nthem. They have turned this around and, as I said, have now set up one \nof the best systems, if not the best system certainly, in this country \nif not in the world.\n  One of the things they do is they have unannounced inspections of \nchild care centers on military bases. Just recently, I went to the \nchild care facility at the submarine base in Groton, CT. Really, they \nare doing a magnificent job--the providers, the staff, the children. \nThis is a great sense of pride for our military personnel, our men and \nwomen, who must by necessity have child care.\n  In the case of submariners, the men are off on submarines for weeks \nand weeks on end. Their spouses, if they are married with families, are \nworking to supplement their incomes, and they need child care. To the \nDefense Department's great credit, they put in place a great system. \nUnannounced inspections make a difference.\n  Conducting background checks on child care providers. Today, it is \nhardly done at all. Someone can move from State to State, get a job and \nthen we find out there is a long record of abuse and other problems, \nand that goes on every day.\n  Improve the compensation, education, and training of child care \nproviders. I have already shared the statistics on what the average \nsalaries are, $12,000 and $9,000. We pay parking attendants in this \ncountry higher salaries than we do people who take care of America's \nchildren. Your car is more likely to have someone with a better salary \nwatching over it than your child. That is unacceptable, or should be, \nto all of us in this country.\n  Educating parents on how to find good quality child care and ensuring \nthat high quality care is available to children with disabilities.\n  Those are some of the ways in which we try to help our States in this \nbill.\n  Thirdly, we increase the availability and quality of school-age child \ncare. This initiative will provide $3 billion over 5 years to increase \nthe supply and quantity of school-age care through child care \ndevelopment block grants. In addition, we incorporate the model \ndeveloped by Senator Boxer which ensures that schools play a central \nrole in these efforts by providing the 21st century community learning \ncenters with $1 billion over 5 years to create before- and after-school \nprograms.\n  Again, as an aside, I think all of us would agree, I hope, that our \ntaxpayers build wonderful schools around our country, marvelous \nfacilities. In many instances, they open at 8 or 9 in the morning, but \nthen close in the afternoon, and are not open in the evening, weekends, \nvacations, summer months. We want to see the school buildings get more \ncommunity use for children in after-school programs, adult education, \nsummer programs, when kids are out of school. There ought to be ways in \nwhich we incorporate the use of these facilities to a larger extent \nthan we have been able to.\n  Fourthly, we expand the dependent care credit. This initiative would \nalso expand the existing dependent care tax credit by nearly $8 billion \nover 5 years, following the model of Senator Harkin's earlier child \ncare bill.\n  We would adjust the sliding scale to increase the credit for families \nearning under $60,000 and index the credit for inflation to keep pace \nwith the rising child care costs.\n  We would also make the credit refundable so that families with little \nor no tax liability, those making under $30,000 a year, can receive \nassistance with child care expenses. I hope that this will not be a \nmatter that ends up being a significant debate. On refundability, \nagain, when people have incomes under $30,000, they don't pay Federal \ntaxes or very few taxes, and if we don't make this refundable, then \nthey are not going to get the benefit. It is to people at that income \nlevel struggling to make ends meet, it seems to me, that refundability \nis absolutely critical if they are going to get help.\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\n  No. 5, supporting family choices in child care. Our legislation would \nalso provide new support for families who make the difficult choice to \nforgo a second income or career and to stay at home to care for their \nchildren. We would allow stay-at-home parents with children under the \nage of 1 to claim a portion of the dependent care credit. This credit \nwould also be made refundable to allow stay-at-home parents earning \nunder $30,000 to benefit, and it is phased out for families earning \nover $70,000.\n  There is a bill that has been introduced by our colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee. The Presiding Officer may, in fact, be a \ncosponsor of that bill. I know we have worked together on these issues. \nThere is a difference here because the proposal being offered, I \nbelieve, by Senator Chafee treats parents who stay at home exactly the \nsame way we treat parents who can't stay at home.\n  In our bill, we do it a bit differently. I am very sympathetic of \nproviding some help to parents who can make the choice, but if we \nprovided it on a totally equal basis, it just becomes far too \nexpensive. What we have done here is said, look, we are going to \nprovide this assistance to you in the first year of that child's life. \nThat cuts the cost by two-thirds. The reason I say that is because \nthere are people out here who have no choice. I want to make this case. \nIt is one thing to have the choice, that is a wonderful luxury, but for \nthe overwhelming majority of the 13 million children who are in child \ncare centers, their parents don't have the choice, they have to be \nthere.\n  It is not a question of ``I would like to stay home, I have another \nspouse that is earning enough.'' It is not a question of ``I want to go \nplay golf or go to the club and play cards.'' These are people trying \nvery hard on their own or with their spouse to hold their families \ntogether. So the choice doesn't exist for them.\n  So it is not exactly equal in that sense. But I do think we should \ntry to recognize and offer help where they do have stay-at-home \nparents, particularly for that first year. So we do provide that \nprovision in our bill. I think it is a worthwhile one. I am hopeful we \ncan reach some common ground.\n  Madam President, we also expand the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nwhich I have already mentioned at the outset of my remarks. I invite my \ncolleagues to go to a children's hospital in your State. Go to the \nwaiting room in those hospitals. You will meet the parents who need \nprotection under Family and Medical Leave. They will tell you about the \ndifficulties. They will tell you, if they work for someone who employs \n25 to 50 people, how difficult it is. There's the problems with health \ncare, the insurance benefits.\n  You go out to NIH here. Go to the Ronald McDonald House. Talk to \nparents who have children with extended illness problems where they \ncan't stay at home, and they have to travel and be with their children. \nTalk to C. Everett Koop, a pediatrician. He will tell you about a \nchild's recovery rate when they are with a parent, with a loved one who \nis with them.\n  This ought not to be a controversial item, Madam President, to \nprovide family and medical leave for working families, to be with their \nparents, to be with their children during a time of crisis. I just do \nnot understand when people raise the kind of objections to trying to \nhelp out people in that situation. It ought to be a sense of national \nmortification that every other nation you can name provides a family \nand medical leave process.\n  I can count colleague after colleague in this Chamber who had a \nproblem with their children, had a problem with their parents, missed \nvotes, did not go to committee hearings, and in fact had they been here \nand not been with their family they probably would have been subjected \nto political attack, that their priorities were wrong, that they were \ndown here voting when they should have been with their children or \nparents at a time of illness.\n  If we believe that to be the case among ourselves, is it asking too \nmuch to say, too, to parents who work outside of public life, that when \nthey are faced with that crisis, that they ought not to have to choose \nbetween their job and their families?\n  So I hope we can expand this benefit to the 13 million working people \nin this country who do not have the luxury of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act that others have enjoyed for the past 5 years.\n  Madam President, No. 6, we encourage private sector involvement, \nwhich is a very important element in all of this. Child care cannot be \nthe sole responsibility of Government, State, local or Federal. So our \nlegislation will create a new discretionary program of competitive \nchallenge grants in which communities that generate funds from the \nprivate sector would be eligible for matched Federal grants to improve \nthe availability and quality of child care on a communitywide basis.\n  This program would be authorized at $1 billion over 5 years. Based on \nthe legislation of the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, which was \napproved, I might add, by the full Senate during the budget \nreconciliation bill of last year but dropped in conference, we would \nprovide a new tax incentive to open high-quality, on-site child care \ncenters or to assist employees in finding and paying for child care \noffsite.\n  Many businesses, Madam President, understand what their employees are \ngoing through, and they want to help. But they are not affluent \nbusinesses. If they could get a little bit of help on paying their \nFederal taxes by providing onsite child care or assisting their \nemployees, I think we would do a lot to expand the availability and the \nquality of child care. So we offer that to employers.\n  Seventh, Madam President, we ensure the quality of Federal child care \nfacilities. We would also ensure that the Federal Government would lead \nby example in providing its workers only the highest quality of child \ncare. Many people would be surprised, I think, to hear that currently \nFederal child care facilities are exempt from State quality \nregulations. In this bill we require that all Federal child care \ncenters meet all State licensing standards.\n\n  Madam President, this is a comprehensive package. I have run down \nthrough the major provisions in a brief way. It is a long bill. It \ncovers a lot of territory, a lot of ground. But it is a bold agenda, I \nthink one that people of common purpose can come to. As the Presiding \nOfficer and I see my colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, who is on the floor here, back in \nOctober, November we convened a group of us here, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to try to fashion a compromise bill. We spent long hours, \nI know our staffs did, in trying to hammer out a bill that we could \nhave presented to the full Chamber here in January. That was my hope. I \nknow it was the hope of the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Well, that did not happen. I am not going to spend time here on why \nthings didn't happen. There are various elements. But a new bill was \nintroduced by Senator Chafee. I do not agree with all of it. There are \nparts I do agree with. In fact, there are parts that are exactly alike \nin both of these bills.\n  I urge the leadership, the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nLott, the distinguished Democratic leader, the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, who is a cosponsor, I might add, of this bill, that we try to \nset some time aside for this issue if we are only in session for 70 \ndays, 100 days out of the 300 days left in this calendar year--at least \nthat is what we have been told. I realize this is a big bill. It is not \nsmall. It is a lot of money over 5 years. A lot of ideas need to be \nthought out carefully. But we ought to be getting about the business, \nMadam President, of doing just that. This issue becomes more of a \ncrisis and more of a problem and arguably more costly the longer we \nwait to address it.\n  To the President's great credit, he identified this issue during his \nState of the Union Message--after school care, affecting millions of \nworking families, early childhood development, that zero to 3 range, \nthe brain studies that all of us are now very familiar with, the infant \ncare, the provider assistance, the family assistance through the \ncredits, the Family and Medical Leave Act. We ought to get about the \nbusiness of trying to get a bipartisan bill that all of us can claim \ncredit for. So we can say to the American public in 1998, ``We heard \nyour concerns. We recognize the problems coming down the road. We \nstepped up to the plate. We resolved our differences, and we presented \nyou with our best efforts in this regard.''\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  My sincere hope, Madam President, is that is what exactly will happen \nin these coming days. As I said, it is a bold agenda. It is \ncomprehensive. And we must try to work together if we are going to \nsucceed in that regard.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Summary of Dodd Child Care Bill: The Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. Act\n\n         (Affordable Child Care for Early Success and Security)\n\n\n               improving the affordability of child care\n\n       Provide an additional $7.5 billion/5 years through the \n     Child Care and Development Block Grant to increase the amount \n     of child care subsidies available to working families. This \n     investment will double the number of children served by the \n     block grant to 2 million by 2003.\n\n\n  enhancing the quality of child care and early childhood development\n\n       Provide $3 billion/5 years to encourage states to invest in \n     activities known to produce significant improvements in the \n     quality of child care and early childhood development, for \n     example: bring provider-child ratios to nationally \n     recommended levels; improving the enforcement of licensing \n     standards, through unannounced inspections; conducting \n     background checks on child care providers; improving the \n     compensation, education and training of child care providers; \n     educating parents on the availability and quality of child \n     care; creating support networks for family child care \n     providers; establishing links between child care and health \n     care services; and ensuring the availability and quality of \n     child care for children with special health care needs.\n\n\n     increasing the availability and quality school-age child care\n\n       Provide $3 billion/5 years to increase the supply and \n     quality of school-age care. Through the 21st Century \n     Community Learning Centers, provide $1 billion/5 years to \n     encourage schools to create before and after-school programs.\n\n\n                expanding the dependent care tax credit\n\n       Adjust the sliding scale to increase the credit for \n     families earning under $60,000 and index the current expense \n     limits for inflation to help the credit keep pace with rising \n     child care costs. Make the credit refundable so that families \n     with little or no tax liability (those making under $30,000) \n     can receive assistance with child care expenses.\n\n\n                supporting family choices in child care\n\n       Allow stay-at-home parents with children under the age of 1 \n     to claim a portion of the department care tax credit. This \n     credit would also be made refundable to allow families \n     earning under $30,000 to benefit and is phased out for \n     families earning over $70,000.\n       Expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to include \n     businesses with 25-50 employees. This would protect an \n     additional 13 million working Americans and their families \n     and provide coverage for 71% of the private workforce (an \n     additional 14%).\n\n\n                 encouraging private sector involvement\n\n       Create a new discretionary program of competitive \n     ``challenge grants'' in which communities who generate funds \n     from the private sector would be eligible for matched federal \n     grants to improve the availability and quality of child care \n     on a community-wide basis. Authorize at $1 billion over 5 \n     years.\n       Provide a 25% tax credit to employers ($500 million/5 \n     years) for operating on-site child care centers, contracting \n     for off-site child care, contributing to the costs of \n     accreditation or operating resource and referral systems.\n\n\n         ensuring the quality of federal child care facilities\n\n       Require federal child career centers to meet all applicable \n     state licensing standards.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am honored to be an original cosponsor \nof Senator Dodd's important initiative to improve the affordability, \navailability and quality of child care in the United States. I believe \nthat American families will welcome this legislation.\n  We all know that high quality, affordable child care is an important \nconcern to working families. The number of working mothers with \npreschool-age children has increased five-fold since 1947. More than \nten million children of working mothers are in child care--and this \nnumber will increase as our strong economy enables welfare parents to \nfind jobs. Child care belongs on the top of the national agenda.\n  This legislation uses a number of strategies to improve child care \nfor American families. Most families struggle to cope with the costs of \nchild care. Under this legislation, low-income working families will \nbenefit from increased subsidies for child care services through the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant. Families who have little or no \ntax liability will receive new assistance through refundability of the \nDependent Care Tax Credit, while an adjusted sliding scale and indexed \nexpense limits will enhance the tax credit for families with incomes \nbelow $60,000.\n  This legislation also provides funds for significant quality \nimprovements. Through block grant funds, States will be encouraged to \ninvest in meaningful strategies that improve quality of care and \nenhance early childhood development, such as lower provider-to-child \nratios, new training and education opportunities for child care \nproviders, higher wages for child care workers, and greater enforcement \nof state licensing standards. In addition, new funding for school-age \nchild care will encourage schools to create before- and after-school \nprograms.\n  Finally, Senator Dodd has structured this legislation to encourage a \nsignificant private sector role in child care improvements. By \nexpanding the Family and Medical Leave Act, establishing competitive \n``challenge grants'' for community-based child care improvements, and \ndeveloping a new tax credit for employers that provide child care \nopportunities to their employees, this legislation recognizes the \nimportant role that community organizations and private businesses have \nto play in meeting American families' child care needs.\n  I am pleased to support such an important investment in American \nfamilies and America's children. We know how important a child's early \nyears are to its later intellectual, emotional and physical \ndevelopment. All American families have great dreams for their children \nand seek the best care possible during these critical early years. And \nall families deserve a chance at the American dream. Through this \nlegislation, Congress will be doing its part to help American families \nwork towards a successful future.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join in the introduction \nof the Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. Act. The initiative is designed to \nimprove access, quality and affordability of child care.\n  Access to child care is a necessity for all working parents. \nNationwide, 55% of children under age six have both parents (if they \nlive with two parents) or their single parent in the labor force. That \nfigure rises to 61% of school age children who have both or their only \nparent in the labor force. In my home state of New Mexico, 54% of \npreschool and 63% of school age children have both or their only parent \nin the workforce.\n  Another way of thinking of the magnitude of the issue is to consider \nthat more than half of all preschool children are away from their \nparents most of the day and two out of three school age children are \nlikely to require child care before or after school. With the passage \nof the TANF legislation in 1997, a number of mothers will be entering \nthe workforce for the first time and will require child care if they \nare to succeed in the job market.\n  Mr. President, while I may not agree with every portion of the bill, \nI believe that we need to improve child care access, quality, and \naffordability for our working families. I believe that this bill \naffords us the best approach to these child care issues and urge others \nto join in support of this initiative.\n  Access is a problem for many parents and expansion of the child care \nand development block grants is one step toward increasing the \navailability of child care programs. Accessibility grows even more \ncomplicated when we look at our rural areas of the country. Each \ncommunity has unique circumstances to overcome, such as a lack of \nresources, programs, and transportation. Since the issues of \navailability and access are addressed in this initiative, I am hopeful \nthat individual states will be able to address their most critical \nneeds.\n  Yet, Mr. President, improving access without improving the quality of \nthe child care is an empty gesture. Staff education and training are \namong the most critical elements in improving quality. Currently, many \nstates do not require providers who care for children in their homes to \nhave any training prior to serving children. I am told that 33 states \nallow teachers in child care centers to start work without prior \ntraining. This legislation includes incentives to encourage states to \ninvest in activities that will enhance provider-child ratios, improve \nthe enforcement of licensing standards, improve\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nthe compensation of child care providers, and offer training and \neducation to child care providers. It is essential that we have child \ncare staff who are trained to provide the necessary care and then have \nsalaries commensurate with their training to retain them in the field. \nIt is a credit to those who have worked in crafting this bill that they \nhave ensured that child care for children with special health care \nneeds will be addressed as well.\n  My state currently has many families who cannot find the quality, \naffordable child care they need to ensure that their children are well \ncared for and safe. Currently, child care is unaffordable for many \nworking families in New Mexico. Full day child care for one child can \neasily cost $4,000 to $10,000 per year, which is a lot of money in a \nstate where the average per capita income is $18,803. This is beyond \nthe reach of many families. These families simply cannot afford the \ncost of quality child care in addition to all of the other demands on \ntheir monthly budget. Increasing the Child Care and Development Block \nGrants will increase the amount of child care subsidies available to \nworking families.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill addresses a critical area: the \nissue of after school care for school age children. Good after school \noptions can help children and teens do well in school and stay out of \ntrouble. It is estimated that nearly 5 million children are left \nunsupervised by an adult after school each week. Studies have shown \nthat juvenile crime actually peaks between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. when \nmany children are unsupervised. Additionally, I am told that one study \nfound that eighth graders left home alone after school reported greater \nuse of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than those who were in adult \nsupervised settings. Our initiative will allow us to strengthen local \nresources and is designed to improve the quality of care in after \nschool programs.\n  In closing, the legislation covers the full spectrum of child care \nfrom early childhood to adolescent after school needs. I look forward \nto participating in the debate on making child care affordable and \naccessible. I am hopeful that the Senate will move forward on these \nissues of utmost importance to our working families, parents and \nchildren alike.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in \nsponsoring the Child Care ACCESS Act to improve the affordability, \navailability and quality of child care.\n  One of the major accomplishments of the last session was to help make \ncollege more affordable for working Americans. We passed bipartisan \nlegislation to increase Pell Grants to the highest level in history and \nto provide tax credits for college expenses. As a result, more \nAmericans will now be able to afford college.\n  We must now turn our attention, with the same firm resolve, to the \neducation of our young children and making child care affordable, \navailable and safe. This must be the top priority for this Congress.\n  The recent research on brain development has provided the importance \nof the first three years of a child's life. Early education \nopportunities are essential for the positive emotional, physical and \nsocial development of children.\n  Last year's appropriations bill included several important provisions \nrelated to early childhood education and development. We increased \nfunding for the Early Head Start program by $66 million and provided \nand 11% increase in early intervention programs for infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities. We also provided an additional $50 million \nfor the Child Care and Development Block Grant to improve the quality \nof care for infants. I would have liked to do more, but we were \nconstrained by provisions in the budget agreement. These \naccomplishments set the stage for us to do much more during 1998.\n  Mr. President, many low and middle-income families simply cannot \nafford high quality or even get decent child care. According to the \nChildren's Defense Fund, child care can cost between $3,000 and $8,000 \nfor each child. This clearly makes child care inaccessible to many low-\nincome and middle-income working parents with young children. The need \nfor safe and affordable child care is great and this legislation will \nprovide families with the help they need.\n  Last year, the President and First Lady sponsored the first White \nHouse Conference on Child Care. The child care concerns facing families \nwas summed up quite simply by Secretary of Health and Human Service \nSecretary Donna Shalala. Can they afford it? Can they get it? Can they \ntrust it? This legislation is a comprehensive response to those \nquestions.\n  First, the bill improves the affordability of child care for low-\nincome families by providing additional resources for the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant. This new funding will double the number of \nfamilies who can qualify for these subsidies. Second, it provides \nsignificant additional assistance for many middle income families \nstruggling with these huge costs.\n  We have all heard concerns about the difficulty working families have \nin securing child care subsidies. In Iowa, eligibility for Block Grant \nassistance is restricted to families who earn less than 125% of \npoverty--or less than $1,389 per month for a family of three. I have \nlong championed the need for parents to have the opportunity to work \nrather than to be on welfare. But, we cannot expect that to happen \nwithout sufficient resources to pay for child care.\n  I am pleased that this legislation includes a significant increase in \nthe child care tax credit, similar to a measure I introduced in 1996 \nand 1997. A key feature of this legislation is to make the credit \nrefundable so that those will the greatest need--those that making near \nthe minimum wage would be able to receive this tax benefit. Under \ncurrent law, they are not eligible.\n  However, low-income families are not the only ones who are struggling \nto pay for child care. Middle income families also need relief and this \nlegislation expands the Dependent Care Tax Credit and makes this credit \nrefundable. The limits of the existing tax credit was last changed in \n1982 and it has been seriously eroded by inflation. Under existing law, \na working family with two children in child care making $30,000 can \nreceive only $960 which, in Iowa often that amounts to only a fraction \nof child care costs. This is a huge burden on young working families. \nThe tax law in this area is especially unfair since other tax \nprovisions allow some taxpayers with generous company benefits to \nacquire tax reductions equal to over $1500 for child care with only a \nsingle child in day care.\n  In 1996 and 1997, I introduced legislation to substantially increase \nthe assistance available to working families and to make those benefits \nrefundable so lower income families would also benefit. My proposal \nprovided for a benefit of up to $2300 when two children are in day \ncare. I am pleased that the proposal being introduced today, and the \nproposal submitted by the President reaches that same level. Because of \nneed to keep this overall proposal within our ability to pay for it \nwithout eating into the surplus, the benefits start to phase down for \nfamilies making over $30,000 in this proposal. I would favor starting \nto phase out the size of the increased benefit at a higher level \ncovering a larger share of middle income families if we can find the \nadditional offsetting funding.\n  A key feature of the tax provision is to make the credit refundable \nso that those with the greatest need--those that making near the \nminimum wage would be able to get this benefit, that is currently \navailable to higher income families. While some make technical \narguments against the provision regarding budget and tax policy issues, \nI feel that we must do more to help working families bear this \nconsiderable cost and help their children receive decent child care so \nimportant to establish a good foundation for their years in school and \nthereafter. And, I find it most unreasonable that those with the most \nneed would be receiving less benefit then those with far more \nresources.\n  After our constituents tell us about the trouble they have paying for \nchild care, the next thing we hear is that they can't find child care, \nespecially for children who are school age. An estimated five million \nchildren spend some times each week as ``latchkey'' children without \nthe supervision of an adult. Further, the Department of Justice tells \nus that most juvenile crime occurs during the hours of 3 and 8 pm.\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\n  This legislation addresses this critical need by expanding funding to \nimprove the supply and quality of child care for school age children. \nIn addition, more funds would be made available to the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers to help public schools create before and \nafter school activities for their students.\n  Finally, families want quality child care that they can trust and \nthis legislation provides additional funding to encourage states to \nimprove the quality of child care. These funds could be used for a \nvariety of different activities that we know make a difference such as \nproviding additional training for providers or reducing provider-child \nratios.\n  The legislation also provides a modest tax credit to allow a parent \nto stay at home with children under the age of one and provides a tax \ncredit to employers for expenses related to child care for their \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides the most comprehensive \nresponse for families struggling to meet their child care needs and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1608. A bill to provide for budgetary reform by requiring the \nreduction of the deficit, a balanced Federal budget, and the repayment \nof the national debt; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, \n1977, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with instructions \nthat if one Committee reports, the other Committee have thirty days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n                    THE AMERICAN DEBT REPAYMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have, of course, from time to time \naddressed the Senate at this point in the day because I am introducing \na piece of legislation called The American Debt Repayment Act.\n  I think this is an important piece of legislation, and it certainly \nis very timely when we take into consideration that Congress now has \nthe President's budget before us for consideration. Recently the \nPresident submitted to Congress what he claims to be a balanced budget \nfor the fiscal year 1999. I would like to welcome him to the ball game \nof talking about a balanced budget.\n  Since I was elected as a Member of Congress in 1990, I have fought to \nbalance the budget using real numbers. In fact, I was a member of the \nHouse Budget Committee that passed the first balanced budget in over 25 \nyears only to see this detailed, responsible plan vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  As happy as I am that the administration has come close to realizing \nwhat the Republican led Congress has known all along, that we can \nbalance the budget while maintaining responsible spending habits, I am \ndeeply concerned that all progress could be lost if we do not diffuse \nthe ticking time bomb of the Federal debt. The Federal debt now stands \nat over $5.4 trillion. That is almost $20,000 for every man, woman and \nchild in the United States. If we do not begin a procedure for paying \ndown the debt and funding the Social Security trust fund, entitlement \nprograms will consume the entire Federal budget by the time the baby \nboomers retire. This is of great concern to me, and we cannot be \nshortsighted in dealing with the future of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The news, however, is not all bad. As I said, the President has \nsubmitted a budget that balances on paper beginning with the fiscal \nyear 1999. While the reality could be different, this is still 4 years \nahead of the 2002 timetable that was laid out by previous Congresses. \nBalancing the budget is clearly not the end but, rather, is only the \nbeginning. From the outset, many of us have realized that once the \nbudget is balanced, the Federal Government has the responsibility to \nretire the Federal debt. Included in the balanced budget agreement of \n1997 was an amendment of mine, and it expressed the sense of the \nCongress that the President submit a plan to pay down the debt when he \nsubmitted his budget. He did not follow this congressional guideline \nand that is one of the reasons why I feel I must come to the floor \ntoday and introduce the American Debt Repayment Act with my good friend \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Enzi. It is clear that now is the time to begin \nthat process and commit to retiring the Federal debt.\n  Let's talk a little bit about what I call the debt tax. The debt tax \nis the amount of hard-earned tax dollars that Americans send to \nWashington to pay the interest on the debt. With the Federal budget in \nbalance, we can begin to pay down the debt and decrease the annual \ngross interest payments of $355 billion. I repeat that, $355 billion is \nwhat we are paying in gross interest. This is $355 billion that could \nbe spent on any number of programs, or more beneficially, in my view, \ntax relief for American families. In real terms, American families are \npaying an annual debt tax of about $5,300 to pay interest on the debt. \nAs any consumer knows, the interest on unpaid debt compounds quickly, \nwhich is exactly what has been happening to our country. We need to \nrelieve our citizens of this burdensome tax.\n  Now, there are reports that we might actually realize a surplus \nbefore the fiscal year 1999. While I am not ready to take it to the \nbank yet, I believe that is exactly what we should do with any surplus, \ntake it to the bank and retire the Federal debt. The Congressional \nBudget Office is predicting a $5 billion deficit for fiscal year 1998. \nThat is down from a forecast of $120 billion at the beginning of the \nyear. I believe that we can and should deliver a balanced budget to the \nAmerican people beginning with this fiscal year.\n  I am a realist and understand that we cannot retire the Federal debt \nimmediately. What we can do is create a plan by which we pay down the \ndebt over a set number of years. I have such a plan. My legislation, \nthe American Debt Repayment Act, seeks to amortize and pay off the debt \nin the year 2028. That is as simple as it gets. My plan puts the \nFederal Government on a 30-year mortgage to pay its creditors and place \nour country on sound financial ground.\n\n  Let me share some of the numbers. If we assume a 4.5 percent growth \nin revenues and similar growth in Federal spending, we could retire the \nFederal debt in the year 2028 by maintaining a balanced budget and by \namortizing the debt payments just like you would pay a home mortgage. \nJust as important, this plan does not break our promise to the American \npeople under the balanced budget agreement.\n  By doing so we save over 3.7 trillion tax dollars in interest \npayments and free at least that much for tax relief or programs. In \nfact, if we stick to baseline outlays we will be able to provide over \n$370 billion in tax relief or program spending through the year 2007 \nwhile sticking to the American Debt Repayment Act to pay off the debt.\n  I would like to take an opportunity to refer to my chart that I have \non the floor where I have placed for the Members to see an amortization \nschedule on how we are going to pay off this huge debt Americans are \nfaced with today, which is about $5.5 trillion. If we start paying down \non the debt in fiscal year 1999, we have a $11.6 billion payment that \nwe start out with and each year we increase the amount we pay down on \nthe debt by $11.6 billion. If we continue that plan, by the year 2028 \nwe have no debt. And what we have saved the American people over that \nsame period of time, and I have it in red here, is $3.7 trillion. By \npaying down the debt, we have saved the American people in interest \nsavings more than $3.7 trillion.\n  By the year 2014 the savings in interest payments could be applied \ndirectly to the $11.6 billion to continue to pay down the debt. So this \nis a very realistic plan. It is a very simple plan. It is less than 1 \npercent of our total budget that we have in the fiscal year, our total \nbudget being somewhere around $1.7 trillion. It is a plan that I think \nthe Senate should adopt. It is called the American Debt Repayment Act. \nMy hope is that we can set an example for the country as well as the \nHouse and send over to the President a plan that will balance the \nbudget by 2028.\n  In the end, we will realize tremendous benefits from paying down the \ndebt. It is well-known that the United States economy performs well \nwhen Government follows sound budgetary policies. I believe that \nenacting a plan to retire the debt can only foster economic growth and \nstability.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor to discuss reduction \nplans, and for the most part we all agree on the necessity to do so. \nBut the problem\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nwith plans that call for one-half or one-third of any surplus to repay \nthe debt is that any President or Congress can produce a budget without \na dime of surplus even though revenues continue to increase.\n  I believe that any money left over after $11.6 billion has been \ncommitted to the debt should go to tax cuts, and I will fight against \ntax cuts for any extra spending. As I indicated earlier under my plan \nwe can pay down the debt and lessen the tax burden on the American \nfamily.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has not reduced its debt burden \nsince 1959. We did not have a deficit in 1969, but it has been way back \nto 1959 since there has been any effort to reduce the debt burden. We \nhave a historic opportunity to begin the process of retiring the \nFederal debt. We must eliminate the debt tax by retiring the Federal \ndebt and restoring financial security to the trust funds and the \nAmerican people.\n  The American Debt Repayment Act is the only real plan to retire the \nnational debt. This plan puts forth real numbers with a set payment and \na balanced budget requirement to retire the Federal debt. So long as \nthe Federal Government carries a $5.4 trillion debt, we cannot tell our \nchildren and our grandchildren that we have provided for their future. \nBy enacting my and Senator Enzi's plan, we can maintain responsible \nspending levels within the Federal Government while providing for \nfuture generations.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Wyoming and look forward to the \nSenate's action on this plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I too rise as an original cosponsor to \nexpress my support for the American Debt Repayment Act and to \ncongratulate Senator Allard for all of his work on this very important \nissue.\n  While Congress was not in session, I traveled several thousand miles \nacross Wyoming. At town meetings I constantly and consistently heard \ncomments such as, ``What surplus? If there is any surplus, please pay \ndown the debt. Don't squander any of it on new spending ideas.''\n  If recent CBO estimates hold true, we have the lowest deficit in \nabout 30 years. We did not get to that point by exercising fiscal \nrestraint, however. We still spent too much--nearly $1.7 trillion every \nyear. I voted against the spending portion of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 because it seemed clear more could have been done to cut down \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government and get our fiscal house \nin order faster. If not for the unexpected revenues that came as a \nresult of 7 years of economic expansion, we would not even be close to \neliminating the Federal deficit today.\n\n  In recent days, I have seen a unique attitude transformation take \nplace in this city. Even though a budget surplus, or even a zero \ndeficit--only estimated, of course--has not occurred yet, the \nadministration has not hesitated to offer over $100 billion worth of \nnew and expanded programs that would easily create a larger deficit in \nits proposed balanced budget. There are even more tax proposals. It \nseems the eye for spending is still bigger than our taxpayers' wallets.\n  Even though the economy is strong, I am surprised that so few are \nconcerned about the debt we as a nation are in danger of passing on to \nour children and our grandchildren. It seems we are tied to the \nimmediate gratification we receive from spending money, spending money \nthat we do not even have. We do not see the danger that looms in the \nnot too distant future if we do not stop spending on credit and with \nreckless abandon. That danger is a massive Federal debt and changing \ndemographics that will place a tremendous amount of pressure and burden \non young taxpayers who, if no changes are made to the entitlement \nprograms, will see a bankrupt Social Security and Medicare system and a \nmountain of debt so high and an economy so weak there will be no hope \nof paying it off. Somehow we have convinced ourselves that we deserve \nthese benefits. Meanwhile, we will will it to our children to figure \nout a way to pay for them.\n  The interest, just the interest that we are now paying on the Federal \ndebt has reached about 15 percent of the total budget outlays. That \namounts to $250 billion that cannot be used for education or military \nreadiness and our national defense or people. The only way we can cut \ndown on the amount of interest paid is to pay down the Federal debt.\n  We have a Federal debt of over $5.5 trillion. We must run budget \nsurpluses not just for 1 or 2 years but for 30 or more years to pay off \nthat debt. And the surpluses are not even projected to last that long. \nI believe the administration and Congress should heed the words of the \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He noted in his \ntestimony to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, January 29, 1998, \nthat we should be cautious in our spending because Federal revenues are \nnot guaranteed and they may fall short of our expectations.\n  He again advised that ``we should be aiming for budgetary surpluses \nand using the proceeds to retire outstanding Federal debt.'' That will \nkeep the economy sound and protect Social Security.\n  The American Debt Repayment Act follows the advice of Chairman \nGreenspan. It requires budgetary surpluses every year, with these \nsurpluses going toward payment of the Federal debt. These payments \nwould amortize the debt over the next 30 years, similar to house \nmortgage payments, only on a $5.5 trillion mansion. Anyone who \npurchases the house must pay the mortgage that accompanies it. Why \nshould the Federal Government be exempt from a similar requirement? \nIt's the ethical thing to do, and it just makes sound economic sense. \nYes, we bought a house for us and our kids, and we will pass on the \nhouse and the debt. But let's be sure it's a responsible debt with the \npayments current.\n  Now is the time to start making these mortgage payments and begin to \nchip away at that mountain of debt. It is irresponsible, reckless, and \nselfish to wait any longer. Any delay will jeopardize the national \nsecurity and economic freedom of us, our Nation, and our children.\n  Some may ask if we can afford to do this now. In response, I would \nborrow the words of former President Ronald Reagan:\n\n       If not now, when? If not us, who?\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for his very fine statement and yield \nthe remainder of my time. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Ford, Mr. Lott, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Allard, \n        Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, \n        Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Mr. DeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Frist, \n        Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. McCain, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Roth, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n        Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S.J. Res. 40. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n               flag desecration constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great honor and reverence that I \nrise today with my friend and colleague, Senator Cleland, to introduce \na Constitutional Amendment to permit Congress to enact legislation \nprohibiting the desecration of the American flag.\n  Mr. President, symbols are important. They remind us of who, and \nwhat, we are. Those of us who are married, for example, wear wedding \nrings to symbolize the commitment we have made to share our lives with \nanother person. For those of us who are Christians, the cross serves to \nremind us of the importance of faith and sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nSimilarly, Jews unite behind the Star of David, which tells them they \nare of an ancient faith and lineage. These representations are not \ntrivial. They help bind us together and give us a common identity.\n  In similar fashion, the American flag serves as a symbol of our great \nnation. As a religious symbol serves to remind its adherents of their \ncommon identity, the flag represents in a way nothing else can, the \ncommon bond shared by an otherwise diverse people. Whatever our \ndifferences of party, race, religion, or socio-economic status, the \nflag reminds us that we are very much one people, united in a shared \ndestiny, bonded in a common faith in our nation.\n  Nearly a decade ago, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens reminded \nus of the significance of our unique emblem when he wrote:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas. . . . So it is with the American flag. It is \n     more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, \n     and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling \n     colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of \n     equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill \n     for other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  Justice Stevens' words ring true. After all, for over 200 years, this \nproud banner has symbolized hope, opportunity, justice and, most of \nall, freedom, not just to the people of this nation, but to people all \nover the world.\n  Perhaps no three events symbolize the importance of this national \nsymbol better than the great battle to our North that gave rise to our \nnational anthem, the ``Star Spangled Banner''; the raising of the \nAmerican flag on the Island of Iwo Jima by United States Marines during \nWorld War II; and the planting of the flag upon the moon.\n  When Francis Scott Key, imprisoned on a ship in Baltimore Harbor, \nlooked to the besieged Fort McHenry he penned the immortal question ``O \nsay does that star spangled banner yet waive, o'er the land of the free \nand the home of the brave?'' That dark night, he witnessed the \nbombardment of the fort, and knew that if it fell, the tide of the war \ncould turn. In the early morning light, Key gazed out across the water \nto see if the fledgling nation had survived. And one glorious symbol \ngave him his answer.\n  In the second verse of our great national anthem, Key described what \nhe saw: ``On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, where \nthe foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes--What is that which the \nbreeze o'er the towering steep--as it fitfully blows, half conceals, \nhalf discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam in \nfull glory reflected now shines on the stream. `Tis the Star Spangled \nBanner, Oh long may it wave o'er the land of the free and the home of \nthe brave.'' When Francis Scott Key looked out that morning, oh how he \nmust have felt to have seen that yes, that banner did wave and that the \nhope of the nation was preserved.\n  At a similarly cricial point in this nation's history, Americans \nrallied around a photograph of United States Marines raising the flag \non the island of Iwo Jima during World War II. That heroic image, \nimmortalized in the Marine Corps Memorial next to Arlington National \nCemetery, instantly came to symbolize the determination and courage of \nall the brave Americans fighting in that great struggle for the very \nsurvival of America as a free nation. Seeing the American flag raised \non an island so close to the enemy's shore, so far from home, gave the \ncountry the will it needed to fight on.\n  Fifty years later, the planting of the flag on that small pacific \nisland remains one of our nation's most powerful images, reminding us \nthat throughout our history, through the generations, from the Battle \nof Bunker Hill, to the Civil War, to Operation Desert Storm, on every \ncontinent and ocean, in every corner of the world, Americans have \nfought, and in many cases given their lives, fighting under this flag \nfor the nation and the ideals it represents.\n  And who can forget the fact that the greatest honor bestowed upon \nthose who have died in battle or otherwise given great service to this \nnation, is to have the flag draped over their caskets. It is a reminder \nto the living that they owe their freedoms to those who have fallen and \na promise to the dead that their country has not forgotten them.\n  It is not only in war that this national symbol has served to unite \nus. Few who saw it live on television will forget the moment when Neal \nArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the American flag on the moon. This \nmoment, perhaps more than any other, demonstrated that we are a nation \nof restless explorers, of dreamers, always ready to reach for the \nstars. The flag planted upon that alien soil was a testimony to the \nhard work, the ingenuity, and the pioneer spirit of the American \npeople.\n  I am therefore proud to rise today to introduce a constitutional \namendment that would restore to Congress the right to protect our \nunique national symbol, the American flag, from acts of physical \ndesecration.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not, nor should it \nbe, a partisan issue. Fifty four Senators, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, have joined with Senator Cleland and myself as original \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  Now, some have argued that this Amendment actually violates American \nprinciples. They contend that preventing the physical desecration of \nthe flag actually tramples on the sacred right of Americans to speak \nfreely. I disagree. Restoring legal protection to the American flag \nwould not infringe on free speech. If burning the flag were the only \nmeans of expressing dissatisfaction with the nation's policies, then I, \ntoo, might oppose this amendment. But we live in a free and open \nsociety. Those who wish to express their political opinions may do so \nin the media, in newspaper editorials, in peaceful demonstrations, and \nthrough their power to vote.\n  Certainly, smashing in the doors of the State Department may be a way \nof expressing one's dissatisfaction with the nation's foreign policy \nobjectives. And one may even consider such behavior speech. Laws, \nhowever, can be enacted preventing such actions--in large part because \nthere are peaceful alternatives that can be equally powerful. After \nall, right here in the United States Senate, we prohibit speeches or \ndemonstrations of any kind, even the silent display of signs or \nbanners, in the public galleries. As a society, we can and do place \nlimitations on both speech and conduct.\n  Moreover, contrary to the claims of some, restoring legal protection \nto the American flag would not overturn or otherwise constrict the \nFirst Amendment. Rather, it would merely overturn an interpretation of \nthat amendment by the Supreme Court, in which the Court, by the \nnarrowest of margins, held that flag burning was a form of protected \nfree speech. I believe the Court's majority had it wrong--that its \ndecision flew in the face of over 200 years of American history: \nburning the flag is conduct--conduct for which there exists numerous \npeaceful alternatives--and may be prohibited. The amendment Senator \nCleland and I propose would correct the Supreme Court's error and \nrestore to Congress and the States the power they historically had to \nprotect the American flag from acts of physical desecration.\n  Nor would restoring legal protection to the American flag place us on \na slippery slope to limit other freedoms. The flag is unique as our \nnational symbol. There is no other symbol, no other object, which \nrepresents our nation as does the flag. Accordingly, there is no basis \nfor concern that the protection we seek for the American flag could be \nextended to cover any other object or form of political expression.\n  For many years, our flag was protected, by federal laws and laws in \n48 states, from acts of physical desecration. No one can seriously \nargue that freedom of speech or freedom of expression was diminished or \ncurtailed during that period. Restoring the protection of law to our \nflag would not prevent the expression, in numerous ways safeguarded \nunder the Constitution, of a single idea or thought.\n  I would note that the effort to restore legal protection to our \nnational symbol is a movement of the American people. It has been \ninitiated by grassroot Americans; numerous civic, veterans and \npatriotic organizations, led by the American Legion, joined together in \nthe Citizens Flag Alliance, working to build support across this\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nnation for a constitutional amendment to restore the historical \nprotection of our flag. And forty-six states have passed resolutions \nurging Congress to send a flag protection amendment to the states for \nratification.\n  That is no small support. I believe we need to support them.\n  I therefore think that the will of the people should not be \nfrustrated by this body. This resolution should be adopted, and the \nflag amendment sent to the states for their approval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the proposed \namendment be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 40\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within 7 years after the date of its submission for \n     ratification:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very honored to be a cosponsor with my \ndear friend from Georgia, Senator Cleland. I appreciate the efforts he \nhas put forth in this battle, and having served in the military as he \nhas done with such distinction and with such courage and heroism I \nthink we ought to all listen to him and I for one will certainly do \nthat. I am proud and privileged to be able to work with him. So I yield \nthe floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. I \napplaud his stalwart leadership on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of a Constitutional amendment \nto prohibit the physical desecration of the United States flag.\n  Like many Americans, I was troubled when the Supreme Court ruled in \ntwo cases, Texas v. Johnson, and United States v. Eichman, that \nstatutes protecting the United States flag were unconstitutional \nviolations of the First Amendment right to free speech. I respected the \nwisdom of the Justices of the Supreme Court, yet I was saddened that we \nno longer were able to rely upon statutory authority to protect the \nflag.\n  I was especially saddened in light of the views expressed by such \ndistinguished past and present Supreme Court Justices as Justices \nHarlan, Warren, Fortas, Black, White, Rehnquist, Blackmun, Stevens, and \nO'Connor. These Justices have each supported the view that nothing in \nthe Constitution prohibits the states or the federal government from \nprotecting the flag. Nonetheless, the current Supreme Court view \nstands. That is what brings us here today.\n  The flag is not a mere symbol. It is not just a symbol of America. It \nIS America. It is what we stand for. It is what we believe in. It is \nsacred.\n  I do not have to tell the Senate what the flag means.\n  Just ask the soldier who proudly marches behind the flag what it \nmeans to salute the flag of the United States.\n  Ask the newly sworn citizen what it means to claim the flag of the \nUnited States for his or her own.\n  Ask the grieving widow or mother of a slain soldier who is presented \nwith the flag that draped the soldier's casket.\n  Being from the South and being a history major in college, it was \nonly natural that I become a student of the Civil War. For those who do \nnot believe in the flag, I would point to the literally hundreds of \ncitations given to men in battle during the Civil War for acts of valor \nassociated with the flag.\n  Soldiers were routinely awarded the Medal of Honor, America's highest \nmilitary award, for defending the United States flag and carrying it \nforward into battle. Many of these awards were awarded posthumously. \nThese brave men knew the meaning of the flag.\n  The flag unites Americans as no symbol can. Only God and the United \nStates Constitution itself stand above the flag.\n  Everywhere history has been made in this country, the flag has been \npresent.\n  It was the United States flag that inspired our National Anthem.\n  It was an American flag that was raised when Jesse Owens stunned Nazi \nGermany.\n  It was a United States flag that was hoisted in Iwo Jima.\n  It was the United States flag that was planted on the Moon.\n  Those who would desecrate the flag would desecrate America. I cannot \nstand by that. Therefore, I stand for a Constitutional amendment.\n  This amendment is simple. It vests only Congress with the authority \nto protect the flag through statute. We need not fear that the states \nwill create a hodge-podge of flag protection statutes. Instead, \nCongress can create one uniform statute for the entire nation.\n  According to opinion surveys, 3 out of every 4 Americans support \nprotecting the flag from desecration. Forty-nine states have enacted \nresolutions to calling on Congress to pass a flag protection amendment. \nI believe we ought to let the American people decide this important \nmatter. Therefore, I lend my support to efforts to send this initiative \nto the American people for ratification.\n  Unfortunately, it has been the Senate that has blocked these efforts. \nThe House has twice passed resolutions that would begin the formal \nprocess of amending the Constitution to protect the flag. The Senate \nhas failed to respond to the overwhelming majority view of the American \npeople.\n  I believe now is an especially important time to reinforce our \nsupport for the American flag. The United States is unquestionably the \nworld's only remaining superpower. Our leadership around the world is \nunrivaled. The principles of democracy and freedom that guided our \nforefathers in establishing our great nation are seen as shining \nexamples for the world.\n  Everywhere that communism has failed, where dictators have been \noverthrown, where tyranny has been rooted out, people look to America. \nAnd it is an American flag that leads our ambassadors, our troops, our \ncitizens, and our hope as we lend our support and leadership to those \nnations struggling to overcome their past.\n  People who seek asylum from religious, political, and ethnic \npersecution look for an American flag flying over our embassies abroad \nto guide them to the place where their human rights will be respected \nand protected.\n  Let us now send a strong signal to the world that we truly cherish \nthis great symbol. Let us now use this opportunity to show the world \nthat we reaffirm our commitment to the ideals the flag stands for.\n  Indeed, as Supreme Court Justice Stevens said in his dissent from \nTexas v. Johnson:\n\n       The freedom and ideals of liberty, equality, and tolerance \n     that the flag symbolizes and embodies have motivated our \n     nation's leaders, soldiers, and activists to pledge their \n     lives, liberty, and their honor in defense of their country. \n     Because our history has demonstrated that these values and \n     ideals are worth fighting for, the flag which uniquely \n     symbolizes their power is itself worthy of protection from \n     physical desecration.\n\n  These are powerful, wise words. Words we should all heed.\n  Let us now stand in support of the Flag of the United States of \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this joint resolution, the Flag \nDesecration Constitutional Amendment, proposes an Amendment to the \nConstitution that would empower Congress to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of our Flag. I am proud to join Senator Hatch and my other \ncolleagues as a sponsor.\n  Two years ago the Senate came close to passing this amendment. At \nthat time, ninety percent of Alaskans who contacted me supported this \neffort. I am confident their stance has not changed. Alaskans support \nour flag and the freedom it represents. Alaskans strongly support the \nprotection of this symbol of freedom.\n  Our flag has a special place in my heart and the hearts of all \nAmericans. As those who have served overseas know, the flag was our \nreminder of America and our freedom. Freedom much greater than any \ncountry ever offers. Our missions oveaseas were to protect that freedom \nand the flag\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nwhich symbolizes it. Too many have devoted their lives for our country \nfor us not to protect its most sacred symbol.\n  Forty-eight states had laws preventing flag desecration before the \nSupreme Court struck them down. The flag is a direct symbol of our \ncountry. Fifty stars for fifty states. I remember the day the forty-\nninth star was pinned on the flag. Having played a role in the Alaska \nstatehood movement, I can say it was one of the proudest moments in my \nlife. I support every effort to preserve the sanctity of America's \nflag.\n  The Supreme Court has given us a choice. We can accept that the First \nAmendment allows the desecration of America's flag. Or we can change \nthe law to prevent it. The power to amend the Constitution demands a \ncautious respect. It is a considerable power--one that has helped chart \nthe course of our history. We should not jump headlong into amendments. \nBut we should not be afraid to act on our beliefs, either. The people \nof Alaska are strong in their belief that our flag should not be \ndesecrated, and we support this amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I add my name as an original cosponsor \nof a constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of \nthe American flag.\n  I know that there are many who believe that the desecration of our \ncountry's flag is the ultimate expression of their political freedoms, \nbut I do not believe all speech is free. Our country pays a price when \nwe see demonstrations which tear down our standard bearer of national \nintegrity. Our flag represents the values upon which this nation was \nfounded and our charter of government established in Philadelphia in \n1787. When we no longer value the flag as a symbol of national unity \nand allegiance to this compact, our Republic is weakened.\n  Burning our country's flag is not political free speech, it is \npolitical garbage. As a society, we have placed parameters on free \nspeech. A person who shouts fire in a crowded theater does not enjoy \nthe protection of freedom of speech. A person whose words incite \nviolence does not enjoy the protection of the First Amendment. I firmly \nbelieve that no legitimate act of political protest should be \nsuppressed. Nor should we ever discourage debate and discussion about \nthe Federal government. However, to allow the physical desecration of \nour national symbol is to allow the ties that bind us as a country, the \nties that bind one generation to the next in their love and respect for \nthis country, to be weakened. When we no longer value our flag, we lose \nvalue for our country, our government, and each other.\n  Over two hundred years after the ratification of our nation's Bill of \nRights, the United States Supreme Court erroneously ruled that the \ndesecration of our national symbol is protected speech in the case of \nTexas vs. Johnson. In response to this decision, the United States \nSenate overwhelmingly passed the Flag Protection Act, which was also \ndeclared unconstitutional by the high court. The Supreme Court's action \nhas made it clear that a constitutional amendment is necessary for \nenactment of any binding protection of the flag. Up to this point, \nneither House of Congress has been able to garner the two-thirds super \nmajority necessary for passage of a constitutional amendment. But \nbecause grassroots support for this amendment continues to grow, I have \njoined with members on both sides of the aisle to again try passing \nthis amendment. I am hopeful that this time we will get the necessary \nvotes.\n  Let me close by recalling the words of a Union Soldier in his last \nletter to his wife dated July 14, 1861. He said, ``my courage does not \nhalt or falter. I know how American civilization now bears upon the \ntriumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went \nbefore us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution, and I am \nwilling, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life to \nhelp maintain this government and pay that debt.''\n  Today, our task here in the Senate seems trivial in comparison. But \nif we want the flag that hangs in school rooms, over courthouses, in \nsports stadiums and off front porches all across America, to continue \nsymbolizing that same commitment to country, then it is a challenge we \ncannot fail to meet.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, we begin the process of restoration. \nRestoration and renewal. Today, we look to our past, our history, as \nprologue of our future. We examine the events of recent years in the \ncontext of history in an effort to restore and renew our faith in this \nplace we call America. They lynchpin of this process will be our \nrestoration of what our flag--our American flag, the flag of these \nUnited States, the flag of what our founders referred to as ``We, the \nPeople''--means to us as a people, as citizens, as people united in the \ncommon cause of Freedom.\n  Our flag is no mere piece of cloth, even a brightly-colored piece of \ncloth--it is the symbol of our nation, and it stands for our ideals, \nour freedom, our hopes and dreams and, yes, our faith in our nation and \nin one another.\n  Let's consider this common cause, freedom. Some may say that we need \nno symbols to embody this cause. I might agree with those people if I \nhad no knowledge of our history or how the American flag is viewed by \npeople around the world.\n  For many, in this country and around the world, the American flag is \nthe symbol of the freedom that they long for, that they strive to \nachieve and to preserve and that they honor. America has been called a \n``melting pot'', where people of many cultures and nationalities come \ntogether to live, work and raise their families. Immigrants all, save \nthose native Americans whose roots in this land we must also continue \nto honor and preserve, we recognize our fortune derived by living in a \ncountry where we don't merely talk about freedom, we practice and work \nto preserve it.\n  Symbols such as our flag don't just appear and receive acceptance. \nThe flag hanging at the Smithsonian didn't come to be so large by \nchance--those who made that flag wanted our people to see it waving in \nthe breeze and take cheer and for our opponents to see it and beware. \nThe flag was born in our struggle for independence, and continues to \nexist in our struggle to ensure freedom for all Americans and other \npeoples of this world.\n  Our flag has survived burning and desecration in this country and in \nother countries. It will survive, as will our faith in our country and \nour freedoms, no matter the strength of our enemies. We who believe in \nthis country must recognize that our symbols, such as our flag, are \nimportant and must be protected and preserved for they are the very \nembodiment of the ideals, hopes and dreams they stand for. We must \nprotect our flag just as we would protect those ideals.\n  In 1942, Congress recognized that the flag should be treated in a way \nmore special than the way we treat any other symbol. That year, the \nCongress enacted the Flag Code to set requirements for how the flag \nshould be displayed and honored. In that day and time, the question was \nnot how to prevent destruction and desecration but merely to set rules \nfor the care and handling of the flag. There was no thought given to \ndoing what we propose to do today because it was beyond thought that \nconditions would exist in this country that would require such action. \nEven then, Congress recognized that with freedom comes responsibility. \nIt is time that we recognize that responsibility again as our \npredecessors in the Congress in 1942 did.\n\n  Mr. President, I will close by quoting from an address in 1914 by \nFranklin K. Lane, then Secretary of the Interior, to the employees of \nthe Department of the Interior on Flag Day, commenting on what the flag \nmight say to us if it could speak:\n\n     I am song and fear, struggle and panic, and ennobling hope.\n     I am the day's work of the weakest man, and the largest dream \n           of the most daring.\n     I am the Constitution and the courts, statutes and the \n           statute-makers, soldier and dreadnaught, drayman and \n           street sweep, cook, counselor, and clerk.\n     I am the battle of yesterday and the mistake of tomorrow.\n     I am the mystery of the men who do without knowing why.\n     I am the clutch of an idea and the reasoned purpose of \n           resolution.\n     I am no more than what you believe me to be, and I am all \n           that you believe I can be.\n     I am what you make me, nothing more.\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\n     I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol \n           of yourself, the pictured suggestion of that big thing \n           which makes this nation. My stars and stripes are your \n           dream and your labors. They are bright with cheer, \n           brilliant with courage, firm with faith, because you \n           have made them so out of your hearts. For you are the \n           makers of the flag and it is well that you glory in the \n           making.\n\n  Mr. President, we made this flag as we made this nation. We can \ndestroy this flag or we can protect and preserve it, just as we can \ndestroy this nation or we can protect and preserve it.\n  The choice is clear. The result is in our hands. As for me, I pledge \nallegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the \nRepublic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with \nliberty and justice for all.\n  I urge the adoption and passage of this Constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee Senator Hatch, and others in introducing a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag of the \nUnited States of America. In the 104th Congress we fell a mere four \nvotes shy of the two-thirds majority needed for the Senate's approval \nof a similar amendment. I encourage my colleagues to join in this \neffort and hope we will be able to address this matter before the end \nof the year.\n  In a 1989 Supreme Court case, Texas versus Johnson, the Court \nerroneously ruled, by the narrowest of margins, 5 to 4, that flag \nburning is a constitutionally protected expression of First Amendment \nfree speech rights. Again in 1990, in U.S. versus Eichman, the Supreme \nCourt protected flag desecration by declaring unconstitutional a \nfederal statute designed to protect our flag. I remain dumbfounded by \nthese decisions. Former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, generally \nregarded as a First Amendment absolutist once stated ``It passes my \nbelief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from \nmaking the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.'' It \npasses my belief as well.\n  It is my belief that the American flag does not belong to one person; \nit belongs to the American people. When an individual desecrates a flag \nI believe he does not destroy private property but a national symbol, a \npublic monument. Just as an individual cannot spray paint the \nWashington Monument as an exercise of free speech, nor should he be \nable to vandalize the American flag. I believe the American flag is \n``franchised'' to individuals who wish to display it. Thus, those who \nchoose to display an American flag have an obligation to the American \npeople and to the country to maintain and respect it.\n  For more than 200 years Old Glory has symbolized hope, opportunity, \njustice and most of all, freedom. For this very reason our flag was \nprotected from desecration by federal laws and laws in 48 states for \nmany years. It is the will of the people that the States and Congress \nhave the power to protect our national symbol. Let us now act on that \nwill.\n  Mr. President, it is my firm belief that this constitutional \namendment would protect our flag without jeopardizing the First \nAmendment. It would overturn these erroneous interpretations and would \nplace flag desecration in the same category as other forms of illegal \nexpression including libel, slander and obscenity. I believe the unique \nnature of Old Glory ensures a constitutional amendment protecting it \nfrom desecration would not impinge upon citizens' First Amendment \nrights nor would it establish a dangerous precedent. It would simply \nprohibit offensive conduct with respect to our nation's most revered \nsymbol. I urge my colleagues to support this most important amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed \namendment to the United States Constitution to prevent desecration of \nour great national symbol. In 1995, I was an original co-sponsor of an \namendment to the Constitution designed to protect the symbol of our \nnation and its ideals. When that resolution was defeated narrowly, we \nvowed that this issue would not go away and it has not. I stand here, \nagain, today to declare the necessity of protecting the Flag of the \nUnited States of America and what it represents.\n  Thoughout our history, the Flag has held a special place in the minds \nof Americans. As the appearance of the Flag changed with the addition \nof stars as the nation grew, its core meaning to the American people \nremained constant. It represents no particular perspective, political \nagenda, or religious belief. Instead, it symbolizes an ideal, not just \nfor Americans, but for all those who honor the great American \nexperiment. It represents a shared ideal of freedom. The Flag stands in \nthis chamber and in our court rooms; it is draped over our honored \ndead; it flies at half-mast to mourn those we wish to respect; and it \nis the subject of our National Anthem, our National March and our \nPledge of Allegiance. As the Chief Justice noted in his dissent in \nTexas v. Johnson (1989), ``[t]he American flag, then, throughout more \nthan 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol \nembodying our nation * * * Millions and millions of Americans regard it \nwith an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, \npolitical, or philosophical beliefs they may have.''\n  There can be little doubt that the people of this country fully \nsupport preserving and protecting the American Flag. The people's \nelected representatives reflected that vast public support by enacting \nFlag protection statutes at both the State and Federal levels. \nRegrettably, the Supreme Court thwarted the people's will--and \ndiscarded the judgment of state legislatures and the Congress that \nprotecting the Flag is fully consistent with our Constitution--by \nholding that the American flag is just another piece of cloth for which \nno minimum of respect may be demanded. As a consequence, that which \nrepresents the struggles of those who came before us; which symbolizes \nthe sacrifice of hundreds; and for which many men and women have died \ncannot be recognized for what it truly is--a national treasure in need \nof protection.\n  Further, the question must be asked, what is the legacy we are \nleaving our children? At a time when our nation's virtues are too \nrarely extolled by our national leaders, and national pride is \ndismissed by many as arrogance, America needs, more than ever, \nsomething to celebrate. At a time when our political leaders are \nembroiled in scandalous allegations, we need a national symbol that is \nbeyond reproach. America needs its Flag untainted, representing more \nthan some flawed agenda, but this extraordinary nation. The Flag, and \nthe freedom for which it stands, has a unique ability to unite us as \nAmericans. Whatever our disagreements, we are united in our respect for \nthe Flag. We should not allow the healing and unifying power of the \nFlag to become a source of divisiveness.\n  The protection that the people seek for the Flag does not threaten \nthe sacred rights afforded by the First Amendment. I sincerely doubt \nthat the Framers intended the First Amendment of the Constitution to \nprevent state legislatures and Congress from protecting the Flag of the \nnation for which they shed their blood. At the time of the Supreme \nCourt's decision, the tradition of protecting the Flag was too firmly \nestablished to suggest that such laws are inconsistent with our \nconstitutional traditions. Many of the state laws were based on the \nUniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that time, or for 70 years \nafterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the First Amendment. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska statute preventing \ncommercial use of the Flag in 1907 in Halter v. Nebraska. As the Chief \nJustice stated in his dissent, ``I cannot agree that the First \nAmendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 \nStates which make criminal the public burning of the flag.''\n  Nor do I accept the notion that amending the Constitution to overrule \nthe Supreme Court's decision in the specific context of desecration of \nthe Flag will somehow undermine the First Amendment as it is applied in \nother contexts. This amendment does not create a slippery slope which \nwill lead to the erosion of Americans' right to free speech. The Flag \nis wholly unique. It has no rightful comparison. An amendment \nprotecting the Flag from desecration will provide no aid or comfort in \nany future campaigns to restrict speech. Moreover, an amendment banning \nthe desecration of the Flag\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\ndoes not limit the content of any true speech. As Justice Stevens noted \nin his dissent in Johnson v. Texas, ``[t]he concept of `desecration' \ndoes not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to \nconvey, but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious \noffence.'' Likewise, the act of desecrating the Flag does not have any \ncontent in and of itself. The act takes meaning and expresses conduct \nonly in the context of the true speech which accompanies the act. And \nthat speech remains unregulated. As the Chief Justice noted, ``flag \nburning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it \nseems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any \nparticular idea, but to antagonize others.''\n  In sum there is no principle or fear that should stand as an obstacle \nto our protection of the Flag. It is my earnest hope that by Amending \nthe Constitution to prohibit its desecration, this body will protect \nthe heritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom and honor that the Flag \nuniquely represents.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hatch in \nintroducing the joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment \nto protect from physical desecration the flag of the United States. \nThis is the same resolution that the House has passed, and we hope it \nwill soon be passed by this body and sent to the American people for \nratification.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember the time I came to this Senate \nfloor with memorials from forty-three state legislatures, urging \nCongress to take action to protect the American flag from physical \ndesecration. Those memorials were inserted in the Congressional Record \nfor all to read. Today that number has swelled to forty-nine states, \neleven more than are needed to ratify an amendment\n  Since this amendment was proposed in 1989, poll after poll has found \nthat eighty percent of the American people consistently support a flag \nprotection amendment. These polls have been performed in times when \nflag burnings have been more frequent, and times when the flag burners \nhave been fairly quiet; yet the result is always the same--Americans \nwant the flag protected.\n  Mr. President, today, we have an opportunity to respond to the \nAmerican people by passing this resolution and sending a very simple \namendment to the states for ratification. This amendment authorizes \nCongress to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates. It is a very straight-forward proposal, and the only way this \ngoal can be accomplished, according to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Our flag, which predates our Constitution, articulates ``America,'' \nmore clearly than any other symbol does. Our flag represents the \ntapestry of diverse people that is America--as well as the values, \ntraditions, and aspirations that bind us together as a nation. It waves \nas a patriotic symbol of our values. It's amazing to see how our flag \ncaptures basic American values and inspires people to protect them. In \nreturn, the vast majority of the American people want our flag \nprotected from acts of intentional, public desecration.\n  We have many songs for our flag and have even named it Old Glory. \nThat's because our flag holds a special place in our hearts. No other \nemblem of our nation has been defended as a symbol of freedom so \nanimatedly. No other symbol has brought our country closer together, \ndedicated to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No other \ntoken has drawn immigrants to our nation, with the promise of \ndemocracy. No other artifact inspires us to rise to the same level of \ndignity and patriotism.\n  Our flag's leading troops into battle is an American tradition, \ninspiring both families at home and those on the front lines; it has \ninspired men and women to great accomplishments; it flies over our \ngovernment buildings because it symbolizes our republic; it is \ndisplayed in our schools as a reminder of the importance of learning \nand our desire for an educated people; it is flown from the front of \nour homes because we are proud to be Americans and we are proud of the \ncontributions our nation has made; it waves above our places of \nbusiness as a testament to the free enterprise system; it hangs in our \nhouses of worship as a symbol of our freedom to worship God as our \nconscience dictates. The flag represents the values, traditions and \naspirations that bind us together as a nation. It stands above our \ndifferences and unites us in war and peace.\n  The American people want an amendment to protect the flag from \ndesecration, and they should be given the opportunity to ratify it. We, \nas servants of the American people, shouldn't act as stumbling blocks. \nInstead, we should respond by passing this resolution. If the American \npeople don't want this amendment, they can vote to reject it. However, \nwe should remember that already more than three million people have \nsigned petitions asking Congress to pass a flag-protection amendment \nand send it to the states for ratification. This is the first step in \nthat process.\n  Flag desecration is offensive to the majority of Americans. To \npublicly desecrate even one flag promotes nothing worthwhile in our \nsociety, communicates no clear message, and tears at the fabric of our \nnation. Chief Justice William Rehnquist said, ``One of the high \npurposes of a democratic society is to legislate against conduct that \nis regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of \npeople--whether it be murder, embezzlement, pollution, or flag \nburning.'' The U.S. flag is more than just a piece of cloth. It \nrepresents the fabric of our nation. I urge my colleagues to listen to \nthe voice of the American people and join us in protecting our flag.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to join \nSenators Hatch and Cleland and others, as an original co-sponsor of \nS.J. Res. 40, the proposed constitutional amendment to protect our \nNation's flag.\n  The act of flag burning--or any other kind of flag desecration--is an \naggressive, provocative act. It is also an act of violence against the \nsymbol of America--our flag. Even more disturbing, it is an act of \nviolence against our country's values and principles. The Constitution \nguarantees freedom, but it also seeks to assure, in the words of the \nPreamble, ``domestic Tranquility.''\n  Many Americans have given their lives to protect freedom and \ndemocracy as symbolized by the flag. In my own family, my father died \nin a service-related accident during World War II. Our family was \npresented with his burial flag. That flag means a great deal to our \nfamily--and we believe that the flag deserves protection under the law.\n  Some people believe that outlawing desecration of the flag--which \nthis Constitutional Amendment would authorize the Congress to do--would \nlead to the destruction of ``freedom.'' I disagree. Our Constitution \nwas carefully crafted to protect our freedom, but also to promote \nresponsibility. We are stepping on dangerous ground when we allow \nreckless behavior such as flag burning or other forms of physical \ndesecration of the flag.\n  The Constitution that our Nation's Founders fashioned has survived \nthe tests of time, but it has also been amended on 27 occasions. Under \nour Constitution, the Supreme Court does not have more power than the \npeople. The people do not have to accept every Supreme Court decision--\nbecause ultimate authority rests in the Constitution, which the people \nhave the power to amend.\n  The idea of amending the Constitution is serious business. We have \nfound, however, that a simple statute is not enough. We tried that, and \nthe Court struck it down. We must stand for something or we stand for \nnothing. I stand for a constitutional amendment authorizing Congress to \nban flag desecration and I am confident that we will succeed in passing \nit in this Congress and submitting it to the States for ratification.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the people of the United States \nrevere the American flag as a unique symbol of our great nation. It \nsymbolizes the national unity that exists among diverse people, the \ncommon bond that binds us and makes us Americans. We are a nation that \nis defined by democracy. The flag symbolizes this democracy not only to \nourselves, but to all other nations. It is through this democratic \nprocess that we feel free to exercise and enjoy the many liberties \nguaranteed to us.\n  Over the years, Congress has reflected respect and devotion to the \nAmerican flag. In 1931, it declared the Star Spangled Banner to be our \nnational anthem, and in 1949, established\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\nJune 14 as Flag Day. In 1987, Congress designated John Philip Sousa's \n`The Stars and Stripes Forever' as the national march. Congress also \nhas established detailed rules for the design and the proper display of \nthe flag. Today, we have an opportunity to add one more important \ngesture of support for our national symbol, to pass an amendment that \nprohibits the physical desecration of the Flag of the United States.\n  Since 1990, 49 states have passed memorializing resolutions calling \non Congress to pass a flag desecration amendment for consideration by \nthe states.\n  Public opinion surveys have consistently shown that nearly 80 percent \nof all Americans support a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag \ndesecration and do not believe that freedom of speech is jeopardized by \nthis protection. Among the grassroots groups that endorse this \nlegislation is the Citizens Flag Alliance, an alliance comprised of 119 \ncivic, patriotic and veterans organizations, including The American \nLegion, AMVETS, the Knights of Columbus, the National Grange, the Grand \nLodge, Fraternal Order of Police, and the African-American Women's \nClergy Association.\n  This amendment, grants Congress and the states the power to prohibit \nphysical desecration of the flag, but does not amend the First \nAmendment.\n  If we want to embrace the will of the American people, if we want to \nreserve the flag's unique status as our nation's most revered and \nprofound symbol, and if we believe the flag is important enough to \nprotect from physical desecration, then we should pass this \nConstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original \ncosponsor of a proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n  I have fought to achieve Constitutional protection for the flag ever \nsince the Supreme Court first legitimized flag burning in the case of \nTexas v. Johnson in 1989. To date, we have not been successful in out \nefforts to pass a Constitutional amendment by the required two-thirds \nmajority.\n  However, we have come close, and, most importantly, we have refused \nto quit. Last year, the House passed the amendment with the necessary \nvotes, and I am very hopeful that we will follow suit in the Senate \nthis year.\n  Some say that burning or defacing the American flag is not widespread \nenough or important enough for a constitutional amendment. I could not \ndisagree more.\n  Since the birth of the Republic, the flag has been our most \nrecognizable and revered symbol of democracy. It represents our Nation, \nour national ideals, and out proud heritage.\n  Men and women of our Armed Forces have put their lives on the line to \ndefend the principles and ideals that the flag represents. Soldiers \nhave risked and even lost their lives to prevent the flag from falling.\n  To say that the flag is not important enough to protect is to say \nthat the values that hold us together as a Nation are not worth \ndefending.\n  Flag burning may be rare, but even it is, it is not acceptable--I \nrepeat, it is not acceptable. It is not tolerable. I hate to see anyone \nburn or deface the flag to make some statement. Why should society let \neven one person wrap themselves around some absolute interpretation of \nthe First Amendment to protect indefensible speech? Have we focused so \nmuch on the rights of the individual that we have forgotten the rights \nof the people?\n  It is clear that the American public strongly favors this amendment. \nOpinion polls register overwhelming support. Every state except one has \npassed resolutions calling for a Constitutional amendment to protect \nthe flag. It is a feeling of great pride to know of the sincere \nnational patriotism that this support represents.\n  The House has already acted. It is now our turn in the Senate. We \nhave a profound responsibility to pass this constitutional amendment as \nquickly as possible so that it can go to the States for ratification.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to join us in this great \neffort to restore protection for the American flag. The flag of the \nUnited States, the symbol of freedom and democracy, must always be \nprotected, and forever wave over the land of the free and the home of \nthe brave.\n\n

KANSAS BASKETBALL PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas in 1898, the ``Father of Basketball'', Dr. James \n     Naismith, became the first basketball coach at the University \n     of Kansas;\n       Whereas Dr. Forrest ``Phog'' Allen, considered one of \n     college basketball's most successful coaches, succeeded Dr. \n     James Naismith, winning 746 games, 24 conference \n     championships, 2 Helms Foundation National Championships, and \n     1 National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in \n     this resolution as ``NCAA'') Championship;\n       Whereas Dr. Allen was influential in forming the National \n     Association of Basketball Coaches, lobbied to make basketball \n     an Olympic sport, and was a key individual in the formation \n     of the NCAA Basketball Tournament;\n       Whereas University of Kansas graduates who played \n     basketball under Dr. Allen, including Adolph Rupp, Dean \n     Smith, Ralph Miller, and Dutch Lonborg, went on to achieve \n     unparalleled success as college basketball coaches;\n       Whereas 13 University of Kansas alumni, including Wilt \n     Chamberlain and Clyde Lovellette, are members of the Naismith \n     Basketball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas the jerseys of Danny Manning, Charlie Black, B.H. \n     Born, Paul Endacott, Wilt Chamberlain, and Ray Evans were \n     retired by the University of Kansas because of their \n     achievements on the basketball floor as University of Kansas \n     Jayhawks;\n       Whereas the University of Kansas men's basketball tradition \n     includes more than 1,650 victories, 44 conference \n     championships, 10 NCAA Championship Final Four appearances, 2 \n     Helms Foundation National Championships, 2 NCAA \n     Championships, in 1952 and 1988, and 10 Consensus All-\n     American players; and\n       Whereas Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas, maintains a \n     spirited atmosphere that provides the University of Kansas \n     Jayhawks an immeasurable advantage in their games: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes and honors--\n       (1) the 100 years of basketball history at the University \n     of Kansas; and\n       (2) the players, coaches, alumni, and fans of the \n     University of Kansas Jayhawks who have participated in the \n     basketball program throughout the years.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my privilege to submit a Senate \nconcurrent resolution today commending the centennial celebration of \ncollege basketball played at the University of Kansas.\n  This weekend former Jayhawk players and coaches, along with fans from \nall over the country, will gather for a reunion weekend in Lawrence, \nKansas. Festivities include a legends game, banquet, and culminate with \nthe Missouri game on Sunday afternoon. They will celebrate and honor a \ntradition that is second to none.\n  College basketball history contains many milestones and \naccomplishments achieved by the Kansas Jayhawks. Since KU's first team \nin 1898-99 the Jayhawks have had more than 1,650 victories, second only \nto North Carolina and Kentucky. Kansas has played in the NCAA \nTournament 26 times, made 10 final four appearances and won or shared \n44 conference titles. Not only can Kansas lay claim to college \nbasketball's greatest coaches, but it has ties to both its inventor and \none of its dominant players.\n  In 1898 Dr. James Naismith, only seven years removed from nailing two \npeach baskets on the wall in Springfield, Massachusetts YMCA, became \nKU's first basketball coach. Ironically, Dr. Naismith was the only \nJayhawk coach to retire with a losing record. Although Dr. Naismith's \nrecord does not reflect his ingenuity for inventing basketball, he is \nfondly remembered at KU.\n  Ten years later, Forest ``Phog'' Allen took over the reins from \nNaismith. Allen, a KU basketball letterman learned the game from his \nplaying days under Dr. Naismith and refined them so much so that he is \nreferred to as the ``father of basketball coaching.'' Off the court, \nAllen joined in the creation of the National Basketball Coaches \nAssociation, led the international effort making basketball an Olympic \nsport, and assisted in the formation of the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association Tournament. Allen compiled a record of 590-219 in \n39 years as the Jayhawks head coach. This includes 24 conference \nchampionships and one NCAA Championship. All totaled Allen won 746 \ngames, a record twice since broken by his former players.\n  One of the outstanding games in the Jayhawks 100 year history is the \n1952 NCAA championship game played in Kansas City's Municipal \nAuditorium. The Allen-coached Jayhawks won the game over St. John's \nwith Basketball Hall of Fame member Clyde Lovellette contributing 33 \npoints. Another future Hall of Famer saw limited action that night, \nDean Smith.\n  Also in the fifties, the Kansas Jayhawks added more to the history \nand legacy of college basketball. In 1957 Wilt Chamberlin led the \nJayhawks to a 24-3 record and a spot in the NCAA finals where Kansas \nwas defeated by North Carolina, 54-53 in three overtimes in what is \nconsidered one of the most exciting games in NCAA Tournament history. \nDespite the loss, Chamberlin was selected tournament MVP and was a two-\ntime All-American. Chamberlin went on to achieve great success in the \nNBA setting a single game scoring record of 100 points while with the \nPhiladelphia Warriors.\n  In recent years, Kansas Jayhawks on the court continued to add more \nhistory. Danny Manning and his all-stars persevered in their underdog \neffort that culminated in the Jayhawks 1988 victory over Big Eight \nConference rival Oklahoma and once again being crowned national \nchampions.\n  Even after reaching the pinnacle of being a national champion in \n1988, the Jayhawks are still regarded as one of the top teams in the \nnation. In his nine seasons as the Jayhawks head coach, Roy Williams \nhas led the Hawks to two Final Fours and five conference championships. \nLike all his coaching predecessors, Williams' teams excel on the\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\ncourt and off, not only preparing student athletes for difficult games, \nbut for the challenges to come in lives.\n  I would like to list for my colleagues those Kansas Jaykawks who have \nbeen elected to the Naismith Hall of Fame in Springfield, \nMassachusetts: Dr. Naismith, Phog Allen, E.C. Quigley, John Bunn, \nAdolph Rupp, Paul Endacott, Dutch Lonborg, William Johnson, John \nMcLendon, Wilt Chamberlain, Dean Smith, Clyde Lovellette, and Ralph \nMiller. In addition, KU's Lynette Woodard, who became the first woman \nto play with the Harlem Globetrotters, has also been recognized for her \nwinning endeavor on the Jaykawks women's team.\n  Mr. President, this short history cannot convey the atmosphere of \ncollege basketball played at ``Phog'' Allen Field House, which opened \nin 1955. Although it resembles a large Kansas barn, when it's filled \nwith 16,300 Jaykawkers it quickly becomes a near impossible place for \nopposing teams to win. The mood of the building is often inspiring, and \nCoach Allen's spirit is said to remain in residence and aid the \nJaykawks in times of need.\n  On this 100th anniversary of KU basketball, I want the past and \npresent fans, alumni, players and coaches to know the United States \nSenate appreciates their efforts for the past one hundred years in \ncontributing to, and perpetuating the heritage of America's unique \ngame; basketball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S401-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S402-S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 LEVIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1644\n\n  (Ordered referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.)\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Roth, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Grams, and Mr. \nCochran) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nbill (S. 981) to provide for analysis of major rules; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Improvement Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effective regulatory programs provide important \n     benefits to the public, including improving the environment, \n     worker safety, and public health. Regulatory programs also \n     impose significant costs on the public, including \n     individuals, businesses, and State, local, and tribal \n     governments.\n       (2) Improving the ability of Federal agencies to use \n     scientific and economic analysis in developing regulations \n     should yield increased benefits and more effective \n     protections while minimizing costs.\n       (3) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful \n     tools to better inform agencies in developing regulations, \n     although they do not replace the need for good judgment and \n     consideration of values.\n       (4) The evaluation of costs and benefits must involve the \n     consideration of the relevant information, whether expressed \n     in quantitative or qualitative terms, including factors such \n     as social values, distributional effects, and equity.\n       (5) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment should be \n     presented with a clear statement of the analytical \n     assumptions and uncertainties, including an explanation of \n     what is known and not known and what the implications of \n     alternative assumptions might be.\n       (6) The public has a right to know about the costs and \n     benefits of regulations, the risks addressed, the risks \n     reduced, and the quality of scientific and economic analysis \n     used to support decisions. Such knowledge will promote the \n     quality, integrity and responsiveness of agency actions.\n       (7) The Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs should oversee regulatory activities to \n     raise the quality and consistency of cost-benefit analysis \n     and risk assessment among all agencies.\n       (8) The Federal Government should develop a better \n     understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainties \n     of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment and conduct the \n     research needed to improve these analytical tools.\n\n     SEC. 3. REGULATORY ANALYSIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                  ``SUBCHAPTER II--REGULATORY ANALYSIS\n\n     ``Sec. 621.

Mr. President, today Senator Thompson and I and the \ncosponsors to S. 981, Senators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Roth, Rockefeller, \nStevens, Grams, and Cochran are putting in the Record a substitute we \nwill be offering in the Governmental Affairs Committee to S. 981, the \nRegulatory Improvement Act of 1997.\n  The substitute is the product of several months of dialogue with \ninterested parties, including the Administration; environmental, labor \nand public interest groups; the business community; the National \nGovernors' Association; academic experts and various associations. I \nhope that a number of these persons and groups will support the \nsubstitute.\n  This dialogue began with the Committee's hearing on the bill on \nSeptember 12th and continued through the end of January. The substitute \ndoes not make any radical changes to the bill as introduced, but it \ndoes clarify a number of important issues and lay to rest areas of \npossible uncertainty.\n  The major changes in the substitute are:\n  (1) We have added a so-called ``savings clause'' that affirms that \nnothing in the bill is intended to supersede any requirement for \nrulemaking or opportunity for judicial review applicable under any \nother Federal law. That was our intent all along with this bill, but \nvarious groups asked that we make it explicit, so we did.\n  (2) We modified the judicial review section to conform it to current \njudicial review principles, by eliminating, for example, the \nrequirement for showing of non-materiality with respect to the cost-\nbenefit analysis or risk assessment. The regulatory analysis is part of \nthe whole rulemaking record and shall be considered by the court, to \nthe extent relevant, only in determining whether the final rule is \narbitrary or capricious. Agency failure to comply with the procedural \nrequirements of S. 981 would not, in and of itself, be grounds for \nremanding or invalidating the rule. However, if an agency totally fails \nto perform a required analysis, including peer review, the court shall \nremand or invalidate the rule.\n  (3) We modified the cost-benefit determination provision to make \nabsolutely clear that the agency determination is a disclosure \nrequirement and\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\ndoes not dictate the substantive outcome of a rule.\n  (4) We changed the definition of ``substitution risk'' to require \nthat it be a ``significant'' increased risk instead of just an \nincreased risk, and we eliminated the requirement of a full risk \nassessment under the procedures of the bill for significant \nsubstitution risks.\n  (5) We changed the principles for risk assessment to be less \nprescriptive to the agencies and to be more accommodating for non-\ncarcinogenic risks. The risk assessment provisions more accurately \nreflect the diversity and uncertainties in risk assessment while adding \nthe requirement that agencies identify central and high-end estimates \nof risk.\n  (6) We added a requirement that agencies develop an effective process \nfor State, local and tribal governments to consult with agencies and \nprovide input as new rules containing federal mandates are developed \nand old rules are modernized.\n  (7) We enhanced the independence and quality of the peer review \nprocess, and require agencies to apply current standards for conflicts \nof interest.\n  (8) We modified the review of rules procedures to reduce the \nbureaucracy in the bill as introduced by eliminating the need for \nagency advisory committees. We also include an amendment to the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act to enhance the review of rules affecting \nsmall businesses and small governments.\n  Those are some of the most important changes made by this substitute.\n  I believe this bill will improve the regulatory process, will build \nconfidence in the regulatory programs that are so important to this \nsociety's well-being, and will result in a better--and I believe--a \nless contentious regulatory process.\n  Mr. President, many people think that when many of us fought hard \nagainst the Dole-Johnston bill that we didn't really want to reform the \nregulatory process. Well they are wrong. Many of us were disappointed \nthat we were unable to pass a comprehensive regulatory reform bill in \nthe last Congress. We weren't going to support bad reform, but that \ndoesn't mean we didn't want to see good reform. Those of us who believe \nin the benefits of regulation to protect health and safety have a \nparticular responsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible \nand cost-effective. When they aren't, the regulatory process--which is \nso vital to our health and well being--comes under constant attack. By \nproviding a common sense, moderate and open regulatory process, we are \ncontributing to the well being of that process and immunizing it from \nthe attacks on excess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that major changes in the \nsubstitute and a summary of the substitute to S. 981 be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n     Summary of the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998 (Substitute)\n\n       1. Regulatory Analysis (Sec. 623)\n       When issuing major rules (costing over $100 million or \n     deemed by OMB to have a significant impact on the economy), \n     Federal agencies must conduct a regulatory analysis, \n     including a cost-benefit analysis and, if relevant, a risk \n     assessment.\n       a. Cost-benefit analysis\n       The cost-benefit analysis shall consider: The expected \n     benefits of the rule quantifiable and nonquantifiable); the \n     expected costs of the rule quantifiable and nonquantifiable); \n     and reasonable alternatives, including flexible regulatory \n     options--such as market-based mechanisms or outcome-oriented \n     performance-based standards;\n       b. Cost-benefit determination\n       The agency shall include in the statement of basis and \n     purpose for the rule a reasonable determination: (1) whether \n     the rule is likely to provide benefits that justify its \n     costs; and (2) whether the rule is likely to substantially \n     achieve the rule making objective in a more cost-effective \n     manner, or with greater net benefits, then the other \n     reasonable alternatives considered by the agency.\n       If the agency determines that the rule is not likely to \n     provide benefits that justify its costs or to substantially \n     achieve the rule making objective in a more cost-effective \n     manner, or with greater net benefits, than the other \n     reasonable alternatives, it shall: (1) explain the reasons \n     for selecting the rule notwithstanding such determination; \n     (2) identify any statutory provision that required the agency \n     to select such rule; and (3) describe any reasonable \n     alternative considered by the agency that would be likely to \n     provide such benefits.\n       The agency shall include an executive summary in the \n     regulatory analysis and in the statement of basis and purpose \n     for the rule.\n       There is an exception from the regulatory analysis \n     requirements when the agency for good cause finds that \n     conducting the regulatory analysis before the rule becomes \n     effective is impracticable or contrary to an important public \n     interest.\n       Each agency shall develop an effective process to allow \n     elected representatives of State, local and tribal \n     governments to provide meaningful and timely input into \n     regulatory proposals, consistent with the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995.\n       2. Risk assessment principles (Sec. 624)\n       Agencies shall conduct risk assessments under Sec. 624 for \n     (1) major rules that have the primary purpose of addressing \n     health, safety, or environmental risks, and (2) risk \n     assessments not related to a rule making that the OMB \n     Director determines would have a substantial impact on a \n     significant public policy or the economy. To promote \n     transparent and scientifically sound risk assessments, \n     agencies would be required to--identify and explain \n     significant assumptions made when measuring risks; notify the \n     public about upcoming risk assessments and allow people to \n     submit relevant and reliable information; disclose relevant \n     information about the risk, including the range and \n     distribution of risks and corresponding exposure scenarios, \n     for the potentially exposed population and for any more \n     highly exposed or sensitive subpopulations; and when \n     scientific information permits, compare the risk being \n     analyzed with other reasonable comparable risks familiar to \n     and routinely encountered by the general public.\n       3. Peer review (Sec. 625)\n       Agencies shall conduct independent peer review for required \n     cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments. Agency standards \n     governing conflicts of interest apply. Peer review can be \n     formal or informal, as warranted. Peer review is not required \n     where the agency and OMB certify that an assessment or \n     analysis has previously been subjected to adequate peer \n     review.\n       4. Deadlines for rule making (Sec. 626)\n       For two years after the Act becomes effective, agencies \n     have the opportunity for a 6-month extension from a \n     regulatory deadline if needed to satisfy the requirements of \n     the Act.\n       5. Judicial Review (Sec. 627)\n       Judicial review will ensure that agencies perform cost-\n     benefit analyses, risk assessments, and peer reviews. The \n     cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are included in the \n     rule making record for purposes of judicial review of the \n     final rule only under the deferential arbitrary and \n     capricious standard. Failure to comply with a specific \n     procedural requirement of S. 981 regarding how to perform a \n     risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis would not, in and of \n     itself, be grounds for invalidating a rule.\n       6. Guidelines, interagency coordination, and research \n     (Sec. 628)\n       Within 9 months, OMB is required to consult with CEA, OSTP \n     and relevant agencies to develop broad guidelines for cost-\n     benefit analyses, risk assessments and peer reviews as \n     required by the Act.\n       Within 18 months after issuance of the general guidelines, \n     each agency subject to Sec. 624 shall develop detailed \n     guidelines for risk assessments tailored to agency programs, \n     consistent with the general guidelines.\n       OMB shall consult with CEA and OSTP to evaluate and improve \n     agency cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment practices.\n       Within 6 months, OMB shall consult with OSTP to enter a \n     contract for research to develop common basis to assist risk \n     communication, and to develop methods to appropriately \n     incorporate risk assessments into cost-benefit analyses.\n       7. Risk-based priorities study (Sec. 629)\n       OMB, in consultation with OSTP, shall enter into a contract \n     with an accredited scientific institution to conduct a study \n     that provides a comparison of significant health, safety and \n     environmental risks, the methodologies for such comparisons, \n     including development of a common basis to assist comparative \n     risk analysis related to both carcinogens and noncarcinogens, \n     and recommendations on the use of comparative risk analysis \n     to set priorities to reduce risks to human health, safety, or \n     the environment.\n       Within 5 years, the President shall submit a report to \n     Congress recommending legislative changes to assist in \n     setting priorities to more effectively and efficiently reduce \n     risks to health, safety and the environment.\n       8. Review of Rules (Sec. Sec. 631-632; Sec. (b))\n       To periodically review economically significant rules, each \n     agency shall publish a review schedule every 5 years. In \n     selecting rules for review, the agency shall consider the \n     extent to which the rule could be revised to be substantially \n     more cost-effective, or to substantially increase net \n     benefits, as well as whether the agency has statutory \n     authority to modify or repeal the rule. If, as a result of \n     the review, the agency determines to amend or repeal a rule, \n     it shall complete the rulemaking within 2 years. For good \n     cause, the OMB Director may extend the deadline for 1 year. \n     Consultation with representatives of State, local and tribal \n     governments shall be governed by the process established \n     under section 204 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n       To provide for the review of rules affecting small \n     entities, S. 981 amends Section 610 of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act. Agencies would review Reg-Flex rules every 5 \n     years, and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration and the Administrator of OMB's Office \n     of Information\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\n     and Regulatory Affairs would oversee the review process.\n       9. Executive Oversight (Sec. Sec. 641-644)\n       The bill codifies the regulatory review process and sets \n     out responsibilities and authority of OMB's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to develop policies \n     and procedures to review regulatory actions and to develop \n     and oversee an annual government-wide regulatory planning \n     process that includes the review of major rules and other \n     significant regulatory actions.\n       OIRA shall establish procedures to provide public and \n     agency access to information concerning regulatory review \n     actions.\n       Information to be disclosed to the public includes: the \n     status of regulatory actions; written communications between \n     OIRA and the agency on the regulatory action; written \n     communications between OIRA and persons outside the Executive \n     Branch; and a list identifying the dates, names of \n     individuals involved, and subject matter discussed in \n     meetings and telephone conversations relating to the \n     regulatory action between OIRA and persons not employed by \n     the Executive Branch.\n       Information to be disclosed to the regulatory agency \n     includes: written communications between OIRA and persons \n     outside the Executive Branch on a regulatory action; a list \n     identifying the dates, names of individuals involved, and \n     subject matter discussed in meetings and telephone \n     conversations relating to the regulatory action between OIRA \n     and persons not employed by the Executive Branch; and a \n     written explanation of any review action taken.\n       The agency shall include in the rule making record: (1) a \n     document identifying the substantive changes between the \n     draft submitted to OIRA for review and the rule subsequently \n     announced; (2) a document identifying and describing those \n     substantive changes in the rule that were made as a result of \n     the regulatory review and a statement if the Administrator \n     suggested or recommended no changes; and (3) all written \n     communications exchanged between OIRA and the agency during \n     the review of the rule, including drafts of all proposals and \n     associated analyses.\n       10. Effective Date (Section 4)\n       The Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of \n     enactment, but shall not apply to any agency rule for which a \n     notice of proposed rule making is published on or before 60 \n     days before enactment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                 major changes in substitute to s. 981\n\n       SAVINGS CLAUSE: Adds a ``savings'' clause which affirms \n     that nothing in the bill is intended to supersede any \n     requirement for rulemaking or opportunity for judicial review \n     applicable under any other Federal law.\n       JUDICIAL REVIEW: Conforms the judicial review section to \n     current judicial review principles, by eliminating, for \n     example, requirement for showing of non-materiality with \n     respect to the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. The \n     regulatory analysis is part of the whole rule making record \n     and shall be considered by the court, to the extent relevant, \n     only in determining whether the final rule is arbitrary or \n     capricious. Agency failure to comply with the procedural \n     requirements of S. 981 would not, in and of itself, be \n     grounds for remanding or invalidating the rule. However, if \n     an agency fails to perform a required analysis, including \n     peer review, the court shall remand or invalidate the rule.\n       COST-BENEFIT DETERMINATION: Modifies the cost-benefit \n     determination provision to make absolutely clear that the \n     agency determination is a disclosure requirement and does not \n     dictate the substantive outcome of a rule.\n       SUBSTITUTION RISK: Changes the definition of ``substitution \n     risk'' to require that it be a ``significant'' increased risk \n     instead of just an increased risk. Eliminates the requirement \n     of a full risk assessment under the procedures of the bill \n     for significant substitution risks. Requires that an agency \n     identify and evaluate substitution risks in the regulatory \n     analysis where information on such risks is reasonably \n     available to the agency.\n       RISK ASSESSMENT: Changes the principles for risk assessment \n     to be less prescriptive to the agencies and to be more \n     accommodating for non-carcinogenic risks. More accurately \n     reflects diversity and uncertainties in risk assessment while \n     adding requirement for agencies to identify central and high-\n     end estimates of risk. Provides a more accurate definition of \n     ``risk assessment''. Applies the risk assessment procedures \n     in the bill to important risk assessments, which are not \n     related to a rule making, if designated by the OMB Director. \n     Requires agencies to notify the public of upcoming risk \n     assessments and to solicit relevant data.\n       COMPARATIVE RISK STUDY: Simplifies comparative risk study. \n     Agencies are to use the results of study to inform the \n     preparation of their budgets and strategic planning under the \n     Government Performance and Results Act.\n       STATE/LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Requires agencies to develop an \n     effective process for State, local and tribal governments to \n     consult with agencies and provide input as new rules \n     containing federal mandates are developed and old rules are \n     modernized.\n       Strikes the requirement that an agency evaluate the \n     benefits and costs of alternative approaches to regulating \n     that inter alia ``accommodate differences among geographic \n     regions and among persons with differing levels of \n     resources'' and substitutes the requirement that \n     consideration be given to alternatives that provide \n     flexibility for small entities and state, local and tribal \n     governments.\n       PEER REVIEW: Enhances the independence and quality of the \n     peer review process. Applies current standards for conflicts \n     of interest.\n       REVIEW OF RULES: Modifies review of rules procedures to \n     reduce the bureaucracy in the bill as introduced by \n     eliminating the need for agency advisory committees. Also \n     amends the Regulatory Flexibility Act to enhance the review \n     of rules affecting small businesses and small governments.\n       OTHER:\n       Provides more accurately worded exceptions to the \n     definition of ``rule''; adds as an exception a rule that \n     authorizes the introduction of a product into commerce.\n       Modifies definition of ``major rule'' to strike ``or a \n     group of closely related rules''.\n       Findings better reflect the value of regulatory programs \n     and how cost-benefit analysis can result in more benefits at \n     less cost.\n       Modifies the ``good cause exception'' for meeting the \n     regulatory analysis requirements of the bill by striking the \n     limitations on what could be considered to be ``contrary to \n     the public interest.''\n       Adds Council of Economic Advisors to entities required to \n     be consulted by OMB Director when issuing cost-benefit \n     analysis guidelines.\n       Provides that compliance with the Regulatory Improvement \n     Act shall constitute compliance with the provisions of the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act as they relate to the private \n     sector.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Levin and \neight of our colleagues in submitting a substitute for S. 981, the \nRegulatory Improvement Act. This substitute incorporates some \nclarifications and improvements to the bill as result of our Committee \nhearing, written statements and letters, and a series of discussions \nwith the Administration, environmental and public interest groups, \nState and local government, scholars, and other interested parties. I \nask unanimous consent that a summary of the substitute and a list of \nthe major changes to the substitute be included in the Record following \nmy remarks. The substitute is the text that we will use as the basis \nfor our Committee markup. This bill is an effort by many of us who want \nto improve the quality of government to find a common solution. The \nsupporters of this bill represent a real diversity of political \nviewpoints, but we share the same goals. We want an effective \ngovernment that protects public health, well-being and the environment. \nWe want our government to achieve those goals in the most sensible and \nefficient way possible. We want to do the best we can with what we've \ngot, and to do more good at less cost if possible. The Regulatory \nImprovement Act will help us do just that.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act is based on a simple premise: that \npeople have a right to know how and why government agencies make their \nmost important and expensive regulatory decisions. The S. 981 not only \ngives people the right to know; it gives them the right to see--to see \nhow the government works, or how it doesn't. And by providing people \nwith information the government uses to make decisions, it gives people \na real opportunity to influence those decisions. So much of what goes \non right now is pretty much done in secret. We're going to change that.\n  Second, the bill will make government more accountable to the people \nit serves. S. 981 is based on the idea that increased public scrutiny \nof government decision making--and people who make those decisions--\nwill lead to better and more accountable government performance. It \ngives people the ability to look over the Federal government's \nshoulder.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act will deliver more decisionmaking power \ncloser to home--and into the hands of State and local governments. The \nbill empowers people and their State and local officials to provide \ninput into the Federal system. It will make the Federal government more \nmindful of how unfunded mandates can burden communities and interfere \nwith local priorities. When I became Chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee last year, I asked the General Accounting Office to \ninvestigate whether the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was \nimproving regulations, which was one of its goals. Unfortunately, the \nanswer is ``No.'' GAO released the report today. It is entitled, \nUnfunded Mandates: Reform Act Has Had Little Effect on Agencies'\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nRulemaking Actions. I view S. 981 as really phase two of the unfunded \nmandates reform effort, because it will make Federal regulators--not \njust Congress--more sensitive to local needs.\n  Finally, the Regulatory Improvement Act will improve the quality of \ngovernment decision making--which will lead to a more effective and \nefficient Federal government. The Regulatory Improvement Act will \nrequire the Federal government to make better use of modern \ndecisionmaking tools (such as risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalysis), which are currently under-used. Right now, these tools are \nsimply options--options that aren't used as much or as well as they \nshould be. The bill also will help the Federal government to set \nsmarter priorities--to better focus money and other resources on the \nmost serious problems.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act bill builds on the Clinton \nAdministration's government-wide reinvention efforts. It codifies many \nof the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the principles of \nother Reinventing Regulation initiatives. It will give some needed \nhorsepower to these efforts. This will help us reach our common goal: \nimproving the quality of government. That's why the bill has broad \nbipartisan support, including myself and Senator Levin, as well as \nSenators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Roth, Rockefeller, Stevens, Grams, and \nCochran. This is a common sense effort we all can be proud of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S402-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                permanent subcommittee on investigations\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support \nof the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor of this crucial piece of legislation.\n  Once again, we begin our fight for the dignity and respect of working \nAmericans. Our goal is simple; to ensure that individuals dedicated to \nhard work and committed to their families no longer live in poverty. \nThe fact is that while our nation is experiencing a time of \nunprecedented prosperity, nearly 12 million Americans earning the \nminimum wage still face a daily struggle to maintain an acceptable \nquality of life.\n  Sixty years ago, Labor Secretary Frances Perkins successfully \nconvinced our predecessors of the need to pass legislation that would \nguarantee low wage workers a decent living. Today, the need to maintain \na basic level of income for American workers is no less necessary. \nIndeed, that need has never been greater.\n  The statistics showing the economic injustice faced by low-wage \nworkers are staggering. Full-time minimum wage workers earn only \n$10,712 year, $2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. \nGiven that fact, it should come as no surprise that 38 percent of the \npeople seeking emergency food aid in 1996 were employed.\n  One reason behind these disturbing statistics is the diminishing \npurchasing value of the minimum wage. Between 1980 and 1995, inflation \nrose by 86 percent, but during the same time, the minimum wage was \nincreased by a paltry 37 percent, greatly reducing the purchasing power \nof American workers. While the minimum wage legislation we passed in \n1996 was a bold step towards closing that gap, our work is not \ncomplete. And with each passing day, as inflation marches on, workers' \npurchasing power once again is falling.\n  The legislation drafted by Senator Kennedy will take the steps \nnecessary to restore and maintain the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage into the next century.\n  As modest as our proposal is, The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998 will \nhelp guarantee low income workers a degree of economic dignity. It will \nincrease the earnings of over 12 million workers, 60 percent of whom \nare women, 46 percent of whom are full-time workers, and 40 percent of \nwhom are the sole breadwinners in their families.\n  An increase in the minimum wage is also closely linked to the success \nof the 1996 welfare reform. Individuals struggling to make the \ndifficult transition from welfare to work deserve the opportunity to \nbecome truly self sufficient. We need to provide an incentive to \nexchange welfare checks for paychecks.\n  The Economic Policies Institute has concluded that, not only did low \nincome families reap the majority of the benefits from the last \nincrease, but minimum wage recipients experienced no disemployment \neffects. Despite the predictions made by our opponents, vulnerable \ngroups, including teenagers and young adults, were not negatively \neffected by the increase.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for drafting this \nlegislation and for his tireless efforts on behalf of working Americans \nthroughout his long career in the Senate. As he has said, this is the \nright thing to do. Put in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, \n``Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the \nfruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first \nexisted.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S409-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S410]]\n TRIBUTE TO BEN KENDIG JR., ON BEING NAMED THE 1997 HOSPITAL AUXILIARY/\n                         VOLUNTEER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Ben Kendig Jr., a distinguished individual, for being \nnamed the 1997 Hospital Auxiliary/Volunteer of the year. I commend his \ncompassion for others in volunteering countless hours for the service \nof his fellow citizens.\n  Ben bravely served his country as a fighter pilot in World War II. \nAfter the war, he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and \nreceived his degree in aeronautical engineering. Ben then used his \nskills working at United Aircraft. After that, he then decided to \nsettle down in Nashua, New Hampshire, and opened up his own engineering \nfirm.\n  After 15 years of running his own business, he decided to retire. \nHowever, at the age of 71, he still had plenty of energy and drive so \nhe decided to put it to good use. According to Ben, he wanted to spend \nhis time helping others, an attribute that I admire greatly.\n  As a result, he joined the Southern New Hampshire Regional Medical \nCenter Messenger Service. Ben initially wanted an easy position with \nlittle responsibility, however, it developed into something much \ngreater.\n  As time went on, Ben accepted more responsibility and assumed \nleadership roles within the Messenger Service. His dedication to \nservice and supportive energy exceeded the normal expectations of any \nvolunteer. Naturally, people turned to him in times of need. \nUnfortunately, the president and the director of auxiliary was \ndiagnosed with cancer. Like many times before, Ben picked up the reins \nof leadership and was appointed the president of the Messenger Service.\n  This arduous job involved overseeing over 200 volunteers, a position \nthat certainly would test any man. Close to 30,000 hours of time had to \nbe delegated throughout the hospital. Ben also had a budget of $100,000 \nthe organization had to distribute to improve certain areas of the \nhospital like the maternity ward.\n  Ben gave not just to the hospital, but to each and every individual \nwith whom he worked. He inspired others by his own actions and caring \nattitude. Ben exceeded the expectations and surpassed the ordinary \nresponsibilities of a volunteer. Mr. President, I want to congratulate \nBen for his outstanding work and I am proud to represent him in the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S410-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 13TH LABOR OF HERCULES\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

RALPH\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on February 1, 1998, Lane A. Ralph \ncelebrated his 20th anniversary of service in the Indiana State Office \nof the United States Senate. In recognition of this milestone \nachievement, and with deepest appreciation, I commend him.\n  An alumnus of Indiana State University with a Bachelor's Degree in \nPolitical Science and a Master's of Public Administration, Lane joined \nmy state office staff during my second year of membership in the \nSenate. In the ensuing years, Lane has worn many hats with unbridled \nenthusiasm, vast energy and selfless commitment.\n  In 1980, Lane rose to the challenge of serving two senators, as \nSenator Dan Quayle and I established the only combined state office in \nthe country. When Senator Dan Coats joined the Senate in 1988, Lane \ncontinued his selfless commitment to serve both of us, ceaselessly \noffering sage council, valued continuity and dedication to a shared \npurpose. Lane has consistently articulated a vision of humane \ngovernment and has demonstrated a genuine commitment to public service. \nHe has served with humility, compassion and empathy for those in need.\n  As the Director of Projects for the United States Senate State of \nIndiana Office, Lane has provided leadership with integrity and \nintelligence. He has developed an extraordinary encyclopedic-knowledge \nof people, places, facts and issues which affect the quality of life of \nall Hoosiers. He has cultivated a comprehensive network of contacts in \nfederal, state and local government and among community leaders who \nvalue his responsible and credible expertise, as well as his well-\nreasoned approach to public policy.\n  Lane's leadership in environmental issues is well-known throughout \nIndiana. He has been a steadfast advocate of soil and water \nconservation, clean air and water, better forest management and \nresponsible hazardous waste disposal. In his collaborations with \nOperation Lifesaver, Lane has worked tirelessly to educate Hoosiers in \nrailroad-crossing safety. As an expert in public works issues, he has \nassisted elected officials, municipal administrators and concerned \ncitizens enhance Indiana's roads, drinking-water systems and planning \nmechanisms.\n  In his many years of service, Lane has consistently demonstrated a \ntalent for forthrightness and for clarifying the intricacies of complex \nsituations. He cuts to the heart of concerns and issues with a knack \nfor asking key questions. Lane is fairminded and industrious with \npeople from all walks of life, balancing the interests of conflicting \nparties and affably fostering collaborative partnerships.\n  Apart from his distinguished career of public service, Lane has been \na loving and generous partner to his wife, Ruth, throughout their 18 \nyears of marriage.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, consistent with the greatest \ntraditions of athletic competition, the 1997 Dover High School football \nteam became the first in Dutchess County history to earn the high honor \nof New York State Champion. Rolling to victory after victory, their \nperfect season culminated in a spectacular double-overtime triumph over \nChristian Brothers Academy of Syracuse.\n  While the victories they gained were as a team of 31 dedicated \nscholar-athletes, they did not travel that road to victory alone. \nBehind them all the way were their parents, their classmates and the \nentire community. Guiding them and offering encouragement in difficult \ntimes while challenging them to be the best were their coaches: Bill \nBroggy, Chris Lounsbury, John Thorpe, Bill Peel, Paul Kenny and Israel \nLorimer.\n  Their skill on the field, their refusal to give up and their \ncommitment to excellence have brought honor and distinction not only to \nthe Dover Dragons, but to all of Section 1. In addition to their \nundefeated season and many memories, they have developed skills that \nwill be with them long after their playing days are over. The \ndedication they displayed through countless hours of practice, their \nsense of teamwork, and the ability to rise to a challenge will serve \nthem well as they continue to grow not only as athletes, but as human \nbeings.\n  Leading up to the championship game on November 28, 1997, the \nplayers, coaches, parents, and so many fans traveled with hope and \npride to play and watch the ultimate game. Win or lose, the Dover \nDragons had made it all the way to the New York State Championship at \nthe Carrier Dome. Facing a\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\ntough hometown team, the Dover Dragons never backed down and never \nforgot what brought them to the contest. Although facing defeat in the \nfourth quarter, the Dragons tapped their collective strength and \nbattled back through two overtimes to earn the title of New York State \nChampion. This championship win represented an entire season of \ntenacity, commitment, and dedication to excellence.\n  For so many of our young men and women, the athletic fields are a \nplace to be challenged, a place to succeed, a place to learn the value \nof teamwork and loyalty. The Dover Dragons have learned these lessons \nwell, and as they continue to celebrate their New York State \nChampionship, I salute them:\n  The 1997 Dover High School Football Dragons: Tim Jones, Kurt Abrams, \nJohn Greiner, Eric Bosley, George Morfea, Chris Maglin, Willie Peel, \nSpencer Harby, Jeff Aubry, Christian Harby, Chris Barto, Rob Schaus, \nChris Zabowski, Shane Barto, Justin Agrella, Luis Jusino, Frank Cawley, \nSteve Meilleur, Ed Pisano, Matt Judson, Nick Savarese, John Hammond, \nRick Rappazzo, Jeff Acken, Pat Hearn, John Locke, Justin Cole, Justin \nBrown, Matt Light, Nate Davis, Garett Yeno.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/04/senate-section/article/S410-4", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 1611\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.
