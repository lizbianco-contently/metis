Forgive us for the pride \nthat too frequently takes the place of praise in our hearts. So often, \nwe want to be adequate in our own strength, to be loved by You because \nof our self-generated goodness, and to be admired by people because of \nour superior performance. Yet pride pollutes everything: It stunts our \nspiritual growth, creates tensions in our relationships, and makes us \npeople who are difficult for You to bless. Most important of all, our \npride separates us from You, dear Father. When pride reigns, life \nbecomes bland, truth becomes relative, and values become confused. We \nlose that inner confidence of convictions rooted in the Bible and Your \nrevealed truth.\n  Now in this quiet moment, we praise You for breaking the bubble of \nillusion that, with our own cleverness and cunning, we can solve life's \nproblems. Help us recover a sense of humor so we can laugh at ourselves \nfor ever thinking we could make it on our own. We humble ourselves \nbefore You. Fill us with Your spirit. Now, with our minds planted on \nthe Rock of Ages, we have the power to face the ambiguities of today \nwith the absolutes of Your truth and guidance. Through our Lord and \nSaviour.

KENNARD, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE A MEMBER OF THE \n                   FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and proceed to the nomination \nof William E. Kennard of California, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of William E. \nKennard, of California, to be a member of the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nWilliam Kennard as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Throughout the confirmation process, I have taken a particular \ninterest in universal service. The ruling earlier this year by the FCC \nto structure a universal service fund from a 25-percent Federal \ncontribution and a 75-percent State contribution has caused me a lot of \nconcern, along with many of my colleagues from rural States.\n  I do not believe that this ruling is consistent with the intent of \nCongress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Such a rule could have \nsevere impacts on Montana and other rural States that are asked to make \nthis contribution.\n  In the process of determining the attitudes of the nominees, I have \nheard statements about a reliance on the historical split between \nStates and the Federal Government in the structure of this fund. \nHowever, in the case of Montana, which has not even had a universal \nservice fund until it was enacted this year by the State legislature, \nwe are on new territory, and history may be different from present \ncircumstances.\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\n  In rural States like Montana,the universal service fund is absolutely \ncritical to the provision of basic telephone service. It should further \nbe noted that maintaining the universal availability of telephone \nservice at reasonable and affordable prices is not just a vague goal \nbut an explicit statutory mandate.\n  I ask how well has the FCC done in fulfilling this mandate? To answer \nthis question, it is helpful to look at the record of the hearings \nwhich the Commerce Committee held in September 1993, on the nomination \nof Reed Hundt to be FCC Chairman.\n  In response to a question which I posed on universal service, Mr. \nHundt said--\n\n       Universal service is, and should be, one of the paramount \n     goals of the Government and specifically the FCC.\n\n  Mr. Hundt also characterized the appropriate role of the FCC in \nresponse to another question. He said the FCC's mandate was,\n\n       [T]o implement the will of Congress, as expressed in \n     legislation, [and that] to that end, the Commission's \n     policymaking activities should take into account incentives \n     and disincentives for private investment in the network, and \n     the creation and offering of service.\n\n  Mr. President, after reviewing the activities of the FCC during the \npast 4 years, it is clear that Reed Hundt has been unable to fully \ncarry out the promises which he made to this committee and to the \nSenate during his confirmation. I should also note that Mr. Kennard \nserved as general counsel to the FCC during this time and bears \nsubstantial responsibility for its record.\n  It should be clear from the record that by focusing on the expansion \nof the definition of universal service to include broad-ranging social \nprograms, the FCC's progress toward maintaining universal service has \nbeen delayed. While such goals as providing internet access to schools \nand libraries may be laudable, they were never meant to be part of \nuniversal service as it has traditionally been known. Indeed, a huge \nadditional burden has been placed on rural States such as mine, in \nMontana, in meeting these newfound definitions. The FCC has addressed \nthose goals in a fashion which many believe is detrimental to \nmaintaining universal telephone service--which is so important to me \nand other Members of rural States.\n  As I have noted before, there are some 55 million Americans who live \noutside metropolitan areas today--which is about the same as the total \npopulation of Great Britain, Italy, or France. The largest single \nelement of the U.S. population today is Americans aged 50 or older--a \ngroup that represents almost 40 percent of the total population. \nEnsuring that these people have access to affordable, quality telephone \nservice is especially important to all of us.\n  Coming from Montana, I have an appreciation for the unique character \nand the difficulties of rural life. In a State with 148,000 square \nmiles and only about 850,000 people, we do not always have the luxury \nof face-to-face communication that people have in highly populated \nareas, nor do we have the ability to shoulder the disproportionate \nburden that would be placed on us by taking on 75 percent of the cost \nof universal service. It is the people of States like mine for whom \nuniversal service is intended, and I do not want to see it dismantled.\n  In view of all of these facts, I must oppose Mr. Kennard's \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, what we are faced with in Montana in this particular \narea is pointed up by an article that was in the Bozeman Daily \nChronicle by Oliver Staley. I ask unanimous consent that article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Some Small School Districts Find Good Internet Access too Expensive\n\n                           (By Oliver Staley)\n\n       Harrison, MT.--The Internet may be the wave of the future, \n     but in the Harrison School District, it's a wave Net surfers \n     can't ride very far.\n       The tiny, 129-student school district has just one computer \n     linked to the Internet. They have access for only 100 hours a \n     month.\n       Superintendent John McGee wants to increase the students' \n     access to the Net, and envisions four terminals providing 200 \n     hours of access a month.\n       But if the school is linked to the Internet through its \n     current Three Rivers Telephone Cooperative's service, it \n     would cost the district $3,360 a year.\n       ``We couldn't justify spending that,'' McGee said.\n       Paying $3,360 is bad enough. Making Harrison's situation \n     even more frustrating is that 20 miles to the north, Three \n     Forks School District pays $540 a year to connect its three \n     terminals to the Internet.\n       The Manhattan School District pays $229 a year, and the \n     Bozeman School District, which has hundreds of computers \n     hooked up in 11 schools, pays just $2,500 a year.\n       Those differences are a result of the Intricate world of \n     telecommunications, which makes it harder and more expensive \n     for small communities to connect to the Net.\n       Ultimately, McGee said, the cost is paid by the students \n     and faculty who are denied access to a technology that is \n     reshaping the world.\n       ``They're completely missing out on the big picture of \n     what's going on out there,'' he said. ``They're missing out \n     on all sorts of levels.''\n       The high cost of supplying Harrison with Internet service \n     stems from basic supply-and-demand economics, aggravated by \n     Montana's vast distances.\n       For the nonprofit Three Rivers Telephone Cooperative to \n     provide Harrison with Internet service, the cooperative must \n     use US West's telephone lines.\n       Whenever a subscriber in Harrison or Ennis dials up the \n     Internet, their signal travels along Three Rivers' fiber \n     optic cables to Twin Bridges. From there, it joins the US \n     West system running from Dillion to Butte, and continues to \n     Great Falls. At Great Falls, the signal rejoins the Three \n     Rivers network and travels to the cooperative's headquarters \n     in Fairfield.\n       Using US West's lines costs Three Rivers about $1,600 a \n     month, said Three Rivers General Manager Art Isley, with the \n     fee based on the distance the signal travels. That cost \n     simply gets passed on, he said.\n       ``It's costing us an arm and a leg to get that (Internet \n     service) out,'' he said. ``I don't get any breaks.''\n       Communities that are served by US West such as Three Forks, \n     Manhattan and Bozeman don't have to pay the cost of leasing \n     the space on the system, Isley said.\n       And because Harrison is so small, other Internet providers \n     lack the incentive to compete with Three Rivers.\n       ``If you have competition, the market is going to drive \n     prices down,'' McGee said.\n       Larger communities have other telecommunications advantages \n     as well. Bozeman's schools are linked to the Internet through \n     Montana State University, which has its own access to the \n     Net. While the university system's Internet structure is \n     expected to change in the next few years resulting in \n     additional costs for Bozeman's schools the low cost of \n     service has allowed Bozeman's schools to bring the Internet \n     to thousands of students.\n       ``We're getting an incredible deal right now,'' said \n     Christine Day, the district's technology services \n     coordinator.\n       Some small schools, however, have found ways to avoid \n     paying huge fees for Internet service.\n       The Whitehall School District receives its Internet service \n     free of charge from the Helena-based Internections. In \n     return, the school district houses Internections' equipment, \n     which allows it to provide local Internet service to the rest \n     of Whitehall.\n       ``It's great for both of us,'' said Whitehall \n     Superintendent Paul Stemick. ``Otherwise, they would have to \n     pay to rent space in town.''\n       And after Whitehall's schools are rewired, a project that \n     was to be completed Saturday, every classroom will be linked \n     to the Internet. Stemick hopes to have 60 computers on-line \n     by Christmas.\n       The Ennis School District is using a different approach.\n       The district pays $2,000 a year for Vision Net, an \n     interactive television system that links Ennis to 48 other \n     Montana schools and universities. The program is designed to \n     expand learning opportunities for both and adults and \n     students, and because of Vision Net's broad bandwidth, it can \n     also carry the Internet.\n       Currently, the Ennis district has 13 computers linked to \n     the Internet for its approximately 415 students, business \n     manager Sandra Lane said. That will be expanded, Lane said, \n     when the district's Vision Net studio is up and running early \n     next year and a higher-capacity link is established.\n       Many Montana schools also plan on taking advantage of the \n     ``E-rate,'' a $2.25 billion federal subsidy for rural schools \n     created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n       Under the E-rate officially known as the Federal \n     Communications Commissions' Universal Service Order schools \n     and libraries can receive a discount on their Internet \n     service, file servers and wiring.\n       The discount is pegged to the percentage of students in a \n     school eligible for free or reduced price lunches, and it can \n     range from 25 percent to 90 percent off the cost of providing \n     students with the Internet.\n       The funds come from a tax on all telecommunications \n     providers, from AT to local pager companies.\n       In order to apply, schools must develop a comprehensive \n     technology plan, in order to demonstrate that the funds will \n     be used in a productive manner.\n       While some schools see the E-rate as a huge benefit Big \n     Timber is planning on a 60 percent discount, while Ennis is \n     looking at\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n     50 percent other schools are left out in the cold.\n       The Ophir School in Big Sky, for example, doesn't have \n     enough low-income children to qualify, said school Principal \n     Pat Ingraham. On the other hand, Ophir doesn't have the \n     $20,000 to expand its Internet capabilities beyond the one \n     computer that is currently linked, Ingraham said.\n       ``There seems to be a hitch every time we go for funding,'' \n     she said. ``It seems it's not there for you, Big Sky.''\n       Isley at Three Rivers has no doubt that the E-rate will \n     improve the situation for schools like Harrison, but fears \n     other schools will take advantage of the program.\n       ``My personal opinion is that this is going to be the \n     biggest boondoggle that's ever going to hit this country,'' \n     he said. ``There's a pot of money $2.25 billion big. There's \n     going to be a lot of shysters coming out of the woodwork.''\n       Whether it's ripe for exploitation or not, the E-rate was \n     created to help erase the discrepancies between a school like \n     Harrison and schools in California's Silicon Valley. Like \n     many Montana educators, its drafters felt that without access \n     to computers, today's students cannot survive in tomorrow's \n     world.\n       ``If we don't give children the skills to learn technology, \n     they're not going to have skills for the work market,'' \n     Bozeman's Day said. ``They're going to be more and more in \n     need of those skills in the next five, 10 years.''\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana expresses a good \nnumber of concerns about the universal service funding issue. I, too, \nam concerned about the issue of universal service. The discussion this \nmorning is on the nomination of Mr. Kennard to be Chairman of the FCC. \nIf Mr. Kennard is confirmed, and I expect he will be, by the vote of \nthe Senate today, that means four of the five Federal Communication \nCommissioners will be new Commissioners. Four of the five will be new, \ntaking office at a time when we face some of the most critical \ndecisions we have ever faced at the FCC.\n  The Senator from Montana made the point that the universal service \nfund is critical. It certainly is critical to the area that I come \nfrom. I come from a town of 300 people, from a county the size of the \nState of Rhode Island, that has 3,000 people in the entire county. Now, \nwhy is the universal fund issue critical? Because if you don't provide \nuniversal fund support for telephone service in the high-cost areas, it \nwill mean many areas of this country will not have good telephone \nservice, because a whole lot of folks won't be able to afford it.\n  The FCC estimated that in my hometown it would cost $200 a month to \nbuild and maintain a new network to provide telephone service--$200 a \nmonth--but of course in a very large city that might be $10 a month. So \nwhat we have done in this country historically is to have universal \nservice support for the high-cost areas so that they have comparable \ntelephone service at affordable rates. That is what the whole premise \nof universal service has been about.\n  Now, the reason I worry so much is the Federal Communications \nCommission has been heading in the wrong direction, headed toward a \ngoal of having much higher telephone costs in rural areas of the \ncountry.\n  I will support Mr. Kennard's nomination today, but I want everyone to \nbe clear that if this new board, if the new Commission cannot properly \ndefine universal service fund support, cannot read the law as we wrote \nit--and I helped write it--that said comparable service at an \naffordable price--and that is not unusual English--if they can't \nunderstand that and can't read it correctly and can't define universal \nservice support sufficient so we don't have substantial telephone rate \nincreases across this country, then we ought to abolish the FCC. We \ndon't need the FCC and all of its staff. We don't need them if they \ncan't make the right decision.\n  I will vote for this nomination, but I also want people to understand \nthese critical decisions must be made appropriately to provide proper \nuniversal service support that comports with the requirements of the \nlaw--comparable service at an affordable price--yes, even in the \nsmallest towns in the most rural counties of this country, because that \nis what the Congress directed the universal service fund support to be \nin the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his involvement as a very active member of the Commerce \nCommittee and his participation now in this and a variety of other \nissues. The Senator from North Dakota and I occasionally disagree, but \nthose disagreements are not disagreeable, and he is one of the most \nwell-informed members of the committee. I note the presence of Senator \nHollings, the distinguished ranking member on the floor, who I know has \na statement to make, as well.\n  First, Mr. President, I recommend that the Senate vote to confirm the \nnomination of William E. Kennard as a member of the Federal \nCommunications Commission where he will serve as the Commission's new \nChairman. The fact that the full Senate is debating and casting \nindividual votes on Mr. Kennard's confirmation underscores the \nimportance to the American people of the decisions the Senate is making \nabout the FCC.\n  For the first time since it was established in 1934, the Senate is \nfilling four vacancies on this five-member Commission. Last night the \nSenate confirmed the nominations of three of these new members: Michael \nK. Powell, an antitrust lawyer; Harold Furchgott-Roth, an economist; \nand Gloria Tristani, a state commissioner. The combination of \nexpertises they bring to the FCC will make an invaluable contribution \nto the quality of its decisions.\n\n  If confirmed, Mr. Kennard, the FCC's current general counsel, would \nadd the expertise of a seasoned communications lawyer. In addition, Mr. \nKennard would be the FCC's first African-American Chairman, and for the \nfirst time in its history a majority of the Commission's members would \nbe of African-American or Hispanic descent. This reflects both the \ninclusiveness we aspire to as a society, and the freshness we hope a \nreconstituted FCC will pursue in its regulatory approach.\n  But this is not just an historic moment for the FCC; it is also a \nvitally important moment for consumers. The FCC's five Commissioners \ncontrol the regulatory destiny of industries that account for fully \none-sixth of our gross national product. For the consumer, this means \nthat the Commission's decisions will affect the price of a local or a \nlong-distance telephone call, how much we pay each month for cable \nservice, how many choices we will have in paging and cellphone service, \nand even what we see on TV and hear on radio.\n  These would be daunting enough responsibilities for the new \nCommissioners in and of themselves. But last year the Congress expanded \nthe FCC's duties exponentially by enacting the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct. The act aims to introduce a heretofore-unattainable level of \ncompetition and deregulation into the provision of all kinds of voice, \nvideo, and data services.\n  It would be nice to say that all this is working well. But the truth, \nMr. President, is that it isn't. The lower rates, better service, and \nincreased competition called for by the Act have translated, at least \nin the short run, into higher rates, increased concentration among big \nindustry players, and reams of new regulations. In addition, recent \ncourt cases have all but gutted the FCC's plans for making local \ntelephone service competitive.\n  In my view, the act has been an abject failure in attaining any \nbenefits whatsoever for the average consumer, and it's difficult to see \nany improvement in the offing. That is absolutely unacceptable. And \nthat, Mr. President, is why we are casting individual votes on Mr. \nKennard's nomination this morning. As the FCC's general counsel, he is \nunavoidably linked with FCC's failed and flawed implementation of the \nact to date. We are therefore anxious that Mr. Kennard understand the \ndissatisfaction with what is occurring and that he be responsive and \nflexible in addressing our concerns. The FCC is, after all, an agency \ncreated by the Congress. Its primary responsibility is to implement and \nenforce the will of Congress, pursuant to authority delegated to it by \nCongress. Some of our members are very concerned that Mr. Kennard may \nbe so tied to the FCC's current policies that he will be not fully \nresponsive to congressional concerns about them.\n  These concerns have led to sequential questions by myself, Senator \nBurns,\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nSenator Stevens, Senator Brownback, Senator Helms, and others about Mr. \nKennard's ability and willingness to reexamine and change policies of \nthe FCC that we believe misinterpret the law and harm consumers. These \nconcerns are only heightened by the very public way in which the \nadministration has sought to involve itself in the deliberations of \nthis supposedly independent regulatory agency.\n  Obviously, I do not agree with Mr. Kennard on many issues. For \nexample, he believes that the FCC can and should tell broadcasters what \nkinds of programming they must present. I vehemently disagree. He \nbelieves that the FCC's current policies on telephone competition are \nworking. I vehemently disagree. I am also troubled by the fact that, \nwhen asked, he was unable to specify any particular issue with which he \nmight have disagreed with the FCC's current chairman--despite the fact \nthat the FCC had disposed of thousands and thousands of issues during \nhis tenure as its general counsel. That did not bode will for the \nindependence of his approach to governing the FCC.\n  Mr. President, I am going to vote in favor of his confirmation, and I \nwill tell you why. Mr. Kennard has an unblemished reputation for \nintelligence and integrity, and I find him to be an individual with \nwhom I believe we can work in an atmosphere of mutual candor and \nrespect.\n  In the final analysis, Mr. President, I believe it is neither \nreasonable nor necessary that all members of the Senate endorse the \ncurrent policies of the FCC or Mr. Kennard's personal policy \npredilections. It is much more important that the Senate understand how \ndifficult the issues are that Mr. Kennard is going to be called upon to \ndecide, and that we undertake to work closely and collaboratively with \nhim in resolving them. I give you my promise, as chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, to exercise the committee's oversight \nresponsibility exactingly and continuously, and I know the members of \nthe committee are as committed to this task as I am.\n  On this basis, Mr. President, I am pleased to support the \nconfirmation of William E. Kennard as Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield such time as is necessary to the \ndistinguished Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \ncommittee and I also thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I was very pleased to hear the chairman's statement that it is his \nbelief that Mr. Kennard possesses an ``unblemished reputation'' for \ncandor and integrity. I appreciate his comments and believe they have \nbeen well stated.\n  As California's Senator, I am particularly pleased to rise in support \nof the President's nomination.\n  Bill Kennard has very strong California roots. He was born in Los \nAngeles. He graduated with honors from my alma mater, Stanford \nUniversity. He then attended Yale Law School.\n  Bill Kennard's family also has strong California roots. His father, \nRobert Kennard, now deceased, was a very well-regarded architect in the \nLos Angeles area. He formed the largest continuously operating African-\nAmerican architectural practice in the western United States and also \nserved as the founding member of the National Organization of Minority \nArchitects.\n  His mother, I want this body to know, is also a distinguished person. \nShe grew up in the great Central Valley of California. She received a \nmaster's degree in bilingual education and has worked in the field of \nbilingual education in Los Angeles.\n  The President's nomination is, in fact, a historic one. Following his \nconfirmation, he will be the first African-American to serve as FCC \nCommissioner in the history of the United States. He is well prepared \nfor the challenges ahead of him. He has a broad telecommunications \nbackground in both the public and the private sector and an impressive \nrange of experiences that, I believe, will serve him well and serve the \nNation well.\n  Since 1993, as the chairman mentioned, Bill Kennard has served as FCC \ngeneral counsel. He has represented the Commission before the courts \nand served as its principal legal advisor. In that capacity, he has \ndefended the commission well.\n  Bill Kennard was a partner in the Washington law firm of Verner, \nLiipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, specializing in communications \nlaw. He has served as assistant general counsel of the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters.\n  I also know that he has been involved in the needs of his community \nhere in Washington and has served on the board of a nonprofit homeless \nshelter.\n  With this committee's leadership, the Congress was able to pass the \nmost comprehensive communications legislation since passage of the 1934 \nCommunications Act, upgrading our telecommunications law to address \nmodern telecommunications needs.\n  The 1996 act sought to develop a regulatory framework that provides \nthe benefit of competition for consumers, spurs the development of new \nproducts and reduces costs, while it also removes unnecessary \nregulatory barriers.\n  Congress has set the stage for a new telecommunications era, and we \nneed to ensure that that law is implemented properly and that it works \nfairly for consumers. I think that, as FCC general counsel, Bill \nKennard has the experience to help see these reforms through.\n  I happen to believe he will be an independent and a strong voice, yet \nresponsive to the concerns that the distinguished chairman has pointed \nout. I am pleased to add a California voice and to support this \ndistinguished nominee.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, we have been working with Senator McCain and Senator \nHollings and their staffs and, of course, William Kennard. I met with \nhim for some time in my office. Mr. Kennard is the nominee to be \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as you know. Now, \nall of us--and I think it is fair to include Mr. Kennard--want to \nrectify an awkward and unjustifiable situation that has developed in \nthe Federal Communications Commission process of awarding broadcast \nlicenses. Specifically, in this case, a well-known and highly respected \nand popular broadcasting executive in Asheville, NC, was curiously \ndisqualified in his application for an FM frequency in the Asheville \narea. There was a lot of resentment in the public about that.\n  What happened, Mr. President, was that this gentleman, Zeb Lee, of \nAsheville, and 12 other groups, had applied for the FM frequency when \nit became available in 1987. The Commission's comparative hearing \nprocess, in effect at that time, was used to determine which group \nwould be the most qualified for the frequency.\n  Zeb Lee had run station WSKY-AM in Asheville for 46 years, during \nwhich time he did the play-by-play for about 4,000 high school football \ngames, and by sponsoring such public interest things as an Elvis \nPresley concert in 1955, which I would not have listened to, but most \npeople did want to hear it. But he made so many innovations in \nbroadcasting that he became just a household word, in terms of his \nname. He is enormously popular to this day.\n  Well, Mr. President, in 1989, a 20-day hearing was held during which \nan FCC administrative law judge disqualified most of the other \napplicants because the judge ruled that they either lacked experience, \ndidn't have transmitter facilities ready to go, or were basing their \napplication purely on provisions favoring minorities--women and others. \nThe judge found for the Lees, ruling in their favor on May 4, 1990. The \njudge found that the Lees were the most qualified, citing their \nstewardship of the AM station and Mr. Lee's commitment of involvement \nin the day-to-day management of the station. The FCC then favored \nactive involvement by owners in the day-to-day operations\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\nof a radio station, as opposed to passive investors who would not be \nactive managers. I think that is the way to go, as a former \nbroadcaster.\n  In any case, Mr. President, in addition to the first ruling in favor \nof Zeb Lee and his people, on April 8, 1991, the FCC Review Board \naffirmed the administrative law judge's ruling. And then on February \n28, 1992, the FCC released its first decision favoring the Lees and a \nsecond decision also favoring the Zeb Lee application was released, I \nbelieve, on November 23, 1992.\n  So on June 14, 1993, the FCC released a third ruling favoring the \nLees.\n  Well, Mr. President, you might say, ``Why is Helms going to speak \ntoday talking about this nominee and this situation in Asheville, \nNC.?''\n  The FCC granted a construction permit to the Lees on April 30, 1993, \nfollowing which they began the construction process. So it went through \na series of regulatory twist and turns in which the Lees complied with \nevery order and requirement issued by the FCC and the administrative \nlaw judge, who stipulated that Mr. Lee must dispose of his AM station \nas a condition for acquiring that FM license--which Mr. Lee did. \nAmazingly, on June 18 of this year, the FCC which had reversed itself \non June 2, forced the Lees off the air.\n  Zeb Lee has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to examine the manner in \nwhich the FCC handled his application, which led to his being taken off \nthe air. The court will shortly issue a decision in the near future.\n  Mr. President since April 30, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in the \nBechtel case of December 17, 1993, struck down the ``comparative \nprocess'' that had been used to determine allocations of radio and \ntelevision frequencies. The court directed the FCC to come up with new \ncomparative standards. The Lees and about 25 to 30 other people were \naffected by this decision.\n  But their cases have been frozen ever since. Additionally, a \nprovision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which went into effect \nJuly 1, required that all radio and television frequencies be subject \nto auction. This provision concerned me because Zeb Lee's case and \nanother 25 to 30 cases were in the pipeline and could be subject to \nauction which nobody anticipated.\n  I find no fault with the provision in the balanced budget \nlegislation, but it crept in the back door on Mr. Lee and the others.\n  So, to get to the meat of the coconut, Mr. President, I submitted \nquestions to Mr. Kennard through Senator Burns' Commerce Communications \nSubcommittee about all of this. I ask unanimous consent that the \nnominee's responses be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Senators should note that Mr. Kennard clearly feels the FCC can \nconduct hearings on this small group and class of applicants using new \ncomparative criteria.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I then consulted and wrote to the able \nchairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \nMr. McCain, seeking assurance that Senator McCain now agrees that the \nprovisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 do not prohibit the FCC \nfrom using the comparative process in these 25 or 30 cases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of my letter and Senator McCain's \nresponse be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been given assurances satisfactory to me by Mr. \nKennard that he will, within statute and regulation, work in good faith \nwith me and others to resolve the problems the Bechtel decision caused.\n  I was very impressed when Mr. Kennard came to my office and met with \nme about 3 weeks ago. I appreciate his voluntary assurance that he will \nwork with us on the Zeb Lee case. Therefore, Mr. President, I support \nthe nomination, and I am going to ask for the yeas and nays. I hope \nthat he will be confirmed unanimously by the Senate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nResponses of William E. Kennard to Post-Hearing Questions Submitted by \n         Senator Conrad Burns on behalf of Senator Jesse Helms\n\n       1. As you know, the recent budget legislation included a \n     provision that appear[s] to require the FCC to apply auction \n     procedures to pending applications for radio stations. These \n     provisions were reportedly aimed at resolving the \n     applications that have been in limbo since the Bechtel case \n     struck down a part of the FCC's rules governing comparative \n     license application proceedings. Please clearly state your \n     views in response to the following questions:\n       a. In your opinion, is the FCC now required to apply these \n     auction provisions to all pending application cases, or does \n     the FCC have discretionary authority not to handle pending \n     cases through this auction approach?\n       In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress required the \n     FCC to use auctions to resolve all future comparative \n     broadcast proceedings involving commercial stations. For \n     pending applications, the statute states that the Commission \n     ``shall have the authority'' to use auctions. The Conference \n     Report states that this provision ``requires'' the Commission \n     to use auctions for pending cases. The Commission will be \n     determining in a rulemaking proceeding implementing the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 how it should proceed with these \n     pending cases. The statutory language suggests that the \n     Commission has discretion to use comparative proceedings for \n     pending cases.\n       b. While most of the pending comparative cases had not gone \n     through a hearing before an administrative law judge, and had \n     at least an initial decision issued, a relatively small \n     number of these cases had in fact been decided under the old \n     rules by an ALJ and in some cases decisions made by the full \n     Commission, although these decisions may have been on appeal. \n     In those cases, the parties often had spent many years and \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars to advance their \n     applications under the old rules. Do you believe that it \n     would be more equitable not to apply auction procedures to \n     the cases which were far along in the process, where the \n     applicants had played in good faith under the old rules, and \n     to instead have those cases decided using any existing \n     hearing record pursuant to such special rules as the \n     Commission might adopt for deciding them?\n       I do believe that the Bechtel decision has caused \n     unfairness to many applicants who have had further processing \n     of their applications delayed and, as a result of that court \n     decision, will necessarily have their applications processed \n     under new procedures. I am quite sympathetic to their \n     predicament. That is why the Commission argued to the court \n     in Bechtel that the court's decision should only apply to new \n     cases. Unfortunately the Commission was not successful and \n     the court rejected this argument. As noted above, the issue \n     of what those procedures will be, that is, whether some or \n     all pending applications should be auctioned or decided \n     pursuant to some new, yet-bo-be developed criteria, will be a \n     subject of the Commission's rulemaking proceeding \n     implementing the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Commission \n     certainly may consider as part of that rulemaking proceeding \n     any arguments that particular classes of pending applicants \n     should be treated differently.\n       c. The U.S. Court of Appeals in the Bechtel case ordered \n     the Commission to issue new comparative rules. Although the \n     Commission never formally adopted such new rules, its staff, \n     including your office, prepared draft rules to respond to the \n     Court's order. Please summarize how those draft rules would \n     have dealt with pending cases, and comment on whether those \n     drafts might be suitable and readily adaptable for use in \n     resolving at least those pending cases that had reached the \n     point where an initial decision had been issued based on a \n     hearing record.\n       The FCC staff presented a draft order to the Commission \n     earlier this year. In that draft, the staff recommended that \n     pending hearing cases be resolved by a lottery pursuant to \n     section 309(i) of the Communications Act. The Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997 eliminated the Commission's authority to use \n     lotteries for these cases, so the staff proposal is no longer \n     an option.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: My folks have conducted numerous discussions \n     with your good people about the FCC treatment of Zeb Lee, a \n     long-time Asheville broadcaster, in response to Lee's attempt \n     to secure an FM radio station. (Zeb and approximately 25 to \n     30 other applicants were left stranded in the regulatory \n     process by the Bechtel court decision.)\n       Additionally, I understand these 25 to 30 applicants are \n     not affected by the provision requiring the auctioning of all \n     radio and television licenses that was included in the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which went into effect July 1 of \n     this year.\n       The FCC contends that it interprets this provision as \n     giving the Commission the authority to decide whether these \n     25 to 30 applicants be judged on the basis of the comparative \n     hearing process. John, I do hope that you agree that this is \n     a proper interpretation.\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n       Furthermore, in the future if the courts question this \n     interpretation for these applicants, I do hope that you will \n     reaffirm this interpretation and move related legislation \n     swiftly through the Senate.\n       Many thanks, John.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                        Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC. October 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jesse: I am aware of your concern over whether Section \n     3002(a) of the Balanced Budget Act would permit the Federal \n     Communications Commission to use comparative hearings where \n     mutually-exclusive applications have been filed for initial \n     licensees or construction permits for commercial radio and \n     television stations. As a principal proponent of this part of \n     the legislation, I am happy to have this opportunity to \n     respond to your question.\n       Section 3002(a) specifically states that, with respect to \n     competing applications filed before July 1, 1997, the \n     Commission ``shall have the authority to conduct'' auctions. \n     Therefore, the Commission's authority to conduct auctions in \n     these situations is clearly and explicitly permissive, not \n     mandatory. Moreover, the statute contains no provision \n     affecting the Commission's existing authority to hold \n     comparative hearings, although it does explicitly repeal the \n     Commission's authority to conduct lotteries. Read together \n     under long-established principles of statutory \n     interpretation, there can be no doubt that these provisions: \n     (1) permit, but do not require, the use of auctions to select \n     initial licensees for commercial radio and television \n     stations; and (2) that the Commission is (a) permitted, but \n     not required, to use comparative hearings to select such \n     licensees or permittees in cases where it determines that \n     auctions should not be used, but (b) is not permitted to use \n     lotteries to select licensees or permittees for any service.\n       As to the impact of legislative history (conference \n     reports, floor statements, and other such collateral \n     material), it is a basic tenet of statutory interpretation \n     that where, as here, the letter of the law is unambiguous on \n     its face, legislative history cannot be read to override it. \n     Therefore, any such statements that appear inconsistent with \n     the clear terms of the statute cannot be interpreted to \n     contradict it or to call it into question.\n       Finally, in the unlikely event that any future court \n     opinion misconstrues the statute, I will do whatever is \n     necessary to secure the passage of legislation that will \n     restate the terms of the statute as reflected in this letter.\n       I sincerely trust this will answer your questions fully. I \n     would be pleased to provide you with anything further you \n     might wish on this issue at any time you feel it would be \n     helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, if it is in order and agreeable to the \nmanager of this nomination, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the manager.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. For the information of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, he has about 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his \ncooperation on what is a very important issue with one of his \nconstituents, and one of great importance to him. I am grateful for his \ncooperation and that of his staff in resolving it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination \nof William Kennard to serve as Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  There is perhaps no industry that has undergone more rapid or greater \nchange than the telecommunications industry. In terms of technology, \nownership, and opportunities, the communications industry has literally \nundergone a revolution. These changes will create opportunities for \nconsumers, existing companies, and new entrants. In the coming years, \nthe FCC will face enormous challenges as it attempts to cope with these \nchanges and finishes implementing the provisions of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n  No one is more prepared for that challenge than Bill Kennard. He has \ndemonstrated exceptional leadership and mastery of the issues during \nhis 4 years as general counsel of the FCC, and his many years as a \ntelecommunications lawyer. When I think of Mr. Kennard, I think of \nsomething that Jean-Claude Paye, former Secretary General of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said of the \nchanging times in which we live. He said that societies concerned about \ntheir economies ought to look to their fraying social fabric, as \neconomic growth is the weave of national character. The waft of it, he \nsaid, are the people who embrace and master social change.\n  Bill Kennard is one of those individuals. He will bring to the helm \nof the FCC not only an understanding of the industry and the economics, \nbut the social and societal implications of the issues that he will \naddress as Chairman of the FCC.\n  Mr. President, I expect great things from Bill Kennard and I look \nforward to working closely with him as he steers the telecommunications \nindustry into the 21st century. I commend the President for choosing \nsuch a qualified and competent individual for this duty, and I hope \nthat every one of my colleagues will support his nomination.\n  I thank the managers of this nomination, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of William E. Kennard to the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC]. The telecommunications industry has seen incredible \ntechnological advances made over the last two decades. As a result, the \nresponsibilities and scope of the FCC have increased dramatically. \nToday, it is more important than ever for FCC Commissioners to be able \nto respond and adapt to these changes in a timely manner.\n  Recently, the FCC issued a regulation that will have a profound \nimpact on the trucking industry nationwide. While ordinarily one would \nnot think of an FCC action having an adverse impact on trucking \ncompanies, such is not the case in this situation. On October 9, the \nFCC issued a regulation implementing a provision of last year's \nTelecommunications Act, which directed the FCC to provide for adequate \ncompensation of pay phone operators. The new FCC regulation ordered \nlong-distance companies to pay payphone owners 28.4 cents per call for \neach call to a toll-free number unless the payphone owner and the long-\ndistance company have a contract specifying a different rate. The \ncharge applies to both customer toll-free numbers and to company access \nnumbers, including those on prepaid calling cards. The charge became \neffective immediately.\n  Long-distance carriers, in turn, are passing this charge along to \ntheir customers. The carriers are not limited to a set charge and as a \nresult the amount being charged varies depending on the carrier.\n  Pay phones are the life line between the Nation's 3.2 million truck \ndrivers and their home offices. A driver will call in numerous times \nduring the day and in most cases will talk no longer than 2 minutes. \nNevertheless, under this new rule, the trucking company will be charged \neach time a driver calls in.\n  Arkansas has been fortunate to have a significant trucking industry \nbased in our State. Some of the largest trucking companies in the \nNation are headquartered there. This new regulation will have a \ndevastating effect on their business costs. For instance, in the case \nof J.B. Hunt Trucking, it is estimated that this new regulation will \nincrease the company's phone bill by approximately $200,000 a month. \nThis will equate to $2.1 million annually.\n  Smaller trucking firms have also contacted me and said their phone \nbills are projected to double under this new rule. A small business is \ncompletely unable to absorb an increase of this magnitude.\n  When it comes to using payphones, the trucking industry is virtually \na captive consumer. There is no real alternative and no option to avoid \npaying what is, in effect, a very expensive tax.\n  Mr. President, we need to explore alternatives to provide some relief \nto this industry. I will be contacting the FCC Commissioners to work \nwith them on this problem and I would encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who requests time?\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to support the confirmation of Bill \nKennard's nomination to be Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission. You will find no one more qualified than William Kennard.\n  Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider the nomination of \nWilliam Kennard for Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission \n[FCC].\n  Mr. Kennard has spent his career in the communications field--as a \nfirst amendment attorney with the National Association of Broadcasters; \nas a communications lawyer in private practice; and the last 3 years as \ngeneral counsel of the FCC. Mr. Kennard brings a tremendous amount of \nexperience to the job at a critical time in the communications \nindustry. A great deal of work remains to be done to fully implement \nthe 1996 act. He is eminently qualified for the task at hand.\n  The overarching goals of the 1996 act are to preserve Universal \nService, and to provide a transition from monopoly to open competition. \nMr. Kennard understands that neither of these objectives will happen on \ntheir own accord. It will be the responsibility of Mr. Kennard, the \nthree new commissioners confirmed last night, along with Commissioner \nNess, to fulfill these objectives by balancing the competing interests \nof industry with the public interest.\n  For the past 20 months, the FCC has been doing its best to implement \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. The rules adopted by the FCC have \ngenerated a great deal of controversy and subsequent litigation. Most \nof those issues are either pending in the courts or before the FCC on \nreconsideration. So it goes without saying that Mr. Kennard will have a \nvery important, and sometimes difficult, job ahead of him.\n  First, and foremost, the new Commission must understand that the \nUniversal Service System we have today is a mechanism designed to \nmaintain low-cost affordable phone service in rural and high-cost \nareas. These areas of the country would not have had telephone service, \nmuch less any economic development, were it not for the Federal support \nand Government mandate of Universal Service. The Commission should be \nvigilant to maintain Universal Service and its attendant benefits.\n  The second issue is the promotion of competition across the various \nindustries. Much of the deregulation of the act was premised on the \ncommitments made by industry to compete with each other. Now some \nsegments of the industry are having second thoughts about competition. \nThe grand plans pledged to the Congress over 2 years ago no longer seem \nso grand. Competition does not come with a money-back guarantee. The \nCongress did not guarantee any incumbent continued marketshare. Nor did \nthe Congress guarantee that competitors would gain marketshare. What \nthe Congress attempted to guarantee was the right to compete under \ncertain conditons. It will be the FCC's job to enforce those conditions \nto bring the benefits of competition to consumers. More importantly, \nthough, its job will be to protect consumers where competition and the \nmarketplace fail.\n  As the FCC decides each of these issues, the most important aspect of \nits responsibility is to safeguard the public interest. The FCC's job \nis to protect consumers by promoting competition and removing barriers \nto entry or, in the alternative, enforcing regulation where competition \ndoes not exist.\n  Mr. President, you will find the frustration of those addressing this \nparticular subject comes about from a failure of implementation by the \nprivate industry itself. We worked for 4 years on the \nTelecommunications Act that passed last year. It is noted that we had \n95 votes. A strong bipartisan support was worked out to the \nsatisfaction of all the entities. Now we find some of those entities \ncoming in and petitioning and enjoining and appealing to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. There are some 73 local carriers that now have enjoined \ntheir local commissions.\n  You will find one particular RBOC that has petitioned the Court on \nthe constitutionality of what we enacted after they sent a wonderful \nletter in support of what we enacted.\n  What you are seeing on behalf of the industry overall is a freezing \nof the board by the majority. And there has been very little movement \nof cable into telephone, telephone into cable and RBOC into long \ndistance. They have not met the so-called checklist, and have held up \non it. That is what is really in force.\n  So some of these mergers could well break it loose in the \ntelecommunications wall--again, the wall of competition.\n  Mr. Kennard, I am convinced, understands what is going on. He would \nhave to at the Commission level as the general counsel. I hope under \nthe law and the requirements of public interest and in balancing all of \nthe interests of the various carriers with that public interest in mind \nthat we can move forward.\n  So I appreciate the situation and would be delighted to yield to \nothers.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I understand the Senator from South \nCarolina yielded to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be glad to yield that time. Go right ahead.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to add my voice to support the nomination \nof William Kennard to be the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, and I am proud to say that he is a native of my home State \nof California. I join with Senator Feinstein today in this moment of \npride.\n  Bill Kennard's experience and knowledge of communications issues will \nbe extremely important in helping the FCC deal with the many, many \ndifficult challenges it faces. He has been their general counsel since \n1993 serving as the principal legal adviser of the agency during an \nextraordinary period in the history of communications.\n  The last 4 years have seen dramatic changes in communications \ntechnology, communications markets, and communications policy. We know \none important thing is for certain. There will be more historic changes \nalmost every month and every week in this area.\n  In a series of historic decisions, the FCC has rewritten the rules \ngoverning every lane of the information superhighway--local, long \ndistance, international telecommunications, satellite, spectrum, \nbroadcast television, and multichannel TV.\n  Bill Kennard has a bird's-eye view of these important changes, \nproviding excellent advice and counsel to the FCC Chairman and \nCommissioners.\n  Prior to joining the FCC, Bill Kennard practiced communications law \nfor several years where he specialized in broadcast, cable TV, and \ncellular matters. He knows where the communications world has been. And \nhe has a strong vision for the future of the communications world.\n  I urge the Senate to give unanimous approval to this very important \nnomination.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has his own time. I \nwould be delighted to yield whatever time is necessary.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank very much the Senator from South Carolina for \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in recommending to the \nSenate William Kennard to be Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  By his record as general counsel, Mr. Kennard's tenure as Chairman of \nthe Commission promises to be both able and insightful at a time of \nextraordinary technological change in the United States.\n  Yesterday, at my request, this nomination was held until today so I \nwould have an opportunity to meet with Mr.\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\nKennard. What may be the best proof is former Speaker O'Neill's maxim \nthat ``all politics is local.'' At a time when the Commission is \ndealing with great national and, indeed, global issues, in this moment \nof extraordinary change in the industry, I needed an opportunity to \naddress with Mr. Kennard a continuing problem with the Commission in my \nown State of New Jersey.\n  For 15 years my predecessor, Senator Bradley, brought to this body \nthe continuing problem that the 8 million people of the State of New \nJersey are largely without internal communication because of the \ndominance of Philadelphia and the city of New York in television and \nradio. Indeed, New Jersey alone, through most of this century, has been \nwithout a commercial television station until Senator Bradley led the \neffort to bring one of those licenses to the State of New Jersey. The \nState still, in its commercial, political and cultural development, is \nnot properly served. That problem has now repeated itself with New \nJersey's largest county, home to nearly a million people in Bergen \nCounty, NJ, which may be without FM radio service. I know in the great \nplethora of issues this does not seem like a significant question \nunless you live in the State of New Jersey.\n  Bergen County, NJ, is host to more Fortune 500 corporations than all \nbut a few counties in America. It is one of the highest income counties \nin the entire United States of America and, indeed, has more people \nthan six States in the United States of America. But from everything \nfrom its internal political debate to news about emergencies within the \ncounty to the simple matter of school closings due to weather, people \nare unable to get basic information. Those licenses rest in the city of \nNew York. Indeed, most of them should. But one, at least one of them, \nas, indeed, with one television station, should be in this area of \nsuburban New Jersey.\n  I spoke at length yesterday with Mr. Kennard. I am convinced that he \nis as sensitive to the problem that the Commissioners responded to for \nSenator Bradley on previous occasions and that under Mr. Kennard's \nleadership the Commission will respond as well in sensitivity to both \nthe ongoing television problem but also this new dilemma of how to \nensure a continued FM radio presence. Therefore, I was very pleased \nlast night to have participated in asking that the nomination come to \nthe floor today and am very pleased today to rise in support of Mr. \nKennard's nomination.\n  For years, the 840,000 residents of Bergen County have relied on \nlocal FM radio in order to receive valuable traffic, weather and news \ninformation, as well as popular music entertainment. Indeed, on \nmultiple occasions, this service has served as a crucial link between \nthe residents of Bergen County and critical emergency information. In \n1996, when a water main break left over a half-million residents \nwithout water for nearly 3 days, a local FM station was the only source \nof live coverage from the scene of the break and the only source of \ncontinuous, round-the-clock reports throughout the emergency. Again \nduring the recent explosion of the Napp Chemical plant in Lodi, NJ, a \nlocal FM station was the primary source of onsite news and information \nabout the risks of possible toxic fumes which originated from the \nplant. Also, for years local FM service has provided extensive school \nclosing reports during snowstorms, and notified the public of road \nconditions and other weather-related emergency information.\n  However, the survival of FM service in Bergen County has recently \nbeen threatened by another Washington regulatory bureaucracy out of \ntouch with the people it is supposed to serve: The Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC]. Mr. President, I am here today to \nensure that the FCC does not succeed in ending FM service for Bergen \nCounty. This is a matter of principle, and it is the right thing to do \nfor the residents of my State. Until the advent of local FM service, \nthe residents of Bergen County had to rely upon radio stations in New \nYork City to provide them with their news and information. \nUnfortunately, radio stations in New York City focus on the news and \nneeds of the residents of that city, and oftentimes ignore those living \nin the New Jersey suburbs.\n  Bergen County has more than 70 municipalities and school districts, \nsix State legislative districts, two congressional districts, 231 \nsquare miles, and a population larger than the States of Alaska, \nMontana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and the District \nof Columbia. It is a county of tremendous size and importance, and it \ndeserves an FM news and information source of its own.\n  Yesterday, I met with William Kennard, the President's nominee to be \nChairman of the FCC, and I am confident that the commissioners of the \nagency will work with my office to preserve FM service for Bergen \nCounty. If the FCC is to continue in its mission to ensure broadcast \ncapability for the public interest, then the commissioners must end \nthis instance of broadcast discrimination against the people of Bergen \nCounty, NJ.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand there is some time left to \ndiscuss the nominee?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in voicing my \nstrong support for the nomination of William Kennard to serve as \nChairman and member of the Federal Communications Commission.\n  With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal \nCommunications Commission faces the daunting challenge of being a \nregulatory agency that will promote a deregulated telecommunications \nindustry. The FCC requires a leader who will be able to charter the \nagency and the industry through these unchartered waters.\n  Mr. Kennard brings a keen understanding of the telecommunications \nindustry and superb academic credentials to the agency. His years of \nexperience as the FCC's general counsel have provided him with the \nexperience and insight to hit the ground running. I am confident that \nhe has the leadership qualities to effectively lead the multi-member \nagency and to forge the consensus needed for the FCC to accomplish the \ngoals of the 1996 act. He will being keen intellect, good judgment, and \ncommon sense to the office of Chairman and to the agency as a whole.\n  I believe that Mr. Kennard is an outstanding nominee. I am convinced, \nthrough my personal experiences of meeting him as well as from \ndiscussions from around the entire telecommunications industry, that he \nwill serve with distinction. I strongly support his nomination and \nencourage my colleagues to do the same. I look forward to working with \nChairman Kennard in the future and offer him my congratulations on his \nconfirmation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof William E. Kennard, of California, to be a member of the Federal \nCommunications Commission. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 284 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\n\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Burns\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, some days ago, the two distinguished \nSenators, Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici, offered an amendment which they \nproposed to call up at some point during the debate on the highway \nbill. There has been no floor discussion of that amendment. I have seen \nand read various things that are being written about the amendment and \nin criticism of the amendment which Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner and \nI have offered for printing. My colleagues and I had offered an \namendment several days ago and indicated we were offering it for \nprinting, and that we intended to call it up at such time as the \namendment tree was dismantled, and we would have an opportunity to call \nup the amendment.\n  There have been some discussions of our amendment, but I think it is \nappropriate to talk about the amendment now that has been offered, I \nassume, as an alternative to our amendment. I don't know what the \nprognosis of this bill is--whether it will be taken down and no action \ntaken on extending the highway bill, or whether there will be a 6-month \nextension, or whether there will be a 6-year bill. I should think that \nthe chances for the latter are diminishing with every passing minute.\n  In any event, it seems to me that there ought to be some discussion \nabout the Chafee-Domenici amendment. I have spoken to Mr. Chafee a \nnumber of times about the amendment and have indicated to him that I \nthought we ought to have some discussion of it so that certain \nquestions might be clarified. I personally have a few things to say \nabout the amendment. I think the public is entitled to some \nenlightenment as to what it does and what it does not do. So that is \nthe reason why I have chosen to take the floor at this time.\n  The sponsors of this amendment, my friends Senators Domenici and \nChafee, have brought forward an amendment that claims to be an \nalternative to the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. I think when all \nMembers thoroughly review the Domenici-Chafee amendment they will find \nthat it is not an alternative at all. Rather, it is an effort designed \nto obfuscate and confuse Senators into thinking that they, the authors \nof the amendment, have accomplished the same ends as the Byrd-Gramm \namendment.\n  Senators ought not be confused. I can understand how they are being \nconfused, however. There have been no discussions of the Chafee-\nDomenici amendment on the floor. There has been discussion of it in \nmemos that have been passed around, letters, articles in various \npublications, one of which was Congress Daily on yesterday, which was \nnot accurate in many ways. Inasmuch as there has been considerable \ndiscussion of the Byrd-Gramm amendment, I think there ought to be an \nexplanation of the Chafee-Domenici amendment and it ought to be out \nhere on the floor in open view where everybody can see what is being \nsaid and hear what is being said and make up their own minds.\n  I feel very much like I am being shot at by someone behind a \nbarricade. They don't come out in the open in public view and take \ntheir shots at the Byrd-Gramm amendment there, but I am being shot at. \nAll kinds of things are being said about this amendment that I have \noffered, many of which things are absolutely not true. Also, many \nthings are being claimed on behalf of the Chafee-Domenici amendment \nthat are likewise inaccurate. So I think that there ought to be more \ndiscussion regarding the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Let's talk about \nit.\n  The differences between these amendments--the Chafee amendment on the \none hand; and my amendment on the other--are as simple as they are \nstark. The Byrd-Gramm amendment authorizes an additional $31 billion in \ncontract authority for investment in our Nation's highways over the 6 \nyears covered in the underlying ISTEA bill.\n  The Domenici-Chafee amendment authorizes not even one, not even one \nadditional dollar in contract authority for this 6-year period.\n  The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment authorizes the spending of a \n4.3-cent gas tax that is now going into the highway trust fund on our \ntransportation needs over the next 6 years. The Domenici-Chafee \namendment does not authorize any of this gas tax revenue to be spent on \nour highway, bridge and safety needs. That is a big difference. Our \namendment authorizes the spending of the 4.3-cent gas tax that is now \ngoing into the highway trust fund.\n  We say it ought to be spent. The American people are being told that \nthat is what it's for. They are not being told that if it goes into the \ngeneral fund, it will be spent on the various\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\nand sundry other programs, such as Indian roads, research, Head Start, \neducation, parks, or just put into the General Treasury. They are not \nbeing told that. They think it is going into the highway trust fund to \nbe spent on transportation needs--highways, mass transit, bridges. I \nthink we owe them, in all honesty, an explanation. We ought to try to \nsee to it that that money is spent for highways, mass transit, bridges, \nand so on.\n  We are not saying in our amendment that it ``shall'' be spent. But we \nare authorizing contract authority, and then come next spring when the \nAppropriations Committees meet and we have debate on the budget \nresolution, we will get into discussions as to whether or not there \nwill actually be obligation authority to spend that money and, if so, \nhow much, and so on. We are saying if savings are there, from which the \n$31 billion will come, and if we are going to spend those savings, \nthen, transportation needs are top priority.\n  But the Domenici-Chafee amendment does not authorize any of this gas-\ntax revenue to be spent on our highway, bridge, and safety needs. \nMembers should not be surprised by this. My friend, the Senator from \nRhode Island, had stated in earlier debate on this bill that he does \nnot believe that the 4.3-cents gas tax should be spent on our \ntransportation needs. That is his view, and I respect him for that. He \nisn't running for a rock to hide under. He is just announcing from the \nsteeple tops that he doesn't believe that the gas tax ought to be spent \non transportation needs. He thinks it ought to go toward reducing the \ndeficit. He is very plain and open about that, and you have to admire \nhim for that. That is his view, and I respect that.\n  However, that is not my view. It was not the view of the 83 Senators \nwho voted in favor of an amendment on this floor on May 22 of this year \nthat called for the 4.3 cents to be transferred to the highway trust \nfund and spent on our transportation needs.\n  The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment keeps faith with our vote on \nMay 22. It keeps faith with the millions of American citizens who fill \ntheir gas tanks and pay their gas taxes, with the expectation that \nthese funds will be spent on the construction and rehabilitation of our \nhighways and mass transit and bridges. The Domenici-Chafee amendment \ntells those millions of Americans and those 83 Senators that they must \nwait for another day, wait until next spring, wait until we have the \nnext budget resolution before the Senate, and, perhaps, maybe--we don't \nknow--we might consider authorizing the spending of your gas taxes on \nthe Nation's highways and bridge needs, and then again, we might not. \nWe don't make you any promises. But, by all means, don't do anything on \nthis bill; don't take action on this bill, the highway authorization \nbill. Wait.\n  The Domenici-Chafee amendment says that notwithstanding the fact that \nwe are currently debating a 6-year highway authorization bill, now is \nnot the time to decide the authorization level for highway spending for \nthe next 6 years. Don't do it now--not now, not here. Wait. You Members \nhere who are waiting with open mouths and open arms to see legislation \npass that will assure your State and your State's transportation \ndepartment of so much contract authority so that they can at least \nbegin to think about it and plan about it, all of you just wait, don't \ndo anything now. This is that old 6-year highway bill that comes out of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. Wait. Don't do it on that \nbill. Wait. Wait until some day in the future--maybe never.\n  I have said as clearly as I can what the Domenici-Chafee amendment \ndoes not do. Allow me to take a moment to explain what the Domenici \namendment does do. The Domenici-Chafee amendment seeks to establish a \ncomplex and convoluted process that basically enables the Senate to \nhide under a rock when it comes to the issue of highway taxes and our \nhighway needs. The Domenici amendment proposes a new, Rube Goldberg, \nfast-track process for each of the next 5 years that would allow the \nCongress to increase highway and/or mass transit authorizations in some \nyet-to-be-determined amount each year, if the budget resolution for any \nsuch year allows it. You can just forget about this highway bill. Just \nwait, wait until another time, and if the budget resolution allows it, \nthen we might increase highway and/or mass transit authorization. That \nwill be determined next year--maybe, but not now.\n  Not surprisingly, the amendment would also allow the Congress to \nignore all those new procedures and do absolutely nothing. Members know \nthat I am not in favor of fast-track procedures. I don't favor fast \ntrack on trade, and I am not going to vote for fast track. I don't \nfavor fast-track procedures. We have too many of them now. In my view, \nthey trample on the rights of all Senators and they cut off meaningful \ndebate. When it comes to the Domenici-Chafee amendment, I think all \nMembers should cast a careful eye on this so-called fast-track \nprocedure, because this fast-track amendment may very well be the slow \ntrack to additional highway spending.\n\n  So they say, take a look at our amendment, and if you are going to \nincrease contract authority for your State and your State and your \nState and your State, we will know that at some point next spring--not \nnow. This is the highway bill. That is the way we have been accustomed \nto doing it. But forget it, that is that old 6-year highway bill. Don't \nfool with it or pay any attention to that.\n  I am quite surprised that Senator Chafee, the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, would go along with that idea. \nHis committee has been the key committee when it comes to jurisdiction \nin authorizing contract authority. But now he has joined in an \namendment that says: Not now, maybe next year sometime--maybe. There is \nno guarantee. Maybe next year and, if next year, we are going to have a \nfast-track procedure.\n  When I was a boy, I read a book called ``Slow Train Through \nArkansas.'' Well, that was in the old days when they believed in \nvoodooism and snake oil and patent medicines that were sold by \ntraveling con salesmen, and so on. So, next year, under the Chafee-\nDomenici amendment, we will have a fast track--not the ``Slow Train \nThrough Arkansas,'' but a fast track.\n  If Senators vote for the Domenici-Chafee amendment, you are not \nvoting for a single dollar in your State for contract authority over \nthe next 6 years--not a single dollar. The Chafee-Domenici amendment is \nsaying: Wait until next year, we will take a look at it then. And then \nin the budget resolution, when that comes along, we will take a look at \nit then. Mind you, we are not saying in the Chafee-Domenici amendment \nthat we are going to spend any of that gas-tax money on highways. We \nare going to let that stay in the Highway Trust Fund. Let that money \naccumulate, and next spring, other governmental needs can compete with \nhighways in the use of that money in the trust fund.\n  Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici are not assuring you Senators that that \nmoney in the highway trust fund is going to be spent on highways. They \nare saying we are not even sure we can do that at all. We are not \nassuring you that you are going to get any extra money. We are going to \nwait until next year, they say. When the budget resolution is up here \nnext spring, then we will talk about it, they say. Then we will decide \nwhat we do with that money. We may spend it on highways; we may not. We \nmay spend it on Indian roads; we may not. We may spend it on parks and \nrecreation. We may spend it on the national forests. We may spend it on \nHead Start. We may spend it on welfare. There are a lot of things we \nmay spend it for, they say. But we don't make that decision here. Mr. \nChafee and Mr. Domenici say that we will make that decision when we \nhave the budget resolution.\n  So if you are on the Budget Committee, you are going to have control \nof that. The Domenici-Chafee amendment says that on this 6-year highway \nauthorization bill we should do nothing, nothing, nothing toward \nauthorizing additional highway funding. We should put that decision off \nuntil another day. That other day may never come. That other day need \nnever come.\n  If Members want to know how the authorized spending levels contained \nin the Domenici-Chafee amendment differ from the levels in the Byrd-\nGramm amendment, they need look no further than the first section of \nthe Domenici-Chafee amendment. I say the same to\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\nCommerce Daily. When Commerce Daily gets ready to write again, I \nsuggest they look at the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Look at it. Don't \ntake somebody else's word for it. Don't take some aide's word for it. I \nam not speaking disparagingly of aides. We have to have them, and I \nhave some excellent aides on my staff, and so have other Senators. But \ngo look at the amendment yourself. Look at the Chafee-Domenici \namendment. Read it. They will find it stated very clearly there.\n  That amendment reads, and I quote from section 3001(A)(2) of the \nChafee-Domenici amendment:\n\n       (A) For fiscal year 1999, $0.\n       (B) For fiscal year 2000, $0.\n       (C) For fiscal year 2001 [guess what?], $0.\n       (D) For fiscal year 2002 [guess again, and I'll give you \n     three guesses], $0.\n  In fiscal year 2003, try again. What is your guess? How much do you \nguess? Zero dollars. That is a joke.\n  Members, if you want to vote for the Chafee-Domenici amendment, do \nyou know what you are voting for? Zero dollars--next year, the next \nyear, the next year, and the next year. Look at it. Don't take my word \nfor it. Read it. Get that amendment and look at it. Members will find \nthat same paragraph repeated throughout the amendment when it refers to \neach of the highway and mass transit components of the amendment.\n  Here on the chart to my left is the difference between the two \namendments. Here is the difference between the Domenici-Chafee ISTEA II \namendment and the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner ISTEA II amendment.\n  Let me read it. It is in fine print. Maybe we ought to read the fine \nprint, or just plain read the print instead of taking somebody's word \nfor it. Go get the amendment. Read it for yourself. Don't read the \npropaganda that comes to you in a memo or a letter. But get the \namendment, and read it yourself. Don't take everything the preacher \nsays for being true. Read the Bible yourself. Go to the basic text.\n  All right. Here it is. ``Comparison of authorization of levels for \nhighway and bridge construction Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act (ISTEA II).''\n  I am going to ask my assistant to point out what I am reading so that \nthe viewers can look through that electronic eye up there and follow me \nand see if I am reading it correctly. I do not want to mislead you. \n``Fiscal year 1992-1993 total.''\n  For those 5 years, what is the total under the Domenici-Chafee ISTEA \nII amendment? What is the total additional contract authority for \nhighways during those 5 years? Let's see. Under the Domenici-Chafee \nISTEA II amendment, the total for those 5 years that you will be voting \nfor, if you vote for the Chafee-Domenici amendment, you are going to be \nvoting for zero dollars. There it is right there, a big cipher!\n  All right. What about the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner ISTEA II \namendment? What additional contract authority are you voting for? \n$30,971,000,000 over a period of 5 years. That is the difference. The \ndifference between $30.971 billion, and zero--zero. That is the \ndifference between the two amendments.\n  Members will find that paragraph, as I say, repeated throughout the \namendment when it refers to each of the highway and mass transit \ncomponents of the amendment.\n  Now, later in the amendment, we read that all those zeros--zero for \n1999, zero for 2000, zero for 2001, zero for 2002, and zero for 2003; \nall those zeros we find, if we read the Chafee-Domenici amendment--we \nread that all those zeros may be further amended someday in the future \nunder a ``fast track'' procedure, or they may not. And the funding \nlevels that may substituted for the zeros throughout the amendment can \nbe found later in the amendment under the heading ``additional highway \nfunding.''\n  So if Senators look later in the amendment, you will find the funding \nlevels that may be substituted for these zeros for the 5 years--``may \nbe substituted'' for the zeros. You will find those funding levels that \nmay--may--at some time in the future be substituted for the zeros. You \nget the zeros now. But maybe sometime in the future there will be \nfunding levels substituted. What are the numbers that may be \nsubstituted? Well, you will find them in the Chafee-Domenici amendment \nunder the heading ``additional highway funding''.\n  That part of the amendment--let's take a look at it--reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Section 3001(a)(2) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1997 is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``$0'' and inserting \n     --\n\n  How much?\n  ``blank'';\n  So maybe sometime in the future we will substitute for this old big \nzero--hold your breath. We are going to substitute for that zero--get \nready now. I am going to pull a rabbit out of the hat. We are going to \nsubstitute for that zero--``blank.''\n  Let me see it. Could I be telling the truth here? That is what it \nsays here on page 7. Is that the Chafee-Domenici highway amendment? \nYes. On page 7:\n\n       Section (1). Additional highway funding.\n       In subparagraph (A), by striking ``$0'' and inserting . . \n     .''\n\n  Well, there is a dollar sign--dollar sign, and a long line --\n``blank.''\n\n       Paragraph (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``$0'' and \n     inserting ``blank'';\n\n  And so on for all the paragraphs, A, B, C, and D.\n  So the amendment strikes ``zero'' and inserts ``blank'' in each \nparagraph. You strike the zero. We had five zeros up there earlier, but \nmaybe sometime in the future, if Senators vote for this amendment, we \nwill substitute at some time in the future for that zero, we would \nsubstitute a dollar sign. This says ``zero'' dollars. We will leave the \ndollar sign, take out the zero, and just draw a straight line, and \nsubstitute ``blank.''\n\n  Well, that sums it all up, Mr. President. The Domenici Chafee \namendment is shooting blanks. We shoot real bullets in ours--Mr. Gramm, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Warner, and I--no blanks. That sums it up. The \nDomenici-Chafee amendment is shooting blanks.\n  That is about all that these publications, commenting on the Chafee-\nDomenici amendment, will find in the amendment. Have they taken a look \nat the Chafee-Domenici amendment? Go see it for yourself. Read it. It \nis a public matter.\n  There is no real new contract authority in the Chafee-Domenici \namendment. It is an amendment about process. And, if any of you \nSenators want to know how much of the additional 4.3-cents gas tax this \nChafee-Domenici process may spend on highways, the answer is we don't \nknow. We can't tell you. Maybe some of it will be spent. Maybe none of \nit. Maybe a little of it. Maybe a lot. Maybe a lot one year, and none \nthe next year.\n  Under the Chafee-Domenici proposal, who will decide whether any \nadditional funding is authorized over the next 6 years? Certainly not \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. No, no, no. That committee \nmight as well disband as far as this subject matter is concerned. Who \nwill decide? It will be the Budget Committee. The Domenici amendment \nsays that, depending on what the ``budgeteers'' decide in the budget \nresolution every year between now and 2003, we may be able to get \nconsidered in the Senate a new fast-track highway and transit funding \njoint resolution.\n  So it will be the Budget Committee, not the authorizing committee, \nnot that old Environment and Public Works Committee, and not the \nAppropriations Committee. Take your choice. It won't be either of them. \nAm I right? It is going to be the Budget Committee.\n  We will not need the authorizing committee. We will just let the \nbudget committee decide it all. They will decide whether it is going to \nbe zero dollars or whether it is going to be ``blank'' dollars. And \nthen, whatever it is going to be, that committee will decide whether we \nare going to have a fast track, a slow track, or no track. And each \nyear that budget resolution may or may not spit out a new kind of joint \nresolution, a highway and transit funding joint resolution. If the \nbudget committee decides that there should be such a joint resolution, \nthen it would be treated under a very tight fast-track procedure. It \nwould be unamendable, except for amendments to either raise or lower \nthe dollar amounts. Then, after no more than 10 hours of consideration, \nthe Senate would proceed without intervening action or debate to vote \non the final disposition of highway and transit funding joint \nresolutions to the exclusion of all motions\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nexcept a motion to reconsider or to table.\n  Finally, a motion to recommit would not be in order, and all points \nof order against these funding joint resolutions would be waived.\n  That is the fast-track procedure that Senators will find outlined in \nthe Chafee-Domenici amendment to the highway bill.\n  There are no procedures expedited or otherwise for our colleagues in \nthe other body to take up such a joint resolution. We are just going to \nbind and gag the Senate, you understand; that is all. Senators will be \nlimited to 10 hours. And Senators can only offer certain amendments to \nraise or lower the dollar level. But if Senators are not satisfied with \nthe formula, forget it. You can't offer an amendment to our fast-track \nbill dealing with formulas. If any of you are unhappy about formulas, \nyou can't offer an amendment on that bill. That is a fast-track bill. \nAnd, besides, there is nothing outlined in this so-called ``fast-\ntrack'' procedure that guarantees Senators of anything once the bill is \npassed by the Senate and sent to conference, or sent to the other body.\n  If Senators turn to the very end of the Domenici-Chafee amendment, \nthey will see subparagraph 3. That subparagraph reads as follows and I \nquote:\n\n       In the House of Representatives.--``Blank.''\n\n  There it is again. More blanks.\n  There are no procedures for this so-called ``Highway and Transit \nFunding Joint Resolution'' to be considered in the other body.\n  So, if such a joint resolution gets out of the Senate, it might just \nsit in the other body until the end of the Congress or until the crack \nof doom, whichever comes first. Or the House might amend the resolution \nand insert new substantive legislation--perhaps a complete new highway \nformula. Even though Senators would be strictly limited in the \namendments they can offer to this resolution, there is no limit to what \nchanges and amendments might be entertained in the other body. Of \ncourse, we don't have jurisdiction over their procedures. But why \nshould we bind and gag and virtually blindfold Members of this Senate \nwhen it comes to fast-track procedure? We could be required to have a \nformula fight with the House over highway funding each and every year \nfor the next 6 years if we wanted to authorize additional spending for \nthe highway bill.\n  Well, I hope that all of my colleagues are carefully following this \nprocess. This is the process that they are being asked to vote for \nunder the Chafee-Domenici amendment. The Byrd-Gramm amendment doesn't \nbind you to any fast track. The Byrd-Gramm amendment simply says let's \nauthorize the new gas-tax revenues in the trust fund to be spent over \nthe next 6 years on our highways and other transportation needs.\n  That is it, pure and simple. We believe that. Most Senators believe \nthat. They have said so. They voted so.\n\n  The Domenici-Chafee amendment calls for a 17-step process with 11 \ncontingencies which, in the end, might not authorize one, not even one, \nmight not authorize one--this is a $1 bill with George Washington's \npicture on it--might not authorize even one additional trust fund \ndollar for our highways.\n  Now, that is the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Why don't you come out \nhere and talk about your amendment? Read it. Read it to the other \nSenators.\n  It is a process that is designed to continue to allow us to hide \nunder that rock--hide under that rock--while our highway needs go \nwanting, while our bridges deteriorate, and while our traffic jams \nworsen. It is a process that will only heighten cynicism of our \nconstituents and continue to undermine the trust of the American people \nin the highway trust fund.\n  My colleagues, I am not fooled by this amendment, and you should not \nbe fooled either. Get it and read it. This amendment is not about \nspending our trust fund dollars on highways. It is not about restoring \nthe trust of the American people in our highway trust fund. This \namendment is about ignoring the usual authorization-appropriations \nprocess and substituting a burdensome, multistep process designed to \nconfuse the American people and enable the Congress to do absolutely \nnothing when it comes to authorizing additional highway spending.\n  I am sure that Senators Domenici and Chafee had nothing but the best \nof intentions in offering this amendment. Unfortunately, their proposal \nis an unnecessary and unwarranted intrusion on the existing \nauthorization and appropriations processes and provides no assurance \nwhatsoever--none--that any additional highway or transit spending will \nbe authorized. It is in violation of the Budget Act--a 60-vote point of \norder will lie against the Chafee-Domenici amendment.\n  The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, on the other hand, is in \nkeeping with the existing budget, authorization, and appropriations \nprocesses. Although our amendment is also subject to a 60-vote point of \norder, it is due to the increased authorizations contained in our \namendment. The question of the level of highway obligation limits and \nwhether the discretionary spending caps will be raised are left to the \nappropriations and budget processes. Our amendment does not resort to \nany new, highfalutin, confusing, fast-track resolution process which I \nfear will allow Senators the opportunity to hide under that rock and \nignore both our highway needs and the skyrocketing balances in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Now, I say what I have said with the greatest respect for the authors \nof the amendment. I have sought to get an explanation of the amendment. \nI want an explanation that is a public explanation. I do not want an \nexplanation by somebody who has not even read the amendment. I do not \nwant an explanation by a publication that does not bother to read what \nthe amendment says.\n  I do not want that kind of an explanation. I want an explanation of \nthe amendment here on this floor. I do not want to be shot at from \nbehind a barricade; I cannot see who is shooting at me. Besides, that \nperson may be wearing black glasses. From time to time, when I am out \non the hustings, it happens in every crowd. I'll bet the Presiding \nOfficer has had this same thing. Somebody will walk up to me with dark \nglasses, black glasses: ``Bet you don't know who I am, Senator. Bet you \ndon't know, Senator. Bet you don't remember me.''\n  Well, of course, I don't. I can't see you. I can't see your eyes.\n  I urge that we have a public explanation of the Chafee-Domenici \namendment in this forum. Explain these zeros. Explain these blanks. And \ntell other Senators how your amendment compares with the Byrd-Gramm-\nBaucus-Warner amendment. Explain it. How is your State going to get \nmore money under your amendment? How is your State going to get any \nmoney out of the Chafee-Domenici amendment? Explain it out here in \npublic view.\n  So while I have great respect for these two fine Senators--and they \nare. They are fine Senators--I nevertheless urge all Senators to join \nme in voting, if we ever come to a vote, to sustain the point of order \nagainst the Domenici-Chafee amendment. Sustain the point of order. And \nI hope that the point of order on my own amendment will be waived.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table proposed by the \nFederal Highway Administration, which compares the authorization levels \ncontained in the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment with the levels \ncontained in the Domenici-Chafee amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FY 1999-2003 TOTAL ADDITIONAL CONTRACT AUTHORITY PROVIDED BY BYRD/GRAMM\n                     AND DOMENICI/CHAFEE AMENDMENTS\n

Mr. President, I will yield the floor when the majority \nleader arrives. He will deal with a series of issues. One of those \nissues will have to do with the Defense authorization bill. We will \nhave a series of motions and a flurry of activity related to that bill. \nI thought that while we were waiting for the majority leader, I could \nsave time for our colleagues by simply talking about the underlying \nissue.\n  Let me begin by saying that while there is a deep division over the \nDefense authorization bill, while there are very strong feelings \nrelated to this bill that are held by individual Senators, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, while several of my colleagues and I feel so \nstrongly that we are going to do everything we can to prevent this \nconference report from being adopted, and while the President has \nissued a letter saying that he will veto this bill if this bill is \npresented to him in its current form, I want to make it clear that \ndespite all of these strongly held views, I think all Members of the \nSenate and the House have acted honorably.\n  I think this is a matter where there is just a disagreement on an \nissue which is partly principle, partly parochialism, perhaps on both \nsides, but it is critically important to me and to several of my \ncolleagues.\n  I think when the Founders wrote the Constitution, when they \nestablished the Senate, their purpose was to guarantee a full debate. \nSome of you will remember that Jefferson was the Ambassador to France \nwhen the Constitution was written. When he came back from France, he \nwent to Mount Vernon and visited with Washington who had been the \nPresiding Officer at the Constitutional Convention. He said to \nWashington, ``What is the Senate for?'' We had established a bicameral \nGovernment. We had the House of Representatives, and we had the Senate. \nSo Jefferson's question was, ``What is the Senate for?''\n  Washington, being a southerner, did something that southerners did, \nand to this day some still do. Southerners, especially when I was \ngrowing up, perhaps like when the Presiding Officer was, would \nsometimes pour their coffee into their saucer to let it cool and then \npour it back and drink it. So Washington poured his coffee into the \nsaucer, and he said to Jefferson that ``The Senate will be like this \nsaucer; the House, being elected every 2 years, will be caught up in \nthe passion of the moment, but the Senate will be the place where those \npassions cool in the light of reason.''\n  So today, to the extent we can, we are trying to allow these passions \nto cool because of our very strong feelings about this bill.\n  I would like to begin, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent \nthat a letter from the President's OMB Director stating the policy of \nthe administration to veto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Administration appreciates the efforts \n     you and your colleagues have made to craft an FY 1998 \n     National Defense Authorization bill that supports our \n     military strategy and our men and women in uniform. The bill \n     recently reported by the Conference Committee successfully \n     addresses many of the concerns voiced by the Administration \n     about earlier versions passed by the House and Senate. \n     Unfortunately, the bill includes provisions that severely \n     limit the Department of Defense's ability to compete weapons \n     maintenance workload between public and private sector \n     depots, a key concern identified in Statements of \n     Administration Policy.\n       The bill includes provisions whose intent is to protect \n     public depots by limiting private industry's ability to \n     compete for the depot-level maintenance of military systems \n     and components. If enacted, these provisions, which run \n     counter to the ongoing efforts by Congress and the \n     Administration to use competition to improve DoD's business \n     practices, would severely limit the Department's flexibility \n     to increase efficiency and save taxpayer dollars.\n       Both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National \n     Defense Panel recommended repeal of current laws that \n     constrain DoD's efforts to competitively outsource depot \n     maintenance workload. Rather than facilitating DoD's use of \n     competitive outsourcing, the bill attempts to further \n     restrict it.\n       The bill could reduce opportunities to use industry to \n     maintain future weapons systems. DoD could be forced to add \n     to its expensive public infrastructure in ways that duplicate \n     what already exists in the private sector. Future weapons \n     systems will rely increasingly on commercial technology, in \n     order to exploit commercial industry's rapid rate of \n     innovation and market-driven efficiencies. But by limiting \n     industry's role in maintaining future weapon systems, and in \n     other ways, the bill could frustrate this revolutionary \n     change.\n       The bill seeks to impose unique and inappropriate \n     requirements on DoD's process for allocating the work now \n     performed at the closing San Antonio and Sacramento Air \n     Logistics Centers. The Department is conducting a fair and \n     open competition to determine the most efficient and cost-\n     effective way to perform this work in the future. Both \n     private contractors and public depots are competing for the \n     work. By dictating how DoD should treat certain competitive \n     factors, the bill seeks to skew any competition in favor of \n     the public depots.\n       If the numerous problems cited above cannot be overcome, \n     the impact on the Department's costs and on our Nation's \n     military capacity would be profound; the President's senior \n     advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.\n       We need to encourage more competition from private \n     industry, not less. Billions of dollars in potential savings \n     are at issue. These resources should be used to maintain the \n     U.S. fighting edge, not to preserve excess infrastructure.\n       Finally, we strongly object to the bill's provisions on \n     high performance computer controls. The bill would severely \n     limit the President's flexibility to conduct foreign policy \n     by mandating permanent controls on the export of high \n     performance computers to specific countries, and would limit \n     the President's ability to adapt computer export controls to \n     changing security needs and technology trends. The bill would \n     also impose unrealistic Congressional notification, licensing \n     and post-shipment verification requirements that would have \n     the unintended effect of decreasing our ability to identify \n     and prevent exports of real national security concern. \n     Current law provides adequate authority to adjust controls \n     appropriately and to deal with any problem exports that may \n     occur.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to define the issue. I know that \nwe have several Members on both sides who know more about this issue \nthan they want to know, but many of our colleagues don't know anything \nabout the issue because they don't at least superficially appear to \nhave a dog in the fight. This has kind of come up suddenly, so let me \ntry to explain it. I will give you a little history, and let me repeat, \nas soon as the majority leader is ready to start, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  We had a Base Closing Commission. I was an original cosponsor of it. \nI voted\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nfor its establishment. We have had three Base Closing Commission \nreports. Each of them have closed facilities in my State. I voted to \nenforce each and every one of them. In fact, I was one of the few \nmembers who voted to have another Base Closing Commission.\n  While I hate them, the plain truth is that we have cut defense by a \nthird, and we have reduced defense overhead by 20 percent. We have more \nnurses in Europe than combat infantry officers, and we have a huge \noverhang of bureaucracy.\n  I have been supportive of the process to try to reduce overhead. I \nhave voted for Base Closing Commission reports that have closed very \nlarge bases in my State, because the process is one that the country \nand, therefore, the people of Texas benefit from.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, one of the bases closed by the \nlast Base Closing Commission was Kelly Air Force Base, which is a giant \nmaintenance facility that does logistics work for the Air Force. It is \na huge employer, a very important facility to San Antonio, to the \nState, and I believe to the Nation. The Base Closing Commission report \ncalled for closing Kelly Air Force Base.\n  I voted for the Base Closing Commission report. I did not like the \nresults. I did not agree with it. But it was part of the process. And I \nsupported the process. But what the Base Closing Commission report said \nis that the work at Kelly should either be transferred to another Air \nForce logistics center or it should be privatized, perhaps in the \nprivate facility which would take over when this base was closed.\n  So the Base Closing Commission report itself called for, as one of \nthe options, private contractors to do the work that Kelly is currently \ndoing. If after the base was closed, the flag taken down, and the \nmilitary personnel removed, a private contractor bids for the work and \nthe private contractor chooses Kelly Air Force Base as a site to do the \nwork, then that work would be done by private contractors in San \nAntonio, on private facilities that would operate where this Air Force \nbase used to operate.\n  What this bill does that I very strongly object to is this bill \nundercuts the ability of the Secretary of Defense to conduct price \ncompetition so that we can have bidding on this work. The taxpayer \ncould potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing \ncompetition to bear on the contracts that will flow from the fact that \nwe are closing Kelly and other bases around the country.\n  Some of our colleagues in the House who represent depots, which are \nGovernment facilities that do maintenance work, wrote into their bill \nfor all practical purposes redundant provisions that would have \nforbidden the Department of Defense from having competitive bidding. \nTheir basic approach, when you cut through all the legalese, was that \nall the work for maintaining military equipment will be done in depots \nby Government employees and that for all practical purposes there would \nbe no competition, no ability for private companies to compete. And \nthat was the provision in the House.\n  Those of us who feel strongly about this issue have strongly \nresisted. And as the distinguished chairman, the ranking member, and \nour colleagues from States that are affected know, this has been a long \nand bitter struggle. The bottom line is that the committee, in \nconference with the House, has written language--30 pages of language--\nthat has to do with limiting the capacity of the Defense Department to \nengage in price competition to determine who gets maintenance \ncontracts.\n  In fact, I think it probably was put best in an article that ran in \none of the Nation's newspapers where the point was made that while \ntechnically the language in this bill does not specifically prohibit \nprice competition, the new language would likely keep private \ncontractors from wanting to bid on the work.\n  The Defense Department has looked at this language. Several of our \ncolleagues have looked at the language. The Defense Department has \nconcluded, as the administration says in its letter, that if this \nlanguage were adopted that they would not have the capacity to have a \nprice competition for this procurement. They would be forced to do this \nwork under monopoly circumstances in a Government depot, that the cost \nof doing that would be substantially above those levels that might be \nachieved through competitive bidding.\n  In fact, there was a competitive bid for the first work that was \nmoved from Kelly Air Force Base. Interestingly enough, the winner of \nthat contract was a Government depot. But the important thing is the \nprice was substantially lower than the cost that the Government was \npaying. In fact, by having a competition, even though a Government \ndepot won the competition, the bid was $190 million below what the \ntaxpayer was paying; and the depot miraculously discovered that in \ntheir overhead they had hundreds of workers who could be released from \noverhead to do this work for $190 million less. Isn't it wonderful what \ncompetition does even to Government?\n\n  Now we are in the process of beginning to move toward competitive \nbidding for many other functions at these closed bases. Those \ncompetitions will occur this spring. It is the intention of the Defense \nDepartment to put this work out for bids, and if a private company can \ndo it cheaper, it gets the bid. If a depot can do it cheaper, it gets \nthe contract. And the net result will be literally hundreds of millions \nof dollars of savings for the taxpayer.\n  This is a principle that is well-established in our economy: If you \nhave competition, you tend to get higher quality and you tend to get \nlower cost.\n  We have provisions in this bill that will disrupt that process, that \nwill make it very difficult, if not impossible, for private contractors \nto bid on and potentially win these contracts. The net result will be \nthat rather than the taxpayer benefiting from the cost savings that \nwould come from competition, now this work is going to be dedicated to \nthe Federal Government and its various entities and no such competition \nwould occur under this language.\n  Granted, this language is 30 pages of mumbo jumbo, but the thrust of \nit, the focus of every word, the focus of every sentence is to inhibit \ncompetition.\n  Let me tell you what I see happening. I am not referring to any of my \ncolleagues. In fact, the people on the other side of this issue are \npeople that I have deep affection for. There is no one that I love more \nthan the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina who is \nchairman of the committee and who has done his best to work something \nout here that we could all live with. In the final analysis, he could \nnot get the House to take language that we could have unanimity on in \nthe Senate. But in any case, here is what is happening. I want to alert \nthe Senate and the American people to it.\n  We have cut defense now since 1985 by over a third. As a result, we \nare dramatically reducing our funds to maintain our military equipment \nand to procure new military equipment.\n  In this environment, there is sort of two ways you could go. One way \nwould be to say, ``Well, listen, with these huge defense cuts, we've \ngot to get the most we can for our money.'' So we want more competitive \nbidding. We want to put almost everything we do--within the constraints \nof this being defense and with its special needs--out for competitive \nbidding and try to get--to quote McNamara--probably not a good source \nto quote--``the biggest bang per buck.'' That would be one way to go. \nQuite frankly, that is the way we should go, in my humble opinion.\n  The other way to go, and the way we are going, is to take the very \nparochial view that defense is like welfare, and that agencies of the \nGovernment that have always had these contracts are entitled to them, \nwhether they can do the work best or not, whether they can do it \ncheapest or not, and that since defense is being cut back, we have all \ngot to grab what piece of it we can and hold it to our bosom and \nprotect our own individual facilities.\n  We are masters at coming up with rationalizations for the things we \ndo. You can argue that only Government employees can really understand \nan F-100 engine, even though private employees built the F-100. You can \ncome up with many rationalizations and not all of them without merit.\n  But the bottom line is that what we are doing in this bill is that we \nare impeding competition and we are stopping the Secretary of Defense \nfrom doing what he believes is in the vital\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\nnational security interest of the United States, and that is having the \ncapacity to put contracts out for competitive bidding.\n  I want competition. I would like to say--not that any of us ever have \nto justify what we do; the one thing that we try as Members of the \nSenate to do is to show each other the courtesy of not impugning one \nanother's motives--but I would like to make a point that at least it is \nimportant to me. I had the privilege of serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee for 4 years. It was a great privilege. And I had in that \ncapacity the opportunity to work with real giants. I have served with, \nin the Senate, Senator Goldwater, a hero of mine who I voted for \nPresident in 1964, and I have served with Strom Thurmond.\n\n  But I think anyone who has served with me, if they will remember from \nmy initial debate with Congressman Nichols, who was a Congressman from \nAlabama and who represented a big defense logistics facility, that from \nthe first year I was on the committee I have fought this business of \ndenying competitive bidding and price competition.\n  I do not believe that I have ever deviated from my support, in terms \nof defense procurement, of the principle that where the objective is to \nget the lowest possible cost and the best quality, that we should have \nprice competition.\n  I have objected to efforts to try to prevent us from forcing \nprisoners to work. I believe prisoners ought to work like taxpayers. \nBut that is a subsidiary issue and has no part in this debate. But the \npoint I want to make is, in my State we do have a closed military base \nwhich I voted to close as part of the base-closing process.\n  Nothing I am trying to do is trying to reverse the base-closing \nprocess. That base is going to be closed. The clock is running. \nFunctions are already being shifted. Military personnel have got their \norders to move off. I am not trying to reverse that.\n  But under the Base Closing Commission, one option that was open to \nthe Pentagon was competitive bidding, with the winner of the bid, if it \nwas a private company, having the option to chose where they wanted to \ndo the work.\n  Privitization is an option that is explicitly, specifically outlined \nin the Base Closing Commission report.\n  The Defense Department wants to follow that procedure. The bill \nbefore us will, for all practical purposes, prevent that from \nhappening.\n  Some of our colleagues, in debating this issue, have brought in \nPresident Clinton. I want to address that issue, if I may.\n  When the Base Closing Commission report came out closing huge \nlogistics centers in San Antonio and in California, President Clinton, \nwho has never been accused of not being a good politician, immediately \ndid what any red-blooded politician would do, and that is he lamented \nthe fact. In fact, he went to great lengths to talk about how terrible \nit was. I thought at one point he might put himself down in front of \nthe gate at McClellan, and just as a bulldozer was getting ready to run \nover him, he would have a trusty aide come in and have the Secret \nService drag him out.\n\n  It is also true that he said we will try to find a way to keep some \nof this work at Kelly and McClellan. If the assertion is that Bill \nClinton was playing politics in the 1996 Presidential election, I am \nsure he would plead guilty, and he clearly was playing politics.\n  But as is true of so much that our President says, he said it but he \ndidn't do it. He flirted with the idea of vetoing the base closing \nreport, but he didn't. He talked about helping these two bases and \ntheir thousands of employees, but in the final analysis, he didn't do \nanything special to help them. He did what virtually any politician \nwould do, and that is he felt their pain. He feels it better, or at \nleast convinces people he feels it better, than most.\n  Now, when the Defense Department, using the exact language of the \nBase Closing Commission, is trying to move ahead with competitive \nbidding to decide whether to transfer functions from these closed bases \nor to give them to private companies if they can do it better, cheaper, \nor both, people who don't want this competition say President Clinton \nplayed politics with the process.\n  The point I want to make is that any politician, whether running for \nPresident, dog catcher or whatever, is going to talk about feeling \npeople's pain when 22,000 people are being put out of work. There is no \ndoubt about the fact that the President actually had people recommend \nto him that he override the Base Closing Commission. But the bottom \nline is he did not override the Base Closing Commission report. The \nbases are being closed. Nor did he intervene to try to say you have to \ngive the contracts to private contractors who will use these old \nfacilities.\n  What the Defense Department is trying to do and what this bill before \nthe Senate seeks to prevent being done is to have a competition, where \nif the depots that are being protected by this language win the \ncompetition, they get the work, while if a private contractor wins they \nget the contract. This is what happened with the depot in Macon. The \nfirst competition saved the taxpayers $190 million by miraculously \ndiscovering hundreds of workers who were not so busy they couldn't do \nthis work. Yet there are still many who say there couldn't possibly be \na fair competition. It is very hard to convince people who don't want \nto be convinced.\n  Now, where are we and what is the issue here? Where we are and what \nthe issue is here is the following: We have 30 pages of language in the \nbill that basically have as their aim stopping competition. I have the \nlanguage here for people to see and I have given it to both the \nRepublican and the Democrat leaders. We had a meeting with the Pentagon \nand a meeting with the White House and have gone through these 30 \npages.\n  In the entire 30 pages we have come up with three major changes, one \nof which is changing a word, another of which is putting back in the \nbill language that was critically important to the Pentagon, critically \nimportant to the White House, critically important to those of us who \noppose this language, but which the staff dropped, saying it was a \ntechnical thing. It was technical. When Senator McCain said, ``Great, \ngreat, we can solve this problem. If it was technical, put it back \nin.'' Well, it may have been technical when they took it out, but when \nwe asked it be put back in, it was not technical.\n  Now, in addition, when the Pentagon was trying to negotiate with the \nstaff of the committee, the Pentagon and the staff reached a tentative \nagreement to strike some of the language. Not very much of it. As you \ncan look at this bill, you can go many pages without seeing a single \nmark of anything that would be changed.\n  But what happened, and again nobody is blaming anybody for it, but in \naddition to taking out language that was critically important to the \nSecretary of Defense--saying it was technical when they took it out, \nand that it didn't matter, but now it is critical and can't be put back \nin--in addition to that, there were a lot of provisions, little bitty \npiddly things that were agreed on to take out of the bill. But then \nsuddenly right at the last minute, it was discovered that that language \nhad been put in the report and that the report language has the effect \nof law. Part of our dispute and I think one of the reasons for the \nstrong commitment to try to do something here is a belief that we were \non the verge of a deal, that language had been struck from the bill in \ngood faith, and then we discover at the last minute that the language \nhas been put back. Our language was in the bill and then we discover at \nthe last minute that it has been struck.\n\n  So what those of us who vigorously oppose the bill in its current \nform have done is reduced our changes down to one page. It would take \n17 hours to read the defense authorization bill, and we may well have \nthe opportunity to hear it read before this debate is over. I think \nthat would be therapeutic because I think if people heard all this \nnoncompetitive language, they would be against it. But in trying always \nto be reasonable, in trying to follow the saintly principle of trying \nto accommodate other people and their legitimate needs and concerns, in \nworking with the Pentagon and the White House we have come up with one \npage of changes--one page. In a bill that would take 17 hours to read, \nwe have one page of changes that would apply to 30 pages\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nof language that is aimed at trying to prevent price competition. We \nhave one page of changes, and two of the three changes have to do with, \none, putting back in language that we thought had already been agreed \nto leave in the bill; and two, taking out language that had already \nbeen agreed to take out. Only we find that it has been put in the \nreport language and, therefore, for all practical purposes, has the \nsame effect.\n  So, of the things we are asking for, far more than half are things \nthat were already agreed to.\n  So it seems to me that even though the House has acted, we can try to \nhave a simple motion to amend this language in the bill. There is \nalready an effort underway to have a similar motion to fix an \ninadvertent change in language for Senator Domenici, and if we could, \nthrough a technical correction amendment, simply get this one page of \nsimple changes, half of which go back to what was already agreed on but \nwhich subsequently was changed at the last minute without our knowing \nabout it, if we could do this, two things could happen, and both of \nthem are good.\n  First, those Senators who are opposed to the bill could graciously or \nungraciously step aside and allow the bill to pass. Second, the \nPresident could sign the bill instead of vetoing the bill. But in order \nto do that, we are going to have to put back in language that was \npreviously agreed on and then later taken out. We are going to have to \ntake out language that was taken out and then later put back. Then we \nare going to have to reach an agreement on a couple of points that are \ntechnical but are important to the Secretary of Defense in meeting the \nnational security needs of the United States.\n  So I want to say to my colleagues we are at this unhappy state where \nwe have at least four and probably more of our colleagues who are going \nto try to the best of their ability to prevent this conference report \nfrom being adopted in this session of Congress. We want to work out an \nagreement. We want to pass this bill. There are things in this bill \nthat are provisions that I wrote, that I am for. We have a provision of \nthis bill to guarantee the status of senior military colleges. That is \nimportant. That is important to Texas A I love Texas A, other than \nmy family, more than anything else in the world. I want that language \nto become law. There are a lot of things in this bill that I care \nabout.\n  So I would like to work out an agreement. So would my colleagues--my \ncolleague from Texas, my two colleagues from California. But if we \ncan't work this out, we are tired of being run over. We are tired of a \nsmall group of Members of the House who have to have it their way, even \nif it means hundreds of millions of dollars of additional cost for the \ntaxpayer, even if it means a weaker national defense. They have \nliterally distorted this whole process, and for 3 years we have been \nengaged in a struggle where they have pursued their own individual \ninterest to protect their facilities at the expense of the taxpayer and \nat the expense of national security. If the alternative is to let them \nprevail, then we have no alternative except to resist. Again, obviously \nit is very difficult to resist a conference report, but we intend to do \nthe best we can in trying to do that.\n\n  Our intention, our hope, is that we can make these small changes. I \nwill give you one of the three things that we need changed. On page 5, \nline 8, of this 30 pages of anticompetitive language that is aimed at \npreventing price competition and, in the process, making taxpayers pay \nmore, there is a word that creates a tremendous problem for the Defense \nDepartment, and that word is ``ensure.'' Now, what the Secretary of \nDefense has said is that he could live with all of this language--I am \ntempted, and if I were in a more expansive mood, I would say ``rotten \nlanguage'' but I am not going to say it--if another word were used \ninstead of saying ``ensure.'' The sentence says,\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall require the performance of \n     core logistic workloads necessary to maintain the core \n     logistics capacities identified under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 \n     at Government-owned, Government-operated facilities of the \n     Department of Defense (including Government-owned, \n     Government-operated facilities of a military department) and \n     shall assign such facilities sufficient workload to ensure \n     cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime, while \n     preserving the surge capacity and reconstitution capabilities \n     necessary to support fully strategic and contingency plans \n     referred to in paragraph 3.\n\n  In other words, all the work goes to them.\n  Now, the Secretary of Defense, in trying to reach a compromise, says \nhe could live with promoting it but he can't live with ensuring it. \nNow, is it worth risking killing the whole bill over one word? Well, it \nis if you believe that one word is going to mean higher cost and less \neffective defense and if you believe that this is part of a continued \neffort of a small group of Members of the House to impose their will on \nthe whole process.\n  So I think we have come up with one page of changes in a bill that \ntakes 17 hours to read, many of which are just one word. If we could \nwork this out, we could get out of the way and this bill could be \nsigned by the President instead of being vetoed.\n  A final point, and I will yield the floor. We have already passed the \nappropriations bill for the Defense Department. We are here trying to \npass the authorization bill after the appropriations bill has already \npassed. We don't have to pass this bill. I would like to pass it. But I \nwould just like to remind my colleagues that we are here today, instead \nof being here 2 months ago, or a month ago, because of this one issue, \nand this one issue is that principally Members of the House are saying, \n``You are either going to protect my depot from competition, or else I \nam not going to support defense.'' That is basically what the House \ndepot caucus, as it is called, is saying.\n  What will happen if this small number of Members of the Senate who \nare today opposing this conference report lose is, first of all, we \nwill be unhappy about it. But second, the President is going to veto \nthe bill anyway and you are not going to be able to override the veto. \nSo the bill is not going to become law in any case. What we are asking \nfor, once again--and I would like to renew this request, and I would \nlike to try to get this material to our distinguished chairman and to \npeople who are interested--is to make one page of changes in a bill \nthat would take 17 hours to read and that gives totally unfair \nadvantage to depots as compared to private companies. If we must, we \nwill accept tilting the competition toward depots and away from private \ncompanies, even though it will mean higher costs and lower quality \ndefense, in order to reach a compromise. We are not willing to accept a \nprohibition against competition. I am sure we can all defend our \npositions, and probably will as this debate goes on.\n  I am happy that my position is in favor of competition. If companies \nbidding to do this work and wanting to do it in San Antonio, TX, can't \ndo it cheaper and better, don't give them the work. But if they can do \nit cheaper, if they can do it better, to the extent that I have power \nas just 1 of the 100 Members of the Senate, I cannot and will not step \naside while other Members of the Senate in essence say, even if private \ncontractors in San Antonio or California can do it better, even if they \ncan do it cheaper, even if it saves hundreds of millions of dollars, we \ndon't care, and we won't let competition occur because we are going to \nrun over people because we have a large enough number of people. We are \ngoing to say forget the taxpayers, forget competition, we want this for \nourselves. We have earned it. We have these depots and it is our right \nto have this work.\n  Well, I reject that. I think it is wrong. I believe I would reject it \nif there were no people in my State who wanted to compete for these \ncontracts. Now, there are people who want to compete for these \ncontracts, and I just want to repeat, in concluding, that I am not \ntrying to put any language in the bill that says give it to my people \nin Texas. I am not trying to put any language in this bill that says \ntilt the playing field toward the private sector.\n  I am willing to accept 30 pages of language that does everything it \ncan to prevent competition from ever occurring if they will make one \npage of changes. But I cannot and will not accept the position that \npeople in my State who want to do this work and who have been doing it \nfor years, who helped win the cold war and tear down\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nthe Berlin wall and liberate Eastern Europe and free more people than \nany victory in any war in the history of mankind, now all of a sudden, \nbecause a few Members who because of their numbers have dominated this \nprocess, say, ``Don't let people compete for my jobs,'' will not be \nable to compete to keep some of their work. I cannot step aside and let \nthat happen willingly. I may not be able to prevent it, as we will find \nout as this process goes along, but I have an obligation to fight it \nbecause it is fundamentally wrong for America to be preventing \ncompetition.\n  Almost as if on cue, our distinguished majority leader is here. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that it seems \ncustomary on this floor to say how much you appreciate and love \nsomebody and respect them. Of course, there is no better evidence of my \naffection for the senior Senator from Texas than the fact that back \nwhen--some may have forgotten that he ran for President. In the \nprimary, he ran against the then majority leader Bob Dole. I openly \nsupported the senior Senator from Texas over Senator Bob Dole, which \nwas politically pretty dumb for me to do. But I did it because I felt \nhe is a very capable individual.\n\n  Having said that, I would like to respond to the items that he has \nstated in his statement. Let me cover a couple of things that the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas talked about.\n  For openers, the Senator from Texas stated that the BRAC Commission, \nduring their process in 1995, offered as an alternative to privatize in \nplace. Let me suggest to you, Mr. President, that is not the case. It \nwas the case in Newark, it was the case in Louisville, it was the case \nin the Naval Air Warfare Center in Indianapolis; but it was not the \ncase in either McClellan Air Force Base or Kelly Air Force Base. The \nreason I say that is that, specifically in those first three instances \nwhere they did privatize in place, the BRAC report said specifically \n``privatize in place.'' Contrary to that, in the 1995 round, it \nspecifically said that whatever happens, whether it is privatization or \nanything else, you have to move the required equipment and any required \npersonnel to the receiving locations.\n  I think we all know why that is the case. If you have five air \nlogistic centers, each one operating at 50 percent capacity and you \nclose the two least efficient ones, according to the BRAC Commission, \nyou then would transfer that workload, and if you didn't transfer that \nworkload, you would have to somehow account for paying for 50 percent \nof overhead that isn't being used.\n  Now, when we talk about what this bill does, it is true that we are \nincluding in any competition a value for the vacancy that occurs, or \nthe 50 percent capacity that is not being used in the remaining ALC's. \nThere would be three remaining. That is only reasonable because there \nis a tremendous value to that.\n  Second, we are also providing a value of the actual real estate value \nof the facilities that would be used. For example, if the Senator from \nTexas wanted competition to come in and use Kelly Air Force Base, it \nwould not be fair competition to say, fine, you could have it for $1 a \nyear. Instead, the bill provides that it would have to be for the value \nof that institution. Those are dollars that otherwise would be spent on \nour defense system.\n  Third, I mention the question as to whether or not President Clinton \nmade a political statement when he suggested out in Sacramento, CA, \nthat they were going to leave that alone, I would like to read his \nstatement to you. It says:\n\n       On July 1, you were dealt a serious blow when the \n     independent Base Closing Commission said that we ought to \n     shut Kelly down. At my insistence and my refusal to go along \n     with that specific recommendation, the Air Force developed \n     the privatization in place plan that will keep thousands of \n     jobs here at this depot.\n\n  That is right before the Presidential election. If you look at this \none sentence which says, ``At my insistence and my refusal to go along \nwith that specific recommendation * * * '' that in and of itself is a \nvery clear violation of both the intent and the letter of the BRAC \nprocess.\n  I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there is a lot more debate that we \nwill hear on this subject. We would like to start a process that would \nget us on the DOD authorization conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11317-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, regarding the Coverdell A-plus education \nbill, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to H.R. 2646, \nthe Coverdell education bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. We have no \nopposition to moving to the bill, but, obviously, how the bill is \nconsidered will be of some interest to us. I know that the leader has \nindicated he would like to go to the bill and, as I understand it, \nthere may be a cloture vote as early as Friday on the bill itself.\n  Obviously, we still have not been able to resolve our problems \nrelating to campaign finance reform and, in part because of that and \nalso because this is a tax bill and not subject to reconciliation \nconstraints under which we have worked with other tax bills, Democratic \nSenators, I know, and perhaps some Republicans would appreciate the \nopportunity to offer amendments. We have an array of amendments on this \nparticular bill that we would like to offer and, of course, perhaps \nmost prominently of all, the non-tax-related matters for which there \nwould be an interest in having a good debate is the campaign finance \nreform bill.\n  Hopefully, by Friday, we can resolve that matter. But even if we do, \nthe issue would still stand that we would need to be able to offer some \namendments. So I am hopeful that we can arrange a way in which that can \nbe accommodated. Subject to how the bill is pending on Friday, we would \nbe subject to another cloture vote for which there would be a \nsignificant degree of opposition--hopefully unanimous on our side--so \nlong as the campaign finance reform issue and this tax matter has not \nbeen resolved. But we certainly will work with the leader to work \nthrough these matters, and we have no objection to bringing the bill up \ntoday.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 2646, the \n     Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools.\n         Trent Lott, Paul Coverdell, Robert F. Bennett, Pat \n           Roberts, Strom Thurmond, Gordon H. Smith, Bill Frist, \n           Mike DeWine, Larry E. Craig, Don Nickles, Connie Mack, \n           Jeff Sessions, Conrad Burns, Lauch Faircloth, Thad \n           Cochran, and Wayne Allard.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \ncloture vote on the Coverdell education bill will occur on Friday of \nthis week. We will have consultation with the Democratic leader and \nwill notify Senators as to exactly what time that would occur. We will \ngive them that information on Thursday so Members can make plans for \nwhat time we would have that vote and, hopefully, what time they could \nthen leave on Friday.\n  In response to the Democratic leader's comments, first of all, this \nis a very, very important issue. I have found that any time that I \nexplain what the Coverdell A-plus provision will do, people of all \nbackgrounds and races and situations in education are very much \nattracted to it. We would allow people, whether it is parents or \ngrandparents or even other groups, to be able to have savings accounts \nsimilar to individual retirement accounts.\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nAnd those moneys can be used with tax benefit to help children with \neducation, K through 12--kindergarten through the 12th grade. That may \nbe for computers, or it could be for a tutor. It could be for supplies, \nor it could be to make some decision on their own as parents as to \nwhere their children would go to school. It is the sort of thing we \nhave for higher education in America.\n  I think one of the reasons we have very good higher education in \nAmerica but much weaker elementary and secondary is because we don't \nhave the same resource, the same opportunity, the same financial \nbenefits available.\n  So I think this is a bill that has a lot of support. We saw that here \nin the vote earlier this year in the Senate.\n  I am glad that Senator Daschle indicates that they do not object to \nus getting to the substance of this bill.\n  With regard to amendments, I certainly think it would be a good idea \nand would want amendments to be offered. I would like for them \ncertainly to be germane amendments. After we get cloture on this issue \nthen we would go to the amendment process. I am sure that Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle would probably have some amendments that they \nwould like to offer.\n  I think, once again, it is very unfortunate that this matter would be \ntied up over the campaign finance reform issue. We continue to work to \nget some agreement that we can go along with.\n  As a matter of fact, once again, just like last week, I had thought \nwe had an agreement. We had a unanimous-consent agreement typed up. \nSenator McCain is now saying that is not what he meant, that is not \nwhat he wants, or he needs something different. But we will continue to \nwork on it. Senator Daschle and I have talked. I have talked to \ninterested Senators in trying to get resolution as to when it would be \nhandled.\n  I say, again for the Record, it would be my intent to call this issue \nup before the end of the first week in March. I don't intend to fill \nthe tree up. I would like amendments to be in order. The problem is \nSenator McCain wants some specific extra provision as to what he might \noffer and how it would be voted on. That is what we are still working \non. But we get very close, and then it slides back a bit. We will keep \nworking on that because, again, I think it would be unfortunate if the \nSenate would continue to be tangled up on that issue while letting \nvery, very important national issues like our national transportation \ninfrastructure, highway improvement and educational opportunities in \nAmerica--even fast-track trade agreements--because we can't get an \nagreement on this other issue.\n  But as majority leader I am going to call these important bills up. \nAnd this one will get a cloture vote, and then hopefully we will \nproceed to the substance and relevant amendments that would be offered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish \nquickly to respond.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader mentioned several \nother pieces of legislation that have urgency to them. Our position has \nbeen all along that on those occasions where there is urgent \nlegislation, we want to work with the majority to expeditiously move \nthose bills through the process. One in particular is the 6-month ISTEA \nbill. We have indicated that we are more than ready to respond to the \nbipartisan Governors' request stated yesterday in a letter that we pass \na 6-month ISTEA bill. Members of the House leadership have said they \nwill only accept a short-term bill. The House short-term bill is \ncurrently on the calendar.\n  I hope we can take that House-passed bill, amend it with any \nimprovements the Senate deems appropriate, and quickly to deal with the \nurgent matter of reauthorizing expired safety programs and the urgent \nmatter of providing contract authority that the 6-month legislation \naddresses. So we are more than willing to work with our colleagues on \nsuch matters of urgency.\n\n  This tax bill, however, would not be called urgent. It may be, as the \nSenator has indicated, a popular bill. But there are other popular tax \nbills that didn't get in the budget reconciliation package last summer \nthat many Senators want to revisit. This happens to be one of them.\n  We have a whole host of other tax provisions that we think the \nSenate, if we are going to have a tax bill, ought to at least give some \nthought to reconsideration.\n  So again we are certainly ready to work with our colleagues, and I am \nwilling to work with the majority leader to see if we can't resolve \nthat matter. But I am very hopeful and determined to ensure that we do \ncome to some final agreement on a procedure on campaign finance, and, \nlike the majority leader, I stand willing to work with those who have \nbeen very much involved in the issue to see if we can do that this \nweek.\n  I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Ms. Collins]. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could just respond further, I think I \nhave made it clear my commitments trying to get the ISTEA extension \nhighway infrastructure bill done. Basically, the Senate spent 2 weeks \ntrying to get on the substance of that bill. Because of the unrelated \ncampaign finance reform issue, the highway bill has had to be pulled. I \nindicated more than once repeatedly that if we didn't get cloture and \nget on the substance the Members that were blocking that bill would \nhave to bear the responsibility for it. For those Governors and those \nhighway people that now would like some additional action, where were \nthey a week ago? Why weren't they talking to the Senators that were \nopposing cloture that would allow us to get on to this highway bill?\n  So, if they have any ideas now as to how to proceed, I urge them to \ntalk to the chairman and ranking member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and explain why they weren't involved a week or 2 weeks \nago so we could get to the substance of this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11321-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11322-S11323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR \n                  FISCAL YEAR 1998, CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate turn to the consideration of the DOD authorization conference \nreport, and it be considered as having been read.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I sought recognition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if I might have the indulgence of the \nmajority leader to try to explain where we are, and I will do it very \nbriefly.\n  We have before us a bill that would take 17 hours to read. It has 30 \npages in it that are aimed primarily to prevent competition from \noccurring in defense. In preventing competition from occurring, it will \ncost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and it will prevent \nprivate contractors--some of whom might use facilities at Kelly Air \nForce Base in Texas or might use facilities at McClellan Air Force Base \nin California, or might use other facilities anywhere in the country--\nfrom competing.\n  Despite the fact that we have a bill that would take 17 hours to \nread, despite the fact that we have 30 pages of language which is \nprimarily aimed at preventing this competition, in working with the \nDefense Department and with the White House, we have come up with 1 \npage of changes that if it could be made in technical corrections to \nthe language of the bill, then we would happily get out of the way and \nlet the bill pass.\n  The President, who is committed to veto the bill--and I put his \nletter in the Record--would then gladly sign the bill. So the point I \nwould like to make is that while we are here to resist to the best of \nour ability--and we will resist--that we are only a few changes away \nfrom the ability to move ahead with a bill that not only could we pass \nthis afternoon but that the President could sign.\n\n  It is my understanding that there may be other technical language \nchanges related to an amendment that\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nSenator Domenici wrote that was adopted by the Senate, and then \nsubsequently was technically changed by the staff. Senator Domenici is \nseeking to get a technical change to correct this mistake. I think if \nyou look through the 30 pages of depot language--what the Leader is \nlooking at--you can see that we are asking for hardly any changes, but \nthat these are changes the Secretary of Defense and the President \nbelieve are critical to their ability to operate the Defense Department \nefficiently and to meet the national security needs of the country.\n  So, while we are here today to obstruct, we are willing, with just a \nfew changes, to allow the bill to go forward, and in the process we can \nget a guarantee that the President will sign the bill.\n  So I would like to urge my colleagues to work with us to correct this \n30 pages of language which is aimed at preventing competition.\n  So, while we obstruct, we hope to make progress.\n  And, based on that hope, I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under his reservations, would the Senator withhold on his \nobjection, and allow me to make a comment and ask a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Certainly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if he would yield for a response, I \nunderstand that these few changes are about 30 pages.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been notified by four Senators that they have \nobjections.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Those are the 30 pages in the bill. The only changes we \nare making are the changes that are written in black ink.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me just say I have worked with this issue, as the \nSenator knows, and the other Senator from Texas, over the last 2 or 3 \nyears. I know there are other Senators that have an interest in it and \nhave different views. I know a mighty effort has been made on all \nsides. This is not a partisan issue. It is a difficult issue between \nsome States, though, to try to resolve it.\n  I really felt like we were never to bring it to a head until we get \nthis legislation started. That is my intent here. We are going to get \nit started off.\n  I have discussed with Senator Daschle the possibility that we at some \npoint--we met this afternoon--we meet to see what else can be done. I \nam certainly willing to continue to work with both sides to try to find \na resolution.\n  But we are running out of time in this session. This is a very, very \nimportant bill for national defense and the security of our country.\n  So I thought we should go ahead and get started. And hopefully that \nwill cause us to try to find some way to resolve this one remaining--\none remaining--very difficult issue to resolve.\n  I thank the Senator for withholding so I could make that comment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the minority leader seek recognition?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do, Madam President. But I would be happy to allow the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas to complete his remarks.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was seeking recognition, Madam President, both to \ncomplete my remarks, and to object. If the distinguished minority \nleader wanted to speak before I objected, I would be glad to withhold.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the accommodation of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Madam President, just very briefly, because the distinguished \nmajority leader made some comments relating to the ISTEA bill, let me \njust say as succinctly as I can, there is a difference between \ndesirable outcome and an essential outcome. A 6-year bill certainly is \ndesirable. I have long favored a 6-year bill with my full support. But \na 6-month bill is now essential. House leaders have said they are not \ntaking up the desirable bill. They are taking up the essential bill--\nthe 6-month bill that bridges the two legislative sessions to \naccommodate our Nation's highway, transit and safety needs. We have \ncome to the recognition, given our current circumstances, that the \nessential bill may be all we can do.\n  So I do think it is important as we consider these bills to recognize \nthat there is a difference between essential and desirable. We \nrecognize the importance of getting the essential work done. That is \nthe reason we would support this afternoon taking up that bill.\n  I again appreciate the accommodation of the Senator from Texas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11322-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11323-S11331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n\n                           Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, just again for clarification of what we \nare doing here, there are very strong feelings and great ground for \nsubstantive disagreement on this issue. Before we start a series of \nprocedural votes, I thought it made good sense for both sides, \nproponents and opponents of the position in the conference report, to \nsort of have a chance to lay out their positions. By doing it this way, \nthe time will be actually controlled between the two sides. Then we \nwill have some procedural votes. And it is my intent to also file \ncloture on this issue tonight.\n  Beyond that, we will see what happens. So, for the next 45 minutes, \nthen, we will have debate equally divided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n7 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Madam President, I rise to oppose the Defense authorization \nconference report. I oppose this conference report because it contains \nlanguage that will effectively ban any further public-private \ncompetition of depot workload at McClellan and Kelly Air Logistics \nCenters. If this restrictive depot language remains in the bill, the \nPresident has said he will veto the bill. A letter is already in the \nRecord, signed by Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin \nRaines, to that effect. I will read the letter in part:\n\n       The bill includes provisions whose intent is to protect \n     public depots by limiting private industry's ability to \n     compete for the depot-level maintenance of military systems \n     and components. If enacted, these provisions, which run \n     counter to the ongoing efforts by Congress and the \n     Administration to use competition to improve DOD's business \n     practices, would severely limit the Department's flexibility \n     to increase efficiency and save taxpayer dollars.\n       Both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National \n     Defense Panel recommended repeal of current laws \n     constrain DOD's efforts to competitively outsource depot \n     maintenance workload. Rather than facilitating DOD's use \n     of competitive outsourcing, the bill attempts to further \n     restrict it.\n  This so-called compromise essentially puts an end to the Defense \nDepartment's plan to conduct public-private competitions for the depot \nwork currently done at both Kelly and McClellan. The possibility for a \nprivate company to win one of these competitions is the cornerstone of \neach community's reuse plan that resulted from the Base Realignment and \nClosure Act which will close both of these bases at the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Continuing to quote from Director Raines' letter:\n\n       The bill seeks to impose unique and inappropriate \n     requirements on DOD's process for allocating the work now \n     performed at San Antonio and Sacramento Air Logistics \n     Centers. The Department is conducting a fair and open \n     competition to determine the most efficient and cost-\n     effective way to perform this work in the future. Both \n     private contractors and public depots are competing for the \n     work. By dictating how DOD should treat certain competitive \n     factors, this bill seeks to skew any competition in favor of \n     the public depots.\n\n  This skewing of the outcome of these ongoing public-private \ncompetitions is what is unacceptable, and we will fight it to the \nbitter end.\n  We tried to work with the committee toward an agreement. At one time, \nthe Senators from Texas and California thought we had succeeded in \nreaching an agreement with the committee. We were ready to buy half a \nloaf. There were four points we wanted, but the agreement we thought we \nhad only contained 2\\1/2\\ of those needs. We agreed to back off. \nOvernight those who wrote the bill put in technical language which \nessentially killed the ability for private contractors to bid. One of \nthe ways they did it was by hiding their overhead costs.\n  I think the Senators from Texas can well explain how this has \nhappened in the past, and how great a disincentive this would be to any \nprivate company who might want to bid on our workloads.\n  I find it amazing that this depot caucus language was still included, \neven after the first private-public competition held for Kelly's C-5 \nair work workload was won by Warner Robins Air Logistics Center in \nGeorgia.\n  Members of the Depot Caucus have complained from the first day these \ncompetitions were announced by the Air Force that they would be unfair \nand biased. They said that public depots could not possibly win. But \nWarner Robins won. How did this happen?\n  One of the reasons is that public depots can hide their overhead in \nother accounts when they bid against private industry for work, and \nmembers of private industry on numerous occasions have said this is \nexactly why they cannot compete under current law.\n  Warner Robins, as I understand it, took advantage of this ability to \nhide overhead costs to help make their bid below that of their private \ncompetitors. In fact, the Air Force had to add approximately $170 \nmillion to Warner Robins' bid for the 500 employees and other overhead \nthat had been shifted to other accounts.\n  The way the next two competitions are set up, under this bill, \nprivate industry will be very reluctant to bid, and probably will not \nbid, on the workloads at McClellan and Kelly. In fact, the Sacramento \nBee quoted an industry representative who said, ``I can't conceive of a \ncompany that would bid for McClellan and Kelly under these \ncircumstances.''\n  Supporters of the depot language say this is a compromise that will \nallow fair and open competitions at McClellan and Kelly. I say baloney. \nHow can I or my colleagues from California and Texas believe that these \ncompetitions will be fair and open when one of the authors of this very \nlanguage, a Senator from Oklahoma, believes that this language shuts \nthe door on private industry's ability to compete. Quoted in the Daily \nOklahoman he said, ``I think it's highly unlikely any contractor would \nwant to bid on it.'' Now, how are my colleagues and I supposed to \nbelieve it is a fair compromise with statements like this? We need fair \nand open competition for the depot work at McClellan and Kelly. As \nSecretary Cohen has stated repeatedly, this language just does not \nprovide it.\n  We need to allow public-private competitions in order to achieve the \nkinds of savings necessary to reach the procurement levels needed to \nfund the modernization of our weapons systems.\n  Madam President, I have much more to say, but in the interest of time \nlet me say this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 7 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We have tried to achieve a compromise. We are open to \na compromise.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield 1 additional minute to the \ndistinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  We are open to a compromise. We are willing today to accept the very \nlanguage that we thought we had agreed upon, which gave us the two and \na half issues out of the four which would enable us to have public-\nprivate competition at these bases. In order for this to occur, we must \nreturn to the earlier compromise language, before the changes were \nmade.\n  Madam President, I cannot tell you what a big deal this is in \nNorthern California. The entire community has been mobilized around \nthis concept of possibly being able to privatize the workload. All we \nare asking for is fairness. All we are asking is that the deck not be \nstacked against us. All we are asking is that public depots not have \nthe opportunity to fudge bids by hiding costs. This conference report \ndenies that, and we have decided that we will use every avenue open to \nus to fight\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\nthis bill until we either achieve a compromise or a veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I sat and listened to the senior Senator from Texas as I did some \nweeks, if not months, ago when he made similar speeches, and I want to \nrespond to some of the comments he made.\n  He said that his primary interest in life is preserving competition. \nI want competition, too. He said he wants fair competition. I want fair \ncompetition, too. I remember in his previous speech he said he was so \nconcerned about fair competition that he would be willing to write the \nlaw in such a way as to outline the requirements to make sure there was \nfair competition and then allow the depots a 10-percent cushion. He \nsaid, if they came within 10 percent of the private sector, they would \nbe given the opportunity to hold the work.\n  We believe the language in this bill fulfills the requirement that he \nlaid out on this floor at that time, that it does outline fair \ncompetition. He says many people think of depots as an entitlement, and \nhe says, ``I reject that.''\n  I agree with him 100 percent. Depots, or any defense facility, are \nnot an entitlement, whether it is in California or Texas or Utah or \nArizona. However, there is the question of the core capability of the \nDepartment of Defense in establishments that they have created over \ntime. It is an established rule that core work is to be done in \nGovernment-owned facilities.\n  What is core work? It is the work that has to be done in case we go \nto war, in case we are in the circumstance where a private contractor \nsays, ``I don't want to interrupt my commercial business to do this \nmilitary business just because there is a war going on.'' There is core \nwork that must be done.\n  Prior to the adoption of the language that is in this bill, the \ndefinition of what is core work and what is not was left entirely to \nthe Secretary of Defense. That means if the Secretary of Defense wants \nto rule something as not core work and thereby rig the competition for \npolitical purposes, he has the right to do it.\n  One of the things that appeals to me most about this language is that \nit puts sunshine on the process of determining what is core and what is \nnot and requires the Secretary of Defense to report to whom? To the \nCongress, to the people who are appropriating the money, as to what is \ncore and what is not.\n  What can be wrong with that? The Senator from Texas wants \ncompetition. So do I. I think we have responded to the Senator's call \nfor competition, and we have crafted language that produces that.\n  Madam President, I have a document with responses to a floor \nstatement that was made earlier by the senior Senator from Texas. This \nbriefly addresses some of his primary objections, many of which have \nbeen repeated here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary of those 11 statements, plus \nthe responses to them, be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now, Madam President, I have spent 5 years in the \nSenate. I have spent 40 years in the business community. I am a \nbusinessman who has run businesses. I would like to speak, in the \nremaining time, out of that experience rather than the political \nexperience.\n  What we are dealing with here from a business standpoint is a factory \nthat is at overcapacity. The question is, How do we as competent \nmanagers deal with that excess capacity? Do we have competition? Of \ncourse, we do. If we have items that can be taken out of the factory \nand built more cheaply someplace else, we want them out of the factory \nand built more cheaply someplace else. But if we have the capital \ninvestment in the factory itself and we have excess capacity, we would \nnot be wise stewards, we would not be intelligent businesspeople if we \ndid not go out and look for things to be built in the factory to soak \nup that excess capacity as our first responsibility to the \nshareholders.\n\n  We here in the Senate are responding not to shareholders but to \ntaxpayers. We are responding to military people who are depending upon \nthese facilities to provide the necessary skills in time of war, and we \nare facing a circumstance where we have excess capacity.\n  I am as dedicated as anybody else to the idea that we need to move \nahead with competition and save taxpayers' money. But to ignore the \nquestion of our existing capacity and overcapacity in the name of a \ntheoretical argument in favor of competition, which sounds good in the \nclassroom, is to be irresponsible.\n  One final comment, Madam President, and then I will yield back the \nremainder of my time. The Senator from Texas has said on this occasion \nand repeatedly that this for him is not a parochial issue, that it is a \nmatter of principle and that he is standing on this principle even if a \nbase in Texas were not involved. I will accept that. I will respect \nthat. I want to make it equally clear, however, Madam President, that \nthere are those of us on the other side of the argument who feel just \nas strongly that we are standing for a principle where the principle is \nintegrity in the contracting process in the Department of Defense, \nwhich integrity we feel has been attacked.\n  I was asked, on the record, would you still be fighting this fight if \nHill Air Force Base were not involved, and would you stand to protect \nHill Air Force jobs if it cost the taxpayers extra money? I said to the \nreporter in the hometown where Hill Air Force Base is located, if we \ncannot demonstrate that the Air Force is better off financially by \nhaving the work done at Hill Air Force Base, I cannot as a Senator say \nthe work should still be done at Hill Air Force Base at a higher price.\n  I believe the position we are taking is sound management practice, \nsound business practice. It is what I would do if I were a businessman \ncharged with the responsibility of running this factory that is at \novercapacity, and I believe that we have just as solid reasoning to \nstand on principle as the Senator from Texas believes he has.\n  I hope everyone will recognize that it is not appropriate to attack \nanybody else's motives. Now, if he attacks the motives of the folks in \nthe House, that is fair game. I will let him do it with the people in \nthe House; that is kind of the way we do it here. But I wanted to make \nmy statement with respect to where we are in the Senate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Competition--Statements of Senator Phil Gramm\n\n       1. ``What the Department of Defense wants to do is have a \n     competitive bidding between the three depots in the Air Force \n     that are doing maintenance work and private contractors.'' \n     (The bill specifically authorizes such competitions and \n     requires that the Department allow all qualified bidders and \n     teams to participate.)\n       2. ``Now, what Senator Hutchison and I want is simply to \n     allow private contractors in our State or anywhere else to \n     have the right to compete for this work and, if they can do \n     it better, if they can do it cheaper, they would have an \n     opportunity to do it.'' (The bill specifically authorizes \n     such competitions and requires that the Department allow all \n     qualified bidders and teams to participate.)\n       3. ``Why should we not have price competition.'' (We \n     should, and this bill makes that happen. The compromise \n     language requires that the Department has to take into \n     account the total direct and indirect costs when comparing \n     the offers.)\n       4. ``If Republicans believe in anything, it is \n     competition.'' (The bill reflects this belief, and \n     specifically authorizes such competitions and requires that \n     the Department allow all qualified bidders and teams to \n     participate on an even playing field.)\n       5. ``Obviously, if you wanted to be reasonable on this \n     issue, you would simply say to the Defense Department, look, \n     here are a set of criteria for looking at a fair competition \n     with a level playing surface.'' (The bill does this. It \n     authorizes competitions and establishes a few of the criteria \n     that must be considered in evaluating the various proposals. \n     The Department of Defense would retain the flexibility to \n     establish any additional criteria that the Department \n     believes would ensure a level playing surface.)\n       6. ``But we could set out simple criteria for a level \n     playing surface to have competition between the public sector \n     and the private\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\n     sector to do this work.'' (Again, this bill does this. It \n     establishes a few of the criteria that must be considered in \n     evaluating the various proposals. For example, it states \n     private and public bidders can team. This is good for \n     competition. The Department of Defense would retain the \n     flexibility to establish any additional criteria that the \n     Department believes would ensure a level playing surface.)\n       7. ``Have competitive bidding after you first set out the \n     criteria for competitive bidding. If you want to look at the \n     cost of facilities they are using, to make adjustments for \n     it, then look at everything--look at retirement costs, look \n     at every single cost, come up with a way of measuring it, and \n     have a competition. And then, even if the depots lose the \n     competition by less than 10 percent, give it to them \n     anyway.'' (The criteria specifically includes the cost of \n     facilities (land, plant, and equipment) from a military \n     installation that are proposed to be used by a private \n     offeror. The Department would retain the flexibility to \n     include the cost of facilities that are proposed to be used \n     by a public depot if they can justify their decision. The \n     criteria also include the total estimated direct and indirect \n     costs (including retirement costs) and the total estimated \n     direct and indirect savings to the Department of Defense. The \n     only thing the language does not do is give the public depots \n     a 10-percent price preferential, as was proposed by the \n     Senator from Texas.\n       8. ``But what I want the workers there to have a chance to \n     do is to go to work for private companies that might have a \n     chance to compete for the work. So I am not asking for \n     anybody to give anything to San Antonio, TX. But I am \n     demanding that we have an opportunity to compete.'' (The \n     compromise language gives them this opportunity.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Utah has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I want to yield to my colleague from \nCalifornia, but I want to make two points that I think will be telling.\n  I would like people to note that in trying to find a compromise, I \nmade an extraordinary offer which the Senator alluded to, and that is I \nsaid, look, don't have a fair competition between the private sector \nand the depots. Have a competition that says if the depots can do it at \nonly 10 percent more than the private sector, then give them the work \nand let the taxpayer pay 10 percent more for the same work. But if \nthey, if the private sector, can do it with savings of at least 10 \npercent, then let them have it.\n  I would just note to my colleagues that was an offer on my part to \nhave less than a flat playing surface, and that offer was rejected.\n  Second, I would just go back to the newspaper article reporting on \nthe amendment and those who had crafted the language of the bill \nsaying, ``The requirements put on contractors''--that is private \ncontractors--``in the new language would likely keep them from wanting \nto bid on the work.''\n  Well, if the language keeps them from wanting to bid, how do you have \ncompetition? It seems to me that those two points show we were not even \ninsisting on any kind of level playing surface. And second, they say of \ntheir own provision that it will prevent private contractors from \nwanting to bid. How do you have competition if there are no bidders?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Gramm for yielding me \nthis time. I thank Senator Hutchison for her being so kind to me to \nallow me to precede her in these remarks. I will not go over my 5 \nminutes because I know she has much to offer and has been struggling \nwith this issue for quite a while.\n  I wonder if the public is confused about what this debate is all \nabout. They see colleagues across party aisles, from Texas and \nCalifornia, joining hands--we don't often do this on many issues--and \ncomplaining that, in fact, a compromise that was supposed to occur in \nthe committee to work out the problems we all had with this depot \nlanguage was abandoned. Had that language been held to, had we been \nable to work it out, we would all be here without holding up this bill.\n  I really think what is at stake is very important not just to those \nworkers at McClellan, 2,000 strong--it impacts 2,000 families--4,000 \nworkers at Kelly, at least that many and their families, but also, as \nSenator Gramm has pointed out, to taxpayers throughout the Nation.\n  But the fact is, either you are for competition and the best deal for \ntaxpayers or you are not. We are for competition. We are for allowing \nthe private sector to come in with a fair and level playing field. The \nlanguage in the bill which we now oppose would thwart competition.\n  In the Senate, we managed to keep all harmful language off the bill, \nbut the House had very restrictive language. We hoped going into the \nconference there could be a compromise.\n  What you are going to hear from some of the folks who don't want \ncompetition from the private sector is that this group of us from Texas \nand California want to undo the BRAC, want to undo the Base Closure \nCommission and their recommendations vis-a-vis Kelly and McClellan. \nThis is false.\n  If you turn to page I-85 of the BRAC report, you will find that right \nthere it says the DOD is instructed to ``consolidate the remaining \nworkloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial \nactivities.''\n  So very clearly the BRAC said the DOD should have the flexibility to \nwork with the private sector, and the administration very much wants to \ndo this. The Department of Defense very much wants to do this.\n  We already heard from Senator Gramm that the President will veto this \nbill if we do not move forward toward a compromise. I don't think the \nSenators from California and Texas want a veto. We could stop talking \nat this very moment and go into one of the cloakrooms and work this \nmatter out. We think we almost did work this matter out, but overnight, \nsomething changed in the language. We are unable to look our \nconstituents in the eye and look the taxpayers in the eye and say they \nare going to get a fair deal, because they are not.\n  That is really all we want on behalf of our constituency: a fair \nchance to compete, to do the work at a lower cost. You wouldn't think \nwe would have to struggle over such a commonsense proposition.\n  I really have to say that the passage of this bill has been \njeopardized. The adoption of this conference report is jeopardized, and \nthere is no reason for it. We were so close. We ought to go back again.\n  What happened in the end, to use an analogy, was like a footrace in \nwhich the committee basically said, ``Line up all the private sector \npeople who want to be involved in depot work; line up all the public \ndepots in Utah, in Oklahoma, in Georgia, and everyone will sprint as \nfast as they can for 100 yards. The first person to cross the finish \nline wins.''\n  Unfortunately, the committee put 100-pound weights on those from \nKelly and McClellan, so they can't win a race or even compete in a race \nif they are so burdened. That is what this conference committee has \ndone.\n  I say in the name of fairness, to those working families at Kelly and \nMcClellan, I say in the name of fairness to taxpayers who want to see \nus move forward and save as many tax dollars as we can, and in the name \nof a strong national defense where the Defense Department has the \nflexibility it needs in this case and many others to move to the best \nway to meet our national defense needs, in the name of all of them, I \nsuggest that we go back to compromise mode. We can resolve this problem \nand move this bill forward.\n  That is the spirit in which I speak to the U.S. Senate today. I do \nwant to say this. I am as determined as my colleagues from Texas and my \nsenior Senator, Senator Feinstein, to do everything in my power to make \nsure--to make sure--that the commitments made to the people at Kelly \nand McClellan and to the taxpayers are, in fact, kept. We will use \nevery parliamentary tool at our disposal to make sure that fairness and \njustice will win out in this debate. Thank you, very much. I yield back \nmy time to Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I certainly understand the position of \nthe Senators from Texas and California. They have worked long and hard \non this issue. I understand where they are coming from. I congratulate \nthe\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, and others, who have worked just \nas hard to make sure this is a fair bill. The bill is consistent with \nthe targets of the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  On the major issues such as Bosnia, the B-2 bomber, and cooperative \nthreat reduction, the bill is much closer to the Senate position than \nthe House position. The most difficult issue to resolve in the \nconference was the depot maintenance provision. These provisions are \nthe product of intense communication, diligent coordination and \ndiplomatic negotiations of the issues to the fullest extent possible. \nWe have actually been working on these issues some 9 months. We made \nnumerous significant concessions in order to reach an agreement.\n  In the final analysis, the major concessions were:\n  We agreed to the Department of Defense request to continue free and \nopen public-private competitions for the workloads at Kelly Air Force \nBase, TX, and McClellan Air Force Base, CA, with public-private \npartnerships.\n  We agreed to the Department of Defense request to lower the 60-40 \nrule to 50-50.\n  We agreed to the Department of Defense request to solicit a single \ncontract for multiple workloads having been certified by the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  And we agreed that it is critical to maintain a core capability at \nthe public facilities with a surge capacity that supports our \nmobilization needs at a moment's notice.\n  In spite of all the concessions made in this agreement, the \nopposition believes this should be an all-or-nothing deal. To do so, I \nthink, would truly negate the rules of fairness and the competitive \nmarket, and it undermines the credibility of DOD's stated financial \npriorities. It also risks the future of legitimate privatization \nefforts by the Department of Defense.\n  I am satisfied with the depot provision in the conference report. The \nDepartment of Defense is satisfied with the provision. And the \nprovision has the unanimous support of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on which I serve.\n  The provision does not include everything that either side really \nwanted, but it is undoubtedly a fair and unbiased bill that places \nbidders on an equal footing.\n  I find it hard to argue against fairness. So, Madam President, I \nsuggest this body finally act on the defense authorization bill, and it \nhas my support. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 5 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I thank all of the \nSenators who are trying to do what is right in this bill. I hope very \nmuch that we will be able to come to an agreement that will allow free \nand fair competition.\n  We are not asking for something special. We are not asking for an \nadvantage. In fact, we have gone so far beyond where BRAC, the Base \nClosing Commission, was that I think we have gone overboard to allow \nthe public depots to even compete, because the Base Closing Commission \nreport in 1995 states specifically, and I am reading from the report:\n\n       Therefore, the Commission recommends the following: Realign \n     Kelly Air Force Base, including the Air Logistics \n     Center, consolidate the workloads to other Department of \n     Defense depots or to private sector commercial activities \n     as is determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.\n\n  ``As determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.'' By the \nlaw that this Congress passed in adopting the Base Closing Commission \nreport in full, the Department of Defense has total discretion about \nwhether to move the depot maintenance from Kelly and McClellan or \nwhether to privatize it in place. The concept of competition came \nforward in the intervening years, and we all believe that is fair. Why \nshouldn't the public depots be able to compete? We think that is best \nfor the taxpayers.\n  So, of course, there we were trying to get a fair and level playing \nfield so that the public depots could compete, so that there could be \nprivate competition in the depots that were closed, and that is what is \nright for this country. It is what is right for the Department of \nDefense, and it is what the Department of Defense wants. So we have \nadded a huge measure of support for the public depots to be able to \ncompete.\n  In the last 2 years, I have heard Member after Member who represents \na depot State saying, ``There can't be fair competition between the \npublic sector and the private sector.'' In fact, the first competition \nthat was held for part of the work that is now being done at Kelly went \nout for competition and, in fact, the bid was awarded to a public depot \nin Georgia. In fact, the Department of Defense personnel say that they \ndon't think there was a level playing field in that bid. But \nnevertheless, the bid was won.\n  Did the people of San Antonio stand up and whine about not getting \nthe bid? No, they didn't. Even though they were told it wasn't fair, \neven though they were told that their bid was better, they did not \nwhine about it because they believe that if they have a fair chance, \nthey will be able to compete the next time.\n  Now we have a bill before us that does not allow them to compete on a \nlevel playing field once again. At some point, there has to be \nintegrity in the process. At some point, the people of San Antonio or \nthe people of Sacramento must know that there is a fairness because the \nBase Closing Commission recommended that the Department of Defense be \ngiven the option of privatizing in place or going to a public depot. \nThey have competed fair and square, and they have been beaten. They \nhave been beaten. So you can have a fair competition. It has been \nshown.\n  Who was the winner in the C-5 competition? It was the taxpayers of \nAmerica, because there was competition. The taxpayers of America and \nthe men and women in our military gained $190 million because that is \nthe efficiency that would be gained because there was competition.\n  If you take the other competitions that are left to go during the \nyears, think of the hundreds of millions of dollars that will be \navailable for a better quality of life for our men and women in the \nservices, for the equipment and the technology that would protect them \nwhen they are in the field, and that would make our security of our \nshores intact. Those hundreds of millions will go for our national \nsecurity rather than on wasted depot space.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask Senator Gramm for half a minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the Senator a full minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Just to end my remarks, if you want to have the \nargument on fairness, I will just quote from the junior Senator from \nOklahoma who says in the newspaper that the requirements that are in \nthis bill put on contractors new language which would likely keep them \nfrom wanting to bid for the work. He says contractors will have to \ninclude in their bids millions of dollars in costs that weren't \npreviously required. ``I think it's highly unlikely any contractor \nwould want to bid on it,'' he said.\n  Madam President, that is prima facie evidence that they are not \nlooking for a level playing field. If they will sit down and work with \nus, we will provide the level playing field, the winners will be the \ntaxpayers of America, the winners will be the Department of Defense, \nthe winners will be our men and women in the military, and the winners \nwill be the secure Americans who will have the hundreds of millions of \ndollars that competition will give us in national security rather than \nin Government waste. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Madam President. I ask how much time do we \nhave remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 22 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Utah, Senator \nHatch.\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have been very interested in this \ndebate because we went through three BRAC processes and, now, all of a \nsudden, we find it turned upside down.\n  Let me respond to the Senators from Texas, especially Senator Gramm. \nI have always appreciated his dogged defense of competition. Generally, \nI am right there with him. That is why I truly regret that I must \ndiffer with him on his interpretation that the conference report is, in \nhis words, anticompetitive.\n  There is fair competition and there is unfair competition. The \nconference report proposes fair competition.\n  Let us look at how the conference report differs from the \nprivatization-in-place language initially proposed by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  First, the conference report requires that all the costs of operation \nbe factored into the bids.\n  What honesty is there in a bid that excludes certain costs? Well, you \ngot that right--none. Privatization in place, as originally proposed, \nwould have permitted certain contractors from excluding the costs of \nthe facilities themselves in Texas and in California. Naturally, these \ncontractors would be able to submit artificially low bids. This would \nbe an unfair disadvantage to the successful depots, which had already \njustified their existence through three separate BRAC processes, \nbecause excess capacity will inflate their hourly costs.\n  Second, the Base Closing and Realignment Commission, the BRAC, \nrecommended the closure of Kelly and McClellan and that the work be \ndistributed to the three remaining depots.\n  Instead of consolidating work as BRAC recommended, privatization in \nplace merely masks greater inefficiency. Privatization in place may \nsound like competition, but it is not fair competition.\n  And it is not very prudent. Let me ask my colleagues: How is it a \ncost saving if private companies are able to take over the work of \nKelly and McClellan under contract to the Government? I realize that \nthis is something of a sleight of hand, so let me review the concept.\n  If you have a subsidiary plant that is not working to capacity, the \nnormal business decision would be to close it down and redistribute the \nwork to the other more efficient plants, which was what BRAC was all \nabout. But under the original Clinton plan, the work would simply be \nbid out to others. There is no closure of the facility, and you are \npaying others for the work. And, you have to ask, what in the world is \ngoing on here?\n  The conference report language is a compromise. Those of us referred \nto by the Senators from Texas and California as the depot caucus are \nnot getting what we wanted--which was the validation of the BRAC \nprocess, whatever that may bring.\n  I know that I went to every one of those meetings. It was a pressure-\npacked, difficult time. All of us were concerned.\n  Frankly, the BRAC Commission did make the tough decisions in \ndetermining which ones should survive, which ones should not. But for \nthe other three to do their job, they must have this work in fair \ncompetition. I have every confidence that Utahns can compete with \nanyone in a fair competition.\n  At least by leveling the playing field for bidding on depot work, \neveryone has a fair chance. May the best bidders win. And let us keep \nintegrity in the process. What the Senators on the other side seem to \nbe arguing for is a system that really stacks the deck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nOklahoma have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like to reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am going to reserve the remainder of my time. The \nSenator from Texas can use his minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. If there is a quorum \ncall at this point, how is that time counted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call would be charged against \nwhichever side put in the request.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, Mr. President, I will be happy to go ahead and take \nmy minute. The normal procedure would be both sides would run off their \ntime equally. I think we are the challenger here and should go last, \nbut that is not of any real significance.\n  I think, Mr. President, I can sum up what this is about very simply. \nWe have 30 pages in this bill that were written with one and only one \npurpose, and that purpose was to derail price competition, to prevent \nprice competition with the depots.\n  The people who wrote the provision are quoted publicly as saying that \nthat was the objective. They say in the newspaper that it would be \nvirtually impossible for a private firm to compete with a Government \ndepot under their language. That is not me talking, that is not the \nSenator from California talking. That is the proponents of this \nlanguage and the people who help write the language.\n  Second, it has to strike you as funny that this language only applies \nto competition that would involve private companies who would choose to \nlocate either at Kelly or at McClellan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have 30 pages that are limited simply to that. So I \nhope nobody is deceived. And I am sure they are not.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just real quickly cover some of the \nthings that have been said in the last 10 or 15 minutes.\n  First of all, I do not like the way this ended up because we had to \nagree, in order to bring everyone in and to have a unanimous vote in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, to allow the President of the \nUnited States to interfere and to politicize the BRAC process for the \nfirst time since it went in place in the round of 1989.\n  Second, a quote has been attributed to me that I do not think that \nthe private sector is going to want to bid on this. I think that is \naccurate, because the private sector would have liked very much to bid \nif they could get free--for maybe a dollar a year--a huge facility down \nin Texas or one in California. Sure, that would be certainly to their \nadvantage, but the taxpayers would lose.\n  All we are saying is: If you want to have free and open competition, \nlet us take all costs, direct and indirect costs, to the Department of \nDefense and throw them in there.\n  Two big costs: No. 1, the cost of the installation that would be used \nif privatization in place took place; and, No. 2, the cost of the \nexcess capacity in the remaining three air logistics centers, which the \nGAO said would be about $468 million a year.\n  Third, in terms of charges that have been made about competition, no \none in this Chamber is going to be able to stand any higher than I do \non my background in privatization. When I was mayor of Tulsa, I \nprivatized everything that wouldn't move.\n  This is different. This is our Nation's defense. However, this bill \nprovides for privatization. It just says that we are going to have to \ntake all costs into consideration.\n  Fourth, there is one other area in the bill. It is called \n``teaming.'' Right now under the current law, if this should be \ndefeated, the private sector would not be able to go to the air \nlogistics center in Georgia or anyplace else and compete because they \nare precluded from doing so. This defense authorization bill provides \nfor much greater opportunity for the private sector to compete.\n  The issue that the junior Senator from California brought up on \nprivatization in place--she was not in here when I covered the details \nin that. The BRAC recommendations specifically precluded privatization \nin place for the air logistics centers. She quoted words out of the \nBRAC language, but she neglected to read the last sentence, which I \nwill read to you: ``Move the required\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\nequipment and any required personnel to the receiving locations.''\n  Mr. President, you, of course, are a businessman. We have already \nheard your pitch. I agree with everything that you said. But the cost \nof keeping three air logistics centers at 50 percent capacity is a huge \ncost and has to be considered in the consideration of this.\n  I came to the House of Representatives in 1987. That was my first \nyear. One of the persons I had the most respect for was a Congressman \nby the name of Dick Armey. And Dick Armey, for the first time, \nconvinced me that we have a real serious problem with excess capacity. \nWe have never been able to do away with it because of the political \ninterference of the local Congressman, of the Senators, and sometimes \nof the President.\n  So he set up a system called the BRAC process. This process was to be \nfree of any political interference--any political interference. He \nsaid, ``Someday I'm going to regret this because I'm going to have to \ngo against my own State when we have to close down some type of \ninstallation.''\n  But you know, Mr. President, it worked. We went through, not three, \nas the senior Senator from Texas suggested, but we went through four \nBRAC rounds--1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995. During these BRAC rounds, we \nclosed over 100 major installations.\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, that we would not have been able to \nclose one of them if it had not been for Dick Armey from Texas, the \nCongressman who established the whole BRAC process. So while we talk \nabout not having parochial interests, I can assure you that I do not. \nIn fact, I am on record in the State of Oklahoma, in 1994, in my \nelection to the Senate, the first time I was elected, they used it \nagainst me, because I said, ``I will not use political interference and \nwill not try to politicize the system.'' That was used against me.\n  So Congressman Armey prevailed. As a result of that, we have been \nable to close a lot of excess capacity. The other day he made a speech \non the floor. Mr. President, I do not have the time--I was going to \nread the entire speech, but there isn't time remaining to do that. But \nI will just read one paragraph out of it. This is Congressman Dick \nArmey from the State of Texas:\n\n       We had three rounds in base closing, and we are all very \n     proud of the process because politics never intruded into the \n     process. That ended in round four. And all of my colleagues \n     knew at the time, and we know now, that the special \n     conditions for McClellan and Kelly, California and my own \n     State of Texas, where you might think I have a parochial \n     interest, were in a political intervention.\n       We talk about this being privatization. No, it is not. It \n     is a new concept. It is privatization in place, created \n     specifically for these two bases in an election year for no \n     purpose other than politics.\n\n  That is a quote from Texas Congressman Dick Armey, the founder of \nthis system.\n  Finally, Mr. President, they keep talking about, ``We had a deal.'' \nThere was never any deal that was had. We have been negotiating this \nthing now for well over a year. And we negotiated it in years prior to \nthis. We are trying now to get a defense authorization bill. We have \ncaved in. We have provided for privatization in place so long as we \ntake all costs into consideration.\n\n  When it has been stated several times by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Texas that only a small number or group of people are \nconcerned about this, I suggest to you that this bill that we are \ntalking about, this conference report was passed out of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee by a vote of 18 to zero--18 to zero.\n  A couple of nights ago--last night I guess it was--it was voted on in \nthe House of Representatives. The vote was 286 to 123. I suggest to the \nsenior Senator from California, if she is convinced that the President \nis going to veto this, we have the votes to override a veto. We are not \ngoing to allow the President to say, ``I'm vetoing a bill because I \nwant to politicize the system for the first time since its inception in \n1988.''\n  So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that we have an opportunity \nhere to have a defense authorization bill that does far more than \ncorrect a problem that has been there in the depots. It takes care of \nmany, many needs to try to keep America strong. I agree with the \nSenator from Texas when he talks about the fact that our defense has \nbeen decimated. It has been decimated. We are going to try to do \nsomething about saving, in this case with this change in the air \nlogistics centers, some $468 million a year.\n  Mr. President, there are two individuals who are here who have not \nbeen heard from. I ask unanimous consent that both the chairman and the \nranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee be \nallowed to speak for 1 minute each.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, of course, I will not object. I would like \nto suggest that they have an opportunity to speak for more than 1 \nminute. I amend the request to ask unanimous consent that each of them \nbe given 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the underlying request \nas amended?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The chairman and the ranking \nmember are each permitted now to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will not take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to take a few moments to address the \noutcome of what was the single most controversial issue in the \nconference--depot maintenance. The bill contains a fair compromise that \nwas drafted by the members and staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee after consulting with all interested parties, including the \nadministration and the concerned delegations. It is fair to assert that \nnone of the parties involved are completely happy with this compromise \nlanguage; however, that is what happens when you have to compromise. If \nwe all insisted on getting everything our way, nothing would ever be \naccomplished by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin, the ranking member of our committee, \nand I worked together in a totally bipartisan manner to achieve this \ncompromise and we both agree that this compromise enables the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct fair and open competitions for the \nworkloads currently performed at Kelly and McClellan. In fact, the \ncompromise language specifically authorizes competitions for these \nworkloads.\n  Mr. President, during the drafting of this compromise language the \nDepartment of Defense, as well as the staff of the concerned \ndelegations, were provided numerous opportunities to review this \nlanguage and identify their concerns. We made significant changes to \nthis language in order to alleviate many of the concerns they raised.\n  Mr. President, no one knows the amount of work that was put into this \ncompromise. We worked night and day. The staffs worked night and day. \nIf this compromise doesn't go through, all of those States will suffer, \nin my opinion. It is better for us to pass this bill. This is a very \nimportant bill. It means a lot to our whole Nation, not just any one \nState or a few States, but all of the States.\n  I ask the Senate to pass this compromise and stand by what has been \ndone and reached heretofore on this important matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we will move to this conference \nreport. This conference report contains hundreds of legislative \nprovisions, thousands of funding provisions which had to be resolved. \nThe issue that took us the longest to resolve was the difference about \ndepot maintenance work at the closed air logistic centers at Kelly and \nMcClellan. Probably the last month was taken up trying to resolve that \nissue. No agreement was ever reached.\n  So we, the members of the committee, had to do the best that we could \nto try to reach a fair and a just conclusion that would not tilt this \ntoward either direction. That is what we attempted to do.\n  Otherwise, we would give up on getting a defense authorization bill \nto the floor and we were not willing to give up that. There are too \nmany issues at stake in this bill that are important to this country \nnot to bring this bill to the floor and not to bring the conference \nreport to the floor.\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\n  We know there are very strong feelings on both sides of the depot \nissue, and it is understandable. To ever denigrate the strength of any \nMembers' feeling about regulating the interests of their State--I think \nall of us have to accept that feelings are very strong on this issue. \nRepresentatives of some States felt that the President had ignored the \nspirit of the base closure process by pursuing a policy of \nprivatization in place at Kelly and McClellan. Others felt equally \nstrongly that the work should remain at the closed depots.\n  I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion of the \ndepot caucus that the Base Closure Commission prohibited privatization \nin place at Kelly and McClellan. The 1995 Base Closure Commission left \nit up to the Department of Defense to decide how to distribute the \nKelly and McClellan work. The Commission's recommendation directed the \nDepartment of Defense to ``Consolidate the workloads to other DOD \ndepots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the \nDefense Depot Maintenance Council.'' That ``or'' is a critical ``or'' \nin the BRAC report.\n  I also disagreed with the legislation proposed in the depot caucus \nand included in the House bill which would have prohibited the \ndepartment from privatizing in place until the three remaining Air \nForce depots were operating at 80 percent of capacity--in effect, \nprohibiting the Air Force from keeping any of the work at California or \nTexas. I voted against that proposal in our committee and I voted \nagainst it in conference because it was one-sided and unfair. Had that \nprovision been included in this bill, I would have strongly opposed the \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, that provision is not in the conference report. But \nwhat we have instead are provisions aimed at providing a level playing \nfield for competition between the closed depots and the depots that \nremain open. I have always believed that competition results in the \nbest value to the Department of Defense and to the taxpayers, and I \nbelieve that is the right answer to the depot dispute.\n  The conference language includes seven specific criteria to help \nensure that the Air Force does not unfairly tilt the playing field.\n  I ask unanimous consent a brief summary of these seven criteria for a \nfair competition be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. These requirements were written by Members and staff who \nare neutral in the fight between the closed bases and the remaining air \nlogistic centers. Our sole objective was to ensure a fair competition, \nand each of these requirements was included for that purpose.\n  We had complaints from both sides of the issue from the Congress, \nfrom the administration, about every single proposal that was put on \nthe table. It went on for months. But the bottom line is that sooner or \nlater those of us who were not involved in this struggle had to reach a \nconclusion as to what would be a fair and just competition. We believe \nwe achieved that, and that the Defense Department can make it work to \nachieve a fair and open competition.\n  I say that after many consultations between my staff and myself and \nthe Defense Department. I support this compromise because I believe it \nwill lead to a fair and open competition that is the only answer to \nthis dispute. Keeping this dispute going and going and going is not \ngoing to resolve this dispute. We learned that from months of fruitless \neffort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Key Elements of the Fair Competition Provision\n\n       Section 359 of the bill requires the use of competitive \n     procedures in contracting for performance of depot-level \n     maintenance and repair workloads formerly performed at closed \n     or realigned military installations. This provision includes \n     a number of requirements and conditions to ensure that any \n     such competition is conducted on a level playing field.\n       First, the source selection process must permit both public \n     and private offerors to submit bids. It goes without saying \n     that these bids must be considered on the merits by the \n     source selection authority.\n       Second, the source selection process must take into account \n     the fair market value (or book value) of any land, plant, or \n     equipment at a closed or realigned military installation that \n     is proposed to be used by the private offeror in the \n     performance of the workload. This provision is intended to \n     ensure that closed military installations are not given an \n     unfair competitive advantage as a result of facilities \n     provided to them free of charge by the federal government \n     (under the base closure laws, we generally give closed \n     facilities to the local communities without charge). Although \n     this provision does not address the value of facilities \n     available to the depots that remain open (or other private \n     sector facilities), it does not preclude the Department from \n     giving appropriate consideration to the value of those \n     facilities as well.\n       Third, the source selection process must take into account \n     the total direct and indirect costs that will be incurred by \n     the Department of Defense and the total direct and indirect \n     savings that will be derived by the Department of Defense. \n     Such savings would include overhead savings that might result \n     from the consolidation of workloads to the remaining public \n     depot activities. The Department of Defense and the Air Force \n     should establish the ground rules for evaluating these \n     savings and for considering any other indirect costs or \n     savings that may be associated with performance of the work \n     by various offerors as a part of the competition plan and \n     procedures required by this section.\n       Fourth, the cost standards used to determine the \n     depreciation of facilities and equipment shall provide \n     identical treatment, to the maximum extent practicable, to \n     all public and private offerors. Such standards shall, at a \n     minimum, include identical depreciation periods for public \n     and private offerors. The qualification ``to the maximum \n     extent practicable'' was added at the request of the \n     Department of Defense, which argued that the evaluation of \n     depreciation requires the application of an extremely complex \n     set of rules which are necessarily different, in some cases, \n     for public and private entities. We anticipate that these \n     rules will be modified for the purposes of public-private \n     competitions under this provision to make them as close as \n     possible.\n       Fifth, the solicitation must permit any offeror, whether \n     public or private, to team with any other public or private \n     entity to perform the workload at one or more locations. It \n     is our expectation that such teaming will ensure the best \n     possible result for the Department and the taxpayers. While a \n     decision by the Air Force to prohibit any teaming arrangement \n     between an Air Logistics Center and a private sector entity \n     would be inconsistent with this provision, the Air Force \n     retains discretion to determine whether a particular teaming \n     proposal is in the best interest of the Department of Defense \n     and the taxpayers. We expect the Air Force to establish \n     substantive and procedural guidelines for the review and \n     approval of proposed teaming agreements as a part of the \n     competition plan and procedures required by this section.\n       Sixth, no offeror may be given any preferential \n     consideration for, or in any way be limited to, performing \n     the workload at the closed or realigned facility or at any \n     other specific location. This provision guarantees a level \n     playing field for public-private competition, without any \n     preference for either Kelly and McClellan or the depots that \n     remain open. The Department would be expected to consider \n     real differences among bidders in cost or performance risk \n     associated with relevant factors, including the proposed \n     location or locations of the workloads. The weight given to \n     such differences would not be considered ``preferential \n     treatment''.\n       Seventh, the provision would authorize the bundling of \n     unrelated workloads into one contract only if the Secretary \n     of Defense determines in writing that individual workloads \n     cannot as logically and economically be performed under \n     separate contracts. This provision permits the Secretary to \n     bundle workloads together only if he determines that such \n     bundling will result in the most favorable bids from public \n     and private sector offerors. We do not expect the Secretary \n     to bundle workloads together if the result would be to \n     substantially reduce competition or eliminate qualified \n     offerors who might otherwise be able to submit advantageous \n     offers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that there is some business that \nthe majority leader will take up in a few moments. When he desires the \nfloor I certainly will yield to him. But I wanted to take this moment \nto describe a couple of the things that I think we still need to do, \nunfinished items, before the Senate leaves following this first session \nof this Congress. Among those is the issue of campaign finance reform, \nwhich we have been debating back and forth here for some long while. \nThere is not any reason, in my judgment, that we cannot take up and at \nleast have a vote on the substance of campaign finance reform.\n  Second, it seems to me that we cannot leave town without having done \nsomething on a highway reauthorization bill. I know there are some who \nsay we brought a highway bill to the floor of the Senate and we had \nplenty of opportunity and now we had to pull it, but I want to make the \npoint the bill that was brought to the floor of the Senate was brought \nhere under procedures designed to block legislation, not pass \nlegislation. And we have a responsibility, whether it is a 6-month bill \nor a 6-year bill, we have a responsibility to address the issue of \nhighway construction and the highway reauthorization bill. So my hope \nis that through negotiation the leaders of the Democrats and the \nRepublicans here in the Senate can deal with both of these issues in a \nthoughtful way.\n  But I did want to make the point that we also are probably going to \ndeal with the issue called fast-track trade authority in the coming \nweek or so. To the extent we do that, I want Members of the Senate to \nunderstand this will not be an easy issue. There are a number of us \nhere in the Senate who feel very strongly about the issue of trade. It \nis not a circumstance where we believe that our country should put \nwalls around the country and prevent imports from coming in, or that we \nshould ignore the fact that we now live in a global economy or that we \nshould decide, somehow, that trade is not part of our economic well-\nbeing, it is unimportant--that is not the case at all. Trade is very \nimportant. It is a critically important component of this country's \nability to grow and to prosper. But the right kind of trade is \nimportant, not the wrong kind of trade.\n  The wrong kind of international trade in this country is trade that \nresults in ever-increasing, choking trade deficits, because those \ndeficits, now totaling nearly $2 trillion, trade deficits which in this \nlast year were the largest merchandise trade deficits in the history of \nthis country--in fact, that was true for the last 3 years and will be \ntrue at the end of this coming year--the largest merchandise trade \ndeficits in this country. To the extent that is the kind of trade we \nare involved in, trade that is not reciprocal, trade that is not two-\nway trade that is fair, trade that substantially increases our deficits \nand takes American jobs and moves them abroad and overseas--that is not \ntrade that is beneficial to our country. Many of us feel it is time for \nus to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about what is fair and \nwhat is unfair trade.\n  I have said many times that it is very difficult to have a discussion \nabout trade. A discussion about international trade quickly moves into \na thoughtless ranting by those who say there is only one credible view \non trade and that is the view of free trade. You are either for free \ntrade or you are\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\nsomebody who doesn't quite understand. You are an xenophobic \nisolationist who wants to build walls around America--you are either \nthat or you are a free trader. I happen to believe expanded trade, in \nthe form of fair trade, makes sense for this country, so I am someone \nwho believes that we benefit from reciprocal trade with other \ncountries, that trade with other countries can be mutually beneficial. \nBut I also believe it hurts our country when we have trade \ncircumstances that exist when we trade with another country and they \nship all their goods to our marketplace and then we discover what we \nproduce, our workers and our businesses, can't get our goods into their \nmarketplace. That is not fair, yet that goes on all across the world.\n  I notice today the President of China has arrived in our country. Our \ncountry welcomes him. We hope we will have a mutually productive \nrelationship with China. I am concerned about a number of things that I \nsee happening in China--yes, human rights. I was in China about a year \nago today, when a young man was sentenced to prison, I believe for 11 \nyears, for criticizing his government. So I think there are serious \nhuman rights questions in China. But also, in addition to the human \nrights issues in China, the Chinese leader comes to our country at a \ntime when they have, with us, a trade imbalance of nearly $40 to $50 \nbillion. Last year it was $40 billion and it is now heading to $50 \nbillion.\n  So we have a Chinese Government and a Chinese economy that ships \nmassive quantities of Chinese goods to our country. But when it comes \ntime to buy from our country, things which China needs--wheat, \nairplanes and more--they say, ``Well, we want to ship Chinese goods to \nyour country, but we want to look elsewhere for products; we want to go \nprice shopping for a week with Canada and with Venezuela.''\n  So while we used to be the major wheat supplier to China, we were \ndisplaced as the major wheat supplier even as they were running up huge \ntrade surpluses with us or us being in the position of having huge \ntrade deficits with them.\n  Airplanes. China has obviously the largest population on Earth, and \nthey need a lot of airplanes. They don't manufacture large airplanes. \nThey need to buy airplanes. So, since they ship so many of their \nproducts to our country for consumption, you expect they would come to \nus and buy our airplanes.\n  They come to our country and say, ``We need airplanes, but we'll buy \nyour airplanes if you manufacture the airplanes in China.'' That's not \nthe way trade works. That's not a mutually beneficial relationship, and \nthat's the thing that I think we ought to be talking to the Chinese \nleader about.\n  Yes, we ought to talk about a whole range of other issues--human \nrights, the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology and the transfer \nof missile technology to renegade and rogue nations. Yes, we ought to \ntalk to them about that. But we also ought to talk to them about this \nhuge growing trade deficit.\n  I hope very much that when President Clinton visits with President \nJiang Zemin, he will describe to him a trade relationship mutually \nbeneficial, and it is not one where one side has a huge imbalance, in \nthis case China, and in which case the United States has a huge and \ngrowing deficit, which means, in the final analysis, that jobs that \nexisted for Americans are now moving overseas. That is what is at the \nroot of this trade imbalance. Jobs that used to be U.S. jobs, jobs held \nby U.S. citizens, jobs to help maintain U.S. families are now jobs that \nare gone.\n  The same is true with Japan. I happen to be talking about China just \nbecause the Chinese leader is in town today. But Japan, we have a \ngrowing trade deficit with Japan. As far as the eye can see, it has \nbeen $50 billion, $60 billion a year. This year, it is expected to be \nup 20 or 25 percent, probably reaching a $60 billion, $65 billion trade \ndeficit with Japan once again this year.\n  Are there people walking around here saying this is an urgent \nproblem, this is trouble? No, they don't. They say, ``Gee, this is just \nfree trade. So what if we have a huge trade deficit.'' In fact, one \nperson wrote an article in the Washington Post recently and said those \nfolks who talk about the trade deficit being troublesome for our \ncountry don't understand it. He said, ``Think of it this way: If \nsomeone offered to sell you $10,000 worth of pears for $5,000 worth of \napples, you would jump at it.''\n  That is a simple and irrelevant example, one I suppose meant to \ninform those of us from other parts of the country who don't quite get \nit. Perhaps there is a way to study economics or perhaps there is a \nschool that teaches economics that will tell those people who think \nthat way and write that way that trade deficits represent an export of \npart of your wealth. Trade deficits will and must be repaid with a \nlower standard of living in this country's future. Trade deficits are \ntrouble for this country's economy.\n  People say to me, ``Well, if that's true, if trade deficits are \ntroublesome, why do we have an economy that seems so strong?'' You can \nhave an appearance of strength. You can live next to a neighbor that \nhas a brand new Cadillac in the driveway, a brand new home and all the \nnewest toys without understanding, of course, that it is all debt \nfinanced and that person is about 2 weeks away from serious financial \ntrouble.\n  So our trade deficit matters, and we must do something about it.\n  The point I make about fast track, which is the trade authority the \nPresident is going to seek, is this: We have massive trade problems, \nyes, with Japan, with China, yes, with Canada, with Mexico. And before \nwe run off and negotiate new trade agreements in secret, behind closed \ndoors, let's fix some of the trade problems that now exist.\n  Senator Helms yesterday reminded me of an old quote that Will Rogers \nmade that I had read many years ago. He said, ``The United States has \nnever lost a war and never won a treaty.'' That is certainly true with \ntrade.\n  Recently, we were asked to provide fast-track trade authority so that \na trade agreement called NAFTA could be reached with Canada and Mexico. \nSo the Congress dutifully complied. The Congress passed what is called \nfast-track authority which says, you go ahead, you negotiate a new \ntrade agreement with a foreign country, you can do it in secret, you \ncan do it without coming back and advising us what you are doing; bring \nit back, and you come to the Senate and House and it must be considered \nwith no amendments because no amendments will be allowed. That is what \nfast track is.\n\n  Fast track through the Senate says that nobody will be allowed to \noffer an amendment; no amendments at all.\n  So NAFTA was negotiated. They ran off and negotiated NAFTA, brought \nit back, and ran it through the Congress. I didn't vote for it, but the \nCongress passed it. When NAFTA was negotiated, we had an $11 billion \ntrade deficit with Canada. Then they negotiated NAFTA, which includes \nCanada, and the trade deficit doubled.\n  When NAFTA was negotiated with Mexico, we had a $2 billion trade \nsurplus with Mexico. They negotiate NAFTA and the $2 billion trade \nsurplus evaporated to a $15 billion trade deficit.\n  That is progress? Where I come from it is not called progress. Yet, \nwe are told now, again, we need to have fast-track trade authority.\n  I come from a State that borders Canada. I just want to tell you that \ntoday thousands of trucks come across the border from Canada hauling \nCanadian durum and Canadian wheat, sold into this country by a state \ntrade enterprise, by a monopoly called the Canadian Wheat Board. It is \na monopoly that would not be allowed to sell grain in this country. It \nwould be illegal. It sells its grain at secret prices. Yet, it ships \nthrough our backyard enormous quantities of Canadian grain, \nundercutting our farmers' interests, undercutting our income in our \nState by $220 million a year, according to a study at North Dakota \nState University, and the fact is, we can't get it stopped.\n  It is patently unfair trade, and we can't get it stopped because all \nthese trade agreements that they have concocted over the years have \npulled out the teeth of enforcement of trade treaties in a meaningful \nway, and so now we can't chew and we are complaining there are no \nteeth.\n  I understand what has happened here. What has happened here is we \nhave concocted bad trade strategy, bad trade agreements and bad \nenforcement of the\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\nagreements that did exist. It is time for us to decide we must insist \nour country stand up for its own economic interest. Yes, its economic \ninterest is in part served by expanding world trade. We are a leader. \nWe ought to lead in world trade. We ought not close our borders. I \ndon't sound like Smoot. I don't look like Hawley. So those thoughtless \npeople who say, ``Well, if you don't chant `free trade' like a robot on \na street corner, we will call you Smoot-Hawley''--that is the most \nthoughtless stuff I ever heard, but it goes on all the time.\n  I am not someone who believes we should shut off the flow of imports \nand exports, but I do believe we ought to stand up to the interests of \nthe Chinese, Japanese and, yes, the Mexicans and Canadians, and other \ntrading partners and tell them it is time for reciprocal and fair trade \ntreatment. If we let your goods into our marketplace--and we should and \nwill--then you have a responsibility to open your markets to American \ngoods.\n  If we say to our people, ``You can't pollute our streams and air when \nyou produce,'' then foreign producers who want to ship to our country \nought not be able to pollute their rivers and streams on Earth through \nthat same production. If we say that it is not fair to hire 14-year-old \nkids and work them 14 hours a day and pay them 14 cents an hour, then \nwe ought to say to them that we don't want your goods if you are \nemploying 14-year-old kids and working them 14 hours a day. We don't \nwant producers to pole vault over all those debates we had all these \nyears about worker safety, about child labor, about minimum wage, about \nair pollution and water pollution. We don't want that to be represented \nas fair trade because it is not if producers find the lowest cost \nproduction in the world, locate their plants there and produce their \nproducts in those circumstances avoiding all of the problems that exist \nfor them in having to comply with what we know now are commonsense \nproposals: child labor proposals, minimum wage, environmental proposals \nand others. That is what this is all about.\n  My only concern is this: I want us to have a fast track trade debate \nin which we are able to offer amendments, able to have a lengthy and \nthoughtful discussion about our trade policies and able to have an \nopportunity back and forth in this Chamber to describe what kind of \ntrade policies will best advance this country's economic interests.\n  If and when the legislation comes to the floor of the Senate, and we \nwill begin with a motion to proceed at some point, when that happens, \nsome of us will be on the floor of the Senate insisting that we have a \nfull, a fair and a thoughtful debate about this country's trade policy. \nAt least those of us, including myself, who believe very strongly that \na trade policy that produces the largest trade deficit in the history \nof this country is not moving this country in the right direction, we \nwill be here demanding that kind of aggressive debate.\n  What does our trade strategy now produce and what kind of trade \nstrategy would represent better economic interest for this country? Not \nprotectionism, but an interest of expanding the American economy and \nexpanding American opportunities as we move ahead.\n\n  So let me conclude--I know my colleague has things that he wants to \nsay on education issues--and let me once again indicate that I hope \nvery much that prior to getting to fast track, which I expect will \nprobably happen the end of this week or the first part of next week, \nthat we can also address the issue of campaign finance reform with a \nreal vote, and we can also extend the highway reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Vermont for his patience \nand thank him for the wonderful work he does on education.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my good friend from North Dakota for his \nremarks.\n  The subject I will talk about I know the Presiding Officer does not \nneed to hear. He is well aware of what I am talking about and I know \nagrees with me that we have to take action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11331-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11333-S11335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate the tragic situation we have going on right now in the \nschool system of the Nation's Capital.\n  Nearly every day for the past month an article has appeared in the \nWashington papers portraying the State of emergency and dysfunction in \nthe District of Columbia's public school system--the shutting down of \nschools.\n  Here are some of the facts:\n  For the fourth year in a row the schools in this city have opened \nlate by at least 2 weeks. This year they are continuing to be closed by \nthe fact that there are repairs that are essential and necessary to be \nmade.\n  The reason they have opened late is because of an infrastructure \nemergency--repairs and renovations. These needs are estimated by the \nGSA to be about $2 billion. And this is almost all for code violations. \nIt has nothing to do with their acceptability from educational function \npurposes.\n  The Congress of the United States is responsible for the schools of \nthe Nation's Capital, the students who depend on these schools, and the \nrepairs these schools need.\n  What are we doing about this?\n  I, for one, am ashamed of the way we have not done anything that is \nresponsible to this point, other than what the Appropriations Committee \nhas done out of necessity but not the way that it ought to be done to \nbe responsible.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at the human result of schools \nopening late and then closing again.\n  I ask you to take a look at this. This came from the Washington Post. \nI will read it to you. The sign says, ``Why should students suffer? For \nadult incompetence.''\n  Those adults are us. We are the ones that have the primary \nresponsibility for the city. We took it back. We took home rule away \nbasically.\n  This student is from a senior high school and holds a sign. These \nstudents were all forced out of their school and forced to be trucked, \nbused, whatever else, to some other place to be able to receive \neducation until such time as that school is fixed. All this student \nwants to do is to go to class and start paving the way for her future. \nWho are the adults that this poster refers to? They are us. We cannot \ndeny that. I hope we begin to understand that.\n  Times have changed. We took back home rule basically.\n  Why is the city in this mess? Why can't they get the revenue stream \nthey need to bond so that they can responsibly repair these schools on \nsome sort of a schedule, to get them all done so they can be done when \nthe school year opens, and to do it not in a piecemeal fashion as the \nAppropriations Committee has been forced to do by having emergencies to \nappropriate money to do this?\n  We have to have a plan. If somebody else has a plan to do it, fine. \nBut we cannot let this situation go on where year after year we are \ngoing to be doing this, shutting the schools down and trying to find \nways to open them. We created this problem. This is another important \nthing to remember.\n  In 1974, when we gave home rule to Washington, DC, a very, very \nastute Member of the Virginia delegation--I commend him for his \nforesight because Lord knows what would have happened if they had all \nthis additional money to spend with what they did have--but he got \nlegislation passed which said that you can't tax the nonresidents that \nare working in your city. This is the only city in the country under \nthis situation that does not have that authority.\n  Sure, the District could levy an income tax on its own residents, but \ndue to the inability to tax the nonresidents, and especially because of \nthe situation in the city--the workers were fleeing out of town; crime \nwas the No. 1 issue; schools second--people were leaving in droves. A \nlousy educational system, a lousy police system, and so we went from \nabout 50 percent of the workers being residents down to about 30 \npercent. As money drained from the District, crime went up, as I said, \nand the school system deteriorated causing the well-known national \nphenomenon known as ``urban flight.''\n\n  But the urban and middle class population stayed close to the \nDistrict of Columbia in the suburbs because it is\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\nthe crown jewel of this metropolitan region. Being the Nation's \nCapital, the District provides the jobs, the tourism, the prestige and \ntherefore high-earning capacity to an enormously affluent population \nresiding in the surrounding Virginia and Maryland counties.\n  But like a tiger with no teeth, the District, under current law, has \nno ability to levy any fair recompense from those who benefit daily \nfrom its services, its roads, and all else, and, namely, their jobs.\n  Let me point out, every other city in an interstate circumstance like \nD.C. does have the ability to gain revenues from nonresident workers to \nsupport the maintenance of their schools, and whatever else.\n  In the absence of such a dedicated revenue stream, Congress has tried \nto keep the city afloat through the annual appropriations process. But \nin some ways that is like giving a man dying of thirst a drop or two of \nwater every year. Eventually, the biological systems just give out from \nthe stress of such bare-bones maintenance. And that is what has \nhappened to the school system here. It is in the process of giving out.\n  Listen to the beginning of the article from yesterday's Washington \nPost.\n\n       District schoolchildren lined up somberly in the cold mist \n     early yesterday outside Emery Elementary School in Northeast \n     Washington, waiting to be taken to makeshift classes at a \n     nearby school and a neighboring church. Their school was one \n     of five closed late last week. . .\n\n  This is dated October 28th, so this is well after school should have \nbegun.\n\n     where asbestos is being removed during boiler repairs.\n\n  That is what has been going on. We just cannot blind ourselves to it. \nAnd I know when you talk about D.C., most everybody and Members just \nsay, ``Well, that's not our problem.'' But it is. That is the message I \nwant to give them today.\n  In 1995, Congress created the Control Board and later the Emergency \nSchool Board of Trustees thereby taking back most of the authority over \nthe management and delivery of education which the Senate previously \nhad. And we therefore took over the responsibility of the schools of \nthis city. This Emergency School Board of Trustees deals specifically \nwith the school infrastructure problem.\n  Earlier, the Control Board asked GSA to estimate the need, and \noutline a plan for repair and renovation. And the report came out in \nSeptember of 1995, showing a $2 billion sum, mostly for code \nviolations, in order to make the schools physically safe for the \nchildren to be in.\n  The thought of appropriating $2 billion from the Congress, to do this \nin an orderly fashion, is of course impossible to think of. And why \nshould they when all they have to have is the power that any other \ncity, under the circumstances, has to take really a 1 percent tax on \nthe nonresidents in order to be able to raise enough money on the \nbonding to fix the schools?\n  Why shouldn't the people that benefit from the jobs in this city take \npart in helping the city, like those benefiting in every other city \nunder these similar circumstances do?\n  We have on our shoulders the burden of these schools. The average \nDistrict of Columbia public school facility is 65 years old. We have \nalso taken on our shoulders the fact that 48 more roofs need to be \nreplaced. That is in addition to all of those that have been replaced \nup to now. We have taken on ourselves the burden that 72 of the school \nboilers need to be replaced. We are heading into winter right now and \nalready they are blowing up or failing. So we will see these boilers \nstarting to blow up more on the days ahead. The colder it gets the more \nthey will be going, and we will get more articles in the Washington \nPost and more condemnation for our failure to act.\n\n  The control board has tried to meet the demands. Under the direction \nof Gen. Julius Becton, 61 school roofs have been repaired or replaced \nsince January 1997 but that is all from emergency money from the \nAppropriations Committee--not a sound way to do it. Over the past 2 \nyears, $86 million has been appropriated for such repairs. Also, I have \nbeen able to raise a similar amount by being able to find things that \nwere going to raise money within the city like the privatization of \nSallie Mae and Connie Lee, so we have put a lot of money into fixing \nthese schools up, but to do it piecemeal one or two schools at a time--\nit will be 40 years before we are done at that rate. The District needs \na dedicated revenue stream to be able to bond to meet the $2 billion \nchallenge. We need that stream to responsibly meet our \nresponsibilities.\n  I have a plan to do that. If someone else has a better plan, fine, \nbring it forward, let's take a look at it, but let us not fail to meet \nour responsibilities.\n  My proposal to meet this challenge is laid out in the legislation S. \n1070, which proposes a nonresident income tax to provide that dedicated \nrevenue stream to fix the schools, to provide that $2 billion. \nIncidentally, I want to reassure, and I don't know how many of my \ncolleagues listen to us when we are here, but I know a number of our \nstaff do because they called up in a panic thinking they would have to \npay more taxes. I want to reassure them that that is not the case \nbecause already in the law they are required to allow people to take \nthat as a tax credit for either the Virginia or Maryland taxes they \npay, so no one is going to pay any more taxes. That will all be able to \nbe taken as a credit against the taxes of Maryland and Virginia.\n  For all of those hard-working residents of northern Virginia and \nsouthern Maryland I say you will not have a difference in your tax. I \nwant to emphasize that.\n  My proposal is also to take a reasonable approach to the issue of \neducation and training, to create a reasonable partnership dedicated to \nfix the 50,000 jobs that are out in this area that are going begging \nbecause the region does not provide the necessary skills for them to \ntake these jobs.\n  If we go up to 3 percent we can provide a revenue stream for the \nDistrict to help them float municipal bonds or to provide money to \nimprove their educational system. I know the Presiding Officer from \nNorth Carolina had spectacular results in taking care of regions, and \nproviding the educational skill and training in regions, and I know \nthis will work here if we have the funding to do it.\n  The bill represents a novel and equitable approach. The taxpayer \nsuffers no economic detriment. The taxpayer's community in the \nWashington metropolitan area will receive substantial additional \neducation training benefit. Workers for the thousands of available jobs \nwill be provided new business which will be attractive and substantial \nnew tax revenues will be raised. This is a win-win win-win.\n  In this process, Congress will live up to its responsibility to meet \nthat $2 billion challenge through the simple act of giving the District \nof Columbia the ability to act like any other city in a similar \ninterstate situation. By giving up our responsibility we will not have \nto bear the shame of knowing that those adults the marching students \nreferred to, ``Why should students suffer--for adult incompetence,'' \nthat we would no longer be placed in a position of having to respond to \nthat.\n  I thank my colleagues. I urge them in joining me to make the issue of \nour Nation's Capital school system a top priority for us.\n  I ask unanimous consent the complete Washington Post article from \nyesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [The Washington Post, Oct. 28, 1997]\n\n          Battle Over Boilers Leaves D.C. Students Out in Cold\n\n\n      children bused to other sites as judge keeps schools closed\n\n                          (By Debbi Wilgoren)\n\n       District schoolchildren lined up somberly in the cold mist \n     early yesterday outside Emery Elementary School in Northeast \n     Washington, waiting to be taken to makeshift classes at a \n     nearby school and a neighboring church. Their school was one \n     of five closed late last week because a D.C. judge didn't \n     want students in school buildings where asbestos is being \n     removed during boiler repairs.\n       But boiler repairs haven't started yet at Emery, school \n     officials said yesterday. And asbestos removal for boiler \n     work was finished Friday in two of the other closed schools, \n     Langdon Elementary in Northeast Washington and Whittier \n     Elementary in Northwest Washington.\n       D.C. Superior Court Judge Kaye K. Christian probably \n     doesn't know there is no dangerous work going on at those \n     three closed schools because--after learning last week that \n     some asbestos removal had begun without her permission--she \n     refused to let school\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\n     system witnesses testify about boiler repairs.\n       The D.C. Court of Appeals rejected a District request \n     yesterday to overturn Christian's order closing the schools. \n     The court said it would first give Christian a chance to rule \n     on a similar request that the city made over the weekend.\n       In the meantime, about 4,300 students--including 1,800 from \n     two other schools that have been closed for a month because \n     of roof repairs--are displaced without proper books, supplies \n     or equipment.\n       ``What we see happening is the egos and emotions of adults \n     penalizing and punishing the children,'' said Roger Glass, \n     PTA president at Whittier, where no boiler work was underway \n     yesterday and where school officials say asbestos removal was \n     completed last week.\n       ``I don't know how else to explain it,'' Glass said. ``I \n     understand that the judge is the judge, and she has all the \n     authority. But just because she has the right to do something \n     doesn't mean that it is the right thing to do.''\n       The boiler standoff between Christian and the school Chief \n     Executive Julius W. Becton, Jr. is the latest in a series of \n     clashes that began shortly after Becton was appointed in \n     November to overhaul the troubled D.C. public schools.\n       As the retired Army lieutenant general has pushed forward \n     with repairs never undertaken by his predecessors, \n     Christian--who oversees school building safety because of a \n     1992 lawsuit against the city over the fire code violation in \n     schools--has demanded detailed summaries of the repair work \n     and repeatedly expanded her jurisdiction over safety issues.\n       This summer, Christian forbade roof work while students or \n     staff were in school buildings, despite expert testimony that \n     such repairs could be made safely. The appeals court upheld \n     her decision. Last month, she ruled that no construction of \n     any kind could take place while a school is in operation.\n       When a fire inspector said in court last week that the \n     boiler work could be defined as construction, Christian put \n     that on the list of forbidden work as well, even though \n     boiler repairs have been made in the past without her \n     interference.\n       ``The court has ruled on these issues with respect to \n     construction going on in these schools while they're \n     occupied,'' Christian said, interrupting Assistant \n     Corporation Counsel Robert Rigsby on Thursday as he tried to \n     protest her decision. ``This court has ruled that this work \n     is to be done while the building is not occupied. Certainly \n     the court has grave concerns about asbestos and children.''\n       School Chief Operating Officer Charles E. Williams \n     testified in court Friday that asbestos-related boiler work \n     scheduled for Emery had not yet started. But Christian, who \n     had closed Langdon the day before, said: ``If Emery, Tyler, \n     Whittier and Young are undergoing this process, then they \n     are to be closed.''\n       Rigsby tried to clarify the order but did not specifically \n     point out that work had not begun at Emery. Christian told \n     him to put his requests in writing. Neither school \n     spokeswoman Loretta Hardge nor Corporation Counsel John \n     Ferren returned telephone calls yesterday to explain whether \n     they considered keeping Emery open because no work is going \n     on there.\n       School officials say that it is costing them more than \n     $20,000 a day for buses to transport the students to \n     alternative school sites. And the situation could get worse, \n     they warned, if more schools must close before boiler repairs \n     and other work can be started.\n       About 72 boilers in the city's 146 aging schools have \n     needed replacing for years, officials note. Unless the work \n     is done, youngsters in many classrooms will continue to be \n     dependent on temporary heat or end up taking tests in coats \n     and mittens. The school system has secured $40 million to \n     begin replacing 47 of the boilers and had hoped to do the \n     work this fiscal year.\n       Each project begins by unwrapping material that may contain \n     asbestos from around the pipes of the old boiler--the \n     procedure that concerned Christian the most last week. But \n     the project manager that Christian wouldn't let testify said \n     in an affidavit filed over the weekend that in accordance \n     with the law and environmental regulations, extreme \n     precautions are taken that would prevent the asbestos from \n     endangering students or staff members at a school.\n       The boiler room, in school basements, is sealed off with a \n     special fabric, approved by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, that does not allow air and asbestos to penetrate, \n     said Narase Bob Oudit, senior project manager for the school \n     system. An EPA-certified company monitors the air outside the \n     area and is required to shut down the project if any asbestos \n     is detected.\n       Oudit said he had monitored similar projects for 11 years \n     and had never seen a case in which asbestos leaked out if the \n     correct precautions were taken. Nor was any asbestos reported \n     in the air during recent boiler work in the schools. If \n     removal is done improperly, he said, the contractor can lose \n     its license and be fined as much as $1 million. Asbestos work \n     at one of the closed schools, Young Elementary in Northeast \n     Washington, doesn't involve a boiler. The heating-system work \n     there is part of a five-month-old project with the EPA \n     designed to improve the school's energy efficiency, school \n     officials say.\n       The asbestos removal at Tyler in Southeast Washington \n     should be completed today, an aide to Williams said.\n       At Whittier yesterday, Glass handed out fliers to parents \n     urging them to call Becton and Parents United, the group that \n     filed the lawsuit, to demand a negotiated solution. \n     Settlement talks began in earnest two weeks ago but faltered \n     this weekend over how much money should be earmarked for \n     school repairs and who should monitor the agreement.\n       At Emery yesterday, the breakfasts usually served before \n     school were not available, and the after-school day-care \n     program was canceled. The youngest children, Head Start \n     through third grade, were bused about 12 blocks across North \n     Capitol Street to Scott Montgomery Elementary School.\n       Fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders were taken around the \n     corner to Metropolitan Wesley AME Church, where by 9:30 a.m. \n     they sat clustered with their teachers in a large open space \n     usually used for Sunday school. Children wrote stories with \n     paper and pencil supplied by the church or bought by \n     individual teachers.\n       ``We're doing the best we can under very, very trying \n     circumstances,'' said Leonard Sanders, Emery's principal. A \n     little girl raised her hand to ask when they would return to \n     their school.\n       ``I do not know,'' Sanders said slowly, ``As soon as I find \n     out, I will let you know.''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 17, 1997.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember, and following the expiration or yielding back of time, the \nconference report be considered agreed to and the\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to present \nfor the Senate's approval today the conference report on H.R. 2160, the \nFiscal Year 1998 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  The conference agreement provides total appropriations of $49.7 \nbillion. This is $4.1 billion less than the fiscal year 1997 enacted \nlevel and $2.6 billion less than the level requested by the President. \nIt is $964 million less than the total appropriations recommended by \nthe Senate-passed bill and $146 million more than the level recommended \nby the House bill.\n  Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1998 of $13.751 billion in \nbudget authority and $13.997 billion in outlays. These amounts are \nconsistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations \nestablished for this conference agreement.\n  Both the House and the Senate passed this bill at the end of July. \nThe conferees met and completed conference on September 17. I believe \nit is a credit to all members of the conference committee that we were \nable to reach a conference agreement quickly. Special recognition is \ndue the ranking member of the subcommittee, my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers; the chairman of the House Subcommittee, Congressman \nSkeen of New Mexico; and the ranking member of the House Subcommittee, \nCongresswoman Kaptur, for their hard work and cooperation in making \nthis possible.\n  It was our intent that the conference report on this bill would be \nadopted by both bodies of the Congress and sent to the President prior \nto the October 1, 1997, start of the fiscal year. However, it was the \ndecision of the leadership to withhold Senate approval of this \nconference agreement until further progress was made on the FDA reform \nbill, which reauthorizes fees to expedite FDA's prescription drug \nreview and approval process.\n  The conference agreement on this appropriations bill was adopted by \nthe House of Representatives on Monday, October 6, by a vote of 399 \nyeas to 18 nays. Senate adoption of this conference report today is the \nfinal step remaining to allow this measure to be sent to the President \nfor signature into law. We have every indication that the bill will be \nsigned by the President.\n  Approximately $37.2 billion, close to 75 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic \nfood programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These \ninclude food stamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental \nfood program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]; and the school \nlunch and breakfast programs. This is roughly the same as the House \nbill level and $923 million less than the Senate level. The difference \nfrom the Senate recommended level is principally due to the fact that \nthe Senate receded to the House on the transfer of funding Food and \nConsumer Service studies and evaluations to the Economic Research \nService, and accepted the lower House bill level for the Commodity \nAssistance Program based on the Department of Agriculture's revised \nestimate of program need. In addition, the Senate receded to the House \nlevel of $100 million for the Food Stamp Program contingency reserve, \n$900 million less than the Senate bill level.\n  For agriculture programs, the conference report recommends a total of \n$6.9 billion, $57 million more than the House bill level. This amount \nincludes $1.2 billion for agricultural research and education, $423 \nmillion for extension activities, $430 million for the Animal Plant \nHealth and Inspection Service, $589 for the Food Safety and Inspection \nService, $703 million for the Farm Service Agency, and $253 million for \nthe Risk Management Agency.\n  For conservation programs, the conference report recommends almost \n$790 million, $30 million more than the House bill level but $36 \nmillion less than the amount recommended by the Senate.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the bill \nrecommends $2.1 billion, $47 million more than the House level and $9 \nmillion more than the Senate bill level. Included in this amount is \n$652 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, nearly $8 \nmillion more than the Senate bill level, and the Senate bill level of \n$535 million for the rental assistance program. The conference report \nalso provides a total rural housing loan program level of $4.2 billion.\n  For foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of \nAgriculture, the bill recommends $1.7 billion, including $131 million \nin new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service and a \ntotal program level of $1.1 billion for the Public Law 480 Food for \nPeace Program.\n  The Food and Drug Administration receives one of the largest \ndiscretionary spending increases over the fiscal year 1997 level. \nIncluded in the appropriation provided by the conference agreement for \nsalaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is $24 \nmillion for food safety and $34 million for youth tobacco prevention. \nThese are the full amounts requested by the Administration for these \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to continue temporary stop-gap \nfunding for the programs and activities funded by this bill. As I \nindicated earlier, this conference report was filed on September 17 and \nwas adopted by the House of Representatives on October 6. Senate \npassage of this conference report today is the final step necessary to \nsend this fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill to the President for \nsignature into law. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of \nthis conference report.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, in bringing to the Senate floor the \nconference report for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and \nrelated agencies. We concluded a successful conference with the House \nand although our 602(b) allocation had to be adjusted downward, we were \nstill able to maintain relatively high levels of funding for many \nimportant programs.\n  As I stated during consideration of the Senate bill, I had hoped we \ncould provide higher levels of funding for agricultural research. I am \nhappy to report that the conference agreement provides a higher level \nof funding for the Agricultural Research Service than was contained in \neither the earlier House or Senate versions. Funding for the Food \nSafety Inspection Service is provided at a level more than $15 million \nabove last year and additional funds are included for the President's \nFood Safety Initiative at USDA and FDA.\n  The conference report contains funding for conservation programs well \nabove last year's level and I am happy to report that the House and \nSenate conferees have agreed to changes in rural development activities \nthat will protect program integrity and make them more efficient. The \nWIC Program retains the increase of more than $100 million above fiscal \nyear 1997 that was included in the Senate bill and full funding for \nFDA's youth tobacco initiative is provided.\n  I regret that we had to defer consideration of this conference report \nuntil this time. We had completed conference action and had been \nprepared to conclude action on this bill well in advance of the end of \nthe previous fiscal year. However, questions raised by the \nauthorization committees of the Food and Drug Administration postponed \nthis final action until today. I look forward to quick passage of this \nconference report and approval by the President.\n  We have already seen the President exercise his new authorities of \nline-item veto on bills presented to him. I no doubt suspect that he \nwill review this legislation with a similar critical eye and, without \ndoubt, he will find items that had not originated with the executive \nbranch. Mr. President, I do not here intend to reopen floor debate on \nthe ill-conceived line-item veto. However, I remind my colleagues, and \nmy friend in the White House, that the Congress has very explicit \nresponsibilities derived from the U.S. Constitution relating to the \nexpenditure of funds. Simply because an item does not\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\noriginate with the executive does not mean it is without merit. Let me \nplainly observe that when this bill was on the Senate floor in July of \nthis year, it passed by a resounding 98 to 0. Mr. President, that \nsimple statistic should speak for itself and send an important message \nto those who would undue the work we have done.\n  In closing, let me again say what a pleasure it has been to work with \nmy friend from Mississippi, the chairman of this subcommittee. He \nunderstands the programs and the issues contained in this bill and his \nleadership has been beyond value. Let me also again thank the \nsubcommittee's majority staff, Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, \nRochelle Graves, and, on this side, Galen Fountain, Carole Geagley, and \nBen Noble of my personal staff. All their work has been important to \ncompleting work on this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending Agriculture and related \nagencies appropriations bill provides $49.0 billion in new budget \nauthority [BA] and $41.5 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $48.8 billion in budget \nauthority and $49.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  Of the $49.2 billion in outlays, $35.2 billion fund entitlement \nprograms like food stamps, child nutrition programs, and price support \npayments. The remaining $14.0 billion funds discretionary programs like \nrural housing and economic development, food safety inspection, \nactivities of the Food and Drug Administration, agriculture research \nand the Farm Service Agency.\n  The conference report falls within the current 302(b) allocation for \nthe Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. I \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Mississippi for bringing this \nbill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  The bill contains important increases over the 1997 level from \nprograms like the WIC Program and the new food safety initiative, and I \nurge adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the conference report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               H.R. 2160, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998 SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,751   .......    35,048    48,799\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,997   .......    35,205    49,202\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,791   .......    35,048    48,839\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     14,167   .......    35,205    49,372\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     14,025   .......    35,048    49,073\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     14,282   .......    35,205    49,487\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,650   .......    35,048    48,698\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     13,989   .......    35,205    49,194\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     13,791   .......    35,048    49,839\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......     14,038   .......    35,205    49,243\n \n                CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        -40   .......  .........      -40\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -170   .......  .........     -170\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......       -274   .......  .........     -274\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -285   .......  .........     -285\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        101   .......  .........      101\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......          8   .......  .........        8\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......        -40   .......  .........      -40\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        -41   .......  .........      -41\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret to come to the floor once again \nto talk about wasteful and unnecessary spending in an appropriations \nconference agreement.\n  During Senate consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill, I \npresented a nine-page list of add-ons, earmarks, and set-asides in the \nbill and report language.\n  I had highlighted four provisions in the bill language of the Senate \nversion of the Agriculture appropriations bill, and not surprisingly, \nevery one of these provisions, with minor modifications, is included in \nthe final conference bill.\n  Interestingly, though, the conferees also made sure that most of the \nearmarks and set-asides in the report language of both Houses is \nincluded by reference in the final agreement.

\n     report.\n       Total objectionable provisions: $152.4 million.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me take a moment to highlight some of \nthe items that are specifically earmarked in the conference agreement.\n  The conferees earmark $3.354 million of the research funds provided \nto the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service \n[CSREES] for shrimp aquaculture studies in Hawaii, Mississippi, \nMassachusetts, California, and my home State, Arizona. Funding for \nshrimp aquaculture is a perennial congressional add-on that has not, to \nmy knowledge, ever been included in an administration budget request. \nAnd I have yet to fathom the logic of conducting shrimp research in the \ndesert.\n  The conferees earned another $150,000 from the same CSREES account \nfor the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness. Again, this item \nwas not included in the budget request but was added by the House with \nthe expectation that the Department of Agriculture would ``exploit \nevery opportunity to collaborate with the Center''--according to the \nHouse report language.\n  Two earmarks are included in the conference managers' statement for \nthe National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture in Leetown, WV. \nThe conferees earned another $6 million to complete construction of a \nbuilding at this site, which was funded at the same level in the fiscal \nyear 1997 bill. And the conferees also provided $250,000 to initiate a \nprogram to be conducted at this new facility which, according to the \nSenate report language, will ``ensure that risks associated with the \nlong-term stability of the [cool and cold water aquaculture] industry \nare reduced.''\n  Finally, the conferees earmarked $1.7 million for new personnel at \nvarious centers. The specific earmarks in the statement of managers \nlanguage include: $500,000 for additional scientists to do research on \nparasitic mites and Africanized honeybees at the Agriculture Research \nService Bee Laboratory in Weslaco, TX; $250,000 for an animal \nphysiologist position at the Fort Keough Laboratory in Montana; \n$250,000 for additional scientific staffing at the Small Fruits \nResearch Laboratory in Mississippi; $450,000 to hire two small grain \npathologists, one at the Agriculture Research Laboratory in Raleigh, \nNC, and the other at the laboratory at Aberdeen, IA; and $250,000 for a \nhydrologist to work on south Florida Everglades restoration. The report \nlanguage of both Houses and the conferees also includes numerous \ninstances of language supporting or urging or encouraging various \nagencies to hire additional staff personnel, including a particular \nreference in the managers' statement, that was not included in either \nreport, to express the conferees' ``support [for] the addition of a new \nlettuce geneticist/plant breeder position at the U.S. Agricultural \nResearch Station in Salinas, CA.''\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the egregiously \nwasteful spending practices of the Congress. I cannot condone wasting \nmillions of taxpayer dollars at a time when we are finally making \nprogress toward a balanced budget. Even when we have eliminated annual \ndeficits, hopefully within just a few years, our Nation will still face \na debt of over $5.4 trillion. Why not stop wasting money on unnecessary \nprojects, and start repaying this huge debt?\n  I plan to recommend that the President exercise his line item veto \nauthority to eliminate these earmarks and set-asides. I hope he does \nso, because eliminating unnecessary spending is in the best interest of \nall Americans.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my colleagues', \nMr. Feingold and Mr. Grams, efforts to clarify study language included \nin the\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\nAgriculture appropriations bill being discussed today.\n  My friends from the Northeast have worked hard to boost prices above \nmarket clearing levels by creating a regional compact for their \nfarmers. Now that the compact is implemented and operating, we need a \ntimely, comprehensive economic analysis by the Office of Management and \nBudget of the marketing and pricing of milk within the six State \ncompact and surrounding areas. The pricing of milk is an extremely \ncomplex issue. Artificially manipulating the marketing and pricing of \nmilk will have major impacts on other regions of the United States, \nlike Wisconsin.\n  Their proposal to raise prices for farmers has worked well and that \ncost is being passed on to consumers. A recently released study \nannounced that Massachusetts consumers will pay an additional $25 \nmillion for their milk over the next 12 months. The print media has \nreported that consumers are paying $.27 a gallon more per gallon of \nmilk in the compact area. We need to analyze the impact this price \nincrease has not only on government purchases of dairy products for \nlunch programs, but also the impact on low-income families that spend \nmore of their income on food and dairy products.\n  Although the program only regulates class I milk, other classes will \nbe impacted by the economic signals encouraging Northeast dairy farmers \nto overproduce. What happens to that excess fluid or manufacturing milk \nthat will be produced in the Northeast and forced to find a new \nprocessing plant outside the compact area? Again, the print media has \nreported that distressed raw milk has moved out of the Northeast to \nplants in Ohio and as far away as Wisconsin and Minnesota. Ohio plants \nreportedly were paying $8.00 per cwt. delivered milk filling all \nmanufacturing plants to capacity in that State. That excess supply of \nmilk added to the overproduction that occurred in the United States \nfurther exasperating record low price paid to farms this summer.\n  Finally, the study should consider a cost/benefit analysis for each \nState participating in the compact. For example, Massachusetts has only \nabout 300 dairy farms, roughly 10 percent of New England total, while \nits consumers pay half of the aggregate total consumer costs.\n  I encourage the Office of Management and Budget to take a serious \nlook at the issue.\n\n\n                 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the conference report (105-252) on \nDepartment of Agriculture appropriations includes $34.4 million for \nresource conservation and development [RC]. The conferees note that \nthis increase in funding is not specifically earmarked for any \ninitiative but should be used for approved RC Councils waiting for \nfunding. I agree that the Natural Resource Conservation Service [NRCS] \nshould prioritize funding for newly approved RC Councils. These \ncouncils provide much needed assistance to watersheds and conservation \ndistricts seeking to maximize the environmental benefits of their \nconservation programs. RC Councils should be funded. RC is a very \nimportant program for protection and prudent development of our \nNation's natural resource base. Working through local RC Councils, \nthis program helps enhance our ability to meet economic objectives \nwithin the context of a wise and sustainable use of our natural \nresources. In Washington State, a State rich in natural resources, RC \noffers the chance to meet the challenges of threatened resources in the \nface of demands for continued economic development.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Washington. \nThe purpose of the RC program is to encourage and improve the \ncapability of State and local units of government and local nonprofit \norganizations in rural areas to plan, develop, and carry out programs \nfor resource conservation and development. The NRCS also helps \ncoordinate available Federal, State, and local programs to ensure \nadequate protection of natural resources while promoting sound \ndevelopment practices. Funding of the RC Councils is an important \npriority for the NRCS, as correctly emphasized by the conferees, and I \nurge the NRCS to not overlook opportunities to enhance the efforts of \nthe RC Councils in a manner complimentary and consistent with these \nstated objectives.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \nexpressing support for the important work of RC Councils as well as \nopportunities to enhance these efforts. I urge the NRCS to seek avenues \nthat maximize the beneficial conservation and environmental purposes of \nRC activities.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as provided by the unanimous-consent \nagreement taking up this appropriations conference report, there are 20 \nminutes equally divided available for further discussion of the \nconference report. I have had some indication that there may be one or \ntwo Senators who may wish to comment. Pending their arrival on the \nfloor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been advised by the staff that \nhotlines have been sent out to Members on both sides, and we have no \nindication that any other Senator wants to come and speak on the \nsubject of the conference report.\n  Therefore, I am authorized by the distinguished ranking member to \nyield back all time remaining on the conference report on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I now so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the conference report is \nagreed to.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11335-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I regret that I must again bring to the \nSenate's attention the situation of imprisoned Tibetan music and dance \nscholar, Ngawang Choephel. I had hoped that Chinese authorities would \nhave recognized by now the grave mistake they made in sentencing him to \n18 years in prison.\n  In 1995, Mr. Choephel was in Tibet making a documentary film of \ntraditional Tibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese \nauthorities. After being held incommunicado for 15 months without \naccess to his family or independent legal counsel, Mr. Choephel was \nsentenced to 18 years in\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\nprison for violating the State Security Law. It was insinuated that he \nwas paid by the U.S. Government to spy on behalf of the Dalai Lama. No \nevidence to support such a claim has ever been produced. The 16 hours \nof film Mr. Choephel sent to India during the first weeks of his \nproject simply contain footage of the traditional music and dance he \nsaid he had gone to document.\n  Persistent inquiries to Chinese authorities regarding Mr. Choephel's \nwhereabouts and the condition of his health have produced little \ninformation. I wrote to the head of the Chinese Communist Party soon \nafter Mr. Choephel's detention and received no reply. I raised his case \npersonally in meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese \nofficials last November in Beijing and received no reply. I have \nwritten to President Jiang since then to urge his personal intervention \nin this case and received no reply. I am just one of many who have \nsought information about Mr. Choephel to no avail. As of today we have \nno information as to where Mr. Choephel is being held, or even if he is \nstill alive.\n  This is an outrageous situation. A former Fulbright Scholar has been \ndeprived of 18 years of his life as a result of spurious charges by a \ngovernment that will not even reveal his whereabouts. I have urged the \nWhite House to raise Mr. Choephel's case with President Jiang. I plan \nto do the same. If President Jiang is interested in fostering closer \nties with the United States, he could make no gesture more meaningful \nthan ordering his release.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from an article \nentitled ``Who Is Invited to the Banquet?'' by Jeff Kaufman of the \nRutland Daily Herald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Oct. 23, 1997]\n\nWho Is Invited to the Banquet?--Tibetan From Vermont Remains in Chinese \n                                 Prison\n\n                           (By Jeff Kaufman)\n\n       In a few weeks, the Clinton administration will welcome \n     Chinese President Jiang Zemin on his first state visit to the \n     United States. Champagne, smiles, encouraging words and a \n     good dose of pomp and circumstance will be broadcast, not \n     just to Americans, but around the world. Sidebar statements \n     about human and workers' rights will be drowned out by \n     televised images that will instantly convey the central \n     message of such a historic meeting: The leaders of the \n     world's most powerful countries are celebrating joint \n     ventures and common purpose.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Anonymity for political prisoners is a tyrant's ally, so \n     here is a name and a story to personalize the kind of cruelty \n     imposed by China's prison archipelago. This individual case \n     may be not be typical in that it involves a young man who \n     left the safety of America to travel to his native Tibet, but \n     it is all too typical in its show of intolerance, judicial \n     abuse and lack of regard for basic standards of human rights.\n       Tibetan exile and Fulbright scholar Ngawang Choopal came to \n     this country at the age of 27 to study ethnomusicology at \n     Middlebury College in 1993. In the summer of 1995, he \n     returned to Tibet to film a documentary about traditional \n     Tibetan music and dance. Sixteen hours of video were sent to \n     friends in the West; they show beautiful images and sounds of \n     a great culture, but no military installations, no political \n     protests, not a critical word against China.\n       Nonetheless, Chinese authorities arrested Ngawang Choepal \n     in Llasa's Shigatse market in September 1995. He was \n     incarcerated for 15 months without being allowed to meet his \n     family, independent legal counsel, or American \n     representatives. Sen. Patrick Leahy visited Beijing in \n     November 1996 and appealed directly to President Jiang Zemin \n     on behalf of Ngawang. That plea was at first followed by a \n     vague promise to examine the case. A month later, Chinese \n     authorities convicted Ngawang Choepal of espionage and \n     providing information ``to the Dalai Lama clique's \n     government-in-exile and to an organization of a certain \n     foreign country.''\n       The sentence imposed was stunningly severe: 18 years in \n     prison. Eighteen years in a Chinese jail for videotaping \n     people dancing to old Tibetan songs.\n       The Chinese government has ignored assurances from the \n     United States that Ngawang Choepal is just a non-political \n     music student, several congressional resolutions in his \n     support, pleas from his family and a number of worldwide \n     letter-writing campaigns.\n       In fact, the international Campaign for Tibet reports that \n     the American Embassy in Beijing is not even certain in what \n     prison Ngawang is being held.\n       Ngawang Choepal's case is tragic on its own very personal \n     terms and as a reflection of a much wider Chinese decision to \n     wipe out all opposition no matter how benign and no matter \n     how inadvertent.\n       Such an outrageous violation of human rights should be a \n     serious obstacle to productive relations between the United \n     States and China (it certainly would be if the offending \n     country had less trade potential).\n       Sadly, President Clinton and in essence our whole country \n     will soon host the man who is responsible for locking up \n     Ngawang Choepal and who could instantly set him free. When \n     President Jiang Zemin visits America later this month, he'll \n     be toasted, feasted, and courted by businesses and lobbyists. \n     Ngawang Choepal's voice will not pass through the thick stone \n     walls that he faces every day.\n       Who will speak out for him and thousands like him?\n       It should be our president and secretary of state using the \n     impressive clout of the United States. Soon we will see what \n     this country really stands for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11339-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEATH OF FORMER SENATE PRESS GALLERY SUPERINTENDENT DON C. WOMACK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Don C. Womack, \nwho served as superintendent of the U.S. Senate Press Gallery from 1973 \nto 1981, died of cancer Thursday morning at his home in Arlington at \nthe age of 87.\n  Don was born in Danville, Virginia August 22, 1910. He moved to the \nWashington Area in 1935, and attended the Corcoran School of Art and \nGeorge Washington University. He managed a string of movie theaters in \nNorthern Virginia before taking a job as staff assistant in the House \nof Representatives Periodical Press Gallery in 1948, beginning a 33-\nyear career as a press liaison on Capitol Hill.\n  Don began working in the Senate Press Gallery in 1951. He briefly \nleft to serve as superintendent of the House Periodical Gallery in 1954 \nand 1955, then returned to the Senate to be deputy superintendent, and \ncontinued in that capacity until his promotion in 1973.\n  Don became superintendent of the Senate gallery during a tumultuous \ntime--the beginning of the Watergate hearings. He weathered the storm, \nand received a commendation from the Standing Committee of \nCorrespondents, the governing body of the Congressional press \ngalleries, for his handling of the hearings.\n  During his tenure as superintendent, Don presided over press coverage \nof the Senate during such major events as the end of the Vietnam War, \nthe Panama Canal Treaties debates, and the \nABSCAM hearings. He assisted with media arrangements for the Republican \nand Democratic Conventions and the Presidential Inaugurals from 1948 to \n1988. He was a tremendous help to Senators, staff members and the \nmembers of the press.\n  A Southern gentleman with a quick wit and warm sense of humor, Don \nwas one of the true characters to roam the halls of Congress. He was \nbeloved by reporters and Senators alike for his storytelling, his \naffable nature, and his seemingly endless repertoire of jokes. He will \nbe greatly missed.\n  My deepest sympathy goes out to his wife, Mary Womack; his two \ndaughters, Kay Duda of Alexandria and Patricia Fair of Eatontown, New \nJersey; his five grandchildren; eleven great grandchildren, and his \ngreat-great grandson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11340-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11340-S11341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n REPORT OF ACHIEVEMENTS IN AERONAUTICS AND SPACE FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 75\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit this report on the Nation's achievements in \naeronautics and space during fiscal year (FY) 1996, as required under \nsection 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as \namended (42 U.S.C. 2476). Aeronautics and space activities in FY 1996 \ninvolved 14 contributing departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place \nduring FY 1996. The Administration issued an integrated National Space \nPolicy, consolidating a number of previous policy directives into a \nsingular, coherent vision of the future for the civil, commercial, and \nnational security space sectors. The Administration also issued a \nformal policy on the future management and use of the U.S. Global \nPositioning System.\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\n  During FY 1996, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA) successfully completed eight Space Shuttle flights. NASA also \nlaunched 7 expendable launch vehicles, while the Department of Defense \nlaunched 9 and the commercial sector launched 13. In the reusable \nlaunch vehicle program, Vice President Gore announced NASA's selection \nof a private sector partner to design, fabricate, and flight test the \nX-33 vehicle.\n  Scientists made some dramatic new discoveries in various space-\nrelated fields such as space science, Earth science and remote sensing, \nand life and microgravity science. Most notably, NASA researchers \ncooperating with the National Science Foundation found possible \nevidence of ancient microbial life in a meteorite believed to be from \nMars.\n  In aeronautics, activities included the development of technologies \nto improve performance, increase safety, reduce engine noise, and \nassist U.S. industry to be more competitive in the world market. Air \ntraffic control activities focused on various automation systems to \nincrease flight safety and enhance the efficient use of air space.\n  Close international cooperation with Russia occurred in the Shuttle-\nMir docking missions and with Canada, Europe, Japan, and Russia in the \nInternational Space Station program. The United States also entered \ninto new cooperative agreements with Japan and new partners in South \nAmerica and Asia.\n  In conclusion, FY 1996 was a very active and successful year for U.S. \naeronautics and space programs. Efforts in these areas have contributed \nsignificantly to the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, \ninternational cooperation, environmental health, and economic \ncompetitiveness.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit the taking of certain lands by the United \nStates in trust for economically self-sufficient Indian tribes for \ncommercial and gaming purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n               THE INDIAN TRUST LANDS REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at returning some common sense to one aspect of the Federal \nGovernment's Indian lands policies. My bill, the Indian Trust Lands \nReform Act of 1997, arises out of a problem Connecticut and other \nStates have been struggling with for the last few years.\n  The bill would amend the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 to \nreinforce its original purpose: helping Indian tribes and individual \nIndians to hold on to or obtain land they need to survive economically \nand become self-sufficient. Congress passed the 1934 act after the \nlandholdings of some tribes had dwindled down to acres. Tribes and \ntheir members were selling and losing land to foreclosures, tax \narrearages, and the like. The 1934 act gave the Secretary of the \nInterior the authority needed to help tribes hold on to or acquire land \non which they could earn a living and, further, to hold those lands in \ntrust for them so they would not be sold or otherwise lost. Once the \nUnited States takes land into trust for a tribe through this process, \nthe land becomes part of the tribe's sovereign property. This means \nthat State and local governments no longer have jurisdiction over the \nland, and the land is removed from those governments' tax, zoning, and \npolice powers.\n  Economic conditions for some tribes have improved since 1934 through \na variety of commercial, agricultural, and other enterprises, but many \nare still struggling. Few could be described as rich or even \ncomfortable; far too many still live in poverty. The 1934 act should \nremain available to help those tribes who still need assistance from \nthe Federal Government in attaining economic self-sufficiency.\n  As our experience in Connecticut has shown, however, that act is now \nbeing used to achieve goals far removed from its original purpose. As a \nresult of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, many tribes have \nestablished casinos and gambling operations, and, although gaming has \nnot brought riches to many of those tribes, some have been very \nsuccessful, particularly in my home State. One of the most successful \ngambling casinos in the country is located in eastern Connecticut and \nis owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. The success of \nthe tribe's Foxwoods Casino has been well chronicled. Established in \n1992, the casino has been open 24 hours a day, 7-days a week ever \nsince. Whatever one thinks about the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or \ngambling, either morally or as a vehicle for economic growth, the \nMashantucket Pequots seized the opportunity presented to them by the \nIndian Gaming Act. They have developed an extraordinarily successful, \nwell-run casino in record time. Annual casino revenues for the 500-\nmember tribe reportedly approach $1 billion. By any measure, the tribe \nhas become very wealthy.\n  Given the tribe's tremendous financial success, it is not at all \nsurprising that it has decided to buy more land near its reservation in \norder to expand and diversify its businesses. According to press \naccounts, the tribe owns over 3,500 acres outside of the boundaries of \nits reservation, in addition to the approximately 1,320 acres that is \nheld in trust on its behalf within the reservation. The tribe is now \nthe largest private landowner in southeastern Connecticut. It already \nruns several hotels outside of its reservation's boundaries, and tribal \nleaders have at various times talked of building a massive theme park \nand golf courses on its off-reservation land.\n  The tribe owns its land in fee simple and so is free to develop it \nlike any other property owner might. But unlike other property owners--\nwho must develop their land in compliance with State and local zoning \nlaws and who\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\nmust pay taxes on the land and on the businesses conducted on the \nland--the tribe has claimed it has the option, under the 1934 act, to \nask the Department of the Interior to take that land in trust on the \ntribe's behalf, thereby removing the land from all State and local \njurisdiction. This is an option because the Department of Interior \ninterprets the 1934 act as being available, with limitations, to all \nfederally recognized tribes, regardless of whether the tribe's \nsituation bears any resemblance to the conditions that originally \nspurred Congress to enact the 1934 provisions.\n  And, this is an option the Mashantucket Pequots have exercised. In \n1992, the Department of Interior granted the tribe's request to take \ninto trust approximately 20 acres located outside the tribe's \nreservation boundaries in the neighboring towns of Ledyard and Preston. \nIn January 1993, the tribe filed another application, this one to have \nan additional 248 off- reservation acres taken in trust. The affected \ntowns of Ledyard, North Stonington, and Preston challenged that \nrequest. Nevertheless, the Department of Interior granted that request \nin May 1995, subject to certain conditions regarding the land's \ndevelopment--a decision the towns and the Connecticut attorney general \nare challenging in Federal court. In March 1993, the tribe applied to \nhave 1,200 more off-reservation acres taken in trust. That request was \nsent back to the tribe because of legal deficiencies in the \napplication, but reapplication by the tribe is expected, and past \nstatements by tribal leaders suggest that more applications may be \nfiled in the future.\n  The effect of the tribe's and the Department of Interior's decisions \ninvolving off-reservation lands has been unsettling, to say the least, \non the tribe's neighbors--the residents of the small towns that border \nthe reservation. Once the United States takes land into trust on behalf \nof a tribe, as it has attempted to do here, boundaries change \npermanently. The land is no longer within the jurisdiction of the State \nor local governments. It is not subject to local zoning, land-use or \nenvironmental controls. Taxes cannot be collected on the land or on any \nbusiness operated on the land. And State and local governments may \nexercise no police powers on the land unless invited by the tribe to do \nso.\n\n  The plight of the towns surrounding the Mashantucket Pequot lands \nshow that these problems are not just theoretical. Ledyard, North \nStonington, and Preston are small communities whose combined population \nis about 25,000--less than half the number of visitors the Foxwoods \nCasino receives on a typical summer weekend. The towns have a combined \nannual tax revenue of approximately $25 million--less than half the \namount of revenue the casino's slot machines generate in 1 month alone. \nObviously, towns of this size cannot absorb a business of this size \nwithout there being any consequences. As a result of the Casino's \nsuccess, the character of the towns has been permanently altered, and \nthe costs of local government--from crime prevention to road \nmaintenance to countless other things--have increased, all at the same \ntime that the 1934 act has precluded the towns from exercising zoning \nand other controls and from collecting taxes to help defray the newly \nimposed costs.\n  Given the financial resources of the tribe and the apparent \nwillingness of the Department of Interior to take land into trust on \ntheir behalf regardless of any evidence that the tribe needs additional \ntrust lands, many residents wonder where this will lead. I question the \npolicy justification for the United States to change the boundaries of \nthree Connecticut towns unilaterally so that an extraordinarily wealthy \ntribe--this one or any other --can expand its gaming or other business \nenterprises, free of taxes and local land-use controls, particularly \nwhen that tribe is perfectly capable of expanding its businesses on the \nthousands of trust and nontrust acres it presently owns. I question \nwhether Congress--which enacted the 1934 act ``to provide for the \nacquisition, through purchase, of land for Indians, now landless, who \nare anxious to make a living on such land * * * '' and ``to meet the \nneeds of landless Indians and of Indian individuals whose landholdings \nare insufficient for self-support'' (Senate Report No. 1080, 73d \nCongress, 2d Session 1-2 (1934))--intended in 1934 that the law would \nbe used in this fashion.\n  The authority for the Department of Interior to grant the tribe's \nrequest is now subject to review in the courts. The courts will have to \ndecide whether the 1934 act even applies to this tribe and, if so, \nwhether the Secretary acted properly. The courts will have to decide as \nwell whether the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Settlement Act independently \nprohibits trust acquisition by the tribe outside of reservation \nboundaries and whether the trust acquisition complied with applicable \nFederal environmental laws.\n  To avoid future disputes and controversy, my bill would amend the \nIndian Reorganization Act to return to its original purpose. It would \nprohibit the Secretary of Interior from taking any lands located \noutside of the boundaries of an Indian reservation into trust on behalf \nof an economically self-sufficient Indian tribe, if those lands are to \nbe used for gaming or any other commercial purpose. It directs the \nSecretary of Interior to determine, after providing opportunity for \npublic comment, whether a tribe is economically self-sufficient and to \ndevelop regulations setting forth the criteria for making that \ndetermination generally. Among the criteria that the Secretary must \ninclude in those regulations to assess economic self-sufficiency are \nthe income of the tribe, as allocated among members and compared to the \nper capita income of citizens of the United States, as well as the role \nthat the lands at issue will play in the tribe's efforts to achieve \neconomic self-sufficiency. May I note that I understand that some \ntribes do not have reservations in the traditional sense, and so the \nlanguage of this bill will have to be adjusted in the future to address \nthe situation of those tribes.\n  In short, my bill is very narrow in scope, aimed solely at ensuring \nthat the Department of Interior's awesome power to remove lands from \nState and local authority is used only in accordance with the original \nintent of the 1934 Act. The bill would not impose any restrictions on \nthe Department's authority to take on-reservation land into trust. It \nwould not affect the ability of the Secretary to assist tribes that \ngenuinely need additional land--whether on or off their reservations--\nin order to move toward or attain economic self-sufficiency. It would \nnot even affect the ability of the Department of Interior to take into \ntrust off-reservation land for wealthy tribes needing the land for non-\ncommercial purposes. The bill contains explicit exemptions for the \nestablishment of initial reservations for Indian tribes, whether \naccomplished through recognition by the Department of Interior or by an \nact of Congress, and in circumstances where tribes once recognized by \nthe Federal Government are restored to recognition. And, of course, it \ndoes not impact the ability of wealthy tribes to buy as much land as \nthey want for whatever purpose they want it. The only thing my bill \ndoes do is to require tribes who are economically self-sufficient and \nwho wish to engage in commercial activity outside of their \nreservation's boundaries to do so in compliance with the same local \nland-use and tax laws applied to every other land holder.\n  Mr. President, many residents of Connecticut applaud the success that \nthe Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has had with its Foxwoods Casino. The \ntribe employs thousands of Connecticut residents in an area of the \nState that was hard hit by a lingering recession and cuts in defense \nspending. The tribe's plans for economic development of the region, \nwhile not universally liked, have many in the area genuinely excited \nabout future opportunities.\n  I have discovered though that even among residents cheered by the \ntribe's success and supportive of its plans, there is a strong sense of \nunfairness about how the land in trust process is being used. They \nbelieve there is no reason why this tribe, or any other in a similar \nsituation, needs to have the U.S. Government take additional, \ncommercial land in trust on the tribe's behalf outside of its \nreservation boundaries. What is at stake here, after all, is not \npreserving a culture or achieving self-sufficiency, but expansion of an \nalready successful business on lands that are owned by the tribe and \ndevelopable by them, as they would be by any other\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\nlandowner. Extra help is simply not needed, and continuing to grant it \nis not fair and, in my view, ultimately counterproductive for all \ninvolved.\n  It is time for Congress to make this common-sense clarification in \nthe law. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance \ndomestic aviation competition by providing for the auction of slots at \nslot-controlled airports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            the aviation competition enhancement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Aviation \nCompetition Enhancement Act of 1997. This bill seeks, in a modest and \nrational fashion, to deregulate further our domestic aviation system, \nand to introduce additional competition in the airline industry for the \nbenefit of travelers and communities.\n  This legislation is intended to reduce barriers to airline \ncompetition, including those imposed by the government. Anticompetitive \nFederal restrictions in particular--restrictions such as slot controls \nand the perimeter rule at National Airport--are barriers to competition \nin a deregulated environment.\n  The Department of Transportation [DOT], in a report released on \nOctober 22, 1997, reiterated its 1990 study on domestic competition, \nwhich demonstrated relatively high fares at network hubs dominated by \none major carrier. In an April 1996 study, the DOT estimated that \nalmost 40 percent of domestic passengers traveled in markets with low-\nfare competition, saving consumers an estimated $6.3 billion annually \nin airline fares. As the Department states in its most recent report, \n``[i]ndeed, we concluded that virtually all of the domestic traffic \ngrowth and declines in average fares in recent years could be \nattributed to this growing form of competition.''\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] reported in October 1996 that \nbarriers to market entry persist in the airline industry, and that \naccess to airports continue to be impeded by, first, Federal limits on \ntakeoff and landing slots at the major airports in Chicago, New York, \nand Washington; second, long-term exclusive-use gate leases; and third, \nperimeter rules prohibiting flights at airports that exceed a certain \ndistance. In addition, according to GAO, several factors have limited \nentry at airports serving small- and medium-sized communities in the \nEast and upper Midwest, including the dominance of routes to and from \nthose airports by one or two established airlines. The GAO concluded \nthat operating barriers such as slot controls at nearby hub airports, \nand incumbent airlines marketing strategies' have fortified those \ndominant positions.\n  The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline \nIndustry in 1993 recommended that the artificial limits imposed by \nslots either be removed or raised to the highest level consistent with \nsafety. The Department of Transportation subsequently conducted a \nstudy, in which it found that eliminating slots would not affect safety \nand would result in increased competition. This bill, however, does not \nsuggest that we eliminate slots.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to outline what the Aviation Competition \nEnhancement Act of 1997 does:\n  Slot auction: The legislation mandates a slot allocation among new \nentrant and limited incumbent air carriers--air carriers that hold no \nmore than 12 slots. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to \ncreate new slots where possible, and allocate unused slots.\n  If it is not possible to create slots because of capacity and noise \nlimitations, which are not affected by this bill, the Secretary must \nwithdraw a limited number of slots--up to 10 percent initially, 5 \npercent every 2 years following--that were grandfathered free-of-charge \nto the major air carriers in 1985 and that remain with those \ngrandfathered carriers. The DOT cannot withdraw slots that are used to \nprovide air service to under served markets. The withdrawn slots then \nwill be auctioned among only the new entrant and limited incumbent air \ncarriers.\n  The process for obtaining slots would be as follows. A new entrant or \nlimited incumbent air carrier would apply to the DOT for slots, \nproposing the markets to be served and the times requested. The DOT \nmust approve the application if it determines that the carrier can \noperate the proposed service for at least 180 days, and that the \nservice will improve the competitive environment. The DOT can return \nthe request to the applicant for further information.\n  While service to any city is eligible under this process, the DOT \nmust prioritize applications that propose service between a high-\ndensity airport, a slot-controlled airport--National, Kennedy, \nLaGuardia, and O'Hare, and a relatively small city.\n  All slot auction proceeds would be deposited in the aviation trust \nfund. The legislation directs the DOT to institute action to ensure \nmaximum slot usage, to tighten up the 80 percent use-\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\nor-lose provisions, and to study the effect of the high-density rule on \nairline competition, and the impact of changes to the rule on safety.\n  Complaints concerning predatory behavior: The legislation establishes \na 90-day deadline for the DOT to respond to complaints of predatory \nbehavior on the part of major air carriers.\n  Exemptions to perimeter rule at National Airport: The bill mandates \nthat the Secretary grant exemptions from the perimeter rule to an air \ncarrier proposing to serve Washington National from points beyond the \nperimeter, if the carrier's proposal would, first, provide service with \nnetwork benefits, and second, increase competition in multiple markets. \nThe proposal stipulates that the Secretary should not approve \napplications that propose to trade under served markets within the \nperimeter for long-haul markets that are well served from the \nWashington region.\n\n  The legislation would not affect the cap on the number of hourly \noperations at Washington National. The number of flights at National \nwould not increase. Commercial aircraft operations at National Airport \nare limited to 37 takeoffs and landings per hour. This requirement \nstands independent of the perimeter rule. In addition, strict noise \nrestrictions currently in place at National Airport would not be \naffected, nor would Federal Aviation Administration requirements \nensuring that all aircraft flying into National, regardless of the time \nof day, meet the most stringent noise standards by the year 2000.\n  All exemption operations would be limited to stage 3 aircraft. The \nlegislation would require the DOT to certify periodically that noise, \nair traffic congestion, airport-related vehicular congestion, safety \nstandards, and adequate air service to communities within the perimeter \nhave not been degraded as a result of this exemption authority.\n  The fact is that changes in the perimeter rule to allow some measure \nof flights outside the distance limit may very well reduce noise at \nNational, as carriers replace older, short-hop aircraft with newer, \nlonger range aircraft that are quieter. The next generation of long-\nhaul Boeing 737 aircraft, for instance, will offer increased range \nalong with significantly less noise. In addition, a number of flight \ndeck improvements represent safety features not found in the older \naircraft.\n  As a means of derailing efforts to reform the perimeter rule, some \nhave impugned my motives, suggesting that my secret purpose is to \nconvenience my own travel between Washington and Arizona. I find this \ncharge wearisome and offensive. Even so, to allay these concerns, I \nhave pledged not to take a nonstop flight from Washington National to \nArizona should such an opportunity ever result from this legislation.\n  This bill would result in more competition, with more convenient \noptions and competitive air fares for travelers. It would not result in \neither increased noise or diminished safety. I believe that a service \ndiversity and safety will be enhanced, as they always are in a \ncompetitive regime. The incumbent carriers should not be afraid of \ncompetition, or fear that their passengers will be taken away. This \nlegislation would result in more competition and economical flights, \nwhich will allow more people to fly.\n  Most of my colleagues know that I would prefer to get rid of the \nperimeter rule, as well as slot restrictions, in a manner consistent \nwith safety. My efforts to do so over the past decade, however, have \nencountered extreme resistance. As a result, I have scaled back my \noriginal proposals significantly in an effort to address the concerns \nof airlines and others who will not let legislation of that magnitude \npass. In turn, I ask that the protectors of the status quo recognize my \nlegitimate concerns about competition, and fair access for all \ntravelers to airports that make up a national aviation system, paid for \nby all taxpayers. I must say that all I have heard thus far from my \nopponents is that there is no problem.\n\n  I do not assert that this bill represents a magical, painless \nsolution. I do assert emphatically, however, that it is modest in \nnature, and that it is open to debate as the Congress moves forward on \nthis and similar proposals. In the House of Representatives, Aviation \nSubcommittee Chairman Jimmy Duncan intends to introduce an aviation \ncompetition bill. Representative Duncan and I have worked together on a \nnumber of provisions, and will continue to do so as we proceed. I \ncommend him for his effort and foresight. I can say the same for Senate \nAviation Subcommittee Chairman Gorton, who has demonstrated exceptional \ninterest and leadership in this area.\n  In addition, I understand that several of my Commerce Committee \ncolleagues, including Senators Hollings and Ford, are working on their \nown competition proposals. I believe that all of this activity is a \nclear indication that there is a problem with respect to domestic \naviation competition. I look forward to working with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion on a solution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to give their \nfull attention and consideration to the Aviation Competition \nEnhancement Act of 1997 that Senator McCain has just introduced. I \nwould also recognize Senator McCain for his tireless efforts to address \nbarriers to competition in the airline industry, and to provide better \nair service for consumers. Senator McCain has devoted much time to \nconsideration of this issue.\n  Compettion is a hallmark of our Nation, and the benefits of \ncompetition are clear. Studies show time and again that competition \nimproves products and services, and reduces costs to consumers. When \npossible, the Congress should do whatever is reasonable to enhance \ncompetition.\n  Airline competition has proven beneficial. Since the airline industry \nwas deregulated, fares have fallen, and service options have increased \non average across all communities. The major carriers deserve credit \nfor responding well to competitive challenges. In addition, many of the \nbenefits of deregulation can be attributed to the entry of so called \nlow-fair airlines into the marketplace. The low-fare airlines have \nincreased competition, and have enabled more people to fly than ever \nbefore. Air traffic has grown as a result, and all predictions are that \nit will continue to grow steadily over the next several years..\n  Although competition exists, there are also barriers to airline \ncompetition. The bill that Senator McCain has introduced today would \nloosen some of the anticompetitive Federal restrictions on the Nation's \naviation system. These restrictions, such as slot controls and the \nperimeter rule at National Airport, inhibit competition. As a result, \nthe benefits of deregulation have been limited in certain communities.\n  I understand that changing the status quo by easing existing barriers \nis difficult. Airline businesses and services have evolved under these \nbarriers. Airlines, airports, communities, and consumers have all grown \naccustomed to these barriers. This should not prevent us, however, from \nexamining the adverse impacts of these barriers and exploring \nreasonable measures to remove them.\n  I would also note that Senator McCain's bill would require the \nDepartment of Transportation to respond to complaints of predatory \nbehavior on the part of major airlines within 90 days. There are \nnumerous industry practices that warrant close scrutiny. Take for \nexample computer reservation systems. Airline travelers usually buy \ntickets through travel agents, who almost always use a Computer \nReservation System to determine what airline fares are available, and \nto make bookings. Each of the Computer Reservation Systems operating in \nthe United States is entirely or predominately owned by one or more \nairlines or airline affiliates. This certainly gives these airlines and \naffiliates the ability to prejudice the competitive position of other \nairlines if not checked. Any airline that believes it is being \nsubjected to predatory behavior deserves a timely response from the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  Again, I would urge my colleagues to take time from their busy \nschedules to consider Senator McCain's bill, and to provide their \nthoughts and insights on this important matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1332. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to recognize \nand protect State efforts to improve environmental mitigation and \ncompliance\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\nthrough the promotion of voluntary environmental audits, including \nlimited protection from discovery and limited protection from \npenalties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n              the state environmental audit protection act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State \nEnvironmental Audit Protection Act. It is a bill that would improve \nenvironmental quality across this Nation by enlisting the voluntary aid \nof people to seek out environmental problems and to correct violations \nusing State environmental audit laws. This legislation would provide \nprotection for those States that have fully debated the issue and after \nthe debate, have chosen to enact aggressive and proactive environmental \naudit laws.\n  First, I would like to explain briefly what an audit law is and how \nit works. State legislatures have chosen to enact many different kinds \nof audit laws with varying levels of incentives. It is important to \nnote that audit laws are not all the same. This concept is apparently \nlost on those who try to mis-characterize every audit law in the most \nsinister and fearful terms. It is important that we recognize the \ndifference.\n  The purpose of audit laws are to provide incentives for regulated \nentities to search for and disclose environmental violations and to \nclean them up at their own expense. Entities cover all kinds of groups \nwith operations that may have an effect on the environment, such as \nbusinesses, schools, hospitals, towns, and counties. The incentives can \nrange from relief from penalties to protection of voluntarily gathered \ninformation. The incentives usually require full disclosure and due \ndiligence in correcting violations. When there is protection of \ninformation, some States simply agree not to inspect based on \ndisclosure of an audit, others go further by allowing that certain \ndocuments will not be used against the entity in enforcement actions.\n  It is important to keep in mind when considering protection of \ndocuments that audits are conducted in good faith. By definition, any \ninformation that is compiled is voluntary and as such is above and \nbeyond what is otherwise required by law. Following from that, any \ndisclosures are a net gain above traditional enforcement.\n  Consider for a moment, Mr. President, the decisions a small business \nfaces with regard to its environmental performance. Many small \nbusinesses are already required to monitor and report certain emissions \nand audit protections do not cover those reports. But consider a \nbusiness that is not on an inspection schedule and has no required \nemissions reporting. If that entity wants to review its performance \nunder environmental laws, it would have to conduct a study. It would \nhave to pay an auditor to come in and review its operations--that would \nbe voluntary. Without audit protection, that business would take on a \nbig risk--a risk big enough so that most small entities would never \nundertake a voluntary audit. The risk is that once they spend the money \nto review their activities, if they find a violation and report it, \nthey face both fines and cleanup expenses. Furthermore, if they don't \nreport it, they risk criminal activity by knowingly violating the law.\n  Faced with the liabilities, without an audit law, most people would \nnot voluntarily police themselves. The risks are too big. Folks choose \ninstead to just take their chances and wait for the inspectors. After \nall, inspectors only visit 2 percent of all regulated entities anyway. \nJust 2 percent, Mr. President.\n  How do we encourage the other 98 percent to really think about their \nenvironmental performance?\n  Audit laws recognize good-faith efforts to improve environmental \ncompliance. They encourage people to look for problems and know with \nassurance that they won't be penalized for their efforts.\n  Today, Mr. President, 24 States have enacted some form of audit law; \n16 more have legislation pending. These laws have been on the books for \nseveral years in some States and I would point out--you don't see the \nexamples of abuses that many claimed would occur during the State \nlegislative debates.\n  Wyoming is one of the States that has passed an audit law. I was the \nprime sponsor in that process during my time in the Wyoming State \nSenate. I studied examples and results from other States that had gone \nthrough the process. I worked closely with our State Department of \nEnvironmental Quality and with members of the regulated community. I \nworked with various resource and conservation groups in Wyoming and we \ncrafted a bill that provides very reasonable incentives for people to \nreview their operations and clean up the problems they find. We \nprovided no criminal immunity or criminal privilege. We deferred to \nFederal laws wherever conflicts existed. There was a consensus. The \nbill made it out of committee unanimously and then passed the House and \nthe Senate by more than a two-thirds majority.\n  We had a vigorous debate in Wyoming. In the end, after all the public \ndeliberation, we passed a reasonable bill. But it was a consensus of \nthe legislators elected by the people of Wyoming. When I got to \nWashington, several States were meeting with the EPA. The EPA was using \nthreats of overfiling and delayed approval of State enforcement \nprograms. Overfiling means the EPA could use a document done at extra \nexpense and exposure to a company in order to be sure there was no harm \nto the environment, only to find the EPA could use those documents as a \nroad map for levying fines. The EPA wanted us to change the Wyoming \nlaw--in spite of repeated assertions from our own State attorney \ngeneral that the law did not compromise our enforcement authority.\n  Wyoming's scenario is not unique. Working with other States where \nthis has happened has led me to offer this piece of legislation.\n  The strange thing I find is that the EPA touts the value of audits. \nThe concept has been trumpeted as part of their reinventing \nenvironmental regulation initiative and a final policy on audits was \nreleased in early 1996. Administrator Carol Browner called it, ``a \npolicy that provides real incentives for industry and others to \nvoluntarily identify and correct environmental violations.''\n  President Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union Address, stressed \nthe need for more common sense and fairness in our environmental \nregulations. He recognized the limitations of the command and control \napproach. He stated that ``Washington is not the source of all answers \nand that we should shift more decision-making authority from the \nFederal Government to States, tribes and local communities.''\n  Apparently the EPA feels the States are not ready to handle audits. \nApparently, Mr. President, State attorneys general are unable to verify \nwith certainty that audit laws are reasonable. In its own astonishing \nway--and in seeming contradiction to its own objectives--the EPA \nremains opposed to State efforts to reinvent command and control \nthrough the use of audits.\n  The problem with EPA's audit policy is that ordinary people do not \nwant to use it. Big business will agree to negotiate with the EPA. They \nwill enter into cooperative agreements and consent agreements because \nthey have entire departments of environmental litigators.\n  Small businesses don't have that. They don't trust the EPA. They see \nthe EPA Office of Compliance Assistance trying to help them out, while \nCriminal Enforcement across the hall is concocting ways to put them in \njail--and boy would those offices love to work together. The EPA has \nlittle accountability to folks at home. It is just too unpredictable. \nThat is why people need statutory protection before they will take on \nthe potential liability of audits.\n  I would like to take a minute to explain my approach to the issue. \nThe legislation I am introducing would provide a safe-harbor for State \nlaws that fit within certain limits. It would not give any authority to \nany State unless they go through the full legislative process, \nincluding all of the local discussion and debate that entails. That is \na critical part of this process and something we should recognize. The \nboundaries of the safe-harbor we create would describe what State laws \nmay provide:\n  Limited protection from discovery for audit information--but only \ninformation that is not required to be gathered. All legal reporting \nrequirements\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\nand permitting disclosures remain in effect and could not be covered by \nan audit privilege.\n  A State audit law may provide limited protection from penalties if \nviolations are promptly disclosed and cleaned up. Note, the protection \nwill not cover criminal actions, and the law must preserve the ability \nof regulators to halt activities that pose imminent danger to public \nhealth.\n\n  Third, if a State law falls within the safe-harbor, the EPA would be \nprohibited from withholding State enforcement authority or overfiling \nagainst individuals simply because of the State's audit law.\n  Last, the bill would require an annual State performance report that \nwill help measure the success of different laws, so we can see what \nworks and what doesn't.\n  I want to point out that this legislation will not dilute \nenforcement. There are safeguards to ensure that State audit laws \nalways act to supplement--not to supplant--existing enforcement. It is \nimportant to note that. Audits are an affirmative tool. Used properly, \nthey can only be used to improve environmental conditions above the \nstatus quo. They do not protect any entity from regular inspection or \nmonitoring.\n  The principle of audit incentives is simple and reasonable. It is no \nsurprise to me that nearly half of our States have chosen to enact some \nform of audit legislation. It is a positive tool that helps people \nunderstand and comply with environmental laws. It gives people a chance \nto ask questions without being penalized. It gives them the chance to \nfigure out what they are doing wrong and fix it--without adding steep \npenalties to the cost of compliance. This bill will put into law \nmethods that have been tested and work.\n  Mr. President, small business owners don't take time to read the \nlayer after layer of byzantine regulations constructed by Washington \nlawyers. I know because my wife and I were small business owners for 26 \nyears. In a small business, the owner is the same one who counts the \nchange, helps the customers and vacuums the floor.\n  He or she has to stay in business, make payroll, and keep up with \nconstantly evolving mandates from a never-ending supply of Federal \nattorneys. And while the small business owner has many jobs, these \nattorneys have only one job, to create and modify mandates and to \ninvestigate citizens. There are over 17,000 employees at the EPA and \nnow, in spite of the rhetoric about reinventing regulations, they want \nfunds for another 200 enforcement police.\n  We don't need more police to improve environmental compliance--we \nneed translators to interpret the regulations.\n  But the fact is, the heavy-handed, command and control approach works \nwell for the EPA--especially in Washington. Here I am beginning to see \nthe process by which they protect and expand their regulatory \nsupremacy. It is an artful combination of nebulous policies, and self-\ndefining authority. Taken from this perspective, the EPA clearly views \nany State audit laws as a direct assault on its unbridled jurisdiction \nand power.\n  Shortly after promoting its own audit policy as a reinvention of \nregulation, the EPA was quick to remind that State audit laws ``would \ncause environmental programs delegated to states * * * to revert to \nnational control at EPA.'' Since then, they have used their leverage to \ncompel States to modify laws in accordance with the will of EPA \nguidelines.\n  This absolute circumvention of the democratic process is astonishing \nto me. As a former State legislator, I think it is a tragedy that the \nEPA is denying States the chance to test reasonable and innovative \nsolutions to a cleaner environment. Instead of promoting reinvention, \nthe EPA is perpetuating an environmental race to mediocrity.\n  Some of the people listening may wonder how Wyoming's audit law has \nfared. Well, Mr. President, I am proud to report that after repeated \ndelays from the EPA on our title 5 clean air permits, and after threats \nto withdraw delegation of other programs--the EPA has finally decided \nthat statutory changes may not be necessary in Wyoming's law, even \nthough there remain problems to be worked out.\n  At least, Mr. President, that's what they tell us today. They just \nmight change their minds tomorrow. It is no wonder that Wyomingites are \nafraid to use our State audit law.\n  I feel it is time we put this issue to rest by defining a ``safe-\nharbor'' and giving State laws the certainty they need to be effective. \nI would encourage Members to take a look at this bill and to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of \n1965 to allow national park units that cannot charge an entrance or \nadmission fee to retain other fees and charges; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     the land and water conservation fund act amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure which \nwill help preserve one of our greatest national treasures and maintain \none of the most significant contributors to the economy of east \nTennessee. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is by far our \nNation's most visited national park, both because of its striking \nbeauty, wildlife, and recreational opportunities, and for the fact that \nit is within a day's drive of half of the population of the United \nStates.\n  I have often escaped to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for \nhiking, camping, and enjoying the great outdoors with my three sons. I \nhave witnessed the splendor of the turning leaves in the fall, and the \nglory and renewal that springtime brings to the Smokies. Spending time \nin the Smokies allows my family and millions of other families to \nreconnect with nature and to refocus on the fundamental strengths of \nwhat really holds us together as a family.\n  While the Great Smoky Mountains National Park plays such a valuable \nrole in the lives of so many American families, it is also a park that \nstrains under the burdens of heavy use. Infrastructure and services \nstruggle to meet demands which the larger and less-visited parks can \nmore easily attain. To compound the problems associated with heavy use \nand popularity, the park is prohibited from collecting an entrance fee \nof any kind. It is the only national park with such a prohibition, thus \nlimiting its access to valuable, internally generated resources which \nsupplement the budgets of other parks. The result is that the Smokies \nhas great difficulty in meeting the infrastructure and maintenance \nneeds generated by its 9 million yearly visitors.\n  In the 104th Congress we began a program which allowed individual \nparks to keep for their internal use up to 80 percent of the user fees \ncollected above and beyond the level of fees collected in 1994. My bill \nwill allow the park to retain 100 percent of that amount. While this \nchange is modest, it is one way to begin to address the deficit in \nwhich the Smokies operates every year, and assist in sustaining the \nvery attractions which serve to make it our most popular national park.\n  In 1910, Teddy Roosevelt said, ``A nation behaves well if it treats \nits natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next \ngeneration increased, and not impaired, in value.'' Roosevelt was the \nfirst proponent of what has clearly become a fundamental tenet of the \npreservation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Mr. President, \nwe owe it to the future generations of Americans to allow this \ninvaluable national treasure to benefit from its own popularity and \naccessibility and to keep more of the revenues from its fees. We can \nthus help ensure that it will continue to offer the services and \nfacilities so many millions of families enjoy and will help guard one \nof our Nation's most precious legacies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Warner, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1334. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to establish a \ndemonstration project to evaluate the feasibility of using the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits program to ensure the availablity of adequate \nhealth care for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries under the military \nhealth care system; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n         FEHBP DEMONSTRATION FOR MILITARY RETIREES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure on \nbehalf of myself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Warner, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Collins, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, and Mrs. Feinstein.\n  This vital, bipartisan legislation would establish a demonstration \nproject to evaluate the feasibility of using the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program [FEHBP] to ensure the availability of adequate \nhealth care for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries under the military \nhealth care system.\n  Current trends, such as base closures, the downsizing of military \ntreatment facilities, and the introduction of TRICARE, have all \nhindered access to health care services for military retirees aged 65 \nand over. In theory, Medicare-eligible retirees can receive health care \nservices at military treatment facilities on a space available basis; \nhowever, active duty and their dependents have priority.\n  Therefore, in reality, space is rarely available--resulting in \nmilitary retirees being locked out of the Department of Defense's [DOD] \nhealth care delivery system. And because of their considered secondary \nstatus, many retirees are forced to travel great distances to receive \neven the minimum of care.\n  Further, when compared to what other Federal and private sector \nretirees receive in terms of health care options, it is easy to note \nthat the current health care choices for military retirees are woefully \ninadequate and downright inexcusable.\n  This measure will rectify the inequity of the current system and take \nthe guesswork out of the financial viability of an FEHBP option for \nmilitary retirees.\n  Scheduled for no more than 3 years, the FEHBP pilot program would be \ntested at two different sites. One site will be within a military \ntreatment facility catchment area and the other in a noncatchment area. \nUp to 50,000 Medicare-eligible military retirees will be able to \nparticipate in the demonstration, with each site capped at 25,000 \nretirees.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents an active step toward \nhonoring our Nation's obligation to those military retirees who \nfaithfully and selflessly served our country in times of war and in \ntimes of peace. Furthermore, this measure will provide retirees more \ndependable, consistent, and affordable care while simultaneously \napplying equitable standards of health care for all Federal retirees.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bipartisan piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, according to the latest statistics, \nAlabama is home to 47,011 military retirees. We have the eight largest \npopulation of retired service personnel in the Nation. Senator Bond \nhighlighted the many changes in DOD's health care system that are \nlimiting access to health care for military retirees aged 65 and above. \nI would like to briefly explain how these general trends are affecting \nthe 47,011 military retirees in my State.\n  The 1995 BRAC slated Fort McClellan for closure by 1999. When that \nbase closes, Noble Army Hospital will be forced to close as well. The \nemergency room at Lyster Army Hospital at Fort\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\nRucker is being closed. At all of the military treatment facilities, \nspace-available is becoming unavailable. In addition to these physical \nchanges, TRICARE came on line in region 4, and Alabama now is \nexperiencing excessive delays in receiving reimbursement payments and \nother well-known problems associated with TRICARE. Many private \nphysicians who provided CAMPUS are leaving the DOD health care, which I \nbelieve is unacceptable and irresponsible.\n  Despite extended service and sacrifice, retired service members are \nthe only Federal employees who will lose their government-sponsored \nhealth insurance when they become eligible for Medicare. This bill \ntakes a modest step forward to insuring that military retirees receive \nat least as much as Members of Congress or retired Federal employees. \nMilitary retirees have dedicated their lives to protecting our Nation; \nwe owe it to them to pave the way for health care equity.\n  I thank Senator Bond for his leadership in introducing this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1335. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to ensure that \ncoverage of bone mass measurements is provided under the health \nbenefits program for Federal employees; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                THE HEALTH BENEFITS STANDARDIZATION ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesignated to standardize coverage for bone mass measurement for people \nat risk for osteoporosis under the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram. This legislation is similar to my bill which was enacted as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act to standardize coverage of bone mass \nmeasurement under Medicare. The bill I introduce today guarantees the \nsame uniformity of coverage to Federal employees and retirees as \nCongress provided to Medicare beneficiaries only a few months ago.\n  Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million \nAmericans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone \nmass; 80 percent of its victims are women. The disease causes 1.5 \nmillion fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 million per \nday--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in two women \nand one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone due to \nosteoporosis. A woman's risk of a hip fracture is equal to her combined \nrisk of contracting breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer.\n  Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could \nbe avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. We now \nhave drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent. However, \nidentification of risk factors alone cannot predict how much bone a \nperson has and how strong bone is. Experts estimate that without bone \ndensity tests, up to 40 percent of women with low bone mass could be \nmissed.\n  Unfortunately, Federal Employee Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] \ncoverage of bone density tests is inconsistent. Instead of a \ncomprehensive national coverage policy, FEHBP leaves it to each of the \nover 400 participating plans to decide who is eligible to receive a \nbone mass measurement and what constitutes medical necessity. A survey \nof the 19 top plans participating in FEHBP indicated that many plans \nhave no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests on a \ncase-by-case basis. Several plans refuse to provide consumers with \ninformation indicating when the plan covers the test and when it does \nnot. Some plans cover the test only for people who already have \nosteoporosis.\n  Mr. President, we owe the people who serve our Government more than \nthat. That is why my legislation standardizes coverage for bone mass \nmeasurement under the FEHBP. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation, in order to help prevent the 1.5 million fractures caused \nannually by osteoporosis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1336.

A bill entitled the ``Telephone Consumer Fraud Protection \nAct of 1997.''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the telephone consumer fraud protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Telephone \nConsumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act of 1997. This measure will \nfinally allow us to strike back against ``slamming,'' the practice of \nchanging a telephone customer's long-distance carrier without the \ncustomer's knowledge or consent.\n  Slamming is the Federal Communications Commission's largest source of \nconsumer complaints. In 1995 and 1996, more than one-third of the \nconsumer complaints filed with the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau involved \nslamming. Last year 16,000 long-distance telephone consumers filed \nslamming complaints with the FCC. Since 1994, the number of slamming \ncomplaints has tripled. Yet, this is only the tip of the iceberg-- the \nLos Angeles Times reports that more than 1 million American telephone \nconsumers have been slammed in the last 2 years.\n  In my home State of Illinois slamming was the No. 1 source of \nconsumer complaints to the attorney general's office in 1995, and the \nNo. 2 source of complaints in 1996. Slamming is obviously a serious \nproblem that must be stopped.\n  Slamming is not merely an inconvenience or a nuisance. It is an act \nof fraud that costs long-distance telephone consumers millions of \ndollars a year and robs them of the right to contract. The Telephone \nConsumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act will now ensure that slammers are \nheld accountable for their fraudulent acts.\n  My measure will help stamp out slamming in two ways:\n  First, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act creates \ncriminal fines and jail time for repeat and willful slammers. Slamming \ntakes choices away from consumers without their knowledge and distorts \nthe long distance competitive market by rewarding companies that engage \nin fraud and misleading marketing practices. This measure's criminal \npenalties will guarantee that slammers can no longer act with impunity.\n  Second, the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act charges \nthe Attorney General with the duty of conducting a study on the \nfraudulent and criminal behavior of telecommunications carriers and \ntheir agents in the\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\nsolicitation, marketing, and assignment of telecommunication services. \nThe Attorney General's study will examine the fraudulent methods by \nwhich a telecommunications consumer's local, long distance, and other \ntelecommunications services are changed without the consumers knowledge \nor consent. Through this study, Congress will gain a better \nunderstanding of how slammers operate. With this knowledge we will be \nable to draft a well crafted, all encompassing law that will finally \nput a lid on slamming.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this \nimportant initiative. I hope my colleagues will join with me and \nsupport the Telephone Consumer Fraud Criminal Penalties Act in order to \nprotect the rights of telephone consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for mitigation of terrestrial wildlife \nhabitat lost as a result of the construction and operation of the Pick-\nSloan Missouri River Basin program in the State of South Dakota, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nThe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and the State \n  of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Mitigation Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of the South Dakota \ncongressional delegation and Gov. Bill Janklow, I am today introducing \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and the State \nof South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Mitigation Act. This \nproposal, which is the culmination of more than 2 years of discussion \nwith Governor Janklow and his staff, South Dakota tribal leaders, \nrepresentatives of South Dakota sportsmen groups and affected citizens, \nlays out a plan for resolving some of the environmental and \njurisdictional problems created by the construction of the main stem \ndams nearly 40 years ago.\n  Land transfers and their attendant jurisdictional implications are \nserious issues with real world ramifications, and it has been the \nGovernor's and my goal throughout this process to achieve consensus on \nhow to proceed. The introduction of this legislation is one more step \non the path to that consensus. I would like to take this opportunity to \noutline the bill, explain how we got to this point and suggest where we \nmight go from here.\n  More than a half century ago, Congress set in motion a series of \nevents that resulted in an extraordinary loss of land and wildlife \nhabitat by the State of South Dakota, tribes, and individual landowners \nalong the Missouri River. This loss of land and the accompanying \nfractionation of jurisdiction has fueled extensive and costly \nlitigation over the regulation of hunting and fishing along the river. \nMoreover, the Federal Government has never mitigated the impact of the \ndams on critical wildlife habitat, as it is required to do by the 1958 \nFish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday is an attempt to settle those issues without further litigation, \nto provide a means to fairly compensate the State of South Dakota and \nthe tribes for the loss of habitat, and to expand public hunting \nopportunities for sportsmen.\n  This bill would not have been possible without the efforts of many \nSouth Dakotans. Governor Janklow and I have worked closely together for \nover 2 years to craft this compromise. Many tribal leaders in the State \nhave provided constructive input throughout this process. In \nparticular, I would like to acknowledge Chairman Michael Jandreau of \nthe Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and Chairman Gregg Bourland of the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe for their wise advice, friendship and guidance.\n  Senator Johnson and Congressman  Thune have approached this often \ncontentious project with open minds. It is significant that Senator \nJohnson is a cosponsor of this bill and that Representative Thune will \nintroduce a companion measure in the House of Representatives.\n  I would also like to thank John Cooper, the secretary of the South \nDakota Game, Fish, and Parks Department, for the enormous amount of \ntime he spent holding public meetings and diligently working with all \ninterested parties to sketch out the broad contours of this compromise \nas well as to craft the small details. His patience and imagination \nhave been critical to the successful development of this legislation.\n  Finally, our draft proposal was discussed with representatives of the \nUnited Sportsmen and South Dakota Wildlife Federation. Both groups made \nconstructive comments about the draft, and I appreciate their \nendorsement of the bill we are introducing today.\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and the \nState of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Mitigation Act \nestablishes trust funds to compensate the State and the tribes for the \nterrestrial wildlife habitat that was lost due to construction of the \nmainstem Missouri River dams. It transfers to the Interior Department \nto be held in trust for the tribes the lands that were acquired for the \nPick-Sloan project and that remain above the exclusive flood pool. The \ntribes will be able to regulate hunting and fishing on those lands for \nall who wish to use them, as long as they accept the conditions of the \nbill, which include protecting the ability of the heirs and assignees \nof Indian and non-Indian ranchers who lost land to the construction of \nthe dams to graze on those lands and reaching agreement with the State \non rules governing fishing on the Missouri River within reservation \nboundaries. Unless otherwise agreed to by the tribes and the State, \nrecreation areas currently operated by the corps within the boundaries \nof the Indian reservations will be transferred into trust for those \ntribes to manage, while recreation areas located outside of the \nboundaries of Indian reservations will be leased to the State.\n  Since there is insufficient Federal project land in South Dakota on \nwhich to perform the necessary wildlife habitat mitigation, this \nlegislation would authorize the tribes and the State to spend revenues \nfrom the trust funds on other projects related to wildlife conservation \nand public access to habitat throughout the State. The result should be \nexpanded opportunity for South Dakota hunters.\n  Through the trust funds, the tribes and State will have a steady \nsource of funding with which to implement formal wildlife habitat \nmitigation plans.\n  To supplement those plans, the tribes and State will be able to use \nrevenues from the trust funds to implement plans developed in \nconsultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lease private \nlands for the protection of\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\nimportant habitat, including habitat for threatened and endangered \nspecies. Private landowners who participate in this program will be \nrequired to provide public access for sportsmen during hunting season. \nThe South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department estimates that over \n200,000 acres of private land will be enrolled in this program, \nsignificantly expanding public hunting opportunities for sportsmen \nthroughout the State.\n  The tribes and the State will be able to use proceeds from the trust \nfunds to operate the recreation areas.\n  The tribes and the State will be able to use the funds to develop, \nmaintain and protect wildlife habitat and recreation areas along the \nMissouri River.\n  And, the tribes will be able to use revenues from the fund to protect \nnative American cultural sites threatened by the operation of the Pick-\nSloan project.\n  To understand the approach taken by this legislation, it is necessary \nto understand the events that were prologue to its development. In \nresponse to a series of major floods along the upper Missouri River in \nthe early part of this century, Congress enacted the Flood Control Act \nof 1944, which called for implementation of a plan developed by General \nPick of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and William Sloan of the \nBureau of Reclamation, known as the Pick-Sloan plan, to establish a \nseries of dams along the river. By authorizing the construction of \nthese massive earthen dams, this law played a critical role in shaping \nthe future development of the State and of the downstream States that \nbenefited from meaningful flood control.\n  By hosting these dams, South Dakota has provided valuable storage of \nwater in the region, preventing flooding, and allowing development \nalong the river in downstream States all the way to the Mississippi \nRiver. The sacrifices South Dakota made for this purpose, however, can \nbe counted in the loss of roughly a quarter of a million acres of the \nmost productive, unique, and irreplaceable cottonwood forests and river \nbottomland in the upper Great Plains.\n  Land that once provided habitat and critical wintering cover for \nnearly 400 species of wildlife is now submerged. The remains of those \ncottonwood forests can be seen today from the banks of the mainstem \nreservoirs, their dead tops sticking out of the water reminding all of \nus what was once such an integral element of the upper Great Plains \necosystem. The effects of that loss also can be felt today. Last \nwinter, South Dakota suffered through some of the most severe weather \nin recent memory. Wildlife throughout the State, unable to find \nsufficient cover, froze to death in vast numbers.\n  At the time the Pick-Sloan project was being constructed, Congress \npassed the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958. That law \nofficially recognized the severe loss of wildlife habitat that could \naccompany the construction of water projects and, as a result, required \nthe Federal construction agency--in this case the Corps of Engineers--\nto consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State \nwildlife agency for the purposes of determining the possible damage to \nwildlife resources and for the purposes of determining means and \nmeasures that should be adopted to prevent the loss of or damage to \nsuch wildlife resources, as well as to provide concurrently for the \ndevelopment and improvement of such resources. This requirement applied \nto any Federal project not yet 60 percent complete at the time of \nenactment. In South Dakota, this meant the Oahe and Big Bend dams. \nDespite the requirements of the 1958 Fish and Wildlife Coordination \nAct, the Federal Government has never adequately mitigated the loss of \nhabitat that accompanied those projects.\n  It may be impossible to completely recreate the unique habitat that \nonce existed along the Missouri River. However, the Federal Government \ndoes bear the responsibility to the State and tribes of South Dakota to \ndo whatever it can to mitigate that loss. Between 1960 and 1982, the \ncorps developed seven major plans to mitigate the lost wildlife \nhabitat. However, since each of those plans proposed the politically \nunpopular fee title acquisition of land and since the corps did not \nforward any of these plans to Congress for authorization, none was ever \nimplemented.\n  In 1982, the Corps of Engineers developed a new plan, known as the \nPost-Authorization Mitigation Report for Fish and Wildlife Mitigation, \nLake Oahe and Sharpe, SD. This plan, which called for mitigating only a \nfraction of the habitat that was lost, was unique in that it did not \nrely on acquisition of land in fee title, but rather made existing \nproject lands available for mitigation work. An unsteady history of \nimplementation of the 1982 plan began in 1989. In 1990, funding was cut \noff and then eventually restored. The corps again terminated funding \nfor the project in 1995, only to restore it in the face of delegation \nopposition.\n  It has become clear that wildlife habitat mitigation for Lakes Oahe \nand Sharpe are not high priorities for the Corps of Engineers. While I \nrecognize that this is attributable in some measure to the levels of \nfunding provided that agency by Congress, that does not excuse the \nFederal Government of its responsibility to mitigate the lost habitat.\n  Another important feature of the legislation being introduced today \ndeals with the management of the Corps of Engineers' recreation areas \nin the State. In partial compensation for South Dakota's sacrifice of \nprime lands to the construction of the dams, Congress had intended that \nconsiderable irrigation development would occur along the Missouri \nRiver. While irrigation development has fallen far short of \nexpectations, today roughly 5.1 million residents and nonresidents \nbenefit by using the reservoirs for camping, fishing, boating, hunting, \nand general recreation.\n  Despite the use that these reservoirs enjoy, there is serious concern \nover the corp's ability to continue to maintain its extensive network \nof recreation areas along the river. Adjusted for inflation, the corps' \nbudget for this purpose has shrunk by 30 percent since 1993. Prospects \nfor reversing this trend are poor, making the challenge of funding both \nwildlife habitat mitigation and recreation area maintenance more and \nmore daunting in the future.\n  That is why this legislation would transfer those recreation areas to \nthe tribes and the State and why the trust funds would be used to \nprovide a predictable source of funding to meet the needs of the 5.1 \nmillion people who use those facilities.\n  There is solid precedent for the establishment of dedicated trust \nfunds to compensate the tribes and the State for losses suffered as a \nresult of these projects. In 1992 Congress enacted the Standing Rock \nand Three Affiliated Tribes Infrastructure Compensation Act, \nestablishing a trust fund to compensate the tribes for infrastructure \nlosses suffered as a result of construction of the dams. That trust \nfund was capitalized with funding equal to 25 percent of the annual \nrevenues to the Western Area Power Administration from sales of \nhydropower generated by the mainstem dams of the Missouri River. In \n1996, Congress unanimously passed the Crow Creek Infrastructure \nCompensation Act, establishing a similar fund, and I expect Congress to \npass a similar bill for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe in the near future.\n  In short, Congress has recognized the appropriateness of linking \nlegitimate compensation for losses resulting from the construction of \nthe dams to the power revenues those dams generate. The legislation I \nam introducing today adopts that same principle.\n  As I mentioned, the development of this legislation has involved \nextensive discussion and negotiation among many interested parties \nthroughout the State. The bill has undergone five drafts over the \ncourse of nearly 10 months. A number of public meetings have been held \nto discuss the bill, and Governor Janklow and I have received, \nconsidered, and responded to, comments and suggestions from interested \nmembers of the public.\n  The tribes expressed a strong desire to protect their jurisdiction \nover the hunting and fishing of tribal members. The legislation adopts \na cooperative\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\nState-tribal enforcement system based on a previous Memorandum of \nAgreement reached between the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the South \nDakota Game, Fish, and Parks Department--a system that respects and \nprotects tribal sovereignty. To transfer the land to trust status and \nto keep the land in trust, the tribes would implement an enforcement \nsystem whereby both the State and the tribes would be able to arrest \nviolators of fish and game rules on the waters of the Missouri River \nwithin Indian reservation boundaries, with tribal members prosecuted in \ntribal or Federal court and non-Indians prosecuted in State or Federal \ncourt. This protects tribal jurisdiction over tribal members and should \nmaximize the effectiveness of fish and game enforcement efforts along \nthe river. Also, under the bill, participating tribes will be able to \nestablish seasons and bag limits for hunting on the lands that will be \ntransferred into trust and to enforce those rules against all those who \nwill hunt on those lands--an opportunity they are denied currently.\n  In response to concerns expressed by the tribes about the effect of \nthe bill on treaty rights and water rights, language has been included \nin the bill stating that both treaty rights and water rights will be \nprotected.\n  A number of counties expressed concern that they would lose their 75-\npercent share of revenues from leases the corps currently holds on the \ntransferred lands. Under the bill, the Department of the Interior will \nbe responsible for maintaining those leases. To ensure that the \ncounties are not penalized by the transfer of the land to trust status \nthe bill directs the Department of the Interior to pay the affected \ncounties 100 percent of the revenues from leases on the lands.\n  Sportsmen commented that the State should obtain new lands to \nmitigate the loss of wildlife habitat. The bill transfers the 20,000 \nacre Bureau of Reclamation's Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal lands to \nthe State for that purpose. Since the land will be transferred in fee \ntitle, the State will pay the county taxes on that land.\n  Non-Indian ranchers and Indian allottees who lost land or whose \nancestors lost land to the construction of the dams, urged that the \nbill clarify that heirs or assignees be granted the right to graze on \nthe lands taken from them or their ancestors, that access easements be \nguaranteed, and that any tribe or agency requiring fencing be \nresponsible for installing and maintaining it. This legislation \nsafeguards that grazing opportunity.\n  Those with easements and rights-of-way on land that would be \ntransferred to the Interior Department, such as the electric utilities, \nasked that language be added to protect those easements and rights-of-\nway. Broad language has been added to preserve existing easements on \nany lands transferred to the Interior Department to be held in trust \nfor the tribes and on any recreation areas leased to the State.\n  The Corps of Engineers needs to ensure that it retain its ability to \noperate the reservoirs. The bill protects its ability to do so.\n  Despite these modifications, not every concern or comment could be \naddressed. Some South Dakota tribes that do not border the river have \nexpressed frustration that they were not included in this legislation. \nIt has been our intention from the beginning of this process to include \nall eligible tribes in this legislation. Since the 1958 Fish and \nWildlife Coordination Act calls for the Federal Government to mitigate \nthe loss of habitat that occurred due to construction of the Oahe and \nBig Bend dams, all the tribes that lost habitat due to the construction \nof those projects qualify for mitigation under Federal law and have \nbeen invited to participate in this bill.\n  Two eligible tribes--the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Crow Creek \nSioux Tribe--have decided not to be part of this arrangement at this \npoint. I respect their decisions, and they are not included in the \nlegislation.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the State of South Dakota, the Federal \nGovernment, the tribes, the wildlife and all who use these reservoirs \nfor hunting, fishing, and recreation will benefit from this bill. It \nprovides for a fair resolution to the environmental and jurisdictional \nproblems created by the construction of the main stem dams nearly 40 \nyears ago.\n  I am hopeful that the appropriate congressional committees will \nschedule action on this legislation as soon as possible so that further \ntestimony can be heard and necessary refinements can be made. Our goal \nis to enact a bill that will allow meaningful wildlife habitat \nmitigation to begin, resolve the regulatory issues relating to hunting \nand fishing along the Missouri River, provide the public with well-\nmaintained recreation areas along the Missouri River and expand hunting \nopportunities long into the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Big Bend and Oahe projects are major components of \n     the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program that contribute \n     to the national economy by generating a substantial amount of \n     hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of water to \n     provide flood control and other benefits for all States and \n     tribes in the Missouri River Basin;\n       (3) to carry out the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin \n     program, the Secretary of the Army acquired approximately \n     500,000 acres of land from the State of South Dakota, 4 \n     Indian tribes, and private individuals;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, of the acreage \n     referred to in paragraph (3), approximately 200,000 acres \n     remain at an elevation above that of the top of the exclusive \n     flood pool of the projects of the program;\n       (5) of the approximately 200,000 acres of dry land referred \n     to in paragraph (4), approximately 80,000 acres are located \n     within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River \n     Reservation, Crow Creek Reservation, Lower Brule Reservation, \n     and Standing Rock Reservation;\n       (6) as a result of the inundation from the construction of \n     the Big Bend and Oahe projects, the State of South Dakota and \n     the 4 Indian reservations referred to in paragraph (5) lost \n     approximately 250,000 acres of fertile, wooded bottom land \n     along the Missouri River;\n       (7) the lost acreage constituted some of the most \n     productive, unique, and irreplaceable acres of wildlife \n     habitat in the State of South Dakota, including habitat for \n     game and nongame species (including species that are listed \n     as endangered or threatened species under Federal or State \n     law);\n       (8) the Federal Government has never applied the Fish and \n     Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.) in such a \n     manner as to adequately mitigate the loss of habitat in the \n     State of South Dakota and on affected Indian reservations \n     within the State;\n       (9) an insufficient quantity of Federal land within the \n     boundaries of projects of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin \n     program is available in the State of South Dakota to provide \n     adequate mitigation of the loss of habitat;\n       (10) because of complicated land ownership patterns along \n     the Missouri River, there have been many jurisdictional \n     disputes over the control of the land along the river, \n     including disputes concerning--\n       (A) the jurisdiction of tribal or State courts over hunting \n     and fishing activities--\n       (i) on land of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program \n     projects located within an Indian reservation; or\n       (ii) on the Missouri River;\n       (B) the establishment and enforcement of hunting and \n     fishing seasons and limits; and\n       (C) hunting and fishing license requirements;\n       (11) the jurisdictional disputes referred to in paragraph \n     (10)--\n       (A) have been, and continue to be, adjudicated in Federal \n     courts; and\n       (B) have resulted in great costs to the Federal Government, \n     the State of South Dakota, and the Indian tribes;\n       (12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, policies of \n     the Army Corps of Engineers encourage the leasing of public \n     recreation facilities to, and the management of certain land \n     by, State and local sponsors, if feasible;\n       (13) the State of South Dakota has demonstrated its ability \n     to manage public recreation areas and wildlife resources \n     along the Missouri River;\n       (14) the Indian tribes have demonstrated an ability to \n     manage wildlife resources on land located within the \n     respective reservations of those Indian tribes;\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\n       (15) the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over \n     certain land acquired for the purposes of the Pick-Sloan \n     Missouri River Basin program from the Secretary of the Army \n     to the Secretary of the Interior is in the best interest of \n     the United States, the State of South Dakota, and the Indian \n     tribes; and\n       (16) the Federal Government has a trust relationship and a \n     fiduciary responsibility to Indian tribes.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to mitigate the loss of terrestrial wildlife habitat \n     that occurred as a result of construction projects carried \n     out under the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program;\n       (2) to settle longstanding jurisdictional disputes over \n     land and water within the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin \n     program projects;\n       (3) to protect, and provide public access to, the remaining \n     wildlife habitat in the State of South Dakota; and\n       (4) to transfer to the Department of the Interior to be \n     held in trust for the Indian tribes of South Dakota land \n     acquired for the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program \n     within existing exterior reservation boundaries, without \n     altering any boundary of a reservation of an Indian tribe \n     established by a treaty with the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease access to quality health care in frontier communities by \nallowing health clinics and health centers greater Medicare flexibility \nand reimbursement; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       THE MEDICARE FRONTIER HEALTH CLINIC AND CENTER ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nFrontier Health Clinic and Center Act of 1997. I am pleased that the \njunior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas is cosponsoring this bill.\n  Our bill clarifies the intent of Congress to allow health clinics to \nparticipate in the new Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program.\n  Mr. President, great advances in health care have occurred during the \npast decades, however, some communities in remote areas continue to \nstruggle to provide primary care services. These communities face \nunparalleled geographic, climatic and economic barriers to quality \nhealth care. They simply do not have the resources, surface \ntransportation nor the demand to provide full service inpatient and \noutpatient care--yet the community might be located hours from an acute \ncare hospital in an urban center.\n  The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 addresses part of this dilemma. It exempts many \nrural hospitals from burdensome Medicare regulations designed for large \nurban hospitals and does not straight jacket them under the prospective \npayment system. This limited-service model has already helped to reduce \nunnecessary overhead and prevent cost shifting in eight States.\n  The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Act means that extremely \nrural communities will finally be able to provide more complete health \ncare to the elderly. However, Mr. President, this important Medicare \nprovision needs legislative clarification. The Medicare Rural Hospital \nFlexibility Program addresses part of the dilemma faced by communities \nlocated in remote areas, but misses a piece of the health care puzzle \nfor our frontier communities--health clinics.\n  Frontier communities face conditions even more extreme than rural \ncommunities. For example, the communities on the Fox Islands in Alaska \nare 400 miles from the nearest limited-service hospital and 650 miles \nfrom the nearest major, acute care hospital. There are no hospitals or \neven limited-service hospitals on the Fox Islands--just health clinics.\n  This legislation will enable clinics in frontier communities such as \nthe Fox Islands to participate in the program. A frontier area is \ndefined in the bill as borough with six or fewer people per square \nmile. Additionally, to ensure this extension goes to frontier \ncommunities who are truly in need, participating clinics must be \nlocated in health professional shortage areas, and be more than a 50-\nmile drive from another facility.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act of \n1997 is the answer for ensuring health care for our elderly who live in \nextremely rural and frontier areas. Demonstrations conducted by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration have already proven the cost \neffectiveness of limited-service facilities.\n  I would also point out that yesterday, the National Rural Health \nAssociation [NRHA], in a letter to Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the nominee \nto be Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, \nendorsed the concept of allowing rural clinics to participate in this \nprogram.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the health care needs of frontier \ncommunities and adopt this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1343. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the excise tax rate on tobacco products and deposit the \nresulting revenues into a Public Health and Education Resource Trust \nFund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the public health and education resource act [phaer]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last spring, various State attorneys \ngeneral announced that they had reached a global agreement to settle \nongoing State lawsuits against the tobacco industry in exchange for \ncertain concessions by the industry aimed at reducing teen smoking. \nThis truly historic agreement followed a persistent effort by President \nClinton to empower the Food and Drug Administration to regulate \nnicotine and develop strategies to stop the addiction of our children \nto this deadly drug. President Clinton is the first President in our \nNation's history to take on the tobacco industry on behalf of the \nAmerican people and he deserves enormous credit for his bold and \nrelentless leadership on this issue.\n  Since the announcement of the global tobacco settlement, President \nClinton, his health advisers, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, \nformer Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, our leading public health \ngroups, and many of us in the Congress have reviewed the proposed \nsettlement. While the attorneys general pushed the industry as hard as \nthey could, they had to make significant compromises along the way to \nkeep the industry at the bargaining table. An examination of their deal \nwith the industry reflects the limits under which they were operating \nand shows that the settlement is flawed in many respects.\n  The Congress, Mr. President, is in an entirely different position \nvis-a-vis the tobacco industry. The Congress has no need to make the \nkinds of concessions to the industry that the attorneys general did. \nThe Congress does not need permission from the industry to take steps \nto reduce teen smoking and put an end to hundreds of thousands of \npreventable deaths each year. We don't have to settle. Our job is to \ndevelop legislation in the public interest and promote the public \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, virtually no one in the Congress today supports the \nsettlement proposed by the industry and the attorneys general. The \nsettlement is dead. It is gone with Joe Camel. After extensive review, \nPresident Clinton recommended to the Congress that we enact \ncomprehensive tobacco control legislation, and focus on the public \nhealth--not the tobacco industry's interests.\n  Mr. President, I share President Clinton's deep reservation about the \nsettlement as a framework for this legislation. Instead, I would like \nto propose an alternative framework for my colleagues and others in the \npublic health community to consider. I hope it will influence our \ndeliberations next year, and contribute to the enactment of effective \nand comprehensive tobacco legislation. Mr. President, this approach is \nnot premised on the notion of a deal with the industry. Instead, it \nattempts to build on the extremely thoughtful and knowledgeable work of \nDrs. Kessler and Koop, and many other public health experts and \neconomists, who have studied these questions for a long time. It is a \npublic health measure, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, today Representative Jim Hansen and I are introducing \nthe Public Health and Education Resource Act--or the PHAER Act. The \nPHAER Act is, in some ways simple and straightforward. It goes right at \nthe problem. It would raise the excise tax on tobacco by $1.50, \nconsistent with the President's recommendation on pricing. It \nspecifically targets the revenues raised to public health, with an \nemphasis on reducing youth smoking rates. This bipartisan, bicameral \nproposal is intended to serve as the blueprint for accomplishing the \npublic health goals that the President and public health leaders have \noutlined.\n\n  Mr. President, the overarching goal of the public health community is \nto\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\ndecrease the rate of tobacco addiction in children. I believe the PHAER \nAct is the simplest and most direct way to accomplish that goal. Every \nhealth expert concludes that the single most effective way to reduce \nyouth consumption of cigarettes is to increase the price. According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, a $1.50 increase in the price of \ncigarettes will result in a 45-percent reduction in youth smoking \nrates. The President has made this a prerequisite to any tobacco \nlegislation.\n  So, Mr. President, the question before Congress is how to accomplish \nthis price increase and serve our public health interests. The tobacco \nsettlement would raise prices by funneling money through the tobacco \ncompanies to accomplish a price increase. This approach relies on the \nindustry to raise the price--which is a Catch-22. If the industry does \nraise the price by a $1.50, then there is no guarantee that all of \nthese revenues will go toward the public health. In fact, health \nexperts and the Federal Trade Commission have concluded that under the \nproposed settlement, the companies would make a substantial profit from \nsuch a price increase--as less than half of the $1.50 would actually go \ntoward settlement payments.\n  On the other hand, the companies might not ever raise their prices to \na point that actually makes a real dent in teen smoking. They could \nchoose to simply raise it high enough to cover their settlement costs--\nestimated at 62 cents per pack.\n  Neither of these outcomes are positive for America's health. That is \nwhy the only fair way to accomplish these goals is through the PHAER \nAct I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, we know that an increase in excise taxes is the single \nmost effective step we can take to reduce teen smoking, and through \nPHAER we can ensure that every penny of the price increase is targeted \nto programs that will further reduce illegal youth tobacco consumption \nand promote other critical public health priorities. This is the most \neffective and reliable mechanism to guarantee that prices go up and \nthat revenues are targeted to the proper programs.\n  Mr. President, this is not a partisan issue. Senators from both sides \nof the aisle have stated that the excise tax is the most efficient and \neffective way to reduce teen smoking and decrease the cost of tobacco \nillness in our country. This is one of the few taxes that people \nactually support increasing. It is one of the few taxes that can be \ndirectly linked to positive policy goals. Now, all we need is the will \nto act.\n  Mr. President, we propose a revenue pipeline to the public health \nrather than relying on the Rubik's cube payment scheme offered by the \nindustry. Under my bill, excise tax increases will turn teenagers away \nfrom cigarettes and the proceeds of the increase will go directly to \nbenefit America's health. These funds are targeted to public health and \neducational programs to further reduce teen tobacco addiction.\n\n  Our PHAER tobacco excise tax increase will be phased in over 3 years. \nEach year the fee will increase by 50 cents until it reaches $1.50. \nOnce at $1.50, the PHAER fee will be indexed for inflation to guarantee \nthat its price-deterrent effect continues to be strong enough to \nmaintain the reduction in teen tobacco use.\n  Mr. President, many have stated that a price increase alone will not \nsustain a long term decrease in youth tobacco addiction, and they are \nright. That is why the revenues from the PHAER fee will be targeted to \npublic health programs, with an emphasis on those that will directly \ndecrease the number of kids who begin to smoke every day.\n  Three-quarters of PHAER funds will be disbursed at the State and \nlocal level for health and education programs that bring home to young \npeople the deadly consequences of smoking. These funds will be \ndistributed to the States with the supervision and assistance by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. We should set out national \ngoals for reducing teen smoking, and insist on accountability, but we \nshould also give States the flexibility to develop the best programs \nfor their people.\n  Mr. President, each State will be able to design teen smoking \ncessation programs that are most effective for its particular \ncircumstance. An average of $15 billion per year will be available for \nthese States programs. Eligible uses include smoking cessation programs \nand services, school and community-based tobacco education and \nprevention programs, counteradvertising campaigns, expansion of the \nchildren's health insurance program created in the budget act, and \nother public health purposes.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that smoking cessation and addiction \ntreatment programs be put into place, and the PHAER Program will do \nthat. I hear a great deal of talk about adult choice. Well, most adults \nwho smoke are not really choosing to smoke--they are addicted. It is \nnot merely a habit--it is an addiction as powerful as the addiction to \ncocaine. And as the price of cigarettes goes up, we should put a system \nin place that will help bring addicted smokers off nicotine. Cessation \nand treatment programs should be available to all Americans, regardless \nof their income.\n  Mr. President, these programs will be coordinated at the State level \nand the States will have flexibility to design their own programs. The \nStates vary widely in the patterns of tobacco use. Some States have \nyouth cigarette consumption rates reaching catastrophic levels; other \nStates have a more pressing problem with chewing--or smokeless--\ntobacco.\n  Mr. President, the remaining 25 percent of PHAER funds--an average of \n$5 billion per year--will be available at the Federal level to expand \ncritical research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers \nfor Disease Control. They will also be used to adequately fund tobacco \ncontrol programs at the Food and Drug Administration and to assure that \ntobacco farmers, factory workers, and their communities will not suffer \neconomic devastation as we move to reduce smoking. The PHAER Act would \nalso contribute to tobacco prevention programs at the Veterans' \nAdministration, the Drug Czar's office, and across the world through \nassistance to international programs. PHAER would also fund Medicare \nprevention programs and premium and cost-sharing assistance for low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. President, all of these goals--and many more--can be \naccomplished, and we do not need to ask the tobacco industry's \npermission to do it. We just need to raise the tobacco excise tax and \nuse the revenues to promote clear public health objectives.\n  Mr. President, the reason we can accomplish these goals is that the \nPHAER fund will raise $494 billion over 25 years--an average of nearly \n$20 billion per year. This estimate is based on the tobacco consumption \ncurve developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is a realistic \ncalculation of the revenues that will flow from this excise tax boost, \neven given anticipated reductions in tobacco consumption.\n  Mr. President, this revenue projection of $494 billion over 25 years \nis much more reliable than the $368.5 billion figure projected by the \ntobacco industry and State attorneys general as a result of their \nproposed settlement. Those numbers are full of holes and deceptions. \nThe Federal Trade Commission recently found that the much-publicized \n$368.5 billion figure so widely associated with the proposed tobacco \nsettlement failed to take into account the effect of reduced \nconsumption of tobacco on the industry's payment obligations under the \nterms of the settlement. A more realistic estimate would peg the \nproceeds of the proposed tobacco settlement closer to $250 billion over \n25 years.\n  Mr. President, when you look at real numbers, it is clear that the \nPHAER Act will provide States with considerably more funds than the \nproposal by the tobacco industry and the attorneys general.\n  Finally, Mr. President, our bill includes a series of sense-of-the-\nSenate provisions. We include them in the bill to reflect our \nrecognition that comprehensive tobacco legislation should include a \nbroader range of measures than the revenue proposals in PHAER. These \nprovisions state that any final legislation should include: stiff \npenalties to serve as an incentive for the industry to stop targeting \nkids, full authority for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate \ntobacco, disclosure of documents, restrictions on secondhand smoke, \ningredient and constituent disclosure and a ban on the use of Federal \nGovernment resources\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nto weaken nondiscriminatory public health laws abroad.\n  Already this year, several key pieces of tobacco legislation have \nbeen introduced that should be part of congressional action next year \non tobacco. I have introduced the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act, \ndealing with ingredient labeling, the Smoke-Free Environment Act, which \nwould restrict secondhand smoke, and the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure \nAct, which would set out our international trade policy on tobacco. I \nhave also cosponsored Senator Durbin's legislation, the No Tobacco for \nKids Act, which would set up real penalties to stop the industry from \ntargeting kids.\n  In addition, along with Minnesota State Attorney General Humphrey and \nothers, I have called for a full disclosure of hidden documents from \nthe industry, including those that have been fraudulently concealed \nunder the cloak of the attorney-client privilege. I have asked relevant \ncommittee chairmen to subpoena documents being held by Minnesota courts \nbecause Congress must have the unfiltered truth before we legislate on \nsuch a critical issue.\n\n  Hopefully, Mr. President, the State of Minnesota will do what the \nCongress of the United States has so far failed to do. Minnesota--which \ndid not sign on to the supposedly ``global'' tobacco settlement--is \nexpected to go to trial in January. That case should bring significant \ninformation to light--information on tobacco and health that will be \ncritical to crafting appropriate legislation in Congress.\n  Mr. President, opponents of strengthening the proposed tobacco \nsettlement assert the industry will ``walk away'' if any legislation is \ntoo favorable to the public health. Last time I checked the \nConstitution of the United States, only duly elected U.S. Senators \ncould vote in this Chamber, and only Members, staff, and former Members \ncould have access to the floor. As far as I'm concerned, the tobacco \nindustry can walk anywhere it wants to--but not onto this floor to cast \nvotes for or lobby against this legislation.\n  Mr. President, all of us were elected to serve the people of our \nindividual States and the Nation as a whole. There are few things that \nI could do for the people of New Jersey--especially the young people \nand their parents--that are more critical than preventing children from \ninhaling a deadly and addicting toxin into their body.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the PHAER \nlegislation. It is not time to strike a deal with Big Tobacco, but \nrather it is time to make a healthy future real for America's kids.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters I have received \nfrom public health groups supporting the approach taken in this \nlegislation be entered into the Record. This includes a letter from the \nENACT Coalition, which is signed by the American Medical Association, \nthe American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, American College of Preventive Medicine, \nNational Association of County and City Health Officials, Partnership \nfor Prevention, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In addition, I \nam inserting letters from the American Lung Association and the \nNational Association of Counties, which also indicated support for the \nintroduction of the PHAER legislation.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to insert the bill, a fact sheet, and a \nchart reflecting how many more lives would be saved under the PHAER Act \nas opposed to the tobacco industry's proposed settlement into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This index will be based on the \n     CPI, the Medical CPI or an increase of 3%, whichever is \n     greater.\n       The PHAER fee will raise approximately $494 billion over 25 \n     years (using the tobacco consumption projections of the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation), an average of almost $20 billion per \n     year. Of these funds:\n       75% (an average of $15 billion per year) will be \n     distributed at the State level for: Smoking cessation \n     programs and services; school and community-based tobacco \n     education and prevention programs; State-level counter-\n     advertising campaigns; ASSIST and similar community-based \n     tobacco control programs; expansion of the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program created in the 1977 Budget Reconciliation \n     Act; early childhood development programs through the \n     Maternal Child Health Block Grant and WIC; and other \n     appropriate public health uses.\n       25% (an average of $5 billion per year) will be distributed \n     at the Federal level for: Research and prevention programs at \n     NIH and CDC; FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products; USDA \n     programs to assist tobacco farmers, their families and their \n     communities; a national counter-advertising campaign; \n     Medicare prevention programs and premium and cost-sharing \n     assistance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries; \n     International Programs to decrease worldwide tobacco-related \n     illness; the Drug Czar to conduct tobacco education and \n     prevention programs; and the VA to conduct tobacco education, \n     intervention and outreach programs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Effective National Action\n\n\n                                           To Control Tobacco,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. James V. Hansen,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Senator and Congressman: On behalf of our millions of \n     public health officials and professionals, health care \n     providers and volunteer members of ENACT, the coalition for \n     Effective National Action To Control Tobacco, we applaud the \n     introduction of the Public Health and Education Resource \n     (PHAER) Act.\n       We particularly want to thank you for your leadership in \n     reaffirming what the members of the coalition have said in \n     the ENACT consensus statement regarding increases in the cost \n     of tobacco products. Experts in the area of tobacco control \n     agree that significant increases in the cost per pack deter \n     children and others from taking up the use of tobacco. The \n     ENACT coalition believes strongly that such an increase in \n     the federal excise tax is essential.\n       In addition to providing for a $1.50 excise tax per pack, \n     indexed to inflation, and the nondeductibility of those new \n     taxes, you have addressed many essential public health \n     programs. Adequate funding of these programs is integral to \n     comprehensive, sustainable, effective, well-funded tobacco \n     control legislation. We look forward to working with you and \n     the supporters of your legislation to get action on tobacco \n     now.\n           Signed,\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\n     American Academy of Pediatrics.\n     American Cancer Society.\n     American College of Preventive Medicine.\n     American Heart Association.\n     American Medical Association.\n     Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.\n     National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n     Partnership for Prevention.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The American Lung Association \n     commends you on the introduction of the Public Health and \n     Education Resource Act (PHAER). As you know, the American \n     Lung Association has pursued a significant price increase in \n     the federal cigarette excise tax for many years.\n       Tobacco use is the nation's leading preventable cause of \n     death and disability. Each year an estimated 419,000 people \n     die from diseases directly caused from smoking. Three \n     thousand children start smoking each day in this country. One \n     thousand of them will eventually die from a smoking-related \n     disease. Smoking costs this nation at least $97.2 billion \n     annually. Of that total cost, $22 billion is paid by the \n     Federal government. Over the next 20 years, Medicare alone \n     will spend an estimated $800 billion to care for people with \n     smoking related illnesses.\n       Reducing tobacco consumption among our nation's youth has \n     long been a goal of the American Lung Association. The bulk \n     of academic research indicates that a sharp and sudden \n     increase in the price of tobacco products has the effect of \n     lowering smoking rates among teens. Raising the price per \n     pack by at least $1.50 or more would help achieve that \n     desired outcome.\n       The American Lung Association applauds your continued \n     efforts and leadership in reducing tobacco consumption, \n     especially among our youth, and we look forward to working \n     with you as this tobacco-related legislation progresses \n     through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Fran DuMelle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The National Association of \n     Counties (NACo) is pleased to support your bill, the Public \n     Health and Education Resource (PHAER) Act. The legislation is \n     a strong step forward for public health activities related to \n     tobacco and helps focus the congressional debate on \n     legislative language rather than broad concepts.\n       We particularly support your recognition of the role of \n     counties and other local governments in the provision of \n     health services. Counties, in collaboration with states, will \n     be key to the success of the public health programs outlined \n     in the PHAER trust fund, including tobacco education and \n     prevention, smoking cessation, and counter advertising. NACo \n     appreciates your work to ensure a local government role in \n     the planning and implementation of the trust fund's health \n     activities.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this issue. Dan Katz \n     of your staff has been very responsive to our concerns. NACo \n     looks forward to working with you and your staff as tobacco \n     legislation moves forward.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n\n                                                Randy

VIOLENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Craig, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Bryan, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Ford, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr.

was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 141\n\n       Whereas every day in America, 15 children under the age of \n     19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims \n     aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun;\n       Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students \n     reported having carried a gun in the past 30 days;\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     helping children grow from a childhood free from fear and \n     violence into healthy adulthood;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of this day will give the students \n     the opportunity to make an earnest decision about their \n     future by voluntarily signing the ``Student Pledge Against \n     Gun Violence'', and sincerely promise that the students will \n     never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a \n     dispute, and will use their influence to keep friends from \n     using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) November 6, 1997, should be designated as ``National \n     Concern About Young People and Gun Violence Day''; and\n       (2) the President should be authorized and requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the \n     United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nproclaiming November 6, 1997, as National Concern about Young People \nand Gun Violence Day. Last year, Senators Wellstone, Specter, and \nBradley introduced this resolution. I am joined by Senator Kempthorne \nand many other colleagues today in supporting an identical resolution. \nWe have all seen the good that can come from focusing attention on \nyoung people and helping organizations across the country mobilize \nchildren to stay away from gun violence.\n  The Day of Concern was initiated by Mary Lewis Grow, a Minnesota \nhomemaker, in 1996. Other groups, such as Mothers Against Violence in \nAmerica, have joined her effort to establish a Day of Concern. The \nproclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a \nnational effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun \nviolence. In 1996, 32,000 students in Washington State signed the \npledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and \ntens of thousands more across the nation.\n  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national \nobservance on\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\nNovember 6 to give students throughout America the chance to make a \npromise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun \nviolence. The students' pledge promises three things: first, they will \nnever carry a gun to school; second, they will never resolve a dispute \nwith a gun; and third, they will use their influence with friends to \ndiscourage them from resolving disputes with guns.\n  Mr. President, just last week I joined several colleagues on the \nfloor of the Senate as we decried the murder of Ann Harris, a 17-year-\nold Virginian, by a 19-year-old man in Washington State. This random \nact of violence was apparently precipitated because the car in which \nAnn was a passenger was going too slowly for the driver of the car in \nwhich the murderer was riding. The young man was angry enough and \nmorally numbed enough to fire his gun into Ann's car, killing Ann. What \na tragedy. What a waste.\n  In another example, a 14-year-old boy opened fire in a Moses Lake, WA \nclassroom, killing a teacher and student and wounding others. He has \nbeen convicted, but that does little to ease the pain of the loss \nsuffered by that small community. Maybe if he had signed a pledge, \nmaybe if he had heard the message over and over from parents and \nfriends that gun violence was the wrong way to solve problems, maybe if \n* * * maybe if * * *. We don't know how we might have stopped this act \nof violence, but we know we all have to try education, try outreach, \ntry everything.\n  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on \nthe decline. A number of factors are involved, including community-\nbased policing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime \nprevention programs, and population demographics. I don't think any of \nus intend to rest on our successes. Rather, we must review programs \nthat work, and focus our limited resources on those. Legislation passed \nearlier this year, the Safe and Drug Free Communities Act, will help us \ndo that.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple \neffort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming \nNovember 6, a ``Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' \nThis is an easy step for us to help facilitate the work that must go on \nin each community across America, as parents, teachers, friends, and \nstudents try to prevent gun violence before it continues to ruin \ncountless lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11365-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEARS 1998 AND 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HUTCHISON AMENDMENT NO. 1526\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON proposed an amendment to the motion to postpone the \nmotion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 1119) to authorize appropriations \nfor fiscal year 1998 for military activities of the Department of \nDefense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the \nDepartment of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike the date and insert ``January 18, 1998''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11366-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11366-S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE AGRICULTURAL, RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND EDUCATION REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 LUGAR (AND HARKIN) AMENDMENT NO. 1527\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for Mr. Lugar, for himself and Mr. Harkin) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 1150) to ensure that federally funded \nagricultural research, extension, and education address high-priority \nconcerns with national multistate significance, to reform, extend, and \neliminate certain agricultural research programs, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 30, strike lines 7 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     Work.--Not more than \\2/3\\ of the''.\n       On page 30, strike line 13 and insert the following:\n       ``(b) Administrative Costs.--The Secretary''.\n       On page 30, strike lines 19 and 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Limitations.--\n       ``(1) Buildings or facilities.--Funds''.\n       On page 31, strike line 1 and insert the following:\n       ``(2) Equipment purchases.--Of funds''.\n       On page 31, strike lines 5 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) $15,000; or\n       ``(B) \\1/3\\ of the amount of the grant award.''.\n       On page 33, strike lines 1 and 2 and insert the following:\n       ``(i) as the lead Federal agency--\n\n       ``(I) the Department of Agriculture; or\n       ``(II) if funding provided for the Plant Genome Initiative \n     through the Department of Agriculture is substantially less \n     than funding provided for the Initiative through another \n     Federal agency, the other Federal agency, as determined by \n     the President; and''.\n\n       On page 35, lines 22 through 25, strike ``without regard'' \n     and all that follows through ``2281 et seq.)''.\n       On page 58, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 229.

I have been, and will continue to be, a vocal \nsupporter of a strong and balanced Conservation Reserve Program. It is \nsimply good for Minnesota and good for our Nation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, with the combined efforts of Congress, the \nUSDA, farmers and people like those at Minnesota's Soil and Water \nConservation Districts, we can ensure the continued success and \nviability of the Conservation Reserve Program well into the 21st \nCentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11369-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JAMES A.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one \nof Michigan's most outstanding citizens, the Honorable Dorothy Comstock \nRiley. After a long and highly successful career, in which she reached \nthe highest level in the Michigan judicial system, she has decided to \nretire.\n  For Dorothy, success came early. Always a bright and industrious \nstudent, while at Wayne State University, she was recognized as the top \ngraduating woman. Following her law degree from Wayne State, she \nentered private practice. In 1956, Dorothy left her practice to serve \nthe community as an assistant Wayne County Friend of the Court. She \nexcelled in this capacity and helped ensure the needs of families and \nchildren were well represented. Although she returned to private \npractice in 1968, where she helped found the firm of Riley and Roumell, \nher commitment to public service was only beginning.\n  A few years later, Dorothy's outstanding abilities and dedication to \nthe legal profession were again recognized. In 1972 she was appointed \nto the Wayne County Circuit Court. Four years later she received an \nappointment to the Michigan Court of Appeals, and was reelected to a 6-\nyear term on the Court. Soon after, the integrity and fairness she had \nshown throughout her career were recognized once more when she was \nappointed to the Michigan State Supreme Court. Dorothy's commitment to \nher profession was rewarded in 1987 when she was elected Chief Justice \nof the Michigan Supreme Court.\n  During her long, distinguished career, Dorothy has belonged to many \norganizations and received numerous accolades. From honorary doctorates \nto the presidency of professional associations, each award and \nmembership reflected Dorothy's commitment to integrity, honesty, and \nleadership. And while Monday evening's event represents one award among \nmany, I am thankful for this opportunity to express how grateful I am \nfor Dorothy's service. Throughout her career, Dorothy personified what \nis best in our legal system: a fair-minded justice with a passion for \ntruth. Because of her long commitment to the State of Michigan, \nDorothy's presence will be greatly missed.\n  As she enters this new phase in her life, I want to express how great \nan impact she has had on both her profession and those individuals \nfortunate enough to know her. I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11369-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11369-S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FISCAL YEAR 1998 TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, GENERAL GOVERNMENT \n                    APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to discuss my vote on the fiscal year 1998 Treasury, and \nPostal Service, general government appropriations conference report.\n  When the Treasury, Postal Service, general government appropriations \nbill passed the Senate, we included a provision to prohibit a cost-of-\nliving allowance for Members of Congress.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Joseph \nBarry Mason, the Dean of the College of Commerce at my alma mater, The \nUniversity of Alabama, in my hometown of Tuscaloosa. Dean Mason is a \nremarkable man, a distinguished educator and a good friend.\n  Joseph Barry Mason received his undergraduate degree from the \nLouisiana Tech University College of Administration and Business. Upon \nreceiving his Ph.D. in marketing from The University of Alabama in \n1967, Dr. Mason joined the faculty of The University and, since that \ntime, he has served that institution with distinction. During his \ntenure, Dr. Mason has served as the Chairman of the College of Commerce \nDepartment of Management and Marketing, and since 1988, as the Dean of \nthe College of Commerce and the Russell Professor of Business \nAdministration.\n  Dr. Mason's professional associations extend beyond the campus of The \nUniversity. He is a former chairman of the board of the American \nMarketing Association and the 1976 Beta Gamma Sigma National Scholar.\n  Further, in 1984 Dr. Mason served as the Chairman of the UA Task \nForce on Cost Savings. In that capacity, Dr. Mason worked with the \nGeneral Motors Rochester Products Plant and the United Auto Workers in \nTuscaloosa in order to identify cost savings and prevent the closure of \nthe 200-employee facility. As a result of his successful efforts, the \ngroundwork for future academic-industrial partnerships was laid.\n  For his excellence in education, Dr. Mason has received numerous \ndistinguished awards. Dr. Mason received the Leavey Award for \nExcellence in Private Enterprise Education from the Freedoms Foundation \nof Valley Forge, PA. In 1986, he was named the first annual recipient \nof the Academy of Marketing Science Outstanding Educator of the Year \nAward. And in 1994, Dean Mason was designated a Distinguished Fellow of \nthe Academy of Marketing Science.\n  At various points in his career, The University has honored Dean \nMason, as well. For bringing distinctive credit to the academic \ncommunity, Dean Mason was awarded the John F. Burnman Distinguished \nFaculty Award and The University of Alabama National Alumni Association \nOutstanding Commitment to Teaching Award.\n  Recently, Dean Mason was honored by Louisiana Tech University as its \n1997 Distinguished Alumnus. As many of my colleagues know, on Saturday, \nNovember 1, 1997, The University of Alabama will play Louisiana Tech at \nour Homecoming Football game.\n  On that day, Dean Mason, loved and respected by all who have known \nhim, will be honored as a friend and leader to not only The University \nof Alabama, but also to Louisiana Tech. On this day, on behalf of my \nwife, Annette, we wish Joseph Barry Mason our sincerest thanks and \ncongratulations for his dedication to making a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11370-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  INDUCTION OF JACKIE ROBINSON INTO NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY'S SOCIETY \n                              HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on October 28, Northeastern \nUniversity will posthumously induct Jackie Robinson into its Sport in \nSociety Hall of Fame. As a member of the National Advisory Board of the \nCenter for the Study of Sport in Society, I want to make a few remarks \nabout Robinson, the Center, and racism.\n  Future historians will remember Jackie Robinson as one of the most \nsignificant individuals in twentieth-century U.S. history. As the first \nAfrican-American to play Major League Baseball in this century, \nRobinson had to will himself to endure horrific abuse from fans and \nfellow players alike. His perseverance in the face of this challenge \nwould have made him a memorable player even had he not excelled on the \ndiamond.\n  But Jackie Robinson did excel. In his distinguished career, he won \nthe Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player awards. Robinson also \nplayed a prominent role as a member of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers ball \nclub, the'' Wait `Til Next Year' team that finally bested its arch \nrival New York Yankees in a thrilling World Series.\n  Recounting Robinson's greatest accomplishments as a player cannot do \njustice to the impact that he had on the game and our nation. His \ndaring on the base paths brought the running game back as the major \nstyle of attack in the National League for the first time in some three \ndecades. His success with the Dodgers led to the signing of other \nnotable players such as Roy Campanella, Larry Doby, and Satchel Paige.\n  His loyalty to the Dodgers ended his career prematurely. Jackie \nRobinson retired rather than play for the San Francisco Giants when the \nDodgers sold his contract. Imagining Robinson in any uniform other than \nthe Dodgers' is like envisioning Cal Ripken wearing New York Yankee \npinstripes.\n  Robinson also led a productive life off the field. A Republican and a \nbusinessman, Robinson devoted the remainder of his life to civil \nrights, party politics, and urban affairs. He bemoaned baseball's tepid \nefforts at integrating all levels of the great game.\n  Sadly, baseball has made insufficient progress since Robinson's death \nalmost a quarter of a century ago. In its ``Racial Report Card'' \nreleased earlier this year, Northeastern's Center gave Major League \nBaseball an overall grade of B, but only a C- for top management \npositions.\n  As Jackie's widow, Rachel Robinson, the Center's Director, Richard \nLapchick, and all of the other excellent employees and friends of the \nCenter celebrate Jackie's life, we should all reflect on what we can do \nto honor and build on his legacy.\n  Unquestionably, there is a distance yet to go when, for example, we \nhave only one African-American general manager in major league \nbaseball.\n  I send my best wishes to Northeastern University, the Center, and \nRachel Robinson on this occasion. I hope that all of us will use it as \na reminder of the work that lies ahead: to realize our objective, which \nwas Jackie Robinson's as well, of a society that does not discriminate \non the basis of race and offers equal opportunity to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11370-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE FY98 LABOR/HHS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM: Mr. President, I supported an amendment offered \nby Senator Gorton which would block grant several K-12 education \nprograms directly down to local school districts. I believe Mr. \nGorton's amendment moves in a positive direction for education \nspending. By cutting out levels of bureaucratic red tape, Mr. Gorton's \namendment would actually send more money into the classroom.\n  As we determine the best possible way to spend scarce education \nresources, I believe it is essential to ensure that the largest \npossible portion of our education spending makes it way into a \nclassroom. I believe Mr. Gorton's amendment achieves this objective. By \nusing the same appropriations level for these programs as last year and \nblock granting that amount to the most local level, the Gorton \namendment will actually provide $670 million in additional money to \nlocal school districts. For this reason, I supported this important \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11370-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11370-S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE STATE VISIT OF JIANG ZEMIN PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this week one of the most important \nevents since the end of World War II will take place here in \nWashington. It is the State visit of the National Leader of the Peoples \nRepublic of China. The future of United States-China relations will \nsomewhat be forged on the occasion of\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\nthe visit of the President of People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin. \nThis summit will, hopefully, define our challenges and opportunities \nand could and should serve as a model for future discussions for both \nnations.\n  Let me say that I continue to be disturbed by some of the actions \nembarked upon by the PRC. The militaristic actions toward Taiwan, the \nsale of weapons to Iran, Pakistan, Syria, and other nations, and the \ninternal human rights violations that continue to occur to name the \nmain ones.\n  However, policy of isolation has never proven successful in \ninternational relations. In fact, a detriment to all this nation has to \noffer and the very doctrines we abide by and stand for.\n  An example: I have not been totally convinced the need for the \nexpansion of NATO--I can hear it now--what does China and NATO have to \ndo with one another and it there a relationship.\n  Well, as a Western State Senator, I have a tendency to view our \nforeign policy from the Pacific, rather than the Atlantic. In my \nopinion, looking from the standpoint of NATO, Europe, Russia continues \nto have difficulties with the fact that NATO enlargement is under \nconsideration. Russia is a cash poor nation with an overabundance of \nmilitary weapons, a silent industry base, and a unmanageable \nbureaucracy. On the other hand, the PRC, their neighbor, is a cash rich \nnation searching for ways to expand investments throughout the world.\n  For the moment China, has not been allowed access to Western military \ntechnology. The West has not allowed and for good reason. I wholly \nagree with a nonaccess policy given obvious actions taken by the PRC.\n  Therefore, China's defense industry does not have the command, \ncontrol, computer, and communication systems, known collectively as \n``C4''.\n  Even with these limitations, China continues its work on advanced \ncruise missiles, a satellite positioning system, and airborne early-\nwarning radar.\n  To facilitate this continued work, China's government has now turned \nto Russia as the best available source of military foreign technology \nfrom foreign sources.\n  It has brought 72 SU-27 fighters--and plans to build more under \nlicense--as well as Russian kilo submarines. There is good news. With a \nlimited procurement budget, it cannot splash out on imports. The only \ngood news is that Russia is still unwilling to sell China its best \nequipment.\n  From these facts, one is able to determine that a China that is \nalienated by the United States will continue to invest their funds for \nmodern military technology wherever, even with their neighbor, and \npossible ally, Russia to ``divide and conquer'' any perceived threats \nto their borders, whether it be their Eastern or Western border.\n  However, if the United States commits to an open dialog--tries in the \nmost earnest way to work out the differences that exist, it is my hope \nthe PRC will become an integrated member of the international community \nand begin to act as responsible member of that community. This can only \nfurther peace and stability for both nations and the world.\n  Besides its recent economic advancements, it is incumbent that the \nUnited States have a constructive working relationship with China. The \nreasons are obvious:\n  The People's Republic of China [PRC] plays a major role in the post-\ncold-war world;\n  It is the world's most populous nation, about 1.2 billion people, and \nthe third-largest in land mass after Russia and Canada;\n  It has nuclear weapons, is a growing military power, and plays a key \nrole in regional stability while emerging as a regional leader in Asia; \nand\n  As one of the five permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council, \nChina has veto power over security council resolutions dealing with key \nmultilateral issues, including international peacekeeping and the \nresolution of regional conflicts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the upcoming summit is an important \nopportunity to address many issues that will be of importance to all \nAmericans especially Mountains. Agriculture cannot be left out in these \ndiscussions.\n\n  Our Nation was founded on hard work, innovative technologies in \nagricultural production. U.S. farmer and ranchers have supplied our \nNation and the world with clean, safe and affordable food since our \nhumble beginnings.\n  We are a leader in agriculture exports. This fact is sometimes \ntransparent in the eyes of those who would rather consider the United \nStates as a nation of fiber optics rather than food and fiber. But, I \nsay we can do both.\n  In 1996, China's farmers produced a bumper wheat crop. That along \nwith a dispute over unfounded accusations and over reaction over \nalleged infected wheat contributed to a severe decrease in the United \nStates grain exports to China.\n  China's ban on United States imports of wheat is based on \nscientifically unfounded trade evidence linked to insignificant disease \ncommonly known as tck smut. This diseases is present in Canada, as well \nas Europe. Such barriers-to-entry are and will be a barrier to China's \nentry into the WTO.\n  We've seen this type of attack on U.S. agriculture before. Recently, \nthe European Union objected to United States beef imports based on \nscientifically unfounded evidence; eventually, the United States \nprevailed in a WTO challenge but not before the United States cattle \nindustry was damaged and European markets found their beef exports \nelsewhere.\n  Mr. President, U.S. farmers and ranchers produce the healthiest and \nbest food commodities in the world. If we are truly supposed to be a \nglobal economy, we need to put our great American agriculture on an \nequal basis with semiconductors and automobiles. Agriculture has always \nbeen dealt away first in all of the trade agreements in the last 50 \nyears. It is not fair or right that the great machine of food and fiber \nproduction be left picking up the scraps.\n  I think that the United States is following the same course as our \nrelations with Russia in the late 1980's. An establishment of ties with \nChina does not necessarily imply an endorsement of their policies. I \nbelieve that the freedom that the United States embraces can only serve \nas an example to the Chinese people. The summits between President \nReagan and Mr. Gorbachev brought about the fall of the Berlin wall--\nthere were naysayers then so maybe the talks that the we begin now, \nwill lead to the opening of the Great Wall of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11370-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11371-S11372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

But having heard the \nnature of the resolution, I commend my good friend from Vermont for \nforwarding this on behalf of the sponsors of the resolution. As it \nhappened, by pure coincidence, today in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I supported the nomination of David Hermelin, of Michigan, \nto be our Ambassador to Norway. I made reference to the fact that Mrs. \nRuppe, also from Michigan, had served with tremendous distinction as \nour Ambassador to Norway, as well as she had served the Peace Corps as \nits director.\n  So it is quite a coincidence that this resolution is coming forward \ntoday with her name commemorated at the Foreign Relations Committee \nwith great warmth. I wanted to just rise to give my strong support to \nthis resolution. It is highly appropriate.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the Senator saying that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11372-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL INCORPORATED\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

I commend Senator Harkin \nand all members of the committee for their bipartisan approach and \ncooperative efforts in constructing this legislation.\n  Because research programs were only authorized through 1997 in last \nyear's farm bill, the Senate Agriculture Committee has had the \nopportunity this year to review agricultural research, extension and \neducation funding. The committee gathered testimony through four \nhearings in March and received more than 100 responses to some relevant \nquestions that I posed publicly in January.\n  With the growth in world population, U.S. producers may well need to \ntriple their production in the next few decades to meet growing demand \nfor food and spare the world's rain forests from being uprooted in a \ndesperate effort to expand production.\n  To increase future food production, our Nation must devote additional \nresources to agricultural research. This bill provides new funding for \nagricultural research to address critical emerging issues related to \nfuture food production, environmental protection and farm income. Food \ngenome science, food safety, agricultural biotechnology and precision \nagriculture are key areas that need additional resources to meet the \nchallenges that face U.S. farmers.\n  This bill also makes significant reforms to the current agricultural \nresearch system. This system has served us well. To use our available \nresources most effectively, however, it is important to ensure more \ncollaboration and efficiency as well as achieve greater accountability. \nWe cannot overlook the relevance or merit of the research, extension, \nand education programs.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Lugar, Senator \nHarkin, and their staffs for the tremendous effort they have devoted to \nthe research reauthorization bill over the past several months, and \ncongratulate them for the legislation we have before us today.\n  We owe much of the credit for this country's agricultural success to \nour network of land grant institutions, State agriculture experiment \nstations, USDA's Agricultural Research Service, and hundreds of county \nextension offices. These entities work together in a wide range of ways \nto produce cutting-edge research and then convert it into improved \npractices and technology meaningful to producers.\n  It is important to strengthen this network further. This bill places \nincreased emphasis on collaboration among institutions and disciplines, \nand encourages pursuit of goals benefiting more than one region or \nState. It emphasizes priority-setting so resources can be targeted to \nemerging and critical issues when necessary, and establishes new \nmechanisms for ensuring accountability.\n  Specifically, I am pleased that the bill preserves existing programs \nthat share these objectives, such as the Fund for Rural America. As you \nknow, the fund was designed to provide immediate, flexible, and applied \nresearch and support to people in rural areas who are adjusting to \nrapid changes in the agricultural sector since the last farm bill.\n  The Fund for Rural America promotes value-added processing, which is \nvital to successful rural economic development. Our rural communities \nmust capture more of the revenue their locally produced commodities \nultimately generate. Value-added processing keeps that revenue local, \nwhich will be critical to the future of those communities.\n  I am pleased to say also that this bill treats smaller institutions \nfairly. It significantly levels the playing field for small schools \ncompeting for limited research funds, and it is sensitive to the \nrelative importance of formula funds for institutions in agrarian \nStates with low populations.\n  Finally, I had hoped we would be able to address the problems with \nthe CRP haying and grazing program, but I recognize that consensus on a \nspecific remedy remains elusive. I do hope we will be more successful \non this front in the near future because the current system is creating \nboth severe difficulties for the people managing those lands and \ngrowing uneasiness among all groups interested in CRP's success. I urge \nthe committee to continue working on this issue.\n  This bill is a positive step forward. Federal investment in \nagricultural research, extension, and education is one of the most \nimportant duties of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and, again, I \ncommend Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin for their commitment to this \neffort.\n\n\n                          FOOD GENOME STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee the food genome \nstrategy that is authorized in this bill. Senator Lugar is to be \ncommended highly for including this visionary provision in the bill. It \nis my understanding that the food genome strategy, authorized in this \nbill, will include comprehensive, directed, and coordinated plant \ngenome and animal genome initiatives. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, these initiatives, while allowing for all entities to \ncompete competitively for funding, will be directed and coordinated \nprograms that are designed to accomplish specific objectives. The \nrequest for proposals [RFP] that will be published by the USDA could be \nvery specific in its requests. For example, one part of the RFP may \nrequest the development of 100,000 expressed sequence Tags on corn and \nanother part may request a very high resolution physical map of corn.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand that it is your intention that the plant \ngenome initiative and the animal genome initiative will not be \nscientific free-for-alls, if you will, that fund any research project \nthat happens to have genome in the proposal. Rather, this program will \nbe designed to have specific objectives and milestones that must be met \nalong the way so that the taxpayers realize a timely and significant \nreturn on their dollar invested in this research.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The purpose of having a food genome strategy is to ensure \nthat there is a comprehensive plan that includes appropriate, specific \nobjectives for each aspect of the program, be it mapping, sequencing, \ntrait identification, or bioinformatics.\n  Mr. BOND. With your assistance, we have established a $40 million \nplant genome initiative within the National Science Foundation [NSF] \nthat will be focused on economically significant crops. To facilitate \nthe development of a comprehensive plant genome initiative, the \nPresident's Science Advisor, Dr. Gibbons, established an Inter-Agency \nWorking Group on Plant Genomes. This group will be consulting with the \nNSF in the design and implementation of the plant genome initiative. It \nis my understanding that the plant genome initiative, authorized under \nthis bill, will be coordinated with the NSF plant genome initiative.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Certainly, we intend for the work to be complementary. We \nexpect the USDA to work with the Inter-Agency Working Group to ensure \nthat\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\nthe total amount of funds from all agencies is coordinated, directed, \nand focused. This will ensure that there is no duplication and better \ncoordination.\n  Mr. BOND. Since the NSF has $40 million for a plant genome \ninitiative, there have been some questions raised concerning which \nagency, NSF or USDA, would serve as the lead agency for the national \nplant genome initiative. In the managers amendment, you clarified this \nissue by providing that USDA be the lead agency unless the funding it \nadministered for the plant genome initiative was substantially less \nthan that provided by another agency.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct. I agree that if the USDA does not provide \nsufficient funding for the plant genome initiative, it should not be \nthe lead agency.\n  Mr. BOND. It is my understanding that some people have stated that \nthis program will be administered in a manner similar to the national \nresearch initiative, the NRI. While the NRI plays a valuable role in \nthe discovery of scientific information related to agriculture, it is \nnot a directed, coordinated program. It is my understanding, however, \nthat the plant genome initiative will be coordinated and focused on the \nmost economically significant crops. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. The food genome strategy will be coordinated and \ndirected and the outcomes will be focused on economically significant \nplants, animals, and microbes and will ensure that all the funding \nunder the program will be directed at achieving results that ultimately \nwill yield us the greatest economic returns.\n  Mr. BOND. The report accompanying S. 1150 makes clear that the \ncommittee intends that the Secretary utilize funds from the initiative \nfor future agriculture and food systems, established under title III of \nthe bill, for the plant genome initiative and the animal genome \ninitiative. Under the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food \nSystems, there is no provision for coordinated, directed, and focused \nprograms. Am I correct in assuming that while the funds for the food \ngenome strategy may be derived from the Initiative for Future \nAgriculture and Food Systems, it is the intent of the managers that the \nfood genome strategy would, in fact, be a coordinated, directed \nprogram?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The food genome strategy will be a coordinated, directed \nprogram without regard to the origin of the funding.\n  Mr. BOND. In addition, under title III, the Secretary is required, in \nmaking individual grants, to give higher priority to a proposal that is \nmulti-state, multi-institutional, or multidisciplinary. While the \noverall Food Genome Strategy will be multi-State, multi-institutional, \nand multidisciplinary, there will be many aspects of the program that \nwill not facilitate multi-State, multi-institutional, and \nmultidisciplinary grants, especially in the first couple of years. For \nexample, the development of expressed sequence tags and high-resolution \nphysical maps may, of necessity, be done by one entity. Expressed \nsequence tags and physical maps are the critical foundation of the food \ngenome strategy. If the Secretary is required to give higher priority \nto multi-State, multi-institutional, and multidisciplinary proposals, \nthis very basic information may not be developed. It is my \nunderstanding, however, that the managers do not intend for this to \nhappen. Rather, since the entire Food Genome Strategy will be multi-\nState, multi-institutional, and multi-disciplinary, all aspects of this \nprogram could receive a higher priority.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is absolutely correct. We recognize that the food \ngenome strategy will be different from other projects funded under \ntitle III. The food genome strategy will be a multi-State, multi-\ninstitutional, and multi-disciplinary program and, therefore, all \nindividual proposals and projects could meet the tests for gaining a \nhigher priority.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I commend you and other members of \nthe Agriculture Committee for including this vitally important \nprovision in the bill. I also appreciate the able assistance of our \nstaff throughout this process.\n  This legislation, will provide us the tools we need to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century and I congratulate you on your \ncontinuing leadership.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass S. 1150, the \nAgricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act. I am \npleased, Mr. President, that several amendments I had planned to offer \non the floor when the Senate took up this bill have been accepted by \nthe chairman, Mr. Lugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the \nAgriculture Committee and have been included in the managers' amendment \nto the bill.\n  Two of my amendments included in the bill address a new research \nprogram regarding precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a \nsystem of farming that uses very site-specific information on soil \nnutrient needs and presence of plant pests, often gathered using \nadvanced technologies such as global positioning systems, high \nperformance image processing, and software systems to determine the \nspecific fertilizer, pesticide and other input needs of a farmer's \ncropland. This technology may have the benefit of lowering farm \nproduction costs and increase profitability by helping the producer \nreduce agricultural inputs by applying them only where needed. In \naddition, reducing agricultural inputs may minimize the impact of crop \nproduction on wildlife and the environment. While precision \nagriculture, generally defined, encompasses a broad range of techniques \nfrom high-technology satellite imaging systems to manual soil sampling, \nit is most frequently discussed in terms of the use of capital \nintensive advanced technologies.\n  Section 232 of the S. 1150 creates a new research program authorizing \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make grants for the development and \npromotion of precision agriculture, including projects to educate \nproducers on the benefits of this new technology. One of my amendments, \nwhich has been included in the managers amendment, ensures that \neducational efforts provide farmers with information about the costs of \nthis technology as well. Any responsible federally funded farmer \neducation efforts on precision agriculture must inform farmers of costs \nof this new technology.\n  Cost considerations are particularly important given that precision \nagriculture technologies tend to be technologically sophisticated and \ncapital intensive, requiring investments in computer systems, new \nsoftware, and potentially new mechanical input applicators. Farmers who \nwish to avoid acquiring the equipment needed for precision agriculture \nmay have to contract for these services with input suppliers. In either \ncase, substantial financial investments may be required of farmers \nadopting precision agriculture technologies. Farmers need information \nthat will allow them to balance the potential long-term benefits of \nprecision agriculture technologies with the short-term and long-term \nfinancial costs. My amendment clarifies that any USDA funding provided \nfor producer education efforts must provide information on both costs \nand benefits of precision agriculture.\n  While precision agriculture may result in production efficiencies and \nimproved profitability for some farms, many in agriculture are \nconcerned that, because of the capital intensive nature of this \nprecision agriculture systems, this new technology will not be \napplicable or accessible to small or highly diversified farms. It is \nunclear whether precision agriculture services, even if provided by \ninput suppliers, will be available at affordable rates to small farms. \nFurthermore, some observers are concerned that private firms may find \nthat marketing efforts directed at small farms are not lucrative enough \nand thus may avoid efforts to apply the technology to small operations.\n  In addition to concerns about the applicability and accessibility of \nprecision agriculture to small farms, many are concerned that precision \nagriculture may not be the most appropriate production system for small \nfarms given the costs of acquiring new technology or contracting for \nadditional services. There may be other production systems, such as \nintegrated whole farm crop, livestock, and resource management systems, \nthat allow small farmers to reduce input costs, improve profitability, \nand minimize environmental impacts of agricultural production that are \nmore appropriate for smaller operations.\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\n  To address this concern, I have proposed an amendment which adds new \nlanguage to section 232 allowing USDA to fund studies evaluating \nwhether precision agriculture technologies are applicable or accessible \nto small- and medium-sized farms. The amendment also allows USDA to \nconduct research on methods to improve the applicability of precision \nagriculture to these operations. It is critical that USDA's research \ninvestment in this new technology not exclude the needs of small \nfarmers. If it does, this new research program could ultimately affect \nthe structure of agriculture, potentially providing disproportionate \nadvantages to large scale farming operations, furthering the trend to \nfewer and larger farms. My amendment will allow USDA to conduct \nresearch on low cost precision agriculture systems that do not require \nsignificant financial investments by farmers and that may be more \nappropriate to small or highly diversified farming operations.\n  The final two amendments I have offered and which have been included \nin the managers' amendment authorize and provide funding for research, \neducation and extension projects to improve the competitiveness, \nviability and sustainability of small- and medium-size dairy and \nlivestock operations.\n  Many Senators have expressed concern about the trend toward increased \nconcentration in the dairy and livestock sectors. According to a 1996 \nreport by the USDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Concentration, \nconcentration in cattle feeding has grown dramatically, with 152 \nfeeders accounting for more than 40 percent of all head sold. \nMeatpacker concentration has also grown, with four packing firms \naccounting for 80 percent of fed cattle in the U.S. Extensive vertical \nintegration in the cattle industry has also reduced price discovery and \nmarket information available to small producers. The combination of \nreduced price information and increased concentration in the feeding \nand packing industry has put small cattle producers under extreme \nfinancial pressure, necessitating more research, education and \nextension efforts to ensure the viability of small- and medium-sized \ncattle operations.\n  Of greatest concern to producers in my home State of Wisconsin is the \ntrend toward fewer and larger dairy farms in the United States. In \n1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In 1997, there are \nonly 24,000 dairy farms. Of those 24,000 dairy farms, 90 percent are \noperations with fewer than 100 cows. The trend toward fewer but larger \ndairy operations is mirrored in most States throughout the Nation. The \neconomic losses associated with the reduction in small farm numbers go \nwell beyond the impact on the individual farm families exiting the \nindustry. Rather, the reduction in farm numbers has affected the rural \ncommunities in my home State that have been built around a large number \nof small family-owned dairy farms. The grocery storeowners, input \nsuppliers, schoolteachers, truckers, cheese manufacturers, and many \nother small rural businesses have been hurt as Wisconsin has seen its \ndairy farm numbers decline.\n  There is substantial concern that past and present Federal \ninvestments in agricultural research have focused almost solely on the \nneeds of larger scale agricultural producers, neglecting the specific \nresearch needs of small producers. Some have suggested that \nthis research bias has exacerbated the trend toward increased \nconcentration and vertical integration, particularly in the livestock \nsector.\n\n  To address this concern, I have proposed an amendment to S. 1150, \nincluded in the managers' amendment, which authorizes a coordinated \nprogram of research, extension, and education to improve the viability \nof small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations.\n  Among the research projects the Secretary is authorized to conduct \nare: Research, development, and on-farm education low-cost production \nfacilities, management systems and genetics appropriate for these small \nand medium operations, research and extension on management intensive \ngrazing systems which reduce feed costs and improve farm profitability, \nresearch and extension on integrated crop and livestock systems that \nstrengthen the competitive position of small- and medium-size \noperations, economic analyses and feasibility studies to identify new \nmarketing opportunities for small- and medium-size producers, \ntechnology assessment that compares the technological resources of \nlarge specialized producers with the technological needs of small- and \nmedium-size dairy and livestock operations, and research to identify \nthe specific research and education needs of these small operations.\n  The amendment allows the Secretary to carry out this new program \nusing existing USDA funds, facilities and technical expertise. Dairy \nand livestock producers should not be forced to become larger in order \nto remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily better. And in fact, \nMr. President, expansion is often counterproductive for small \noperations requiring them to take on an even greater debt load. Farmers \nneed more help in determining other methods of maintaining long-term \nprofitability. For example, small dairy farmers may find adoption of \nmanagement-intensive grazing systems combined with a diversified \ncropping operation a profitable alternative to expansion. But there has \nbeen far too little federally funded research devoted to alternative \nlivestock production systems. Small producers need more Federal \nresearch and extension activity devoted to the development of these \nalternatives. I believe this amendment is a good first step in \nestablishing the Federal research commitment to help develop and \npromote production and marketing systems that specifically address the \nneeds of small producers.\n  Using research dollars to help maintain the economic viability of \nsmall- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations has benefits \nbeyond those afforded to such farmers and the communities in which they \nreside. Keeping a large number of small operations in production can \nprovide environmental benefits as well. As livestock operations expand \ntheir herd size without a corresponding increase in cropping acreage, \nmanure storage and management practices become more costly and more \nburdensome for the operator and raise additional regulatory concerns \nassociated with runoff and water quality among State and Federal \nregulators. Research that helps dairy and livestock operators remain \ncompetitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will help \nminimize these concerns.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I proposed an amendment to require the \nSecretary to fund research on the competitiveness and viability of \nsmall- and medium-size farms under the Initiative for Future \nAgriculture and Food Systems--a new research program authorized by S. \n1150 funded at total $780 million for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. \nWith the inclusion of my amendment in the managers amendment, the \nSecretary is directed to make grants for research projects addressing \nthe viability of small- and medium-size farming operations with funding \nmade available under the Initiative in fiscal years 1999-2002. This \namendment ensures that the research needs of small dairy, livestock, \nand cropping operations will be addressed under the substantial new \nfunding provided for agricultural research in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman, Mr. \nLugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the Agriculture Committee \nand their staff in addressing the important research needs of small- \nand medium-size farms by including my amendments in this important \nbill. I look forward to working with them to maintain these amendments \nduring conference committee consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and \npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1527) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1150), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I rise this evening to discuss an issue \nthat relates to NATO enlargement that I believe merits careful \nconsideration by the Senate at this early stage of the ratification \nprocess.\n  Enlargement of the Alliance is based upon Article 10 of the North \nAtlantic Treaty, also known as the Washington Treaty, which states in \npertinent part as follows:\n\n       The parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other \n     European state in a position to further the principles of \n     this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area to accede to this treaty.\n\n  So Article 10 sets up two conditions for Alliance membership. One, to \nfurther the principles of the Treaty, and, two, to contribute to the \nsecurity of the North Atlantic area.\n  Madam President, the principal focus of the Senate and expert \ncommentators thus far has been to examine whether the accession of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will contribute to European \nsecurity. That is the second condition. And that is surely an \nappropriate focus.\n  For instance, one of my first concerns was the impact that these \nadditions would have on democratization and movement to a market \neconomy in Russia, which I believe has a major bearing on European \nsecurity. Those concerns have been greatly ameliorated by the NATO-\nRussia Founding Act and other NATO initiatives. But we also need to be \naware of the other condition of Article 10; namely, to further the \nprinciples of the Washington Treaty.\n  Now, those principles are summed up in the preamble which reads as \nfollows:\n\n       The Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the \n     purposes and principle of the Charter of the United Nations \n     and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all \n     governments.\n       They are determined to safeguard the freedom, common \n     heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the \n     principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of \n     law.\n       They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North \n     Atlantic area.\n       They are resolved to unite their efforts for collective \n     defense and for the preservation of peace and security.\n\n  Those are the principles in the preamble to the NATO Treaty.\n  In the April 23 testimony of Secretary of State Albright and \nSecretary of Defense Cohen before the Armed Services Committee that \nkicked off the Senate ratification process, my first question to \nSecretary Albright dealt with this issue. I asked her to list the \ncriteria which will be applied in judging the applications for \nmembership of the various countries.\n  Secretary Albright responded as follows:\n\n       Senator Levin, what we are doing is looking at a general \n     set of criteria that fit into some of the comments that I \n     made in my statement, as did Secretary Cohen. That is, we are \n     interested in countries, first of all, that can be active \n     contributors to the Alliance. This is not a way of just \n     trying to give gifts to countries. This is the world's \n     strongest military alliance, and members have to be capable \n     of pulling their weight in it.\n\n  And she continued:\n\n       We are looking at democracies, at free market systems. We \n     are looking at the way that countries treat their minorities, \n     their attitude toward human rights. We are looking to make \n     sure that there is civilian control over the military, \n     generally looking at\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\n     the ways that they are approaching the post-cold war world \n     and their sense of responsibility toward their own \n     populations.\n  She continued:\n\n       So in broadest terms, our criteria are, first of all, their \n     ability to contribute to this foremost alliance, so that the \n     alliance itself is never diluted; and, second, their bona \n     fides in terms of being functioning democracies with market \n     systems that respect their people and where civilian and \n     military relationships are the kind that we believe are \n     pursuant to those ends.\n\n  Madam President, I believe that these are appropriate criteria for \njudging the suitability of countries for admission to the NATO \nAlliance. Additionally--and this is my point this evening--I believe \nthat they are appropriate criteria for continued membership in the \nAlliance. In other words, I believe that the criteria which are used to \njudge a country's suitability for membership should also remain \napplicable during its membership, and that if a country fails to live \nup to those criteria after becoming a member of NATO, that a process \nshould be available whereby that country's membership can be suspended \nuntil it can once again meet those criteria.\n  During the cold war, when the Warsaw Pact posed a major threat to \nNATO, the emphasis understandably was on the military contribution that \nNATO members brought to the Alliance. That has changed, however, in the \npost-cold-war period. There is no current major threat to NATO member \ncountries, and the rationale for enlargement of the Alliance in the \npresent environment, as the Alliance's own September 1995 ``Study on \nNATO Enlargement'' makes clear, is different than it was during the \ncold-war period. Chapter 1 of the NATO study entitled ``Purposes of \nEnlargement\" list the following as the first of seven ways in which \nenlargement will contribute to enhanced stability and security for all \ncountries in the Euro-Atlantic area as:\n\n       Encouraging and supporting democratic reforms, including \n     civilian and democratic control over the military.\n\n  Similarly, in listing 13 criteria for possible new Alliance members, \nchapter 5 of the NATO study lists the following as the very first \ncriterion:\n\n       Conform to basic principles embodied in the Washington \n     Treaty: democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.\n\n  I have reviewed several collective security treaties to which the \nUnited States is a party. In the course of that review, I discovered a \nnumber of relevant provisions; for instance, the Charter of the \nOrganization of American States, the world's oldest regional \norganization. While not as widely celebrated as some of the other \ncharters, nonetheless all of the countries in the Americas but one are \ntoday democratic, and it should come as no surprise, then, although the \nevent received virtually no publicity, that on September 25, with the \nratification by Venezuela of the Protocol of Washington, the OAS \nCharter was amended to provide for the suspension of any member country \nif that country's democratically elected government is brought down by \nforce. The suspension requires the vote of two-thirds of the member \nstates. So in the OAS there is a way of suspending a member who no \nlonger complies with the criteria for membership in the OAS.\n  In the United Nations Charter, for instance, it provides in Article 5 \nthat a member against which preventive or enforcement action has been \ntaken by the Security Council may be suspended from the exercise of the \nrights and privileges of membership. Moreover, Article 6 of the United \nNations Charter provides that a member who has persistently violated \nthe principles of the Charter may, indeed, be expelled from the United \nNations.\n  When we review the Washington Treaty that created NATO, we see that \nit has a provision, article 13, which enables a NATO member to cease to \nbe a party 1 year after notice has been given by it, but the treaty \ndoes not contain any provision or process for the suspension of a \nmember nation. And, I think that it should. Specifically, I believe \nthat the NATO treaty should provide for a mechanism to suspend the \nmembership of a NATO member if that member no longer adheres to the \nprinciples of the Washington Treaty. Like the recent amendment to the \nCharter of the Organization of American States, the suspension of a \nNATO member, I believe, should require the affirmative vote of two-\nthirds of the members of NATO.\n\n  I want to quickly add, this proposal that we add a suspension \nprovision to the NATO Charter is not aimed at any of the current member \ncountries. It is not aimed at Poland or Hungary or the Czech Republic. \nIt is not aimed at any of the nine other members that sought NATO \nmembership or any other nations that may be contemplating seeking \nmembership in NATO in the future. It is simply a mechanism which is \nneeded in any collective security agreement to assure that if a member \nof that collective security pact no longer adheres to the fundamental \nprinciples which bind that pact, that the other members should have a \nmechanism to suspend the country which is no longer adhering to the \nfundamental principles.\n  At the Armed Services Committee's hearing with Secretaries Albright \nand Cohen, I listed several major issues that the Senate would have to \nconsider in the course of our examination of the wisdom of NATO \nenlargement. One of those issues was, ``Should the United States \nconsider the security of Central European nations one of our Nation's \nvital interests, so that we would go to war if their security is \nthreatened?''\n  That is not the only issue, but it is a central issue. And I, for \none, am not ready to put the lives of American youth at risk for a \nnation unless that nation adheres to the principles of the Washington \nTreaty: democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. If there is \na nation in NATO now or that might be added later that no longer \nadheres to those fundamental principles, then I believe there should be \na mechanism in NATO to suspend that country so that we are not bound \ncollectively to go to the defense of a nation that doesn't adhere to \nthe fundamental principles which bind NATO.\n  Accordingly, I believe that the Senate should add a condition to its \nratification of the accession of new members and that condition be that \nthe North Atlantic Treaty be amended to enable NATO to suspend one of \nits members on the affirmative two-thirds vote of the NATO countries.\n  I thank the Chair for her patience tonight. I don't think any motion \nor other action on my part is appropriate. So I simply yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/29/senate-section/article/S11389-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
