Today's prayer will be offered by the \nguest Chaplain, Levi Shemtov, Rabbi, Director of the Washington Office, \nAmerican Friends of Lubavitch, Washington, DC. Glad to have you with \nus.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The guest Chaplain, Rabbi Levi Shemtov, Director of the Washington \nOffice, American Friends of Lubavitch, offered the following prayer:\n  Almighty God, our Father in Heaven, bless and grace this august body, \nthe United States Senate. Fill this Chamber and through it the Nation \nwith the strength of Your sovereignty and the power of Your comfort. \nMay the Members of this body and its officers strive always to glorify \nYour name and through their devotion to You and true service to the \ninhabitants of the Nation.\n  As the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah) approaches, commemorating the \nanniversary of Your creation of man, we stand before You while You sit \nin judgment. May this feeling of our ultimate need for mercy pervade \nour lives, and may we judge each other at least as favorably as we \nwould like to be judged ourselves.\n  As our Nation faces tremendous challenges, we also possess a deep, \nenormous faith and capacity for healing. The Senate, reflecting the \nNation, comprises men and women from various political, cultural, and \nreligious backgrounds. We are thankful for the freedom to bring various \nviews, but as we debate the significant issues of the day, let us \nremember the words of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. \nSchneerson, of blessed memory, who taught, ``the only way to soothe the \ndifferences between two sides is to seek how we are ultimately all on \nthe same side.''\n  Three hundred years ago, the Great Baal Shem Tov, founder of \nChassidism, taught us that in every experience lies Divine Providence, \ngiving man the ability to find and develop divinity in seemingly \neveryday activities. As the officers and Members of the Senate and \ntheir staffs go about their noble task of legislating the path for our \nNation, with the will of the people, please let them see in their work \nnot just mere political activity but divine endeavor, nothing less than \npartnership with God in perfecting the world, bringing redemption to \nall of mankind.\n  A happy and a healthy new year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are still consulting with both sides to \nsee if we will be able to go forward this morning. It is Thursday \nmorning and it seems to me this would be a good time to make some \nlegislative progress on the people's business. We had great difficulty \nyesterday, trying to schedule votes around Senators' own interests \nwhich I thought, in many instances, were inappropriate. I urge my \ncolleagues to not put their own conveniences over the interests of the \npeople's business or their other 99 colleagues.\n  Also, while there are obviously distractions and disagreements on \nwhat should be the business of the Senate, there are some things that \nwe can do and should do. Unfortunately, yesterday we were not able to \neven go forward with debate because we could not get an agreement as to \nhow to proceed on the issues. We have a unanimous consent agreement \nthat we reached last Thursday that seemed to be fair and satisfactory \nto one and all on how to proceed on the bankruptcy reform legislation, \nincluding, at the insistence of the Senator from Massachusetts, a vote \non a minimum wage.\n  We agreed that we would have a vote as soon as we took up the \nbankruptcy bill, we would have 2 hours of debate on minimum wage and \nthen a vote. The Senator indicated he had hoped we would do that in the \nmorning, rather than late at night, and we have wanted to try to \naccommodate that. But when we said, OK, good, Thursday morning, we will \nstart at 9:30, we will do the debate, have a vote at 11:30 on minimum \nwage, he indicated he didn't want to do that.\n  So I don't know. I understand maybe he has a press conference at the \nWhite House, but he has to make a decision here. You know, are we going \nto go for press conferences, or are we going to go for the vote on \nsomething he says is very important to him, the minimum wage issue? I \nassume he will be here later and we will get something worked out as to \nhow to proceed on that. In the\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\nmeanwhile, I hope we can go ahead and go forward with bankruptcy, \nbankruptcy amendments. We have a list that we agreed to, amendments \nthat are not subject to second-degree.\n  There was a misunderstanding about one of them, and the sponsor of \nthat amendment has very graciously agreed to not offer that amendment, \nSenator Hatch, on the intellectual properties issue. And there are some \nother controversial issues that we are going to work together on in a \nbipartisan way.\n  So I hope we would try to make some progress on that. Senator Durbin \nis here, one of the sponsors of the bankruptcy reform bill. Senator \nGrassley is right here ready to go. So as soon as we can get a \nconfirmation that we were able to get together on that, we will make \nthat announcement to Members.\n  I might say, we should expect votes on amendments throughout the day. \nAnd, from 2 to 6 this afternoon, we will have the debate on the \npartial-birth abortion ban veto override. And then we hope to come back \nto the bankruptcy after that, and then have a couple of votes tonight \non amendments--one or two or three, whatever--that we can stack, so \nthat Members will know when those votes would occur.\n  Let me read here now the unanimous consent that we have worked out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10451-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1301 AND THE VETO MESSAGE TO ACCOMPANY \n                    THE PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to S. 1301 under the provisions of the consent agreement of \nSeptember 11. I further ask that at 2 p.m., the bill be laid aside and \nthere be 4 hours for debate, equally divided, on the veto message to \naccompany the partial-birth abortion bill, with speakers alternating \nbetween the proponents and opponents.\n  I further ask that at 6 p.m. the Senate resume consideration of S. \n1301.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, \nSeptember 18, there be 1 hour for debate, equally divided, on the \nabortion veto message and a vote occur at 9:30 a.m. on the question: \nShall the bill pass, the objections of the President to the contrary \nnotwithstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation getting this \ntime agreed to.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor to the managers of the \nlegislation, I do want to take just a moment of leader time to make a \nplea for Senators, once again, to consider very carefully how they will \nvote this afternoon on the partial-birth abortion ban issue.\n  The vote will be close. We need 67 Senators to override that veto. I \nbelieve there is no more important issue that we will vote on this \nentire year. I don't see how any Senator can defend this procedure.\n  I took the time while I was home, about a year ago, to talk to Dr. \nJulius Bosco, the OB/GYN who delivered both of my own children. \nOriginally from Brooklyn, NY, he was in the Air Force as a doctor, came \nto Keesler Air Force Base, married a local girl, and we couldn't get \nrid of him--he stayed. He is a great doctor and a great man. I asked \nhim, Dr. Bosco, are there any circumstances at any time, any \njustification for this procedure being used? And he said, ``Never.''\n  Three Senators hold the results of this veto override in their hands, \nand it will weigh on their conscience. I hope that the Senate will \noverride this veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10452-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10452-S10454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 3595 to amendment No. \n     3559.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our procedure today is we have the \nmanagers' amendment pending. We will lay this amendment aside from time \nto time as Members come over to offer amendments. I am going to visit \nwith Senator Durbin on procedure. So, in the meantime, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2489 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We hope very much that Members on both sides of the \naisle will come to the floor and offer amendments on the bankruptcy \nbill. Both sides have reached an agreement on the number of amendments \nto be offered. All we have to have is time agreements on those \namendments, and if a vote is necessary on those amendments, have a \nvote.\n  Senator Durbin has worked very hard with me for his part, for the \nDemocratic Members, as I have for the Republican Members, to get a very \ngood bankruptcy bill before this body. It was hard work for the last \nyear putting a bill together. I really appreciate his cooperation, \nincluding getting it through the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16-2, \nthen additionally accommodating some other Members who are not on the \nJudiciary Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over bankruptcy.\n  We accommodated several Members, both on the Judiciary Committee and \nnot on the Judiciary Committee, through the consideration of their \namendments in some negotiating sessions we had last week to limit the \nnumber of amendments, also to accept, as I have indicated, in the \nmanagers' amendment many of the ideas that people have.\n  So since Senator Durbin and I have worked together in a cooperative \nand very much bipartisan way on this legislation, we hope that at these \nalmost midnight hours of this session, as well as midnight hours of the \nconsideration of this legislation through the process of a year and a \nhalf, that we would not have Members stalling by not coming to the \nfloor and offering their amendments.\n  So we hope very much that people will come over and do that. We are \nready for those considerations. The floor leaders of both parties very \nmuch want to see this legislation pass. And we ought to do that \nbecause, as Senator Durbin and I have described for the Members of this \nbody, there is very much a need for this legislation, and particularly \nsince we have this tradition of bipartisanship on the issue of \nbankruptcy, not only between Senator Durbin and myself but historically \nover the last decade and a half between his predecessor, Senator \nHeflin, now retired from the Senate, and myself. We want to keep that \ntradition going. There is just now the one simple process of Members \ncoming over here and offering amendments that we have all agreed should \nbe considered.\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\n  There is no controversy at this point, except should an amendment be \nadopted or not. There is no controversy of whether or not this bill \nshould eventually come to a vote. There is no controversy about what \namendments should be offered. Hopefully, there is no controversy over \nhow long we should discuss these amendments--a thorough discussion but \nwith time limits--and eventually get this bill passed and get it to the \nconference committee. There Senator Durbin and I are going to need a \nlot of time.\n  There is a tremendous difference between our bill and the House bill. \nSenator Durbin and I need the rest of this session. And we hope that \nthe rest of this session that we are talking about isn't October 1. We \nhope it is from this date of September 17 to the end of the session to \nwork out the differences between the House and Senate. So that is why \nwe want Members to come.\n  In the meantime, I say to Senator Durbin, I thought I would --yes, \nlet me yield to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I note September 17 is an important date in the history \nof the world, because it is the birthday of the Senator from Iowa, and \nI think it is appropriate that we acknowledge that on the floor of the \nSenate, and also give him a great birthday gift by moving this bill \nalong in an efficient manner.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have called the Democratic Senators who have told me \nthey have pending amendments and asked them to come to the floor as \nsoon as possible so that we can start the amendment consideration. \nThere is one amendment which the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, would like to offer relative to the minimum wage which does \nnot relate directly to this bill, but there has been an agreement that \nhe will have that opportunity. I think he will be here within an hour, \nand we can discuss exactly when that amendment might come up.\n  I just say, as I have said before on the floor, it has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Grassley and his staff. I think the way \nthat we resolved over 30 amendments on this might be a good way to \nlegislate. Because literally Senator Grassley and I, with our able \nstaff members, and people from the administration, sat in a room and \nworked through some 30 different amendments.\n  We now have pending about a dozen that were unresolved that we think \nshould be the subject of floor votes. Once those have been voted on, we \nare prepared, I hope, with a good work product to move forward, to pass \na bill, and move to conference to consider a very complicated and \ncomplex area of the law but one so critically important to over a \nmillion Americans each year who file for bankruptcy in the United \nStates.\n  We want to make certain that we keep those bankruptcy courts \navailable for those who have truly reached the end of the rope and have \nabsolutely nowhere to turn; and that, I think, describes the vast \nmajority of people who come to the bankruptcy court. But we also hope \nto tighten the procedures to eliminate those abuses, petitioners who \ncome to court who should not, those who were in court and engaged in \ntactics that, frankly, we do not think should be acceptable.\n  We are also going to try to address in the course of the amendments \nto this bill questions relative to the whole offering of credit cards \nto Americans. I think virtually everyone here today can tell me that \nwhen they go home tonight and open up the mail, they are going to find \nanother credit card solicitation--I see heads nodding in the gallery--\nif you are a normal American. And I am sure they are nodding at home as \nwell.\n  We want to make sure that the credit that is offered in America is \ncredit available to everyone. The democratization of credit in this \ncountry has been a positive thing. But we also want to say to those who \noffer credit: Do it in a responsible way. Be honest in terms of \ndescribing the credit arrangement that you are seeking. Be certain that \nthe people you are dealing with are truly capable of incurring more \ndebt and can get involved in this process with a clear understanding of \ntheir obligation. Make your monthly statements intelligible so people \nwho pay a minimum monthly amount have some idea when it might come to \nan end. Disclose some peculiarities of credit. Am I taking a security \ninterest every time I use my credit card--for the toaster I just \npurchased? All of these things, I think, are relevant and will be \nraised during the course of this.\n\n  One of the Senators is going to offer an amendment which basically \nsays we can declare ``time out.'' If we are tired of credit card \nsolicitations, we ought to be able to call a number and tell them to \ncease and desist, stop bothering us with all these solicitations. I \nthink there is a right in America to be left alone. One of the \namendments that will be offered will address that particular issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa. I am going to make some phone calls \nand encourage our colleagues to come to the floor quickly.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we probably have fewer Republican \nMembers with amendments to offer, but I have also been on the phone to \ntalk to those people, as well, to come to the floor to expedite this \nprocess. The Senate majority leader and Senator minority leader really \nwant this bill to be passed.\n  As I said, we need a long time to conference--our bill is quite a bit \ndifferent from the House bill--to work out the differences and get a \nbill to the President before we adjourn.\n  Mr. President, I would like to discuss several provisions of the \nconsumer bankruptcy reform act which will greatly enhance the ability \nto collect child support from people who owe child support. When the \nJudiciary Committee marked-up the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, I \njoined with Senators Hatch and Kyl to add an amendment to the bill \nwhich would protect and enhance the status of child support claimants \nduring bankruptcy proceedings.\n  The bill, which were reported out of the committee on a bipartisan \nvote of 16-2 now provides that child support obligations must be the \nfirst obligation paid during any bankruptcy proceeding. Under current \nlaw, child support is paid 7th so that often there just aren't funds \navailable to pay to ex-spouses and children. I think that this bill \nwill be tremendously helpful for those who are owed child support.\n  And the National district Attorneys Association agrees with me. This \norganization represents more than 7,000 local prosecutors throughout \nthe United States, many of whom must enforce child support obligations \nunder title IV-D of the Federal Social Security Act.\n  On September 2d, 1998, NDAA President John R. Justice wrote me to \nexpress the association's belief that this legislation will \n``substantially assist'' efforts to collect child support for the \nchildren and spouses of debtors who have filed for bankruptcy. This \nletter went on to note that association supports the act because S. \n1301 contains ``enormous enhancements to support collection remedies'' \nand represents a ``major improvement to the problems facing child \nsupport creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.''\n  The reason it's important to put child support claimants at the top \nof the list during a bankruptcy proceeding is that most bankrupts don't \nhave enough money to fully pay all their creditors. So, somebody's not \ngoing to be paid. This bill makes it more certain that child support \nwill be paid in full before other creditors can collect a penny. That's \nreal progress in making sure that children and former spouses are \ntreated fairly.\n  Also, the amendment accepted by the committee provided that someone \nowed child support can enforce their obligations even against the \nexempt property of a bankruptcy. This means that wealthy bankrupts \ncan't hide their assets in expensive homes or in pension funds as a way \nof stiffing their children or ex-spouse. This is another example of how \nthis legislation will help, not hurt, child support claimants.\n  Outside the bankruptcy context, when there are delinquent child or \nspousal support obligations, State government agencies step in and try \nto collect the child support. S. 1301 exempts these collection efforts \nfrom the automatic stay. The ``automatic stay'' is a court injunction \nwhich automatically arises when anyone declares bankruptcy and it \nprevents creditors from collecting on their debts.\n  But, now, if this legislation passes, State agencies would be in a \nmuch better position to collect past due child\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\nsupport. In practical terms, this means State government agencies \nattempting to collect child support can garnish wages and suspend \ndrivers licenses and professional licenses. Mr. President, clearly, \nthis bill will help State governments catch deadbeats who want to use \nthe bankruptcy system to get out of paying child support.\n  Taken together, these changes will significantly advance protection \nfor child support claimants in the context of bankruptcy proceedings. \nThis is why the National District Attorneys Association, an \norganization which represents many of the prosecutors who must enforce \nchild support obligations, supports this bill. And these changes \nprovide yet another compelling reason to support S. 1301.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I requested some morning business time. It \nis my understanding that our colleague from Minnesota came over and \nasked unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. I also had \nchecked with our dear friend, the Senator from Iowa, about the \npossibility of doing the same. If I wouldn't be delaying the important \nbusiness of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10452-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10454-S10455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS AND THE SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to express some concern about what \nis happening in terms of Federal spending this year; about the fact \nthat now, for two weeks, we have not passed an appropriations bill; \nabout the fact that it is clear from watching the process now that the \nminority, operating strictly within its rights, has held up the passage \nof any of the remaining appropriations bills by simply drowning these \nbills in riders and amendments.\n  We are beginning to hear talk, both in the administration and the \nCongress, about the need for a massive expansion in spending.\n  I decided earlier this week to sit down and look at all the proposals \nthat have been made under the name of ``emergency spending.'' That is \nimportant because, as my colleagues know--the public may not fully \nunderstand--while we have a binding budget, there is a gigantic \nloophole in that budget. That gigantic loophole is, if the President \nand the Congress agree to designate an expenditure ``an emergency,'' it \ndoesn't count.\n  Since President Clinton has been in office, we have had $31.5 billion \nworth of emergency spending. During election years, that level of \nemergency spending has ballooned to a whopping $8.6 billion per \nelection year.\n  Now, in looking at where we are and in looking at the threats of \nvetoing appropriations bills if we don't appropriate as much money as \nthe President has called for, I put together the following list of \nemergency requests that have been made by the President or have been \ndiscussed in the Congress.\n  The first is $2.9 billion for natural disasters. I remind my \ncolleagues that we know at the beginning of every year that we are \ngoing to have disasters.\n  Now, we don't know exactly where they are going to be. We don't know \nwhether they are going to be earthquakes in California, or hurricanes \nin Texas and South Carolina and North Carolina, or floods in the \nDakotas. But we know, based on experience, that every year we are \nspending about $5 billion on disaster relief. But instead of putting \nthe money in the budget so that it is there, instead of setting \npriorities, as any family would, what we do is wait until a disaster \noccurs and then we designate it as an emergency, so we can spend beyond \nour budget. In the President's own words as he stood before the \nCongress in the State of the Union Address, he said: ``Save Social \nSecurity first, don't spend one penny of the surplus, and don't give \nany of it back in tax cuts.''\n  But what we declare spending to be an emergency, it means that we \nare, in fact, spending the surplus and taking money away from Social \nSecurity.\n  Let me go over this list of what is now being called ``emergencies.'' \nThe next item on the list is the fact that we are about to enter a new \ncentury and a new millennium and, in the process, we are going to incur \na computer problem called the ``Y2K problem.'' In other words, the year \n2000 is coming and we are entering a new millennium. Now, is that a \nsurprise? Is anybody shocked that every day we get closer to the year \n2000? Is it news to anybody that we have a potential computer problem \nin the Federal Government? Yet, while we have known about this--in \nfact, we have known from the beginning of the calendar of Julius Caesar \nthat we were going to reach the year 2000. We have known it since the \nancient Greeks. We certainly have known that we had this problem for \nthe last 5 or 6 years. Yet, suddenly, we have a proposal saying that \nthere is an emergency, the year 2000 is coming and there is going to be \na new millennium, so the Federal Government needs an additional $3.25 \nbillion to $5.4 billion. How can anybody say that that is an emergency \nif it is obviously a problem we knew we would have to face? It is \nsomething that we are going to have to face in the year 2000. But why \nshould it not be dealt with within the context of the ordinary budget?\n  Now we hear talk of emergency funding for the census. We are required \nby the Constitution to do a census every 10 years. Surely it doesn't \ncome as a shock to anybody that we have known since 1787 that we are \ngoing to make preparations for doing a census in the year 2000. Yet, \nthere it is, as if somehow there is an emergency in that suddenly we \nhave realized that we have been grossly underfunding the census in \norder to fund other programs, and now we have a funding problem in the \ncensus. But is that a shock or an emergency? I would say no.\n  Suddenly it has been realized that all these cuts we have made in \ndefense are having a detrimental impact on defense. That hardly comes \nas a shock to me, since I and others have spoken out for the last 10 \nyears about the level of cuts in defense readiness. But now we are \nlooking at a potential emergency supplemental appropriation for defense \nreadiness of between $3 billion and $4 billion this year.\n  Now the shock of all shocks: We have troops in Bosnia. You would \nthink that as long as we have had troops in Bosnia, the President would \nhave put in his budget this year funding for the troops in Bosnia. But \nwhat is going to happen in the next 3 weeks is that we are suddenly \ngoing to be awakened to the fact that we have troops in Bosnia and the \nPresident wants an additional $1.9 billion of funding that will be \ndesignated as an ``emergency.'' I submit that it is no emergency that \nwe have troops in Bosnia. I submit that it is not a shock that we have \ntroops in Bosnia. Everybody knows we have troops in Bosnia, and \neveryone has known we have troops in Bosnia. Yet, we are looking at an \nemergency supplemental to fund it.\n  We are also seeing requests--our Democrat colleagues have proposed \nbusting the budget by $7 billion to help agriculture. Others on my side \nof the aisle are talking about $2.7 billion to $3 billion or more. The \nbottom line is this. When you add it all up, we now have serious \ndiscussion at the White House and in the Congress about raising the \ntotal level of spending this year by almost $20 billion. That is $20 \nbillion that we may spend over the level of the budget that we set out \njust last year.\n  I simply want to make several points. First of all, I have, because \nof the work I have done on Social Security, concluded that we would be \nwell advised not to create any new spending and not adopt a tax cut \nuntil we have taken action to fix Social Security. And it is my hope \nthat we can fix Social Security early next year, and the funds that are \nnot required in the surplus to fix Social Security could be given back \nto the taxpayer in the form of substantial tax cuts.\n  My problem is that, having concluded that it would be best to hold \nthe money in the surplus to fix Social Security first, I now see the \nspecter of the Congress and the President spending that money. I want \nto remind my colleagues that for the $20 billion of ``emergency \nspending'' that we are looking at this year, we could repeal the \nmarriage penalty; we could give full deductibility for health insurance \nto all Americans who either don't get it provided by their employer or \nare self-employed; we could provide a change in the Tax Code so that \nfarmers could income average and better shield themselves against the \nkinds of fluctuations in agriculture income that we have; we\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\ncould repeal the earnings test under Social Security. All of those \nthings would cost less as a tax cut than the money we are talking about \nspending on an ``emergency basis.''\n  So I want to conclude by making the following points. No. 1, I intend \nto resist these emergency spending items. If somebody wants to sit down \nand come up with a real emergency, I am willing to look at it. But if \nwe are talking about this kind of spending where we knew it was coming \nbut decided to call it an emergency--and I now understand that the \nPresident is considering designating research and education spending as \nan emergency--if we are talking about this level of spending, I intend \nto resist, and we are going to have to have 60 votes in the Senate if \nthis kind of spending is to occur.\n  Secondly, I have been among those who have publicly stated that we \nshould set aside the budget surplus this year, not spend the money, not \ngive it back in tax cuts, until we fix Social Security. But if the \nother side decides that we are now suddenly going to start spending \nmassive amounts of money, I would much rather give it back to working \nAmericans by cutting their taxes than to see the Federal Government \nspend it, although my first choice is to save the money for Social \nSecurity. I remind my colleagues that the tax burden on working \nfamilies in America at the Federal, State, and local levels is at the \nhighest level in American history.\n  So my two points are: No. 1, I intend to resist this effort to begin \na massive spending spree, the likes of which we have not seen in a \ndecade. No. 2, if this effort continues to have the government spend \nthe surplus, the argument that we must wait to do tax cuts is over. If \nwe are going to see one group in Congress try to spend the surplus, \nwhile asking those of us who believe it should be safe for Social \nSecurity but who also believe that giving it back to the taxpayer is a \nmuch higher and better use than seeing the Government spend it, then \nthat argument is over.\n  So I wanted to alert my colleagues to this problem. I hope that we \ncan serve the public better than we would be if we simply ignite a new \nspending spree, because for the first time since 1969 we have a \nsurplus.\n  I think that is wrongheaded policy.\n  Let me say also to the threats that the administration might veto \nappropriations bills if we don't spend enough money that I think the \nCongress should stay in session, pass appropriations bills at \nreasonable and responsible levels, and, if the President wants to veto \nthem, let him veto them. And then we can be here and we can pass them \nagain; then pass them again, pass them again. I believe at some point \nthat the public would awaken to the fact that this is a debate about \nhow much money is being spent, and thats what we are seeing here is a \nvery subtle blackmail where the administration says, ``If you do not \nspend more money, I am going to veto bills, and I am going to shut down \nthe Government.''\n  I believe, if we will stand our ground on fiscal principle, if we \nwill save the surplus for Social Security, that we will serve the \npublic interest well. But, if the money is going to be spent--if that \nis the alternative--then I would much rather move ahead with a major \ntax cut and give the money back to the American worker than to see the \nGovernment spend it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3596 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4  . PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN ACTIONS FOR FAILURE TO INCUR \n                   FINANCE CHARGES.\n\n       Section 106 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1605) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) Prohibition on Certain Actions for Failure To Incur \n     Finance Charges.--A creditor may not, solely because a \n     consumer has not incurred finance charges in connection with \n     an extension of credit--\n       ``(1) refuse to renew or continue to offer the extension of \n     credit to that consumer; or\n       ``(2) charge a fee to that consumer in lieu of a finance \n     charge.''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would prohibit credit card \ncompanies from terminating a customer's account or imposing a penalty \nsolely because the customer pays his or her bill on time and in full \neach month. It seems amazing but there are actually some companies out \nthere that will terminate credit because the borrower, the debtor, pays \nthe full amount each and every month on time.\n  This amendment is narrowly tailored and would not otherwise affect \nthe ability of the credit card company to terminate accounts or charge \nany fees or do anything with respect to penalties, but it would \nrestrict and, indeed, eliminate this practice of terminating the best \ncreditors that they have simply because they are not making any money \non finance charges.\n  I am offering this amendment in response to this very troubling \npractice which finds many credit card companies discriminating against \nthe most responsible borrowers, those who pay their balances on time \neach and every month. Specifically, several companies have started to \nterminate a customer's card or impose a penalty if the customer pays \nhis or her credit card bill in full each month.\n  For example, in my home State of Rhode Island, many consumers with a \ncredit card issued by a popular national discount store were alarmed to \nreceive letters which stated:\n\n       Our records indicate this account has had no finance \n     charges assessed in the last 12 months. Unfortunately, the \n     expense incurred by our company to maintain and service your \n     account has become prohibitive, and as a result, in \n     accordance with the terms of your cardholder agreement, we \n     are not reissuing your credit card.\n\n  One couple who received this letter has been married for 49 years and \nhad never been late on any mortgage payment or denied any loan or been \nlate in any type of credit arrangement that they had. Yet, with this \nnote, the company was informing them that they were effectively being \ndenied credit solely because they were responsible borrowers.\n\n  Now, the message from credit card companies in this case is if you \nare too good a risk we won't give you any credit. That is illogical \nand, I think, should not be the practice of these companies.\n\n[[Page S10456]]\n\n In fact, this practice is contrary to the goals of S. 1301, which is \nto promote responsible borrowing practices and reward those who are \nresponsible in their borrowing practices. By penalizing borrowers who \npay off their bills each month, it seems that some credit card \ncompanies are, in fact, advocating the type of behavior which S. 1301 \nis designed to discourage.\n  I am not moved by the claims of these companies that say they need to \ncancel accounts which do not incur financial charges because the cost \nof servicing these accounts is prohibitive. Industry data suggests it \ncosts issuers about $25 annually to service an account. But issuers are \nable to offset this cost through an interchange fee of approximately 2 \npercent charged to merchants on each transaction. Each year, on \naverage, $3,000 is charged to a credit card. This 2-percent interchange \nfee on these charges equals about $60 which would seem to more than \ncover the cost of these accounts. Moreover, with Americans holding over \n$450 billion in consumer debt and with an average interest rate on \ncredit card balances at 17.7 percent, the overall profitability of \ncredit card lending is obvious and apparent.\n  This amendment is a narrowly crafted measure which is designed to \nprohibit credit card companies from discriminating against the most \nresponsible borrowers. For this reason, the amendment would clearly \nadvance the goals of S. 1301 to promote more responsible credit card \npractices.\n  I see no reason why my colleagues would oppose it. I therefore ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. At the appropriate time I will \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, because we have about 12 amendments \npending on this bill, I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \ncoming over here and helping to expedite the process of the Senate on a \nvery important bill. I thank Senator Reed for coming over and doing \nthat.\n  Having said that, knowing the personality of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, that he is very sincere about his position and very sincere in \ndetermining that this is a problem to needs to be dealt with, I suggest \nthere are two issues relating to this amendment. One would be the \nimmediate issue of whether or not it is needed; second, the extent to \nwhich this really falls in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking \nCommittee.\n  I don't find fault with the Senator from Rhode Island offering this \namendment to my bill, but a reason for my opposition is that I do not \nlike to usurp the authority of other committees.\n  I think experience has shown that price controls, as indicated in \nthis amendment, are counterproductive. In the end they are very harmful \nto the people they are trying to help, particularly the consumer, and \nin addition to that, somewhat harmful to the general economy.\n  I feel this amendment should be opposed. This amendment has the \ndestabilizing effect of imposing price controls on credit card lenders \nby prohibiting the imposition of a fee or canceling the account of an \naccount holder because the account has not incurred financial charges.\n  The credit card industry is extraordinarily competitive. People might \nnot realize it--on the other hand, they might realize it because they \nget so many of these solicitations--but in the banking industry alone, \nthere are 6,000 credit card issuers. They are all in competition, \ncompeting with each other for new credit card holders. Everybody here \non the Senate floor right now is in somebody's computer and in a few \ndays they will get some sort of a solicitation. That is how competitive \nit is. Whether that is right or wrong is another thing, but the \ncompetitive environment makes that determination.\n  This intense competition provides consumers with enormous benefits. \nFor instance, it has resulted in a decline of the average credit card \ninterest rate in the past several years. Just as important, the \ncompetition results in industry choice for the consumer. As I said, \nconsumers can choose from literally thousands of different cards, each \nwith a different array of pricing and benefit features.\n  As a result, the extraordinarily competitive environment in which \ncredit card issuers operate, consumer credit actually dictates credit \ncard prices much more efficiently than we can do through almost any \nFederal law. Any lender who offers undesirable pricing features will \nswiftly fall behind the competition because the consumers can and will \nchoose other products. By contrast, this amendment would harm consumers \nby restricting consumer choice.\n  In addition, we have a record going back to 1991 when another \nSenator--still a Member of this body--tried to impose price controls on \nlenders and it precipitated a severely negative impact on the stock \nmarket. For example, in 1991, when the Senate opposed price controls on \ncredit card lenders in the form of an interest rate ceiling, the stock \nmarket reacted, dropping 120 points in a single day. Clearly, in this \ntime of already volatile market activity, we don't want to repeat \nthings of that nature. I am not suggesting that would be what would \nhappen in the case of the amendment that is before the Senate, but, \nobviously, we should be very cautious.\n\n  Now, probably a more important point for Members to consider in \nsupporting or not supporting this amendment would be, as I said, \nwhether it is in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee. We \nhave the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, chairing the \nSubcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Banking Committee. He has \nindicated to me that he will hold hearings on credit card solicitation \npractices and also on lending practices.\n  I know many Members feel the credit card companies have been sloppy \nand overly aggressive in the way they offer credit. I say there is \nsubstance to that argument. That is why I have appreciated my comanager \nof this bill, Senator Durbin, bringing this to our attention as part of \nthis legislation. I think it has been amply discussed, and I share some \nof those concerns as well. I do think it is more appropriate for the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to do that. I am certainly not here to tell \nMembers that credit card companies have been totally responsible in the \nway that they offer credit. But the fact is that these are issues which \nneed to be explored by the authorizing standing committee and its \nsubcommittee.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island is a Banking Committee \nissue. We happen to have before the Senate a bankruptcy bill which came \nout of the Judiciary Committee where we don't have the expertise that \nwe ought to have on this issue. I would like to follow the regular \norder of the Senate and let the subcommittee with real expertise \nexamine this.\n  I have a letter from Senator Faircloth that I wish the Senator from \nRhode Island would consider. It is addressed to me.\n\n       It is my understanding that a number of amendments relating \n     to credit cards will be offered to S. 1301. Most, if not all, \n     of these amendments will relate to matters in the \n     jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I Chair the Financial \n     Institutions Subcommittee of the Banking Committee.\n       I share the concerns that many have regarding multiple \n     credit card solicitations and solicitations to minors. In \n     fact earlier this year, my Subcommittee held a hearing on \n     bankruptcy issues, with representatives of the credit card \n     industry testifying. I have requested and received GAO \n     reports on such practices as high loan to value loans and \n     the sending of ``live'' loan checks.\n       As for many of the proposed amendments relating, however, \n     none have been passed by the Committee. In fact, none have \n     been considered by the Committee. Further, none of the \n     proponents of the amendments have requested hearings on any \n     of their legislative proposals.\n       During consideration of the bankruptcy bill, please know \n     that I would be more than willing to hold a hearing or \n     hearings on any of these proposals in my Subcommittee where \n     they rightfully should be considered under regular order.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Lauch Faircloth,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                           Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.\n\n  I give that to my colleagues for consideration. Again, I thank the \nSenator from Rhode Island for coming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \ncomments and for his leadership, along with our\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. I have a few comments in \nresponse to his very thoughtful commentary.\n  First, the jurisdiction of the committee when it gets to the floor, \nit has been my limited experience, is somewhat fluid. In fact, in this \nbill we are amending the Truth in Lending Act, which has ramifications \nin both the Judiciary Committee and the Banking Committee. I think, to \nbe very scrupulous about jurisdictional responsibilities here, we \nmissed the opportunity to do something which most of our colleagues, I \nhope, would recognize is an appropriate thing to do--preventing the \ntermination of credit to people who simply pay their bills on time.\n  The second aspect of this debate, which I think is appropriate to \nhave in this bill, is that the driving force for this legislation comes \nvery powerfully from the credit card industry. They are concerned that \nmany individual consumers seek bankruptcy because of their huge credit \ncard debts, and they feel that they are currently disadvantaged with \nthe present system. So, again, I don't think it is inappropriate as we \nlook at this bankruptcy system and, in many respects, test the credit \ncard industry and look at some of their practices. This practice is \nparticularly disturbing--again, that somebody's credit would be \nterminated simply because they paid on time.\n  Another aspect that the Senator from Iowa mentioned was the \nsuggestion that this is, in some way, price controls. I think that is a \nvery, very long stretch--to look at this amendment which says you can't \nterminate an individual because they pay on time--that is a far cry \nfrom imposing limits on how much could be charged in terms of fees, \npenalties; and, clearly, I make no attempt to do that. I would never \nsuggest that we do that in this amendment. I point out that in fact \nthere are existing situations, in State law certainly, usury statutes, \nwhich do impose fees and caps on what a credit card company can charge. \nThat is not the intent nor the specificity of this amendment.\n  This simply says that it should not be permissible for a company to \nterminate an individual who has paid promptly, solely for the fact that \nthat individual has paid promptly. If the individual is in arrears, if \nthe individual has done something else to violate the agreement, then \nthat is grounds, but not prompt payment; that should not be grounds.\n  Ultimately, let me get back to the initial point I made. At the heart \nof this legislation--and, again, the Senator from Iowa and his \ncolleagues have done much to make sure this was at the core--was to try \nto reinstill a sense of responsibility among borrowers that we will not \ntolerate people who game the system, who use bankruptcy as a shield for \ntheir irresponsibility. To me, it is extremely ironic that we would be \ntalking about a situation here where I am attempting to recognize and \nprotect the continued extension of credit to the most responsible \nborrowers we have in the country, the ones who pay on time every month \nand don't use this system to be irresponsible.\n  So I hope my colleagues can recognize the merits within this \nparticular amendment and support it.\n  On a final point, I note that today is the birthday of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I thank you for working overtime on your birthday on this \nmeasure, Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon today the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Reed amendment number \n3596. I further ask that at 11:55 there be 5 minutes for debate equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Recently, some credit card issuers have started to discriminate \nagainst people who pay off their account balances each month, and, \ntherefore, don't incur finance charges for the credit card purchases. \nThese issuers charge such customers a monthly fee, or they actually \nterminate the customer's account.\n  The Reed amendment would prohibit credit card issuers from charging a \nfee, or terminating an account based solely on the customer's failure \nto go into debt to incur finance charges.\n  Let me tell you why I think this is a good idea.\n  Industry experts have concluded that many issuers of these cards have \nbeen actively discouraging consumers from paying off balances by \nlowering their monthly minimum payments, and, in some cases, requiring \nas little as 2 percent of the balance on their credit card debt each \nmonth. Think of how long it would take to pay off your credit card \nunder such circumstances. At such a rate, it could take 34 years, in \nfact, to pay off a $2,500 credit card balance, with payments totalling \n300 percent of the original principal.\n  In fact, about 40 percent of American credit card holders pay their \nbalances in full each month, thus incurring no interest charges. Such \n``convenience users'' are considered freeloaders by these credit card \ncompanies--even deadbeats. They want people to go into debt. They want \nus to pay finance charges as much as possible every single month. Some \ncredit card companies charge annual fees and other techniques to \ndiscourage this type of credit card use.\n  I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island is a \ngood one. I will support it on the floor. I believe that the credit \ncard companies should understand that if some people are unable to make \ntheir monthly payments, and thus, incur additional expenses, so, too, \nthere are people who really do pay off their debts as they are \nincurred, and in so doing these people should not be penalized.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10455-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10457-S10459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          211TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I look about at my distinguished \ncolleagues seated in the august Senate chamber, I find myself mentally \ntransported to another gathering of distinguished leaders, in another \nelegant chamber, that occurred exactly two hundred and eleven years ago \ntoday.\n  The date was Monday, September 17; the setting, the Philadelphia \nState House. It had been a long, hot summer, and only 38 of the 55 \ndelegates attending the Constitutional Convention were still in \nattendance. One can imagine the commingled sense of pride, nervous \nexcitement, and exhaustion that filled these men as they filed into the \nState House chamber and took their seats. For awaiting them that day \nwas a task that they must have eagerly anticipated for several months--\nand that many of them feared might never arrive. It was to be the \nfruition of their diligent, patient, frustrating summer of debate, \ndiscussion, and dispute. Finally, they would put their signatures to \nthe document, freshly copied on parchment in neat script, that they\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\nhad spent the summer composing. And so it was that, after a protracted \nand at times painful labor, on September 17, 1787, the Constitution was \nsigned. Today, this document, little changed since its creation in \nPhiladelphia, celebrates its 211th birthday.\n  Before the signing ceremony took place, Benjamin Franklin rose to \nspeak one last time to his colleagues. Some of them still had \nreservations about the document that the Convention had drafted, and \nFranklin, as he had so often that summer, used his customary self-\ndeprecating charm and understated wisdom to try to win them over. \nAcknowledging that the draft Constitution might well contain some \n``faults,'' Franklin added, however:\n\n       I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain may \n     be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble \n     a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, \n     you inevitably assemble with those men, all their prejudices, \n     their passions, their errors of opinion, their local \n     interests, and their selfish views. From such an Assembly can \n     a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, \n     Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as \n     it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies, who are \n     waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are \n     confounded like those of the Builders of Babel. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I, too, continue to be astonished at the perfection of \nthis document. The more I study it, the more I see it in action--as we \nall do here, on a daily basis--the more I marvel at the handiwork of \nthose 55 men in Philadelphia. What transpired that summer in \nPhiladelphia's State House was truly one of the great events in the \nhistory of this Republic--it is not a democracy; it is a Republic--or \nin the history of the world. Indeed, it is no stretch to call this \nConstitution, as Gladstone did, ``the most wonderful work ever struck \noff at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.''\n  Part of the strength of the Constitution lies in its ability to \naccommodate situations and developments that the Framers could never \nhave anticipated. Just as Seneca tells us that the test of a strong man \nis adversity, so the true test of the Constitution may be how well it \nhandles the unexpected. So far, Mr. President, the Constitution has \npassed that test with flying colors. It has seen us through two \ncenturies of staggering technological, economic, social, and political \ntransformations.\n  We may well be entering a new period of upheaval which will further \ntest the Constitution's strength and elasticity. Some have even \nsuggested that we are entering ``a constitutional crisis.'' I, for one, \nhave greater faith in the Framers' handiwork. The Constitution sets up \na clear process for investigating and resolving allegations of \nwrongdoing by the Executive and other civil officers. The House is \nassigned the power of impeachment and the Senate the power to try \nimpeachments. The current situation may well not result in impeachment, \nbut if it does--and that is just one possibility--then I am confident \nthat, as long as we in the House and the Senate fulfill our \nconstitutional duties solemnly and judiciously, we will see the nation \nthrough this and any future difficulties.\n  Sadly, just as current events reaffirm the importance of knowing and \nfollowing constitutional processes and procedures, a new poll indicates \nthat America's youth are largely ignorant of the Constitution and its \norigins. It seems that every few months a new poll appears which plumbs \nthe depths of ignorance among some of our children. Each time, we hope \nthat we have finally reached the bottom of the abyss; each time, we are \ndisappointed when a new survey a little later indicates that the depths \nare deeper and darker than we ever realized.\n  The latest sounding of the depths comes to us through the courtesy of \na poll by the National Constitution Center, which shows that while \nAmerican teenagers are Rhodes Scholars in popular culture, in many \ninstances many are sadly deficient in matters constitutional. The study \nfound that by a wide margin, 59 percent to 41 percent, more American \nteenagers can name the Three Stooges than can name the three branches \nof government. Less than 3 percent of teens could name the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court, while almost 95 percent could name the \ntelevision actor who played the ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.'' And less \nthan one-third could name the Speaker of the House, while almost 9 of \n10 could name the star of the T.V. show ``Home Improvement.''\n  It gets worse, Mr. President. Why, just one-quarter of the teens \ncould name the city in which the Constitution was written! Only one-\nquarter knew what the 5th Amendment protects. Only 21% knew how many \nSenators there are. And less than half knew the name given to the first \nten amendments.\n  These should not be difficult questions to answer. This is not a \nmatter of knowing whether the Constitution allows states to grant \nletters of Marque and Reprisal--it doesn't--or citing cases over which \nthe Supreme Court has original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction. \nOne should not need a degree in constitutional history, or a course in \nconstitutional law, to know the name of the Speaker of the House. \nIndeed, answering many of the questions I cited requires only a cursory \nfamiliarity with current events. What's more, over half of the teens \ninterviewed said they read or listen to the news for at least 15 \nminutes daily, over half said their teachers discuss politics at least \na few times a week, and yet, only a handful could recall the names of \nNewt Gingrich or William Rehnquist.\n  Where does the fault lie, Mr. President? With our schools, for \nfailing to provide students with the most rudimentary background in \ncivics and government? With the media, for its shallow and trivializing \ncoverage of important issues? Or with parents, for failing to prepare \ntheir children for their responsibilities as citizens? With the entire \nnational culture, for placing greater emphasis on the fashion tips of \nsupermodels and the escapades of rock stars than on the accomplishments \nand heroics of great men and women of the past and present?\n  Perhaps all of these entities must share some responsibility for this \nsad state of affairs. But my purpose today, Mr. President, is not to \ncast blame. I speak not in anger but in sadness, out of a concern for \nthe welfare of our country and the future generations which will assume \nits leadership. This country will not long continue to occupy its \nunique position among the nations of the world if it does not \nadequately prepare its children to pick up the reins of power that the \nolder generations currently wield. We need to prepare our children to \nbe active, informed, involved citizens. We need to make them aware of \nhow our governmental system operates and what part they play within it. \nWe need, in short, to teach them about the Constitution.\n  For it is the Constitution that lays out the Federal system of \ngovernment. It is the Constitution that establishes the separation of \ncertain powers and the sharing of other powers among three distinct but \noverlapping branches of government, and between one Federal and \nmultiple State governments. The Constitution is the secular bible of \nthis Republic, and, given its importance, its brevity, and its \naccessibility, it is not too much to expect that every citizen have at \nleast a passing familiarity with it.\n  Even this is not enough, however. The Constitution, as I suggested at \nthe beginning, is the product of a particularly momentous course of \nevents. Simply reading the words of the Constitution without knowing \nsomething of those events is like learning about World War I by reading \nthe Treaty of Versailles. We cannot teach our children to understand \nand respect this document unless they learn its history. They must \nlearn about the considerable intellectual and physical energy that \nthose 55 men at Philadelphia expended in drafting this document. They \nshould read some of those debates, and they should read The Federalist \nPapers and discover for themselves the principles, hopes, and fears \nthat motivated the Framers.\n  For the Constitution was not simply handed down to us as the Old \nTestament God handed down the Commandments to Moses. To believe that \nwould be a disservice to the remarkable men who toiled long and hard to \nproduce the document. The Constitution is our tangible connection with \nthose men, and with the founding events of this Republic some two \ncenturies ago.\n  So, I close where I began: with 38 men gathered in a room at the \nPhiladelphia State House some 211 years ago. While they may not have \nfully appreciated the moment of the occasion--\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\nhow could they?--they had some inkling of it. And, of course, it was \nFranklin again who best captured the spirit of the moment. Gazing at \nthe back of the President's chair, upon which the sun had been painted, \nFranklin commented:\n\n       I have often and often in the course of the Session, and \n     the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, \n     looked at that behind the President without being able to \n     tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I \n     have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a \n     setting Sun.\n\n  Today, 211 years later, that sun continues to be in the ascendant. I \nhope and pray that it will remain so for another 211 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10457-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10459-S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3596\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Reed amendment, No. 3596. Who \nyields time? The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is a very straightforward \none. It would prohibit credit card companies from penalizing or \nterminating customers who pay their bills on time.\n  The core principle of this bankruptcy legislation that we are \ndebating today is responsible borrowing, and being responsible for your \ndebts. Here, we have a population of the most responsible borrowers, \nthose who pay their bills timely and full each and every month. But \nwhat is happening is that there is a growing movement among credit card \ncompanies to penalize these individuals or to terminate their credit \narrangements. I think it is wrong and I think we should do something \nabout it here today.\n  The credit card industry claims it is too expensive to maintain these \naccounts. Frankly, if you look at the charges that they receive from \nmerchants on each transaction, the very substantial interest rate that \nthey charge for outstanding balances, and also the membership fees \nwhich now seem to be ubiquitous, those claims seem to be very hollow. \nIndeed, this should be an issue about not only responsibility but \nfairness, and also about whether we really do believe that if people \nconduct their lives appropriately, pay their bills on time, are \nresponsible, that they should end up being penalized.\n  If we are talking, today, in this legislation, about responsible \nborrowing, how can we allow the most responsible borrowers in our \nsociety, ones who pay their bills each and every month, to be punished \nby these credit card companies?\n  I urge adoption of this amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  We have the chairman of the appropriate subcommittee willing to work \nwith Senator Reed to address this problem in the Banking Committee. My \nopposition to this is not so much a matter of substance but of \nprocedure and not usurping the authority of that committee. It does \nneed to be studied. I can tell you that in the Grassley-Durbin \namendment, we have enhanced disclosure requirements to help consumers.\n  While I respect the Senator's view on price controls, my view is that \nforcing a credit card company to offer credit when it has made a \nbusiness determination that it would lose money will only force \nincreased prices on other consumers. This is something that the Banking \nCommittee needs to take a very serious look at and do it before we do \nsomething that may help some but may also hurt others.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask that this amendment be tabled after \nthe Senator from Alabama speaks. I yield my remaining time to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 1 minute 58 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The effect of this will be to require mandatory lending at no \npossible profit for a credit card company. We have 6,000 credit card \nissuers today. They are all providing different services; some charge a \nfee and you have to pay monthly, others don't. It is just not right for \nus, without a hearing, to even impose on a credit card company a duty \nto lend money in a way in which they will never be able to make a \nreturn.\n  I don't think we need to be entering into wage-and-price controls. We \nhave a very vigorous free market, and, for the first time, interest \nrates are beginning to come down because we do have a lot of credit \ncard companies competing out there. I think we ought not to intervene \nat this time. This is an unwise amendment. I understand the motivation \nbehind it. It is not appropriate, and I oppose it strongly at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-nine seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The credit card companies make a great deal of money even on those \nindividuals who pay their bills on time. They have membership fees, \nfees from merchants when the transaction is processed, and they have \nadditional ways to acquire fees.\n  I do not think it is a question of forcing an enterprise to give \nmoney away. What it is is a situation in which the credit card \ncompanies have come to us and said, ``There are all these irresponsible \nborrowers out there; we have to amend the bankruptcy laws so we are \nprotected.'' Yet, when we point out they are punishing responsible \nborrowers, they rise up and say, ``That is an imposition on us.''\n  If we believe in responsible borrowing, we should support this \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 3595, offered by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nHollings) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3596) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent we now move to the D'Amato \namendment, regarding ATMs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As soon as this is disposed of--which we don't think \nwill take very long--we will move to the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now move \nto the consideration of Senator D'Amato's amendment to the bankruptcy \nbill, and immediately upon disposing of that, which we hope to do \nfairly shortly, we move then to the Dodd amendment, and we would have \n40 minutes on the Dodd amendment, evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and to inquire of the \nmanaging Member, there would be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is in the agreement. We have to certify which \namendment it is.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I notify the managing Member that it is the \namendment on the credit card age limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, is there going to be a \ntime limitation on the D'Amato amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We felt that Senator D'Amato would offer his amendment, \nand then I will move to table.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there a time limitation?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. There is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are \nsupposed to conclude by 2 p.m. to take up another matter.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that we have 15 minutes for the \nD'Amato amendment and 5, which probably won't be used, by the \nopposition prior to the motion to table.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I would like 2 or 3 minutes \non the D'Amato amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will give the Senator my time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 20 \nminutes for the proponents. I have a number of people who would like to \nspeak. It is an important amendment and one we have tried to have \nconsidered by the full body. Then if the opposition wants 5 minutes, \nthat is fine. That would still keep it under a half hour.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, that is OK--with a motion to table at \nthe end of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3597 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit fees \n   charged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller \n                   machines, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bryan and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3597 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ATM FEES.\n\n       (a) Definition.--Section 903 of the Electronic Fund \n     Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693a) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (10), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (11), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(12) the term `electronic terminal surcharge' means a \n     transaction fee assessed by a financial institution that is \n     the owner or operator of the electronic terminal; and\n       ``(13) the term `electronic banking network' means a \n     communications system linking financial institutions through \n     electronic terminals.''.\n       (b) Certain Fees Prohibited.--Section 905 of the Electronic \n     Fund Transfer Act (12 U.S.C. 1693c) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) Limitation on Fees.--With respect to a transaction \n     conducted at an electronic terminal, an electronic terminal \n     surcharge may not be assessed against a consumer if the \n     transaction--\n       ``(1) does not relate to or affect an account held by the \n     consumer with the financial institution that is the owner or \n     operator of the electronic terminal; and\n       ``(2) is conducted through a national or regional \n     electronic banking network.''.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment would end the \nmonopolistic, anticonsumer, anticompetitive practice of ATM double \ncharges once and for all. It is cosponsored by Senators Chafee, Dodd, \nHarkin, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun.\n  The amendment corresponds to my bill, S. 885, called the Fair ATM \nFees for Consumers Act, which currently has 11 cosponsors. It would \namend section 903 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit ATM \nsurcharges imposed by ATM operators directly upon noncustomers using \ntheir machines.\n  The big banks would have you believe that if this amendment passes, \nATMs are going to disappear. Absolute nonsense. Hogwash. It is simply \nnot true. If they get rid of ATMs, then they are going to have to open \nup more branches and hire more people, and it is going to cost banks \nmore money. Well, a transaction performed by a teller at a bank branch \ndoes cost more money.\n  Let's take a look at the genesis of the ATMs. When they were \ninitially introduced to the consumer, great promises were made. Indeed, \nthe banking community, I believe, had the support of just about \neverybody, including consumer groups, when they said: Look, we're \nmoving into the modern era and the utilization of ATMs will save \nconsumers money, it will reduce transactional costs.\n  Those benefits, indeed, were supposed to be passed on to the \nconsumer. It made sense. Indeed, a network was set up--a network owned \nby Cirrus and Plus, really owned by the large money center banks. \nInterestingly, in order to induce others who may have started rival \nnetworks, they said: Don't worry, use our network, use the ATMs that we \nestablish, because we will prohibit a double charge, a surcharge on top \nof an initial fee. So, therefore, those who might go into competition, \nsuch as the credit unions, the small community banks, and others, do \nnot have to go through the cost and expense of setting up your own \nATMs, because we will let your customers use our ATMs without any \nadditional charge.\n  Indeed, up until April 1, 1996, the networks prohibited double \ncharges. That was a self-imposition to see to it that all of the \nfinancial services that were offered in the banking community would be \navailable, there would be one charge that the consumer's own bank could \nimpose and pass along the money to the ATM operator. The bank would be \ncompensated, but there would not be any additional charge for those who \nused an ATM that was not their bank's.\n  Let me say that the Congressional Budget Office reported that there \nwere more than 122,000 ATMs in the United States before double charges \nwere permitted nationwide. So this rubric, this nonsense, this \nincredible claim that, ``Oh, we are concerned about consumers and their \nchoices, and we're concerned that they won't have these ATMs,'' that is \njust a lot of nonsense. Look at the facts--122,000 of the existing \nATMs, or 74 percent, were in place before double charges.\n  Now, at last count, there were 165,000 ATMs. So in the past 2 years, \nyou have had approximately 43,000 new machines come into use. That \nmeans that 74 percent--three-quarters of all the ATMs in\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\nthe United States--were in place before they were allowed to double \ncharge.\n  Now, under the amendment, which has been cosponsored by many of my \ncolleagues, ATMs would still be profitable. They have been raking in \nhuge profits.\n  The banks were saving money because they saved a dollar for each \ntransaction performed at an ATM rather than at a bank branch--and they \nmade a profit on the use of the ATMs. But they weren't satisfied with \nthat. Oh, no. They had to say that: On top of that, we are now going to \nadd another charge. Guess what we are going to tell the consumer? A \nlittle flag goes up and says you will pay $1.25 more.\n  What is a person who, at lunchtime, has to take out $20, $30, or $40 \nsupposed to do? Go running around looking for an ATM that doesn't have \na double charge? No. The people are stuck. They are running late, or \nmaybe it is getting dark. Are you going to go searching for an ATM that \ndoesn't have that little flag going up? Or are they going to look for \none that doesn't exist, because their bank, under the inducement years \nago that they need not participate and open up their own ATMs, they \nsaid, ``We will rely on the network rather than try to find that \nmythical one''?\n  If you tried to find one in Washington, DC, you would not find one. \nNinety percent of them in this region double charge. If you don't go to \nthe institution where you do your banking, you are going to get \nwhacked. This whacking costs the American people more than $3 billion \nmore--$3 billion. The average family that uses another bank's ATM six \ntimes a month is going to pay about $200 a year more.\n  Do you know who it hurts? It hurts the little guy. It hurts the \nperson who draws out that $30, $40 or $50, because the surcharge, which \naverages about $1.27, is paid in addition to the initial charge. \nConsumer groups have estimated the two charges average about $2.68 \ntogether.\n  Here is somebody trying to get out their $20 or $30 or $40--a senior \ncitizen, a college student--and there is a $2.68 charge. That is a lot \nof money coming from the little guy. That is a heck of an interest \nrate. Years ago that would be called ``usury''--usury to get your own \nmoney. That is really incredible.\n  That is why we have come forth with this amendment. Some people say, \n``Why are you getting into the private sector?'' I will tell you why. \nWhat you have today is anticompetitive. Banks say consumers always have \na choice to use an ATM that does not double charge. That is a joke. \nSeventy-nine percent of the ATMs are now double charging. I predict \nthat by the end of the year that number will be over 90 percent. This \nis a situation where the consumer has little, if any, choice.\n  Many of my colleagues have said to me, ``What is the big deal? It is \nonly a couple of dollars.'' It may not be a big deal to us to pay an \nextra $3 when you are taking out $100 or $200. But it is a very big \ndeal to senior citizens, to students and to working families who take \nout $20, $30 or $40 at a time.\n  ATM surcharges account for more than $3 billion a year. The fees \nthemselves are skyrocketing out of control. The most common surcharge \nhas increased from $1 to $1.50. That is right, when they introduced it, \nit started at $1. It is now $1.50. Forty-four percent of the ATMs \ncharge $1.50 or more. It is going to go higher and higher unless \nCongress acts to stop it now. Keep in mind that this is a charge on top \nof a fee that the consumer is already paying to his or her own bank. It \nis a hidden bank fee. But they are paying.\n  A recent U.S. PIRG survey found that 83 percent of the banks charge \ntheir own customers an average of $1.18 per transaction whenever they \nuse another ATM. When you add the most common charge to the average \nfee, that is $2.68. That is about $200 a year for a family that uses an \nATM six times a month. That is outrageous.\n  Several States, including Connecticut--the State of my colleague, \nSenator Dodd--Iowa, and Massachusetts are waging battles to ban double \ncharges at the State level. But there is a question as to whether these \nmeasures would apply to federally chartered banks.\n  That is why Congress has to act. It has to act in order to preserve \ncompetition--in order to see to it that this monopolistic practice does \nnot deprive people of real choice.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look to help the little guy. \nThis is an opportunity to give them the protection they so desperately \nneed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amendment of \nthe Senator from New York?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask that I use, say, 5 minutes and be \nnotified when 5 minutes have transpired so that the author of the \namendment has some additional time at the end to conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. President, there is little question that the surcharges seem to \nhave become the No. 1 complaint by many consumers and consumer groups \nall across the Nation. Part of the reason for the increasing complaints \nin this area is the speed with which the surcharges have become \nattached to the ATM machines.\n  Frankly, I say to the Chair, and my colleagues, I was not an early \nsupporter of the prohibition of these fees. When it was first proposed \nby the Senator from New York, I argued that we ought to let the market \ndictate how these fees would be set, convinced, as had happened with \nthe credit card issue, that competition within the marketplace actually \nhad the desired effect of creating a good level, a less decent level, \nand an understandable and rational level for fees and surcharges and \ngrace periods, and the like, when it comes to credit cards.\n  It was my hope that would occur here with the ATM issue. The problem \nis that it just hasn't happened at all. We have had the opposite \neffect, in fact. Banks seem to have become more interested in acting \nlike sort of an electronic Jesse James--taking their cut when the \nconsumer wants to get access to their money. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office puts this a little more seriously in their study, noting:\n\n       Paradoxically, the increase in supply of ATM machines has \n     not led to the kind of reduction that would generally follow \n     from supply and demand solutions.\n\n  This is the Congressional Budget Office testimony. My concern over \nthe practice of surcharging was augmented by some other developments as \nwell.\n  First was the decision by a major national bank to sue the State of \nConnecticut, my home State, to overturn my State's ban on surcharges. \nThis demonstrated to me that the banking industry was unwilling to \nallow the individual States to make their own public policy decisions \nabout this practice. As a result, it has become very clear that only \nFederal legislation would allow my State of Connecticut to maintain the \nprotections for its citizens that it has chosen to enact.\n  In fact, the attorney general of my State, Richard Blumenthal, came \nto Washington and testified strongly in favor of the D'Amato amendment. \nLet me quote him. He said:\n\n       Federal legislation is vitally necessary to clarify our \n     State's ability [a State rights issue] to enact such a \n     prohibition. In addition, Federal legislation is necessary to \n     ensure that consumers are protected from such fees whenever \n     they use an ATM.\n\n  Also, let me note that despite Connecticut's ATM surcharge ban, the \nlargest bank in my State announced, on July 14, that it was going to \nclose some branches and open more ATMs around the State. The results \nrebut the argument that banks won't open new ATMs if this amendment \npasses. This is a living example where you have a ban, a moratorium on \nany new surcharges, and, yet, they are expanding the ATMs in my State.\n  So, clearly this ban, this legislation that is being offered by the \nSenator from New York, would not produce the results that its opponents \nare claiming.\n  Second, community banks in my State have expressed deep concerns that \nATM surcharging could be used to give large banks with extensive \nproprietary networks an unfair advantage over community banks with \nfewer machines. Smaller banks are worried about this--not only \nconsumers, but smaller banks are. This is particularly troublesome \nbecause of the regulatory and legislative decisions that allow banks to \nuse the ATMs in the first place where, based upon the concept of \nuniversal access to the network, the\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\nlarge banks are reneging on that commitment. That is how they got this \nin the first place. This was going to be universal access. They have \nbasically backed off that commitment.\n\n  Lastly, I have become very concerned over changes in bank \nunderwriting standards for commercial loans and for credit card \ncompanies, which I have raised before and which was the subject of a \nfront page Washington Post article today. It is a great concern where \nyou have now these normal banking fees being replaced by surcharges and \nthe like as a way of offsetting lowering the standards for credit. This \nought to be a great concern of all of us. And the Washington Post \narticle highlights this. You can lower your standard on credit card \nallocation, because you can make up whatever the losses would be in \nthis area. I think putting this issue aside is a very dangerous road \nfor us to be going.\n  As I reviewed the materials in preparation for the Banking Committee \nhearing, I couldn't help but be struck by the fact that loan standards \nand credit card underwriting standards have slipped as revenues from \nfees, which are almost pure profit, have escalated. I can't help but \nwonder whether the profit from these fees--$3 billion in ATM fees and \n$1.1 billion from fees charged their own customers when someone else \nbounces a check--aren't giving bank officials a false sense of security \nabout their lending practices. If true, then this may be the most \ncorrosive effect aspect of the recent boom in consumer banking fees of \nall types.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I believe the D'Amato amendment \ndeserves to be adopted by this body. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from New York. I congratulate \nand commend the Senator from New York for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment to ban \nATM surcharges. Over the past two years, the Banking Committee on which \nI serve has held numerous hearings on this issue. I think it is \nimportant to note that every time we have one of these hearings, more \nstudies confirm what we have said all along: the practice of \nsurcharging is anticompetitive, it exploits consumers and it should be \nbanned.\n  When I was in law school at the University of Chicago, I was taught \nthat competition in a free market is supposed to be all about lowering \nprices and providing better services to your customers in order to \nmaintain market share. However, competition in a world of surcharging \nis like Alice in Wonderland, where nothing is as it should be. \nSurcharging actually encourages the abuse of a dominant position in the \nmarketplace, promoting predatory prices. Competition in this instance \nis not about providing the best services for the best prices, rather it \nis about forcing your rivals out of the marketplace by raising their \ncosts.\n  And these costs are spreading. ATM surcharges have soared since 1995, \nand consumers paid between $2.5 and $3 billion in surcharges last year. \nThis figure is in addition to the almost $1 billion in interchange fees \nalready collected for these same transactions. Seventy percent of all \nbanks currently impose a surcharge, and the most common surcharge has \nrisen from $1 to $1.50 over the last year.\n  If current trends continue, few ATMs will remain that have no \nsurcharge, and consumers, despite surcharge warnings most institutions \npost on the computer screen or on the machine, will truly have no \nalternative but to be charged twice for the same transaction--\nespecially now that some institutions are surcharging their own \ncustomers.\n  I am aware that there are some costs to convenience. The number of \nATM machines has more than quintupled over the last decade. Americans \nused ATM machines billions of times last year, accessing their bank \naccounts and other financial services 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek. However the practice of surcharging has actually resulted in less \nconvenience for many customers. The result of surcharges is ``the \nincredible shrinking ATM network,'' far less convenience, longer \nsearches and longer waiting lines for those who seek to avoid these \ndouble fees. As the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded, ``to \navoid surcharges, many consumers are likely visiting ATMs that are less \nconvenient than those used previously.'' I know there are costs \nassociated with deploying these new machines, handling increased \ntransactions, and other maintenance and safety issues. However, \nconsumers are paying quite a bit for the marginal ``convenience'' of \nthese additional machines. According to David Balto of the Federal \nTrade Commission, assuming that surcharging has lead to the deployment \nof 40,000 new ATMs, the more than $2.5 billion in surcharges last year \nmeans that customers paid over $60,000 for each new ATM. Furthermore, \nbanks do not just surcharge on new ATMs in remote locations, but on all \nof their machines. Therefore, many customers who may never use one of \nthese new, remote ATMs pay for the ``convenience'' of having it exist.\n  Moreover, it should not be forgotten that banks moved customers to \nATMs because, compared to teller transactions, ATMs were cheaper. \nAccording to a 1996 Mentis Corporation study, an ATM cash withdrawal \nfrom an in-branch ATM costs an average of 22 to 28 cents, while the \ncost of a teller transaction is 90 cents to $1.15. And in some cases, \nbanks charge customers for completing transactions with a teller if \nthose transactions could have been completed at an ATM.\n  Certainly ATMs are a convenience for customers, but the truth is that \nbanks have deployed more ATMs because it means lower costs to banks.\n  I remember when banks paid their customers for the use of their \nmoney. Today, however, it's increasingly expensive for the average \nworking family to manage even a simple banking account. Americans who \nmake timely credit card payments, or no payments at all, face higher \nfees. Americans who avoid special banking services are considered \nunprofitable customers, and face higher fees.\n  Now, with ATM surcharges, Americans are discovering that they must \npay banks more than an additional $155 each year simply to access their \nown money.\n  The market is out of whack. The public knows this is unfair, and \ntheir visceral reaction is a response to market excess.\n  I am hopeful that the financial industry will take the necessary \nsteps to remedy this problem. If they do, I do not believe this \nprovision should become law. Banks in some states have demonstrated a \nwillingness to address this issue. I call on the rest of the industry \nto follow their lead. Otherwise, the government has a duty to correct \nthe abuse of double charging people for accessing their own hard-earned \ndollars. In an era of unprecedented bank profits, it is clearly a case \nof greed over need. I strongly support this amendment and urge all of \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, there are sound economic reasons why this proconsumer \namendment ought to be passed. Whether you care about consumer issues or \nbanks, you ought to support Senator D'Amato's amendment, which I am \nproud to cosponsor.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank Senator D'Amato. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not know if there is anyone here \nready to speak in opposition.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know this is a good-sounding and popular-appearing \nbill, but I am not one who enjoys going to banks and going in banks. \nOver the years, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to obtain the \ncash I need on a daily basis from ATM machines. In fact, it allows you \nto carry less cash in your pocket, and you can find ATM machines \neverywhere. They are exploding to every corner of America. Businesses \nhave them. Grocery stores have them. And they cost money--$30-, $40-, \n$50-, $80,000 to put in one of those machines.\n  So it has been a remarkable, wonderful advancement for the people of \nAmerica, that they can obtain money\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\non virtually any corner of a city, at their grocery store, at their \nbank, at their gas station, and so forth. This has been a wonderful \nadvancement.\n  It seems to me particularly odd that we would say that a bank which \nis servicing someone who is not their customer, who does not have an \naccount at their bank, and yet they might have spent $50,000 to put in \nthis ATM machine, cannot charge a fee for it; that someone can use \ntheir machine without being able to charge a fee. It seems to me that \nwould be an unreasonable thing. I think most banks don't have it free \nfor their own customers.\n  I wish to make a number of points. While this fee, I don't suggest, \nwould eliminate all ATM machines, I think it is quite reasonable to \nsuggest that it would eliminate marginal machines, and as we know when \nwe take money out of an ATM machine, it pops up on the screen how much \nthe fee is. So if you are at a grocery store and you have your own bank \nmachine down the street, but you would like to get your cash in the \ngrocery store and they are not going to service you but for $1.50, you \ndo have a choice. You have your choice of going to your bank or going \nto a machine that may charge less.\n  I hope and expect that as we have an expansion of machines, we may \nwell find some of these fees will begin to drop rather than increase, \nand that has been the pattern in free enterprise since its beginning. \nSo it seems to me that what we are suggesting is that on a bankruptcy \nbill, where at least with regard to this committee that deals with \nbankruptcy we are tacking on a credit card banking issue that was not \npart of the markup on this bill, it could jeopardize the bill and not \nbe relevant to what we are considering.\n  I note that the Banking Committee on July 30 on a bipartisan 11-to-7 \nvote rejected this amendment. They considered it in some detail, and \nthat committee, after careful consideration, balancing the great \nutility and advantage of having ATM machines at virtually every corner \nversus the cost of it, have opted in favor of allowing the continued \nexpansion and convenience of more and more machines. I do not think \nthere is any doubt that the growth in availability of machines will end \nand, in fact, it is likely that we will have a reduction in the number \nof machines, therefore reducing convenience.\n  Many bank machines are totally dependent on access fees, and many of \nthese are particularly convenient to small businesses and small grocery \nstores. Many new ATMs in rural and other low-volume, high-convenience \nsites operated by nonbanks will be economically unfeasible. They will \nbe closed. They will not exist. You simply have to be able to make a \nprofit if you are going to provide a service. Nobody is going to invest \n$30-, $40-, $50,000 if they do not have any prospect of a return. We \nknow that. We talk about the big banks, but it is not always big banks \nthat are involved.\n  Mr. President, I believe that on this bankruptcy bill, we ought not \nto be dealing with banking issues and credit card issues. Those are \nmatters that ought to be held in those committees and, in fact, they \nhave been considering it. I urge the Members of this body to wait for \nanother forum, another time to deal with this issue and reject this \namendment because it is not good economics. It is not good public \npolicy to limit the expansion and the convenience and accessibility of \nATM machines.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New York. First let me say that I have a \ngreat deal of sympathy for the problem that the Senator is attempting \nto address. When banks first began to install ATM machines, I remember \nthe reluctance many consumers expressed about this new technology. They \nwere worried about whether their deposits would be safe, whether \nstrangers would find it easier to get into their bank accounts and \nsteal their money. The banks initially sold consumers on the use of the \nmachines by calling them a cost-saving measure--ATMs were supposed to \nhelp banks cut costs by allowing them to serve more people for longer \nhours, without the need for high employee salaries or costly new \nbranches.\n  In those early years, it appeared that these claims were paying off. \nAnd consumers became addicted to the convenience. No longer did you \nhave to spend your lunch hour at the bank's drive-in window to deposit \na paycheck--you could do it after work at the ATM instead. Consumer \ndemand also led to an unexpected growth of ATM machines located in \nbusinesses other than banks. Now you can do your banking at the grocery \nstore, the convenience store, the airport--any other place where there \nis demand.\n  But the economics of operating ATMs in those remote locations are not \nthe same as operating them in the bank building itself. It is a lot \nmore expensive to service the machines, collect and process deposits \nevery day, or to provide security. And the networking banks have \nprovided means more consumers are using ATM machines at banks other \nthan their own--again with higher operating costs.\n  The convenience of banking virtually any place at any time has its \ncost. ATM fees allow banks to recoup at least some of those costs from \nthe consumers using the services.\n  I know that ATM fees rankle those of us who don't appreciate having \nto pay a fee to have access to our own money. And I also understand the \narguments of the Senator from New York and others who claim big banks \nare making large profits from their fees.\n  However, I also believe that ATM fees represent the purest form of \nuser fee. If consumers don't want to pay the fees, they don't have to \nuse the ATMs. But for those who are willing to pay, the fees allow \nbanks to provide ATMs in more locations, making it more convenient to \ndo our banking.\n  If the D'Amato amendment is approved, two things will happen.\n  First, banks will immediately re-evaluate the economics of all their \nATMs, and those that are the least cost-effective will simply be \nremoved. Rural areas, like those in my State of Montana, will be \nparticularly hard hit. The low volume of usage, combined with the \nhigher cost of maintenance because of the distances involved, will make \nmany rural ATMs unaffordable for the sponsoring banks.\n  Let me give you just one example sent to me by the 1st Bank of \nSidney, Montana. Sidney is a town representative of a lot of towns \nthroughout Montana and other rural parts of our country. 1st Bank has \nan ATM machine at a 24-hour gas station and convenience store located \non the main street through town. Even with the current ATM fee, 1st \nBank lost almost $8,000 on that machine in 1997. Now $8,000 doesn't \nsound like a lot of money, but in states like Montana, believe me it \ncan be.\n  I don't know whether 1st Bank will close this particular ATM if they \nare not allowed to recoup at least part of their costs by charging a \nfee. I do know that right now, hundreds of Montanans who used that \nmachine in 1997 had a choice--if they didn't think the convenience of \nthe machine was worth the $1.00 fee, they didn't have to use the \nmachine.\n  If the ATM is removed because the bank decides it isn't worth the \ncost, we have legislatively taken from these consumers the ability to \nmake that choice. They won't be able to decide on their own whether the \nconvenience is worth the cost. We will force them to find other ways to \ndo their banking.\n  Approval of the D'Amato amendment will also have a second \nconsequence, that I believe we need to consider. Right now, those who \nuse ATMs pay for the convenience. In places where the fees don't cover \nthe costs of operating the machines, those of us who don't use ATMs, or \ndon't use them frequently, help subsidize those who do. Eliminating the \nability to charge those who benefit from the convenience of an ATM \nsimply makes it that much more difficult for the rest of us to avoid \nthese charges.\n  The old adage ``there is no free lunch'' is very applicable here. \nSomeone has to pay the cost of operating an ATM. If we prohibit banks \nfrom charging those who use ATMs, it simply means everybody else will \nend up picking up the tab. And it won't matter whether we discipline \nourselves to do our banking inside the bank, through the drive-in \nwindow, or electronically in order to avoid the fees. Every transaction \nwill carry part of the cost of operating that ATM, because it will be \nbuilt into the banks' operating costs.\n  Mr. President, I don't think those of us here in Washington, DC, \nshould be\n\n[[Page S10464]]\n\ndictating to consumers how to do their banking. I believe consumers \nshould be allowed to continue deciding for themselves whether the \nconvenience of an ATM is worth the cost. If enough consumers decide the \nanswer is no, the marketplace will correct itself. Banks will be forced \nto reduce fees and cull out less profitable locations.\n  But this will happen in response to consumer demand, not legislative \nfiat. I believe this it the right answer.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the D'Amato amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New York (Mr. D'Amato).\n  This amendment is about simple fairness.\n  Mr. President, banks, credit unions, and the other owners of \nautomatic teller machines are entitled to be compensated for the \nservice they offer.\n  But consumers are also entitled to be treated fairly.\n  The D'Amato amendment strikes that balance.\n  This amendment does not fix prices.\n  It does not limit what ATM owners may charge for using their \nmachines.\n  It simply prohibits charging consumers twice for the same service.\n  Mr. President, consumers become subject to ATM charges when they \nobtain an ATM card through their bank or credit union.\n  While the consumer's bank or credit union often has its own ATM \nmachines at which account holders can bank, increasingly, banks and \ncredit unions join a network of ATMs to give their account holders \ngreater access.\n  Mr. President, when your bank or credit union joins an ATM network, \nit pays what is called an interchange fee to the network, and your bank \nor credit union may pass the cost of that interchange fee directly to \nyou, or it may just add it into their overall cost of doing business--a \ncost that account holders help to bear.\n  But, Mr. President, consumers are now being forced to pay an \nadditional fee, a surcharge, for using a network ATM.\n  When that happens, the consumer is being billed twice for the same \ntransaction--once by their own bank, and once by the ATM owner.\n  Mr. President, consumers who are already charged by their own banks \nor credit unions for using an ATM feel that once is more than enough.\n  When consumers are charged twice for the privilege of accessing our \nown hard-earned money through an ATM, it's time for this body to take \nsome action.\n  Mr. President, not only are consumers now being asked to pay twice \nfor the privilege of accessing their own money, the second fee, or \nsurcharge, often represents a big portion of the cash they want to \nwithdraw.\n  The Senator from New York noted consumers may be hit with a surcharge \nof $3 or more just to take $20 out of their account.\n  This is especially a problem for consumers in under-served areas.\n  Because they lack ready access to their bank or credit union, those \nconsumers are much more dependent on ATMs for every day financial \nservices.\n  Mr. President, let me note here that not all ATM networks subject \nconsumers to this double billing.\n  I understand there have been efforts, especially by community banks, \nto form networks that explicitly do not charge consumers twice.\n  While I applaud those efforts, they may not be enough.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the fundamental unfairness of these \ndouble charges to consumers, I am troubled that this fee structure may \nalso put smaller banks and credit unions at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Customers seeking to avoid these double charges may move their \naccounts to larger banks that own these broad-based ATM networks, and \nas we've seen recently, these big banks are now merging with each \nother, which will only make matters worse for their smaller \ncompetitors.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in this regard there have been some troubling \ndevelopments in the past few weeks.\n  In particular, I was disturbed to hear reports that the Department of \nJustice is investigating whether or not some of the large ATM networks \nare engaging in illegal restraint of trade by seeking to prevent \nsmaller banks from forming those very alliances that promise not to \ndouble charge consumers.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will end double-billing at ATMs.\n  It will ensure fairness for consumers, and it will put a stop to \nefforts that undermine the ability of our smaller community financial \ninstitutions to retain their customer base.\n  Mr. President, it's time to demand fairness for ATM users.\n  Paying additional fees at the ATM is something consumers can afford \nto live without.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator D'Amato's \namendment to ban ATM surcharge fees.\n  This is good policy, and we all ought to vote in favor of it.\n  These fees, which in some instances have reached exorbitant levels \nlike $5 or $10 per transaction, are charged against consumers to access \ntheir own money.\n  The large bank networks, which typically operate the automatic teller \nmachines, already charge a transaction fee to smaller banks for the use \nof their network.\n  These surcharges are a second charge, directly to the consumer, for \nthe privilege of using the machine.\n  Some have argued that consumer behavior has changed, so that \nconsumers can learn how to minimize surcharges. They can do this by \ngetting cash back on debit card purchases, or by taking more money out \nat one time.\n  But these are the savvy consumers, or those who are able to take out \na large amount of money at one time. The consumers who end up paying \nthese fees are those who have the fewest options: their money is \ntighter, or they are in an emergency situation, or they don't \nunderstand the system enough to avoid these fees. Do we want to protect \nthe rights of the banks to take advantage of those consumers?\n  The banks now charge the consumer at every turn. They first said that \ntellers were too expensive and encouraged us to use machines. Now they \ncharge both the consumer, and the consumer's bank, for the privilege of \nusing the ATM machine.\n  This gouging of the consumer has to stop!\n  Some have argued that we should allow banks to police themselves on \nthis issue. In my home state of Massachusetts, for example, the \nMassachusetts Bankers Association has worked to organize fee free \nalliances between big and small banks so that consumers can use \nmachines statewide and avoid surcharges. This is a terrific program, \nand I compliment the MBA for developing it.\n  Truly progressive organizations, like Fleet Bank which operates \nthroughout New England, have agreed not to charge fees for ATM use in \nlow and moderate income communities. This is progressive corporate \npolicy, and I salute them for it.\n  These financial institutions can be a model for the nation.\n  Unfortunately, there are not enough banks like those in my home \nstate.\n  And so we must pass this amendment. We have heard from consumers, and \nthey have had enough.\n  I know banks have heard from their customers in response to these \ncharges. They have complained about it, loud and clear.\n  If banks had been proactive and responded by policing themselves, we \nwould not be compelled to pursue an amendment such as this.\n  These exorbitant charges are an outrage! The Senate must act to \nprotect the consumer from excessive charges.\n  In a time in which we are debating bankruptcy legislation, which has \nbeen supported strongly by banks and credit card companies, we also \nneed to enact some provisions which will help the working men and women \nof this country.\n  We must end the gouging of the American consumer! I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me in supporting Senator D'Amato's amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the D'Amato amendment to limit fees \ncharged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller \nmachines is a very close question, in my opinion, because it pits the \nconsumer's interest in avoiding potentially excessive bank charges \nagainst existing market forces where ATM machines provide significant \nconvenience for the depositor's access to cash.\n  On this state of the record, I do not believe that there has been a \nshowing\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nof excessive charges on the part of the banks. This issue might well be \nrevisited in the Banking Committee with hearings, as opposed to being a \nfloor amendment on this bill where the Judiciary Committee, on which I \nserve, did not have the benefit of an evidentiary record on the issue \nof excessive charges.\n  On the other hand, I do believe that there is substantial benefit and \nconvenience to the consumer who has access to a cash withdrawal, far \nfrom home, at unusual hours and under circumstances where it is a \nsignificant convenience to be able to get the cash.\n  I know that when I go to a convenience store, for example, to buy \nmilk, and pay a higher price, I dislike it; but I am mindful of the \nfact that it is late at night or I don't have to stand in a long line \nin a supermarket or it is on my way home. So, I grin and bear the \nsomewhat higher charge.\n  In addition, there may be substantial merit to the contention that if \nthe Congress acts to affect the market on this issue that the ATM \nmachines will not be available or may be very few in number to reduce \nthis convenience.\n  Accordingly, on this state of the record, on a very close question, I \nam voting against the D'Amato amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly my thoughts \nabout the automated teller machine (ATM) fee ban amendment offered \ntoday by Senator D'Amato to the bankruptcy reform bill.\n  I share the concerns that Senator D'Amato and others have about the \nrapid, and seemingly unchecked, increases in ATM fees across this \ncountry over the past few years. There is compelling evidence that some \nbanks are charging exorbitant ATM charges that impose an unnecessary \nand unfair financial burden on bank customers. For many consumers, this \nhappens every time they use an ATM that's not owned by their bank. And \nthere appears to be no end in sight to this explosion in ATM fees. I do \napplaud the work of Senator D'Amato and others for bringing attention \nto this growing problem.\n  But regrettably, I was forced to vote against Senator D'Amato's \namendment, as drafted, because it failed to recognize that many of our \nrural communities have significantly higher costs for providing many \nkinds of services. I'm afraid that adopting Senator D'Amato's approach \nmay actually be harmful for people living in these higher-cost areas. \nIn my judgment, this amendment might have forced some of our banks to \nshut down existing ATMs in more sparsely populated areas in our state \nor made it too costly for them to install new ones in places where they \nare needed.\n  Let me be clear on this point. I would have liked to support a \nproposal to stop those ATM owners who are charging excessive and, in \nsome cases, outrageous fees. And I'm willing to consider other \napproaches to help put the brakes on ATM price gouging. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment that Senator D'Amato offered today is one that I could \nnot support because it may inadvertently hurt rural America.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \ndebate, the pending D'Amato amendment be temporarily laid aside and the \nSenate proceed to the debate on the Dodd amendment. I further ask that \nat 2 p.m. the Senate proceed to a vote in relationship to the Dodd \namendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on or in relationship \nto the D'Amato amendment, with no intervening action and 2 minutes of \ndebate between each vote. I further ask that the partial-birth abortion \ndebate begin immediately following the vote in relationship to the Dodd \namendment under the 4 hours outlined in the previous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I think the Senator means \nthe D'Amato amendment, at the conclusion of the vote on the D'Amato \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I think the Senator said the Dodd amendment. I think he \nmeans the D'Amato amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Might I inquire how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, because I do not \nbelieve it will impede on the time allocated for consideration of the \nDodd amendment--we will not go past 2 o'clock--that we have an \nadditional 5 minutes for the proponents because I have some Members \nhere who would like to speak to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there are \na number of amendments on this bill, and we have to finish this bill by \n2 o'clock. I just think that there has always been an advantage on \nfloor time for the proponents and not opponents. I know Senator \nGrassley has no time. I reluctantly object.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest we amend it by giving 5 minutes to Senator \nSessions.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure. If he would like, 5 minutes each. I would ask that \nwe have----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would certainly go along with Senator Grassley. I am \nnot sure I will use any time. If Senator Grassley is comfortable with \nit, I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield 3 minutes to Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee for his leadership on this issue. The banking industry is \nenjoying its sixth straight year of record profits, which topped $60 \nbillion last year. That is good news. But unfortunately, as part of a \ngrowing trend, these record profits are coming from an increasing \nproliferation of fees on bank customers. The number of these separate \nbank fees has grown from 90 to 250 over the last 5 years.\n  Last year, banks made more than $3 billion alone on ATM surcharges. \nThat is the new cash cow. And this is in addition to the $1 billion \nbanks are paid as part of the interchange fee, which covers their cost \nof ATM transactions. So, that is where the surcharge comes in. The \nbanks are already compensated through an interchange system. They are \nimposing an additional fee, a surcharge, which Senator D'Amato and I \nand others object to, which, in effect, imposes a charge twice on the \ncustomer.\n  Mr. President, $1.50 or $2 for every ATM withdrawal may not seem like \na lot, but over the course of a full year it adds up to several hundred \ndollars. Many banks for years prohibited these ATMs. In fact, three out \nof every four ATMs that are in place today were built before surcharges \nwere prohibited, so the argument that somehow prohibiting the surcharge \nwould limit the availability of ATMs is simply a specious argument. Two \nStates that come to mind immediately, Connecticut and Iowa, prohibit \nATM surcharges, and there is no evidence to suggest that customers in \nthose two States are deprived of the option to use ATMs.\n  So, people, in effect, kind of feel entrapped. Initially the banks \noffered ATMs because they reduced the costs of their transactions. They \nare much less expensive than the teller transactions. Customers \nresponded because of the convenience. A win-win proposition. Once \ncustomers got induced to use ATMs, then they got hooked, and now they \nare being reeled in by the bankers with these new charges, because the \naverage ATM transaction cost is about 27 cents while a transaction \ninvolving a teller costs the bank roughly $2.93.\n  ATM charges are unfair, because the consumer is charged twice for the \nsame transaction. Additionally, ATM surcharges have the anticompetitive \neffect of pressuring people to leave small banks--which may be their \nchoice--for their larger banks, to avoid this double charge or the \nsurcharge. I urge my colleagues to support the able and distinguished \nchairman and to support this.\n  Let me just tell you, both in Nevada and around the world, this is \nhow the public views the ATM surcharge. You\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\nwill note from the chart there, the ATM reaches out with a loaded \npistol and the customer is held hostage. That is what these ATM \nsurcharges are all about.\n  I urge support for my colleague's thoughtful legislation, I yield the \nfloor, and thank the Senator for extending the privilege of the floor \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I commend both my colleague from \nConnecticut and Senator Bryan from Nevada for their thoughtful \npresentations.\n  I tell you, when I look at the ATM cartoon over there, that Senator \nBryan has put up, it is interesting because that is exactly what is \ntaking place, particularly to so many young people who don't have a \nchoice, to the student who is at his college campus and there are only \none or two of those ATMs around and everyone of them is double \ncharging. It is excessive--to think they are paying $2.68 to take out \ntheir own money. If you are taking out $30 or $40 at a time, as many of \nthe young people are, and many of our senior citizens, that is usurious \nby any standard.\n  The argument that somehow this is going to hurt competition is rather \npathetic. This has really hurt the small banks, the credit unions, \nbecause they were deceived into not getting into competition while a \nhuge network was built; 122,000 out of the 165,000 machines were \ninstalled well before the double charges.\n  Let's take a look and see. Since the double charges, in the past 2 \nyears, have been imposed--17 percent double charged going into 1996. \nThe next year, it jumped to 59 percent. And the following year, 79--79 \npercent of all of the ATMs are now double charging. They came into \nexistence and were making a profit before the surcharges. This is just \na way of really doing what Senator Bryan's description, the chart, \nshowed so eloquently. You are really holding up the consumer, because \nit is anticompetitive, antichoice. This number, 79 percent--that is \ntemporary. We have seen them grow. You will top out at over 90 percent \nby the end of next year, there is no doubt.\n  So there is little choice. There is no reason. It is anticompetitive, \nantipeople, and we should have the courage to say enough is enough. Let \nour States determine whether or not this should be permitted. When the \nState of Iowa and the State of Connecticut have attempted to ban double \ncharges, surcharges, they have not seen a diminution. But now, even \ntheir law will be threatened, and is in court, as it relates to those \nStates that want to protect consumers. So we are whipsawing them both \nways, and there is only the Federal Government that can make a \ndifference.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in voting to give people a \nreal choice without that additional burden being placed on them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for \npermitting us the additional time to make known our thoughts and our \nviews.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, may I inquire of the manager, does he \nintend to make a motion to table now? And then we will lay that aside \nand we can ask for the yeas and nays now? Would that save time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to table the D'Amato amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move the D'Amato amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By a previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3598 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Truth in Lending Act with respect to extensions \n              of credit to consumers under the age of 21)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3598 to amendment numbered 3559.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO UNDERAGE CONSUMERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 127(c) of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1637(c)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) Applications from underage consumers.--\n       ``(A) Prohibition on issuance.--No credit card may be \n     issued to, or open end credit plan established on behalf of, \n     a consumer who has not reached the age of 21 unless the \n     consumer has submitted a written application to the card \n     issuer that meets the requirements of subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Application requirements.--An application to open a \n     credit card account by an individual who has not reached the \n     age of 21 as of the date of submission of the application \n     shall require--\n       ``(i) the signature of the parent or guardian of the \n     consumer indicating joint liability for debts incurred by the \n     consumer in connection with the account before the consumer \n     has reached the age of 21; or\n       ``(ii) submission by the consumer of financial information \n     indicating an independent means of repaying any obligation \n     arising from the proposed extension of credit in connection \n     with the account.''.\n       (b) Regulatory Authority.--The Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System may issue such rules or publish such \n     model forms as it considers necessary to carry out section \n     127(c)(5) of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by this \n     section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair might say, under the previous order, \nthere is 40 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the most troubling developments in \nthe hotly contested battle among the credit card issuers to sign up new \ncustomers has been the aggressive way in which they have targeted \npeople under the age of 21, particularly college students. We are \nengaged, obviously, in a debate about the bankruptcy bill here. The \nauthors of this bill, and I commend them for it, recognize there has \nbeen an explosion of people who are taking advantage of the Bankruptcy \nAct to avoid their financial obligations.\n  It seems appropriate in the context of this bill that we also \nrecognize that there has been an explosion of efforts to sign up \nyounger people, particularly on college campuses, to credit cards, \nrecognizing that, as many have pointed out, these students are ill \nprepared to meet their own financial obligations. Inevitably, they \neither incur debt and end up in tremendous difficulty or their parents \nassume the responsibilities, which can occur with upper-income people \nwho can afford it.\n  Just this past August, to make the point, a fellow by the name of \nJohn Simpson, who is an administrator at the University of Indiana, \nsaid:\n\n       This is a terrible thing. We lose more students to credit \n     card debt than academic failure, at the University of \n     Indiana.\n\n  What I am trying to lay out here is a proposal that is not \noutrageous. Basically, what it says is if you are between the ages of \n18 and 21--no contract is valid for someone under 18, so a credit card \nobligation for someone under 18 would be voided anyway. But between 18 \nand 21, either show that individual has independent economic means--a \njob or whatever--or parental permission. If you can do that, fine, then \nyou can market and issue a credit card to those individuals. We set up \nseparate standards on drinking in this country for those 21 and under, \nand for tax purposes. It seems to me this little window in here could \nsave an awful lot of students, an awful lot of families, the kind of \nhardship.\n  Let me lay out the case for you here on a factual basis. \nSolicitations to this age group have become more intense for a variety \nof reasons. First, it is one of the few market segments in which there \nare always new faces to go after. It is also an age group in which \nbrand loyalty can be established. In the words of one major credit card \nissuer, we are in the relationship business and we want to build \nrelationships early on. Recent press stories have reported that people \nhold on to their first credit card for up to 15 years.\n  In fact, people under the age of 21 are such a hot target for credit \ncard marketers that the upcoming card marketing conference this year--\nthis is the\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\ncard marketing conference 1998, which is going to be held in Las Vegas. \nThey have a seminar beginning at 12 noon on the day of this conference \nthat is entitled ``Targeting Teens: You Never Forget Your First Card,'' \nto give you an idea of how much a part of this the credit card \ncompanies have in mind. As I say, this is indicating their deep \ninterest in this constituency.\n  Credit card issuers are also enticing colleges and universities to \nhelp promote their products. Professor Robert Manning at Georgetown \nUniversity here in Washington told my staff that some colleges receive \ntens of thousands of dollars per year for exclusive marketing \nagreements. Other colleges receive as much as 1 percent of all student \ncharges from credit card issuers in return for marketing or affinity \nagreements.\n  Even those colleges who don't enter into such agreements are making \nmoney. Robert Bugai, president of College Marketing Intelligence, told \nthe American Banker that colleges charge up to $400 per day for each \ncredit card company that sets up a table on campus. That can run into \nthe tens of thousands of dollars by the end of just one semester.\n  Last February, I went to the main campus of the University of \nConnecticut to meet with student leaders about this issue. Quite \nhonestly, I was surprised by the amount of solicitations going on in \nthe student union, and I was also surprised the degree to which the \nstudents themselves were concerned about the constant barrage of offers \nthey were receiving.\n  The offers seemed very attractive, Mr. President. One student intern \nin my office this summer received four solicitations in just 2 weeks. \nOne promised ``get eight cheap flights now while you still have 18 \nweeks of vacation.'' That is the solicitation, part of it geared to \nthis young woman in my employment.\n  Another promised a platinum card with what appeared to be a low \ninterest rate, until you read, of course, the fine print that it \napplied only to balance transfers, not to the account overall.\n  Only one of the four, Discover card, offered a brochure about credit \nterms, but in doing so, often offered a spring break sweepstakes in \norder to attract these students. In fact, the Chicago Tribune reported \njust last month that the average college freshman will receive 50 \nsolicitations during their first few months at college. The Tribune \nfurther reported that college students get green-lighted for a line of \ncredit that can reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a \nsignature and a student identification card.\n  Mr. President, there is a serious public policy question about \nwhether people in that age bracket can be presumed to be able to make \nthe sensible financial choices that are being forced on them from this \nbarrage of marketing. While it is very difficult to get reliable \ninformation from the credit card issuers about their marketing \npractices to people under the age of 21, those statistics that are \navailable are deeply, deeply troubling.\n  The American Banker newspaper reported that Visa found that 8.7 \npercent of bankruptcy filers were under the age of 25. A Chicago \nTribune article from August 16 of this year cited that bankruptcies \n``among those under 25 have doubled over the last 5 years from 250,000 \nto 500,000.''\n  The bankruptcy legislation, the underlying bill, is going to make it \nharder to take the bankruptcy act. I understand that. I am not opposed \nto that idea. But if simultaneously you are going out and aggressively \nsending eight solicitations to an 18-year-old in my office promising \nthem free vacation breaks or flights, I think there is something wrong \nhere.\n  I don't mind getting tougher on the bankruptcy laws, but I think we \nhave to get a little tougher to say the 18-, 19- and 20-years-olds who \nhave no independent financial means and without parental permission are \ngetting signed up merely on a student ID card and signature, incurring \n$10,000 worth of debt.\n  The same survey found that 27 percent of undergraduate student \napplicants had four or more credit cards--27 percent, four or more \ncredit cards--and found that 14 percent had credit card balances \nbetween $3,000 and $7,000, while 10 percent had credit card balances \ngreater than $7,000. This figure of 24 percent with credit card debts \nin excess of $3,000 is more than double the number from last year.\n  Moreover, while there is evidence that student debt is skyrocketing, \nsome surveys by credit card issuers themselves show that this same \ngroup of consumers is woefully uninformed about the basic credit card \nterms and issues. A 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of \nAmerica study found that only 22 percent of more than 2,000 college \nstudents surveyed knew that the annual percentage rate is the best \nindicator of the true cost of a loan. Only 30 percent of those surveyed \nknew that each bank set the interest rate on their credit card, so that \nit is possible to shop around for the best rate. Only 30 percent knew \nthat interest was charged on new purchases if you carry a balance over \nfrom the previous month.\n  Some college administrators, bucking the trend to use credit card \nissuers as a source of income, have become so concerned that they have \nbanned credit card companies from their campuses and have even gone so \nfar as to ban credit card advertisements from the campus bookstores. \nRoger Witherspoon, Vice President of Student Development at John Jay \nCollege of Criminal Justice in New York, banned card solicitors saying \nindebtedness was causing students to drop out:\n\n       Middle-class parents can bail out their kids when this \n     happens, but lower-income parents can't--\n\n  Mr. Witherspoon said in an interview.\n\n       Kids only find out later how much it messes up their lives.\n\n  That is a quotation from the American Banker.\n  The amendment I am proposing today does not take any such Draconian \naction against the credit card companies. Let me state, by the way--and \nI should have said this at the outset--many credit card companies do \nrequire parental notice or approval or evidence of independent means. \nThere are many who do this, but there are some who do not at all. As \nmost laws, it is not targeted to those who show good judgment and good \nsense, but to the few who do not. Unfortunately, here we have a few who \ndo not at all.\n  This amendment does not go so far as to ban credit cards or ban \nadvertising. It merely says, look, between the ages of 18 and 21, \neither show you have the independent means to meet the obligations or \nget a signature from a parent that they understand that their child is \nabout to take out a credit card.\n  I agree with those who argue, as I said, there are millions of people \nunder the age of 21 who hold full-time jobs who are as deserving of \ncredit as anyone over the age of 21. I agree with that. I also believe \nstudents should continue to have access to credit, and we should not \nprohibit the market from making that available.\n  I also recognize the period of time from 18 to 21 is an age of \ntransition from adolescence to adulthood, and as we do many places in \nFederal law, extra care is needed to make sure mistakes made from \nyouthful inexperience does not haunt these people for the rest of their \nlives or a good part of it.\n  All my amendment does is require a credit card issuer, prior to \ngranting credit, to obtain one of two things from the applicant under \n21: Either they get the signature of a parent or guardian, or they \nobtain information that demonstrates the existence of an independent \nmeans of paying off the amount of credit offered.\n  Federal law already says people under age 21 shouldn't drink alcohol. \nOur Tax Code makes the presumption if someone is a full-time student \nunder the age of 23 that they are financially dependent on their \nparents or their guardians.\n  Is it so much really to ask that credit card issuers, in the midst of \na bankruptcy bill that will make it tougher for people to take this \nact, is it so much to ask that we try to find out if someone under the \nage of 21 is financially capable of paying back their debt or that \ntheir parents are willing to assume the financial responsibility?\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that most, as I said, \nresponsible credit card issuers already require this information in one \nform or another. Is it too much to ask the entire credit card industry \nto strive to meet their own best practices when it comes to our \nchildren?\n  Mr. President, I do not believe this amendment is either unduly \nburdensome on the credit card industry nor is\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nit unfair to the people under the age of 21. The fact of the matter is \nthat these abusive solicitations assume that if the young adult is \nunable to pay, they will be bailed out by their parents. Many times \nthis means that parents must sacrifice other things in order to make \nsure their child does not start out their adult life in a financial \nhold with an ugly black mark on their credit history.\n  By adopting this amendment, Mr. President, the Senate will send a \nclear message to those aggressive credit card companies that we will no \nlonger countenance this abusive behavior. This amendment corrects that \nbehavior by making those overly aggressive companies, credit companies, \nexercise their best judgment--instead of their most craven instincts--\nwhen it comes to people obtaining their own credit cards for the very \nfirst time.\n  Mr. President, I note as well in an interview on an NPR program just \na few days ago on this very issue, Nancy Lloyd, who is the editor-at-\nlarge for Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine, had this to say about \nthis practice. She said:\n\n       . . . that the real reason that credit-card companies are \n     going after college students is that they know that after a \n     parent has spent several tens of thousands of dollars to \n     educate their student, that if they fall behind on their \n     bills that the parent will bail them out, even though legally \n     they don't really have to [if they are younger than 18].\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think this is a radical proposal here. It is \nagain a huge problem. NBC, I think last evening, ran a special report \non the ``Fleecing of America'' where they talked about this problem. I \nthink there have been a number of other reports on this.\n  We began this issue last December in raising the question when I went \nto my own campuses in Connecticut, as I mentioned a moment ago, to find \nout how widespread this was. And, again, the information we have been \nable to gather indicates, I think based on the data we have, limited as \nit is, that this is a growing problem. The debt has doubled now in the \nlast year. It is going to get worse.\n  If we adopt the underlying bill, which I hope we do, then obviously \nthe ability to use the Bankruptcy Act to excuse obligations are going \nto get tougher. So it seems to me if we are going to do a favor to the \nbanks by making it tougher for people to avoid their financial \nresponsibilities, which we should, we should also send a message that \nwe do not believe you ought to be dumping, as we did last year in this \ncountry, 3 billion credit card solicitations but particularly dumping \nthese where there is a student ID and a signature from a 19-year-old, \nwithout independent means or parental approval, to assume $3,000, \n$4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 worth of \nfinancial debt. I think that is wrong. I think we ought to try to stop \nit. I think this amendment brings us in the right direction, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know this amendment is well intentioned, \nbut, look, I was a building tradesman as a young 16-year-old. I made a \npretty good living as a building tradesman. I could have wound up as a \nbuilding tradesman, which I was very proud to be. In fact, I have had \nsome colleagues say I should have stuck with it. In fact, one of them, \nwhen they found out I was a janitor at one time putting myself through \ncollege, said I should have stuck with it. Maybe so.\n  But I would hate like heck to have some artificial rule or some \nregulatory rule by some regulatory agency of Government say that I, as \na hard-working carpenter, would not be able to get a credit card and \nget credit that I might need for my family to make our lives a little \neasier because of artificial rulings like what happens as a result of \nthis well-intentioned amendment.\n  This is a slap in the face of every 18-, 19-, 20-year-old--and 17-\nyear-old, 16-year-old even--people who can work; 16-, 17-, 18-, 19-\nyear-olds who work hard, who are supporting their families. They may \nnot be college graduates, they may not look like they quite have the \nfuture of some who have gone to college and done the things that they \nhave done--might look like--but they are not going to be able to get \ncredit cards under this without going through some big rigmarole \ndecided by Government.\n  This amendment would unfairly discriminate against young adults. I \nthink it has to be opposed. I hope our colleagues will think about \nthis. The amendment would require parental consent for extensions of \nopen-ended credit to young adults under the age of 21--think of that--a \nlot of young adults who are supporting their families and doing what is \nright but have not been to college, or even those who have been to \ncollege or who are working well in college, as I had to do, unless they \ncould demonstrate ``an independent means of repaying'' the obligation.\n  While it is not entirely clear what would constitute an ``independent \nmeans of repaying'' a debt, one thing is clear: This amendment would \nhave the bizarre effect of requiring an emancipated but temporarily \nunemployed 20-year-old mother to obtain her parent's consent before \nreceiving a credit card, or an unemployed 20-year-old carpenter who, \nbecause of seasonal layoffs, might not have a job for a couple of \nweeks, or maybe 3 weeks or maybe a month or two. I understand that \nlife; I understand how difficult it is.\n  The same would be true with respect to a 20-year-old plumber or a \nconstruction worker, like I have mentioned, who is between jobs, in \nbetween jobs, and with respect to a 20-year-old recently discharged \nfrom the U.S. military and looking for civilian employment--somebody \nwho is honorable and decent, would pay back any debt no matter what \nhappened but could not get a credit card because of these artificial \nrestraints.\n  Moreover, the amendment makes no provision whatsoever for a young \nadult whose parents or guardians may be deceased. It is also not clear \nwhat responsibility, if any, the amendment would impose on a lender to \nverify that the signature of a parent or a guardian was authentic.\n  In short, discriminating against individuals between the ages of 18 \nand 21 when it comes to obtaining credit simply cannot be justified \njust because we know it is pretty easy to get a credit card out there \nand it is abused from time to time. But this amendment furthers the \nabuse only in the opposite direction. Also, it is important to note \nthat individuals under 18 cannot enter into binding contracts and, \ntherefore, any credit inadvertently extended to them is unenforceable.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment, \nnotwithstanding some of the arguments on the other side of the aisle. \nIt is important to note that not all 18-, 19- or 20-year-old kids are \ncollege students or unemployed or irresponsible or bums, if you want to \nsay it. Some have families, some serve in the military and are asked to \ndefend our country. It puts their ability to gain credit in doubt. Or \nshould we just call it the way it is? In the hands of Federal \nregulators.\n  You know, there is a limit to everything. Yes, there are some abuses \nhere. Yes, some of these credit card companies get some of these young \npeople hooked on credit cards just thinking they can live with that \ncredit card. But in the interest of solving that problem, do you abuse \nall the other honest, hard-working, decent young people between the \nages of 18 and 21? Do you discriminate against them so that they cannot \nget a credit card that might make their lives maybe a little bit better \nor a little more livable or a little more sustainable?\n  My attitude is that this amendment ought to be defeated because it is \na one-sided amendment that, in my opinion, has not been well thought \nthrough. That is not a knock at my colleague because I know he is \nsincere. I know he has good intentions here. I know there are some \nvalues that he is trying to defend. But I think the overwhelming weight \nof maturity is on the side of young people in that age group who \ndeserve to have a credit card, who would pay back their credit card, \nwho are responsible citizens, and who do not need the Federal \nGovernment to tell them what they can or cannot do in this area. The \nfact that we have a few credit card companies that abuse the system \ndoes not mean we should pass this type of an amendment.\n  I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\nexcellent remarks in pointing out a lot of people age 18 to 21 are not \nin college. I just had two children graduate from college, and I still \nhave one in college. I believe a credit card is a good thing for them \nto have. Almost every college student is going to have a credit card. \nThe fact that we have some competition in the credit card industry--\nthey are offering lower rates and less charges if you will use their \ncredit card--that is good. We have needed that.\n  In my opinion, the biggest complaint about credit cards is they \ncharge too much interest. Those rates have been driven down because of \ncompetition. There are 6,000 credit card companies, and they are \nsending out mailings, and they are encouraging people to use their \ncredit cards. What is bad about that?\n\n  What troubles me is we are saying if you want a young person to have \na credit card, they may have to get their parents to sign as a cosigner \nand be financially responsible for their debt. That doesn't seem to me \nto be fair or correct. Maybe a parent says if you want to get a credit \ncard you can, but it is your debt to pay, not mine. The requirement we \nare debating now would prohibit them from getting a credit card under \nthose circumstances.\n  What about young persons whose parents are deceased?\n  The Federal Government should not be stepping in and telling a credit \ncard company you can't take a chance on a young person, or that you \nhave to get the parent to cosign before giving a young adult a credit \ncard. This seems unhealthy to me. I am sure it is true that credit card \ncompanies like to get young people accustomed to using their cards and \nhope they will use them throughout their career. I don't know that \nthere is anything wrong with that.\n  Mr. President, a 20-year-old who may be temporarily unemployed may \nfind a credit card to be very valuable. Suppose you have to drive to a \njob interview and the guy down at the car inspection place says your \nvehicle emits too much pollution and you have to spend $400 to fix it; \nor your tire blows out and you have to have $75 to get the car towed \nand another $50 to put a tire on it. A person may not have that cash in \ntheir pocket at times such as these, when they really need it. That is \nwhy credit cards are a good thing.\n  Credit cards have been helpful in many ways for citizens in America. \nThe problem is with people who abuse them and who don't show personal \ndiscipline. We all know that is a problem. We need to encourage \npersonal discipline, not have the Federal Government telling a young \nperson they can't have a credit card unless their parent agrees to pay \ntheir debt.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have no intervening business between now \nand 2 o'clock. Several of our colleagues want to speak on this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent we take the time between now and 2 \no'clock and equally divide it between opponents and proponents of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I have \nlistened to the debate; it is an interesting debate, but I think all of \nus know what is happening in this country with respect to credit cards.\n  I noticed an article this morning in the Washington Post on the front \npage:\n\n       Banks Risk New Wave of Bad Debt: Report Cites Easing of \n     Credit Standards.\n\n  They are talking about commercial loans in response to competition; \neven though the risks will rise, they are easing standards, lowering \nlending standards.\n  What are the standards of lending for credit cards? Go to a college \ncampus and look in the mailboxes and see the solicitations for these \nkids that have no jobs, no income, no independent means of paying. They \nget solicitations from companies halfway around the country.\n  The solicitation says we have something to offer you. You don't have \nmoney? We have money. We will give you a piece of plastic, and you get \na preapproved range of credit. Sign this, send it in, and it is all \nyours.\n  It is Byzantine to me to see what is happening with the \n``blizzarding'' of these credit cards all around the country, even to \npeople without money.\n  Yesterday in our mail, my son got a solicitation from the Diners \nClub. My son, Brendon, is a great young guy. In fact, do you know what \nBrendon told me he wanted to do when he gets big? Brendon told me he \nwants to be like his grandpa.\n  Now, I know that doesn t sound surprising. But do you know why? It s \nbecause he wants to be retired, just like his grandpa.\n  You see, Brendon went to Arizona to see his grandpa, and Brendon \nwatched his granddaddy and thought, that's what I want to do--sleep \nlate, get up and golf a little bit, come home, have some lunch, take a \nnap, then watch television.\n  Brendon says, ``I like what grandpa has. I want to be retired.'' \nBrendon is only 11.\n  The Diners Club wrote to Brendon. Doreen Edelman, Senior vice \npresident at Diners Club, wrote:\n\n       Dear Brendon, Whether you travel for business or pleasure, \n     wouldn't you like a Card that rewards your spending with \n     something you could really use--frequent flyer miles on the \n     major airline of your choice?\n\n  It says get our Diners card. You can go to lounges, you can go to \nfancy restaurants, you can rent cars, you can pay for your airline \nticket.\n  I didn't show Brendon this last night because the fact that Brendon \nwould like to be retired might persuade him that he would like a Diners \nClub card, too, but he is only 11. He doesn't have a job. He doesn't \nhave any money. He isn't going to have a Diners Club card.\n  I don't know whether Doreen Edelman, senior vice president of the \nDiners Club, listens to this debate. In fact, it looks like she is from \nSioux Falls, SD. Holy cow, I didn't think anybody from either of the \nDakotas would think this way--that an 11-year-old boy ought to get a \nDiners Club card.\n  I know why he got this. They don't know him from a head of lettuce. \nThey don't know Brendon Patrick Dorgan. They gathered the name \nsomeplace and sent him a little letter that says they would like him to \nget a Diners Club card.\n  It would serve them right to have all these 11-year-olds send this \nin, get the Diners Club card and go spend some money.\n  I come from a town of 300 people. If someone in business on the main \nstreet of my hometown said, Do you know what I want to do? I want to \nsend some 11-year-old an invitation to have credit with us. That person \nwould have to be drunk or just dumb. What are they thinking? That is \nwhat is happening.\n  I know this debate is a little more serious than that. It is about \nthe explosion of credit cards to college kids and so on. I understand \nthat. But this is a wonderful example of how ridiculous it has become, \nisn't it? It is just indiscriminate. Are you alive? Do you breathe? Do \nyou have a name? Are you on a list? Congratulations, we would like to \noffer you some preapproved credit.\n  What kind of standard is that? What kind of business behavior is \nthat?\n  I happen to support the underlying bill. I believe the pendulum has \nswung too far on bankruptcy. I think it ought to swing back some. I am \nprepared to support the underlying bill. I also believe those in this \ncountry who run these businesses and send solicitations to 11-year-old \nboys and solicit every college student in the country with credit cards \nwith preapproved limits, I think they have some responsibility, as \nwell. That is what the Senator from Connecticut is saying today with \nhis amendment. They have some responsibility, too.\n  I am pleased, on behalf of Brendon, to support the amendment by the \nSenator from Connecticut. Perhaps we will make some progress in saying \nto those who extend credit in this country, yes, we believe bankruptcy \nlaws ought to be adjusted some; you are right about that. We also \nbelieve you have some responsibility, which you have been ignoring with \nthe solicitations you are making indiscriminately around this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquent, and \nif it weren't so sad, quite humorous story.\n  Unfortunately, Brendon is not alone. This wasn't just a mistake. \nUnfortunately, parents can tell you all across the country that this \nhappens with regularity.\n  Let me address, if I can, the argument of my good friend and \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S10470]]\n\nfrom Utah and why he is opposed to this bill. The great irony is the \n20-year-old who is out working and not in college is disadvantaged. \nThat individual has to prove that they have independent economic means.\n  Listen to this recent report:\n\n       All the rules have been suspended when it comes to college \n     students. They get a green light, a line of credit that can \n     reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a signature \n     and a student ID. Almost comically, [the report says], low \n     standards become much different after graduation and bona \n     fide adulthood.\n\n  So the individual who is out working, who is not in school, who may \nhave a real need for a credit card, has to go through far many more \nhoops than the students between the ages of 18 and 21 who can get these \nsolicitations.\n  This wasn't Brendon. This was a 19-year-old--get eight cheap flights \nnow while you still have 18 weeks of vacation. How about a platinum \ncard to a 19-year-old without any indication of whether or not she can \nmeet her payments?\n  I don't think it is outrageous to say, look, just show your \nindependent economic means. You have a job, fine. Or get a parental \nsignature. That is not asking too much. Just listen to the \nadministrators at these universities.  A terrible thing. We lose more \nstudents to credit card debt than academic failure now. The numbers \nhave doubled. It is not overreaching to say to an 18- or 19-year-old \nthat we are going to insist that you prove an independent economic \nability to pay--the same as an 18- or 19-year-old would have to do were \nthey not in college--or have a parental signature. Everybody knows that \nif you are under 18, you can't enter into a contract and have it \nbinding. People have said, ``Why not just make it 18?'' Well, those \ncontracts don't hold up and the bankruptcy laws would not cover it.\n\n  So between 18 and 21, we are just trying to cover those areas here, \nstatistically. I talked about this study that was done and I failed to \nidentify who did it. Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in New \nEngland, conducted a survey of students who had applied for student \nloans. ``The results of the credit card examination is alarming.'' \nThose are their words, not mine. They found that 27 percent of the \nundergraduate student applicants had four or more credit cards, and 14 \npercent of the credit card balances, debt, between $3,000 and $7,000, \nand 10 percent in excess of $7,000. That is before they graduated from \ncollege, in addition to student loans.\n  So our efforts here--while the credit card companies see this, \napparently, as draconian--will provide relief in the underlying bill. \nRequiring a little higher standard for college students before they get \ncredit cards is not asking too much. I know the ranking member on the \ncommittee wanted to be heard on this, and I see my colleague from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I find it somewhat ironic and, frankly, \nindefensible that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho are now arguing for parental consent here in order to obtain a \ncredit card, would also argue against requiring parental consent for \nchildren who want to get an abortion. I have spent 22 years listening \nto that.\n  Now, Mr. President, they are arguing for parental consent for young \nadults between the ages of 18 and 21. Look, if they are willing to \namend the amendment--every State in this Union, to my knowledge, \nrefuses to give credit or allow credit to be granted to young people \nless than 18 years of age. So I think Senator Dorgan's son already fits \nwithin that category. We are talking about 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds \nwho work, who are in the service, are capable of doing this, who should \nnot have to get parental consent, should not have to justify it. I am \ntalking against discrimination against young people of that age.\n  My friends on the other side argue for parental consent for young \nadults between 18 and 21. These are not even minor children. How can \nanybody argue, on the one hand, that if you are between 18 and 21 and \nyou want a credit card, you have to get your parents' consent, and on \nthe other hand you should not have to get parental consent if a minor \nwants to get an abortion? I don't know about you, Mr. President, but to \nme that sounds a little bit inconsistent--maybe a smidgen.\n  Every State in the Union, to my knowledge, refuses to give the right \nto grant credit to young people below 18 years of age. At least that is \nmy understanding. So that is not even an issue. Despite all of the \nenjoyment we had from the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota, \nthat isn't an issue. Are we going to discriminate against hard-working \nyoung people who are 18, 19 and 20 years of age, who should have a \nright to credit, just because we have some excesses in our society that \nreally are not justified?\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments that I hear again and again is \nthat the bankruptcy crisis in this country is the fault of credit card \ncompanies because they offer credit too freely to low- and moderate-\nincome Americans. Opponent of reform have, during the hearing process, \nshown us piles of credit card solicitations to make their point. They \nwant us to believe that the nation's bankruptcy crisis is the fault of \neasy access to credit, and not of the individual who abuses the \nbankruptcy system with all of its present loopholes.\n  First, I would like to say a few words about taking personal \nresponsibility for our actions. In a free world, each of us is \nconfronted with a variety of offers on a daily basis, some of which we \nshould accept, and some of which we should not. It is the \nresponsibility of the individual to decide whether or not to take on \ndebt and it is the responsibility of the individual to live with the \nconsequences of that decision. Before we can begin to make meaningful \nreform to the bankruptcy laws, we simple must stop the finger pointing \nand accept personal responsibility for our spending and borrowing \npractices. That said, if we look at the objective facts, it is apparent \nthat credit card debt is only a small fraction--about 16 percent--of \nthe debt of a typical bankruptcy filer.\n  The reason I have this chart up is because the yellow part of that, \nthe higher part of it, shows the total consumer debtload. You will \nnotice that between 1980 and 1997 the consumer debtload has remained \nabout the same. But look at the red part, increase in consumer \nbankruptcy filings, which this bill would help to resolve. The increase \nin consumer bankruptcy filings has continued to go up off the charts. \nSo the debtload doesn't appear to be the major problem. What is the \nmajor problem is the abuse of the bankruptcy system, which this bill \nwould correct.\n  Surprisingly, as Americans continue to use consumer credit at about \nthe same level as they have historically over the last few years, \nbankruptcy filings have more than quadrupled. In other words, as this \nchart demonstrates, the debt load that individuals carry has not \nchanged very much. What has changed is the attitude of Americans toward \nbankruptcy. People turning to bankruptcy today are not in significantly \nmore difficult debt that those in the past. But rather than taking \nresponsibility and working their way out of debt, too many people are \nchoosing bankruptcy as a first resort.\n  As I have said before, excessive bankruptcy filings hurt all of us. \nWhen someone who could pay their debts instead opts for bankruptcy, the \nrest of us effectively pay their unpaid bills for them. Bigger \nbusinesses and creditors raise prices and interest rates to offset \ntheir losses, and small businesses may actually be forced into \nbankruptcy themselves.\n  But his issue is not just about the impact of bankruptcy on the rest \nof us. It is about personal integrity and personal responsibility. When \nyou borrow money from someone else, you make an implicit promise to do \nwhatever you can to pay that money back. Our present bankruptcy laws \nundermine this basic principle. This bill will help solve that. They \nallow people who can repay their debts to avoid doing so because they \nfind their debts ``inconvenient'' or because repaying their debts would \nrequire them to change their lifestyle.\n  Ironically, many of the people who say that we do not need to reform \nthe bankruptcy code because easy access to credit is to blame, are the \nvery same people who argue that poor and moderate income individuals \ndesperately need, and should not be denied, credit. These are the same \ngroups who, fifteen\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\nyears ago, complained that the credit industry granted credit only to \nthe elite and wealthy, and deprived lower-income Americans of the \nimportant opportunity to use credit. And, these are the same people who \nvociferously argued just a few weeks ago in favor of the Community \nReinvestment Act or CRA, which requires banks to extend loans and \ncredit to low and moderate income Americans who live in low income \nareas.\n\n  Rather than reform the bankruptcy code, some have suggested imposing \nburdensome credit qualification standards on the credit card companies. \nLet me be clear: amending this bill to require onerous credit \nqualification standards will result in an immediate reduction in the \navailability of credit to lower-income individuals. And, imposing \nburdensome requirements on credit card companies that do nothing to \nhelp consumers--and that in fact hurt consumers by adding to the cost \nof being a credit card holder--is nothing more than an obvious attempt \nto derail bankruptcy reform. On the other hand, I remain open to \nmeasures that will help people become fully aware of the implications \nof debt before they incur it.\n  Mr. President, the explosion in bankruptcy filings has less to do \nwith causes and more to do with motivations. The stigma of bankruptcy \nis all but gone. Bankruptcy has become a routine financial planning \ndevice used to unload inconvenient debts, rather than a last resort for \npeople who truly need it. The rest of us end up footing the bill for \nabuses in the bankruptcy system in many forms, including higher prices \nand higher interest rates. What this legislation will accomplish is \nstraightforward: If a person is able to repay some of what they owe, \nthey will be required to do so. We must restore personal accountability \nto the bankruptcy system. If we do not, every family in America, many \nof whom struggle to make ends meet but manage to live within their \nmeans, will continue to shoulder the financial burden of those who \nabuse the system.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest that the bankruptcy system \nhas failed us altogether. It provides a way for individuals who have \nexperienced a a financially devastating event to get back on their \nfeet. The problem we face is that current law does not simply allow \nbankruptcy filers to get back on their feet * * * it allows abusers of \nthe system to get ahead of Americans who make good on their debts. S. \n1301 is a common-sense bill that will provide a much needed adjustment \nto the bankruptcy system.\n  Again, I will end with what I started with. If my colleagues on the \nother side want to exclude those below 18 years of age, as the States \nbasically do, so that credit card companies cannot solicit them, I \nwould be more than happy to do that. I would be more than happy to \ngrant that right now, right here on the floor. But if they are going to \ndiscriminate against 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old people who are hard-\nworking, decent kids, some of them working at trades in society as I \ndid, some of them working in the military, some of them who may be \ntemporarily out of work but are good, honest people, then I have to say \nwe have to fight against this amendment.\n  Last but not least, I will say that I find it ironic that they would \nrequire parental consent to get credit card credit while at the same \ntime not requiring parental consent with regard to getting an abortion.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield our remaining \ntime to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. President, I agree with Senator Dodd. I, too, have been concerned \nabout the problem that we see as a mounting one. We ought not to be \nputting college students in debt, particularly at such an early stage \nof their life. But my concern is that this law has to be carefully \ncrafted. I do not feel that it has been. My concern is that this has to \nbe put together in such a way that we do not deny credit to students \nwho might need it while they are away from home. But further, I don't \nwant to stop or impede credit to non-college students under the age of \n21.\n  We have not had hearings on this. And we have not attempted to curb \nthe credit cards through any private methods. Senator Dodd is on the \nBanking Committee. So am I. I would prefer to defer this, and hold \nhearings, and move legislation independently out of the Banking \nCommittee, where it should begin, and then to the floor.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut has certainly identified a real \nand continuing problem. But I have struggled with how to legally cut \noff credit to college students for some time. I have noticed card \nsolicitations at college bookstores and the marketing efforts that have \nbeen put forth that are aimed solely at young people. But why do we \ntell someone in the U.S. Army, who is under the age of 21, whom we \nwithout any hesitation send into harm's way to be killed, or whatever, \nthat they can't get a credit card? This will diminish the chances of \ngetting one, very likely.\n  That is why I think we should take more time and care in crafting \nthis proposal so that we do it right. It needs to be done, but it needs \nto be done right. What do you do with the people who lie on their \napplication? These are some of the things that are going to be \ndifficult to legislate unless we take time and do it right.\n  You have to remember that while there may be only really a few credit \ncard brands, they are offered by literally thousands and tens of \nthousands of institutions. All of the burden of administering this \nrequirement is going to be absorbed by them. Those costs are going to \nbe passed along to you know who. And that is all of us who do business \nwith banks or use credit cards.\n  Again I say, let's carefully consider this before we legislate. Let's \nbring it to the Banking Committee. Let's have hearings on it and at \nthat point craft a bill that would serve the purposes and go in the \ndirection that Senator Dodd is trying to go. I would be happy in the \nsubcommittee that I chair to hold hearings on it just as soon as \npossible. It really is a problem. But we need to take our time and \ncorrect it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  I would like to ask several brief questions to clear up this debate.\n  It has been said on the floor of the Senate that because of the \namendment of the Senator from Connecticut, that someone serving in the \nU.S. military under the age of 21 could not get a credit card. Is that \ntrue or false?\n  Mr. DODD. That is absolutely false. That person has independent \neconomic means, being a paid member of the military.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It has also been said that someone with a job with low \nincome under the age of 21 would be unable to get a credit card under \nthe Dodd amendment. Is that true or false?\n  Mr. DODD. That is false. A person who is unemployed might have \nunemployment compensation and independent means, and would certainly \nqualify.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, because I think \nthere have been some things said on the floor which mischaracterize his \namendment.\n  This debate has had a lot of reference to personal responsibility. We \nought to keep a board up here to check off every time someone says \n``personal responsibility.'' We are talking about bankruptcy, and I \nthink people who go into bankruptcy court should be personally \nresponsible. I agree. Most Democrats agree. Most Republicans agree. \nThere are some people abusing the bankruptcy system. We ought to change \nit.\n  The purpose of this bill is to tighten it up so that the abusers \ncannot take\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\nadvantage of bankruptcy to the disadvantage of everybody else in \nAmerica.\n  But in addition to personal responsibility, can't we discuss \ncorporate responsibility here? Don't the credit card companies have \nsome responsibility to make certain that they don't offer risky credit, \nluring children and people who are unwitting into credit situations, \nand then watching it topple over them? Those same credit card companies \nwhich come to us and say, once these people have fallen deep in debt, \nonce they have all this credit card debt that they can't get out of, \nand go to bankruptcy court, be strict and tough with them--I agree with \nthat, but shouldn't we also have a standard which says these companies \nshould be responsible in dealing with American consumers?\n  Senator Dodd offers an amendment which is timely. Listen to this. \nBankruptcies among those under the age of 25 have doubled in the last 5 \nyears. It is estimated that a college student in the first few months \non campus will receive 50 solicitations for credit cards. A student \nwithout virtually any income is going to be that target customer. As \nSenator Dodd has said over and over again, too many kids who are lured \ninto easy credit before they have an income or the maturity to handle \nit end up deeply in debt, and many of them jeopardize their education \nas a result of it.\n  The Senator from Alabama said he wanted his children to have a credit \ncard at college. I wanted mine to have one as well. He would have \ngladly signed for that. I would have as well. That is exactly what the \nDodd amendment says. If a parent will put a signature on the line, the \ncredit card is there for the college student.\n  But I salute the Senator from Connecticut. I support his amendment. I \nthink we are talking about corporate responsibility and personal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois.\n  Just to make the case once again, we have watched consumer debt \ndouble to $455 billion in the last couple of years. It has tripled and \nquadrupled. It seems to me that to listen to what university people are \nsaying, we have more people dropping out of school--as the official at \nthe University of Indiana said, ``We lose more students to credit card \ndebt than academic failure''--we have some indication of what is going \non here. To say between the ages of 18 and 21 just to get a parental \nsignature, or an indication of independent economic means, as you would \nif you were not a student, is not asking too much. It seems to me that \nis the bare minimum standard of what we ought to be asking of the \ncredit card companies. It is my understanding that most responsible \ncredit card issuers already require them.\n  Is it asking too much that the credit card companies strive to meet \ntheir own best practices in order to do something to protect our \nchildren? If you are under 18, the law already protects you. It is that \nwindow between 18 and 21.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will recognize that it is \nreally not fair for middle-income families to get saddled with a \n$10,000 debt because of solicitations that were made to a student in \nschool. This is a license for us to do something about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, my amendment would stop one of the most \npredatory, outrageous practices that consumers throughout America are \nfacing, double charging at ATMs. There are fewer opportunities to avoid \nthat. Since the ban has been lifted, we have gone from 17 percent of \nthe ATMs double charging to 79 percent in 2 years. There is no consumer \nchoice. At the end of next year, it will be over 90 percent, and it \nwill cost the average consumer $2.68 for that transaction.\n  For people who say, ``Oh, we'll lose the ATMs if we do not have these \ndouble charges,'' 74 percent of the ATMs that are in existence today \nexisted prior to the double charges.\n  If you want to help the little guy, here is an opportunity. Vote for \nthe ATM ban; vote for the consumer. Give that little guy a choice and \ngive people an opportunity to vote. I am urging people to vote no \nagainst the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to \nmake some comments with regard to this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleagues who have \ngiven me the opportunity to at least bring this to a vote. Needless to \nsay, the great power and the great number of dollars involved were \nfelt. It is a lot of money that a lot of little people are paying that \nthey shouldn't be paying.\n  Indeed, some Members have indicated to me that notwithstanding their \nopposition to intruding generally into the private sector, they would \nreconsider their votes in the future if they continue to see the \npredatory price-gouging practices that are anticonsumer and \nmonopolistic; if they continue to see not only the number of ATMs that \nare double charging continue, but lack of consumer choice; and \nescalating fees.\n  Indeed, the Senate majority leader told me, and he is on the floor \nnow, that he has indicated to those in the banking community that they \nhad better look carefully at what they are doing. If they continue to \nimpose these fees on the little people, he may not be nearly as \nsupportive.\n  This is a close issue as it relates to when should government become \ninvolved in the private sector. I believe that time has come.\n  Having said that, this is a battle, but it is not the end. I lost \nthis battle, but I am prepared to continue this battle and win the war \nuntil and unless we see a rollback in what is taking place now--and \nthat is taking advantage of the consumer, the little guy, the working \nfamilies of America.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have yielded me this time to make \nthis observation. We lost the battle, but not the war.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had earlier made a unanimous consent \nrequest to bring up the FAA issue, now known as the Wendell Ford \nNational Air Transportation System Improvement Act. This is a bill we \nreally need to get done before we leave. If we don't get it cleared, \ncloture will take so much time, we may wind up not being able to \ncomplete this bill.\n  It is important for airports, air passengers, the airline industry, \nthe entire country.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 2279, the National Air Transportation System \nImprovement Act. I further ask that during the pendency of S. 2279 only \nrelevant amendments be in order to the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  Let me explain, briefly. I share the majority leader's determination \nto complete work on this legislation. We need to get this bill done \nbefore the end of the session. The Senators from Maryland and at least \nthe Democratic Senator from Virginia, as well as the Senators from \nIllinois, are still attempting to work through some problems relating \nto the legislation and their respective States. I am hopeful we can \ncome to some successful conclusion in those discussions at an early \ndate, but until that has been completely worked through, we will have \nto object.\n  I hope that we continue to put the pressure on those who are \ninterested, as we are, in coming to closure on this, to get it done \nsoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 3 days ago the distinguished majority \nleader asked unanimous consent, and it was objected to. I come to the \nfloor, again, to say I am happy to work with any Senators. The Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, is now in agreement. I believe that the \nSenators from Illinois are, although unhappy, willing to let this bill \nmove forward. If the Senators from Maryland have a problem, I am happy \nto consider their amendments in the normal legislative process.\n  Mr. President, let me point out something very important here. We are \ntalking about aviation safety, security, capacity, and noise projects, \nand we are talking about billions of dollars' worth. I hope that we \nwill be able to move forward on this bill very quickly. There are over \n$2 billion worth of projects that can be held in abeyance because of \nour failure to reauthorize the FAA. We are talking about safety, Mr. \nPresident, which is a very big burden for all of us to bear. So I want \nto tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--especially the \nSenators from Maryland--I am ready to sit down at any time and see if \nwe can work out any differences that we have to their satisfaction so \nthat we can get this very important reauthorization completed before \nthe end of the fiscal year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters regarding this legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Association of Airport Executives, Airports \n           Council International,\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 14, 1998.\n     Hon.

Under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration of the veto \nmessage on H.R. 1122.\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate a message from the House \nof Representatives, which was read as follows:\n\n       The House of Representatives having proceeded to reconsider \n     the bill veto message to accompany H.R. 1122 entitled ``An \n     Act to amend title 18, United States Code, to ban partial-\n     birth abortions'', returned by the President of the United \n     States with his objections, to the House of Representatives, \n     in which it originated, it was\n       Resolved, That the said bill pass, two-thirds of the House \n     of Representatives agreeing to pass the same.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass, the \nobjections of the President of the United States to the contrary \nnotwithstanding?\n  The time for debate will be limited to 4 hours, to be equally divided \nbetween and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader \nor their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today we begin debate on the issue of \npartial-birth abortion, the override of the President's veto, which he \nvetoed last year.\n  I believe this is one of the most important issues, if not the most \nimportant issue, we will face in this session of Congress because it \ndeals really at the core with who we are as a country and to what \ndegree we respect life in this country and recognize life, recognize an \nindividual's inclusion into our family and our society. In many cases, \njust as we did in voting with respect to banking laws, we have to draw \nlines. Part of the legislative process is, in fact, drawing lines. \nSometimes those lines are not clear. Sometimes the votes are very \ndifficult, and it is hard to understand in the area of gray where \nexactly you do draw the line.\n  I have always felt, with respect to the issue of partial-birth \nabortion, that it was a very good place to at least draw the first \nline, in a very emotional and confrontational issue, because we are not \nreally talking about abortion at that point, we are talking about \ninfanticide. I think if you took a poll in this Senate and asked \nwhether Members of the Senate were in favor of infanticide, I hope and \npray that the answer would be 100 percent ``no,'' that they are not in \nfavor of infanticide. Well, I believe, as many Senators have said, that \nthis is infanticide. This is a baby that is just 3 inches from being \ndelivered and is brutally killed.\n  Let's do a little rundown of how we got to the point where we are \ntoday. In the last session of Congress, Congress passed a bill to ban \nthis procedure, sent it to the President, and he vetoed it. We had a \nvote to override in September of 1996. We had 59 votes on the floor of \nthe Senate. They overrode in the House. Last year, the Senate and House \npassed the bill. The House, in July of this year, overrode the \nPresident's veto with a vote of 296-132, I believe. So now it comes to \nthe Senate.\n  Earlier this year, we had 64 votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nban this procedure. Unfortunately, as overwhelming a vote as that is, \nit is three short of the votes necessary to override a Presidential \nveto. So that is the state of play; three votes in the U.S. Senate \nseparate us from what I believe is a clarion call to the world that we \nare a civilized country that respects life which is born in this \ncountry, or nearly born in this country, and a signal to the country \nthat we are just not quite ready to open our arms as a society and \nwelcome every member to it.\n  Let's first go through the particulars of what this procedure is, \nbecause I think it is important to define the procedure so everybody \nknows exactly what we are talking about. These charts that I am going \nto show you, while they are not particularly easy to look at, they do \naccurately describe, according to several doctors who perform them, \nwhat a partial-birth abortion is. It is performed on babies that are at \n20 weeks of gestation, roughly halfway through the gestational process. \nBetween 20, 24, 26, and longer, it can be performed. One of the \nreasons, in fact, that this procedure was developed was to perform it \non solely late-term and very-late-term babies. So at 20 weeks, and \nthereafter, this procedure is used. The baby, as you see, in the \nmother's womb is usually in a head-down position at that age. The \ndoctor, over a 3-day period, will begin to dilate the cervix, open up \nthe cervix, so the doctor can reach in with forceps and grab the baby's \nfoot and turn the baby around and pull the baby out in a breach \nposition.\n  I want to state that again. This is a 3-day procedure. It starts with \nthe dilation of the cervix over a 2-day period. On the third day, when \nthe cervix is sufficiently dilated, the doctor goes in with these \nforceps, grabs one of the baby's limbs --usually the foot--pulls the \nbaby, turns the baby around into a breach position, and begins to pull \nthe baby out of the birth canal in the breach position. As most people \nunderstand, that is a very dangerous position for a normal delivery. \nYou try to avoid breach births because of the danger to the mother, as \nwell as the baby. In this situation, they deliberately turn the baby \naround and deliver the baby in a breach position. The baby is then \npulled out feet-first until all of the baby is outside of the mother, \nwith the exception of the head. The reason for that is, the head being \na hard part of the body, even at that age--certainly a harder part of \nthe body at that age--and it is the biggest single part of the body, it \nis left inside of the mother.\n  The third thing that happens is, the physician reaches in with one \nhand and finds the back of the baby's skull. You can't see the back of \nthe baby's skull because the skull and neck are still inside of the \nmother. So they probe and find the soft part here, right at the base of \nthe skull. Then they take what is called a Metzenbaum scissors and \nthrust it into the back of the baby's skull, open up a hole in the \nbaby's skull, introduce a suction catheter, which is a high-powered \nsuction device, and suck the baby's brains out, which causes the \ncollapse of the skull, and then a dead baby is delivered.\n  This is the brutal procedure that the President of the United States \nhas said must remain legal. This is the brutal procedure that we have \nthe opportunity here in the U.S. Senate to say has no place in a \ncivilized society.\n  I would think that would be enough reason--that simply its brutality, \nits shocking, barbaric, horrific nature would be enough reason to ban \nthis procedure. But there is much more. There are so many reasons to \nban this procedure beyond its horrific and barbaric nature.\n  In a few minutes, I will detail exactly all of those reasons. I will \ndetail all of the lies that have been put out by the other side to \nprotect this rogue procedure, which is not done in any hospital, not \ntaught in any medical school, has not been peer-reviewed and studied by \nothers to make sure that this was a proper, safe procedure. This is a \nrogue procedure done only in abortion clinics, when no one else is \nwatching.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, as I know the Senator from \nMissouri is here and has other time commitments.\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nI will yield and turn it over to the Senator from Missouri, Senator \nBond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. I congratulate him on his \nleadership on this issue. These are very, very difficult procedures to \ndescribe and I know that no one here on the floor enjoys hearing them. \nBut the fact that they are so horrendous I think is one of the reasons \nwe are here today.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on whether to override the \nPresident's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. This \nlegislation would ban a particularly hideous form of late term abortion \nknown as ``partial birth'' abortion. Unfortunately, while a majority of \nSenators supported the ban last year, the vote count was not enough at \nthat time to override the subsequent veto by President Clinton.\n  I hope that some Senators will have had a change of heart since then \nand will vote to override the veto.\n  This is a horrible procedure. The Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, has likened it to infanticide. Remember that these are \n``late-term'' abortions, meaning they take place during or after the \n5th month of pregnancy. A fully developed fetus is brought down the \nbirth canal, feet first, and then delivered, all but the head. Then the \nabortionist takes a pair of scissors, inserts them in the back of the \nbaby's neck, and collapses the brain, and the baby is delivered: dead.\n  I would note the American Medical Association, representing thousands \nof doctors, believes the ban is justified and that there is no room in \nmedicine for this procedure.\n  The overwhelming majority of the American people and Missourians are \nrightly revolted by this. Some states have banned the procedure, and \nthe state of Missouri has come very close to banning it. Few other \nissues have generated so much mail and so many phone calls to my \noffice. People feel very very strongly about banning this procedure. \nAnd it is easy to see why.\n  And, the partial birth abortion ban has passed in both the House and \nthe Senate by large majorities. In fact, the issue would be settled if \nPresident Clinton hadn't vetoed the bill last year, against the wishes \nof an overwhelming number of Americans.\n  Rarely have I seen a President, like this one, who is willing to \nignore the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the American people. \nThe overwhelming majority is opposed to this hideous procedure.\n  I have been asked why we are holding this vote in the Senate, when we \nare likely to fall short of what is needed to override the veto? We are \nholding this vote today because the President made a terrible mistake \nin vetoing the bill. It is up to Congress--it is up to Congress on this \nissue to listen to the people, to try to reverse it.\n\n  Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to correct the President's \nmistake. We are going to work on it. I ask our constituents and the \nconstituents of other Senators who may be undecided to let them know \nhow important overriding this veto is. I hope--I sincerely, honestly, \nand devoutly hope--that we will muster the necessary votes to override \nthe veto tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis excellent comments and for his strong support for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to understand a little bit \nmore about this procedure and what has been said about this procedure \nover time by those who defend its use. I think it is very instructive \nto understand the history of what has been said so we can better \nunderstand what really is the final thread that those who oppose this \nban hold onto in order to justify their vote against banning this \nprocedure.\n  The first, I guess, almost incredible thing was when this bill was \nfirst introduced in the House--and in the Senate, by Bob Smith here in \nthe Senate--the original response by those who were opposed to this \nbill was that--this is the National Abortion Federation that called the \n``. . . illustrations of partial birth abortions highly imaginative, \nartistically designed but with little relationship to truth or to \nmedicine.''\n  Myriad other reports denied that this even occurred; that there is no \nsuch thing as partial-birth abortion; or, as they like to call it, \nintact D The truth is that Dr. Haskell, who was one of the \noriginators of this procedure, described this procedure at a National \nAbortion Federation meeting in 1992--by the way, the original quote \nthat I quoted from was in 1995--3 years later. Yet, 3 years prior, a \ndoctor spoke before the group and described this very procedure using \nthe very drawings that you saw earlier. Yet, 3 years later, that same \nfederation that Dr. Haskell spoke before denied it exists and denied \nthose pictures and depictions of the procedure had anything to do with \nreality. Lie No. 1.\n  Lie No. 2: This was used by several of the people you may hear from. \nThose who will defend this procedure on the floor today cite several \nwomen who have come forward to say that this procedure was necessary to \npreserve their health and future fertility, or life. One of the women \nwho has been used--in fact, the President called her up to the White \nHouse and brought her before the American public in testimony that she \nhas given. She said she was told by her anesthesiologist that the fetus \nwould endure no pain. This is because the mother is given a narcotic, \nanalgesia, at a dose based upon her weight. The narcotic is passed via \nthe placenta directly into the fetal bloodstream. Due to the enormous \nweight difference, a medical coma is induced in the fetus and there is \na neurological fetal demise. There is never a live birth. The baby \ndies.\n  This was the testimony of a doctor who does this procedure before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee. Obviously, lots of anesthesiologists who \nprovide anesthesia to women who are going through labor and delivery \nbecome incensed that someone would make such a statement--that by \ngiving a woman anesthesia, enough would pass into the baby to kill the \nbaby. In fact, they came up here to the House and Senate pleading to \ntestify to set the record straight, because there were women who were \nnot taking anesthesia because of what they had heard.\n  This is Norig Ellison, president of the American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, 4 years ago:\n\n       In my medical judgment it would be necessary--in order to \n     achieve ``neurological demise'' of fetus in a ``partial \n     birth'' abortion--to anesthetize the mother to such a degree \n     as to place her own health in serious jeopardy.\n\n  In other words, it wouldn't happen. Another lie.\n  Third lie, again, about anesthesia, that:\n\n       The fetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to the \n     mother intravenously.\n\n  Again, Planned Parenthood said the first one.\n  Dr. Haskell, who, again, is one of the abortionists who does this \nprocedure, said to the American Medical News:\n\n       ``Let's talk about whether or not the fetus is dead \n     beforehand. . . .'' Haskell: ``No, it's not. No, it's really \n     not.''\n\n  Lie No. 3, being perpetrated on the American public and the Congress, \nin almost all cases rebuffed by their own people.\n  Lie No. 4--this was a doozy:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is ``rare.''\n\n  Once they got past the point of accepting the fact that it happened, \nthat they admitted that it happened, they then went out and said that \nthis was ``rare''; it only happened a few hundred times a year:\n\n       This surgical procedure is used only in ``rare'' cases, \n     fewer than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the \n     cases of wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong, when a \n     family learns late in pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies, or \n     medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or \n     health.\n\n  This was signed by a slew of abortion rights organizations: The \nGuttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, National Organization of \nWomen, Zero Population Growth, Population Action International, \nNational Abortion Federation, and others. They all signed this. They \nall signed this letter to Congress. They testified in a letter to \nCongress that this was the fact, that it was only tragic cases and \nthere were only a few. But according to the Bergen County Record--and I \nhave to tip my cap to them because, unfortunately, the entire press \ncorps in Washington, DC, read this letter and accepted it as fact\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nand reported consistently that that was the fact. I asked many of the \npress corps did they bother to check, did they bother to check to see \nwhether, in fact, the number and the circumstances were accurate? Did \nanyone bother to call a local abortion clinic in their city and ask?\n\n  The answer was a resounding--that's right--nothing. The Bergen County \nRecord was one newspaper that did. September 15, 1996, just 10 days \nbefore the vote to override the President's veto in 1996:\n\n       But interviews with physicians who use the method reveal \n     that in New Jersey alone, at least 1500 partial-birth \n     abortions are performed each year--three times the supposed \n     national rate.\n\n  Several months later we find out what really was going on.\n\n       Ron Fitzsimmons has suggested that between 3,000 and 5,000 \n     partial-birth abortions could be performed annually.\n\n  Now, how do we know that he is right? We have absolutely no way of \nknowing he is right. I will quote from the American Medical \nAssociation, Journal of the American Medical Association just last \nmonth with respect to how we know how many of these are done.\n\n       First of all, States do not provide abortion-related \n     information to the CDC.\n       Second, data gathered varies widely from State to State \n     with some States lacking information on as many as 40 to 50 \n     percent of abortions performed within their jurisdiction.\n       Third, the category the CDC uses to report the method of \n     abortion does not differentiate between what is called \n     dilation and evacuation, D, and intact D, or partial \n     birth abortion.\n\n  We have no way of knowing, and even if they accurately reported it, \nsome States don't collect the data and those that do, don't report 40 \nto 50 percent of the data. So how do we know? Those of us who are here \ntrying to argue that this procedure should be banned have to rely upon \nRon Fitzsimmons for the information. And who is Ron Fitzsimmons? He is \nthe chief lobbyist for all the abortion clinics in this country that \noppose this bill. So we have to use the information given to us by \nthose who, by the way, have consistently lied, who also don't want the \nprocedure to be banned. We have to accept their numbers as fact because \nthere is no other way to independently check them. So I would just \nallow you to use your imagination as to what the number really is in \nthis country. If they admit to 3,000 to 5,000, what is the real number?\n  Lie No. 5. ``Partial-birth abortion is only used to save a woman's \nlife or health or when the fetus is deformed.''\n  This is Ron Fitzsimmons 2 years previous. Let's rewind 2 years back \nto 1995.\n\n       The procedure was used rarely or only on women whose lives \n     were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.\n\n  And I can give you lots of other quotes, by the way, from the Senate \nfloor and from the House floor that maintained this position, as well \nas all the other organizations that you just saw on the last chart, \nthat that was the reason this procedure was created for those who it is \nused on, and that is why it needs to remain legal.\n  The truth: New York Times February 26, 1997:\n\n       Ron Fitzsimmons admitted he ``lied through my teeth'' when \n     he said the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose \n     lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.\n\n  Ron Fitzsimmons, again quoted in the American Medical News March 3, \n1997:\n\n       What the abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge, \n     Fitzsimmons said, is that the vast majority of these \n     abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy \n     fetuses and healthy mothers. ``The abortion rights folks know \n     it, the antiabortion folks know it and so probably does \n     everyone else,'' he said.\n\n  Well, of course, we knew it. We knew it because Dr. James T. McMahon, \nwho is now deceased, about 6 years ago said that he performed most of \nthe abortions, partial-birth abortions on healthy mothers with healthy \nbabies late in pregnancy, in his case up to the eighth and ninth month \nof pregnancy. He classified only 9 percent of that total of the 2,000 \npartial-birth abortion procedures he alone did, he classified only 9 \npercent of that total as involving maternal health indications of which \nthe most common maternal health indication that he gave as a reason for \ndoing the abortion was depression; 56 percent were for ``fetal flaws,'' \nand those are his words, that included many nonlethal disorders, a \nsizable number as minor as cleft palate.\n  Yes, we knew. We came to the floor and we said here are the facts. \nAnd the other side stood behind the lies. They parroted them knowing \nthat they weren't true. They parroted them either knowing they weren't \ntrue or praying that they could hide behind others who would try to \nfool the American public.\n  The sixth untruth and the final one, at least to date the final one. \nThis is the last untruth that those who continue to oppose banning this \nprocedure hold on to, this last thread of deception. And that is that \n``partial-birth abortion protects women's health.''\n  President Clinton, in his veto message, April 10, 1996, when he \nvetoed the first ban:\n\n       I understand the desire to eliminate the use of a procedure \n     that appears inhumane. But to eliminate it without taking \n     into consideration the rare and tragic circumstances in which \n     its use may be necessary would be even more inhumane.\n\n  Fast forward to October 10, 1997, a year ago, when he vetoed this \nbill.\n\n       H.R. 1122 does not contain an exception to the measure's \n     ban that will adequately protect the lives and health of the \n     small group of women in tragic circumstances who need a an \n     abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy to avert \n     death or serious injury.\n\n  One comment first. This bill clearly has a life-of-the-mother \nprovision. If this procedure is in any way necessary to prevent the \ndeath of the mother, it can be used.\n  The President says ``to avert the death or serious injury.'' To try \nto convince the American public that we do not have a life-of-the-\nmother exception, again, is disingenuous at best.\n  ``Serious Injury,'' let's go to the American Medical Association. Who \nis the American Medical Association? Most people know it is the largest \nassociation of doctors in this country. What is the American Medical \nAssociation position on abortion? They are in favor of abortion rights; \nvery strongly in favor of abortion rights.\n  What is the American Medical Association's position on banning \nmedical procedures? They abhor banning medical procedures. They believe \nthat medical procedures should be left to physicians to determine what \nis good medicine and bad medicine. So, on two counts we should have a \ntough time getting the American Medical Association to endorse a ban on \na medical procedure having to do with abortion. But the American \nMedical Association last year endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \nAct. They stated that it was ``not medically indicated.''\n  Let me quote from a group of obstetricians, several hundred across \nthe country, most of them board certified:\n\n       The partial-birth abortion procedure, as described by Dr. \n     Martin Haskell, the Nation's leading practitioner of the \n     procedure, and defined in the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, \n     is never medically indicated and can itself pose serious \n     risks to the health and future fertility of women.\n\n  Four female OB/GYNs were here today to have a press conference, here \non Capitol Hill, to talk about partial-birth abortion, and all of them \nindicated that not only is this not medically necessary, but this \nprocedure, this rogue procedure, is incredibly dangerous to women and \nto women's health.\n  So, I go back to the point that I made before. There is enough \ngrounds on its sheer barbarism and the fact that it is an affront to \nour sensibilities and to our culture that we would allow this kind of \nhorrific procedure to occur. When you compound that with the fact that \nit is not medically necessary, ever, to protect a woman's health, when \nyou compound that with the fact that it is medically dangerous to women \nto have this procedure done, and it is always done at an abortion \nclinic, where there are inadequate facilities to deal with these \ncircumstances promptly if something should go wrong, if you combine \njust those facts it appears obvious that this procedure should be \nbanned.\n  So, what I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do is to \ndo something that is very, very difficult to do here on the issue of \nabortion. When you mention the word ``abortion'' on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate or the U.S. House of Representatives, people dive into \ntheir trenches. They dive into their trenches that they feel \ncomfortable with because the last thing\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\nyou want to do is, during this battle, jump from trench to trench, to \ntry to get to both sides. That is because you end up getting shot at a \nlot, if you go from what would be considered the pro-life side and try \nto run the battlefield over to the pro-choice side, or vice versa. So \nwhat all the political consultants say is, ``Stay in your trenches when \nyou hear the word `abortion'.'' That is both sides. ``Do not lift your \nhead up because you either get shot by those who you are trying to join \nor your folks will shoot you in the back.''\n  So let me say, first, to the Members of the Congress, the House and \nthe Senate, for those Members who are ``traditionally on the other side \nof this issue,'' who are in the other trench, for them to climb out of \nthat trench to face the fire and to stand with us, as they will \ntomorrow and vote for what they know in their heart is morally, \nethically, and medically right, I salute them and I thank them. That is \npolitical courage.\n  You hear a lot of talk these days about political courage. Will we \nhave the political courage to do the right thing with respect to the \nPresident? Just let me suggest that there are many Members of this \nSenate who tomorrow will show political courage and do the right thing. \nIt is political courage to follow your heart, to follow what you know \ninside you is right, not just right for the children or for the \nmothers, but what is right for our society and the message we send to \nall the people listening and watching what goes on here.\n  For those who have yet to climb out of the trench, I will tell you a \ncouple of things. No. 1, the fire is not that intense once you climb \nout. The American public overwhelmingly supports banning this \nprocedure. All of the medical evidence that has been out there to \nsupport keeping this procedure legal has been debunked and discarded. \nThere is nothing left except zealotry, except this concept that we \ncannot infringe on this right of abortion--even if, as I would argue, \nthis is not even abortion, as others have argued this is not even \nabortion once the baby is outside the mother's womb. But we cannot even \ntouch limiting that right.\n  I would say there is not a right in America that does not have a \nlimit on it. There is not one. Certainly, when it comes to taking the \nlife of a little baby, we in Congress should be able to muster the \ncourage to put some limit, to draw some line that says ``enough.''\n  I would also say that for those to whom I have talked, who have run \nthat gauntlet and come over and voted on this issue to support this \nban, there has been communicated to me a great sense of relief and \nsatisfaction that they could break those chains and stand up and do \nwhat in their heart they knew was right; what in their conscience they \nknew was right. So I appeal to your conscience, I appeal to your heart. \nAnd I appeal to your reason--I appeal to facts. On every score, on \nevery score, we must override the President's veto.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire is here--I am sorry, I turned my \nback and he is gone. Let me just say something about the Senator from \nNew Hampshire. The Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, was the \nfirst person to introduce this bill in the last session of Congress. He \ndid so when there was not a whole lot of popular support in the polls \nfor this because the knowledge of the American public was minimal at \nbest. He stood here when the votes were a lot closer than they were \ntoday and the public was a lot less informed, and all these lies that I \nshowed to you were all out there being accepted by the press as truth. \nBut the Senator from New Hampshire stood here in the well, armed with \nwhat he knew was truth. He stood here and argued and tried to focus the \nAmerican public's attention for the first time on this gruesome, \ngristly procedure. He is one of the heroes in trying to bring the \nconsciousness of the people to this Chamber. So I salute him for that. \nI suspect he will be back in a minute. It gives me the opportunity to \ntalk about a couple of other things.\n  I want to get back to the moral issue at hand. What we are talking \nabout are babies who are in the 20th week of gestation and later. Now, \nfor most Americans, they have a hard time understanding, ``Well, what's \nthe 20th week? What does the baby look like? What are its chances of \nsurvival? What are we talking about here?''\n  At 20 weeks gestation, a normal baby, ``healthy'' baby, most normal \nhealthy babies delivered at 20 weeks of gestation will be born alive. \nThat doesn't necessarily mean that they will survive. In fact, very \nfew, if any, babies born at 20 weeks will survive. But they will be \nborn alive.\n  Let me give you some of the statistics we have, if we can get that \nchart, about survival rates of babies who are subject to partial-birth \nabortion.\n  When the Supreme Court came down with the decision on Roe v. Wade, \nback in the--actually early seventies, but in the late seventies, the \ninformation I have, the viability, the time of viability was considered \nto be around 28 weeks. Babies born before 28 weeks gestation were not \nconsidered to be able to be saved. They were not considered to be \nviable. So much has happened with medical science since that time, and \nthe numbers have changed and changed dramatically.\n  Let me share with you some numbers from The Journal of American \nMedical Association. It is an article I referred to earlier, and I will \ngive the citation. It is called ``Rationale for Banning Abortions Late \nin Pregnancy,'' by Leroy Sprang, M.D., and Mark Neerhof, D.O., \nNorthwestern University Medical School, Evanston Northwestern \nHealthcare.\n  Here are some of the numbers that we have used in past debates.\n  According to a 1987-1988 NIH study of seven hospitals, you can see at \n23 weeks, about a quarter of the babies survive; 24 weeks, 34 percent; \n25 weeks, 54 percent.\n  From 1986 to 1994 at Minneapolis Children's Medical Center, 45 \npercent at 23 weeks; 53 percent at 24 weeks; 77 percent at 25 weeks; \nand 83 percent at 26 weeks. Remember, these weeks gestation during Roe \nv. Wade when the decision was decided, all of these were considered \nzero.\n  In a Michigan study from 1994 to 1996, you see the numbers--27, 57, \n77 and 82 percent.\n  Let me give you some updated numbers from this report that was \npublished last month:\n\n       Recent data from our institution [at Northwest]. . . \n     indicate a survival rate at 24 weeks--\n\n  The second line. A survival rate of 24 weeks of 83 percent--83 \npercent and at 25 weeks at 89 percent.\n  Remember, these are all children born at that hospital, some of whom \nhad abnormalities, some of whom had severe problems. They are not all \nhealthy babies being born, and even at that, the survival rate is in \nthe eighties. If you filtered out those who had fetal anomalies who \nwould have died irrespective of when they were born, I suspect this \nnumber is substantially higher. So we are performing partial-birth \nabortions most commonly on babies who would be almost certain to be \nable to live.\n  Some people suggest I shouldn't draw that distinction. A baby at 20 \nweeks, whether the baby can survive or not, is still a baby. I happen \nto subscribe to that. We draw lines that don't exist in our society \nabout what is life and what isn't. There is no doubt in my mind that \nwhen my wife became pregnant with a child, I knew that was going to be \na little boy or little girl and there wasn't much doubt that it was \ngoing to be a dog or a cat. But we draw lines here as to what is life \nand what isn't.\n  Some people feel comfortable drawing lines here. It comes to \nviability, whether they can live outside the womb. The Supreme Court \nwas one of those entities that did decide that was the place they had \nto draw the lines, where the rights of the child would increase and the \nrights of a woman to kill her child would diminish. By not banning this \nprocedure, we allow little children--imagine, most of them, the vast \nmajority, according to the people who perform it, healthy babies, \nhealthy mothers, with very high probability of surviving, who for just \none small period of time in the life of that child it is unwanted. For \nbut a moment in the life of a child, that baby is temporarily unwanted \nby the one person who has absolute control over its destiny.\n  We read in the paper so much about parents who are seeking to adopt \nchildren. There probably isn't a person here in the room who doesn't \nknow someone who has gone to extraordinary lengths, who has waited an \nextraordinary long period of time to\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\nadopt a baby, to love a baby, to accept it, that little gift from God \nas their own. And yet because for just a moment in time of what could \nbe a long and beautiful life, that baby is unwanted, and because it is \nnot wanted at that very moment in time, its life is taken away.\n  We are talking about if the mother didn't want to carry the pregnancy \nto term, if the feeling was, ``Well, I just don't want to be burdened \nwith this pregnancy anymore,'' deliver the baby, give the baby a \nchance. There is no medical need to kill the baby. There may be medical \nneeds to terminate pregnancy. The doctors today talked about that at \ntheir press conference. There may be the need for the health or life of \nthe mother to terminate a pregnancy, but there is never a need to kill \na baby in the process of terminating the pregnancy. There is never a \nneed to drag this baby out--a baby that feels pain. In fact, in Great \nBritain right now the Parliament is considering requiring doctors who \nperform abortions after 19 weeks to anesthetize the baby because of \nconclusive research that shows that these babies feel pain. In fact, \nthere are articles that have been written by physicians who say they \nfeel pain more intensely than we do.\n  I quote again from this Northwestern study that says:\n\n       When infants of similar gestational ages are delivered, \n     pain management is an important part of the care rendered to \n     them in the intensive care nursery. However, with intact \n     D\n\n  Partial-birth abortion--\n\n     pain management is not provided for the fetus who is \n     literally within inches of being delivered. Forcibly incising \n     the cranium with scissors and then suctioning out the \n     intercranial contents is certainly excruciatingly painful. It \n     is beyond ironic that the pain management practice for an \n     intact D on a human fetus would not meet Federal standards \n     for the humane care of animals used in medical research.\n\n  We have laws in this country--imagine--we have laws in this country \nthat require us to treat animals--animals--better than we treat these \nlittle gifts from God. What is to become of us when we simply cannot \nsee what we do?\n  I see the Senator from Illinois is here. I have used a lot of time on \nour side. I would be happy to yield the floor to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. Let me say at the outset that \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania comes to this floor to discuss this \nissue with heartfelt emotion. I am convinced of his commitment to this \ncause. I have served with him in both the House and the Senate. I would \nnever question his motives. And I know a little bit about his family \nsituation. I am sure that they are sincere.\n  I also say to you that this may be the most difficult issue for any \npolitician to deal with in America today. I have been in and around \npublic life for 32 years. It has not gotten any easier in 32 years, at \nleast not since the Roe v. Wade decision, because the American people \nare basically conflicted internally about this issue of abortion.\n  There are some who would argue no abortions under virtually any \ncircumstances and others who would argue that the State--Government--\nshould not restrict abortions under any circumstances. But the vast \nmajority of Americans, I think personally, fall into some middle ground \nwhere they understand that a woman's right to make this decision, in \nconcert with her doctor, her family and her conscience, is something \nthat should be protected under law--it is currently protected under \nlaw--but they want to see us do everything we can as a Government and \nas a people to reduce the likelihood of abortion in this country. The \nnumber of abortions have diminished some over the past few years, but \nit is still a very widespread practice and medical procedure in \nAmerica.\n  My own personal views on it--I personally oppose abortion but I \nbelieve that we should take care where we draw the line about the \nGovernment's involvement in that decision. You would think after \nserving on Capitol Hill for 16 years, and facing literally hundreds of \nvotes on the issue, that this would become rote, that it would be an \neasy, automatic, reflexive vote. It has never been that for me. It \nnever will be. I pause and think and worry over every vote on this \nsubject because I know what is at stake is very serious.\n  Today, the Senator from Pennsylvania comes to the floor and asks us \nto vote to override President Clinton's veto of his bill banning what \nis known as the partial-birth abortion procedure. I will be voting to \nsustain the President's veto. I will be voting in opposition to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, but I want to make it clear why I am doing \nso.\n  It is my belief that this bill, as far as it goes, addresses one \nchallenge before us. This bill addresses one abortion procedure. But \nthere are many different kinds of procedures. As terrifying and \ntroubling as this procedure is, there are others. And the Senator from \nPennsylvania would ban this one procedure, if I am not mistaken, at any \nstage in the pregnancy. Many of us believe that this issue should be \naddressed in a different manner.\n  When it comes to the issue of late-term abortions, allow me to try to \nexplain what I mean when I use that term. In the Roe v. Wade decision--\nI believe in 1972, if I am not mistaken--the Court, the Supreme Court \nacross the street, divided a pregnancy into three sections, three \ndifferent trimesters, three different periods of 3 months and basically \nsaid in the first two trimesters, the first 6 months of the pregnancy, \nthat they would give the paramount right to the woman to make the \ndecision whether she continued the pregnancy. They made it clear that \nin the third trimester, the end of the pregnancy, that the State would \nbe able to impose restrictions.\n  They drew a distinction between that time when the fetus could \nsurvive outside the mother's womb and that time when it could not. And \nif it could not--the previability phase--then they felt that this was \nmore a decision for the woman to make. After viability, that is, the \nability of the fetus to survive outside the womb, then the State--the \nGovernment--could step in and say, ``We will limit the circumstances \nunder which a woman can seek an abortion.''\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today does not make that \ndistinction. It does not draw that line. I fear it is fatally flawed \nfrom a constitutional viewpoint, from the viewpoint of the case of Roe \nv. Wade which guides us in this debate. As a result, I am not certain \nthat this bill, even if it were enacted over the President's veto, \nwould survive a Court test. I believe the Court has said repeatedly, \n``We are serious about drawing that line.'' This particular bill does \nnot draw that line.\n  Having said that, though, let me tell you that I am not going to \nengage this debate just on pure legalisms and interpretations of Roe v. \nWade. Let me go to the real question before us. Let me try to address \nsome of the points which the Senator from Pennsylvania has made.\n  I am not a medical doctor. Some Members of Congress are; I am not. \nWhen I hear medical doctors say that this procedure, this partial-birth \nabortion procedure, is never medically necessary, I take that very \nseriously.\n  Recently, in the Chicago Tribune, in my home State of Illinois, a \nprofessor from, I believe, Notre Dame University, Douglas Kmiec--I hope \nI am pronouncing it correctly--wrote an article on July 27 in which he \nquoted a man whom I respect very much, C. Everett Koop, a medical \ndoctor who served as our Surgeon General and who I have worked with \nclosely on the tobacco issue. He quoted Dr. Koop as saying that this \nmedical procedure, this ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically \nnecessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.''\n  As I said, such a statement from a medical doctor, and someone of Dr. \nKoop's reputation, I take very seriously. As a result, I came back to \nmy office and wrote a letter the following day, on July 28, 1998, to a \ngroup which I respect, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists here in Washington, DC. I did not try to color this \nletter or to influence their reply in any way. I wrote to them and \nsaid, ``Tell me, is Dr. Koop right? Is this abortion procedure never \nmedically necessary?''\n  A few days later I received a reply from Dr. Ralph Hale, executive \nvice president of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists. I ask\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     364 Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July \n     28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to \n     Dr. Koop's statement that ``Partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future \n     fertility.''\n       The College's position on this is contained in the \n     statement of policy entitled Statement on Intact Dilation and \n     Extraction. In that statement we say, ``Terminating a \n     pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life \n     or preserve the health of the mother.'' It continues, ``A \n     select panel convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances \n     under which this procedure, as defined above, would be the \n     only option to save the life or preserve the health of the \n     woman.'' Our statement goes on to say, ``An intact D & X, \n     however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a \n     particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with \n     the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances \n     can make this decision.'' For this reason, we have \n     consistently opposed ``partial-birth abortion'' legislation.\n       Please find enclosed ACOG's statement on intact D & X. \n     Thank you for seeking the views of the College. As always, we \n     are pleased to work with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       ACOG Statement of Policy on Intact Dilation and Extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit as method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has promoted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes that the intent of such legislative proposals \n     is to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       1. deliberate dilation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specified method of abortion, so it is unknown how many \n     of these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show \n     that second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a \n     safe procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me speak to the contents of this letter, because I \nthink it is an important letter when we consider the medical debate \nhere--not the legal or political debate but the medical debate.\n  Dr. Hale wrote to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July \n     28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to \n     Dr. Koop's statement that ``Partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future \n     fertility.''\n\n  Dr. Hale goes on to say:\n\n       The College's position on this is contained in a statement \n     of policy entitled ``Statement on Intact Dilation and \n     Extraction.''\n\n  That term, ``intact dilation and extraction,'' is the technical \nmedical term for what we term ``partial-birth abortion.''\n  Dr. Hale goes on to say:\n\n       In that statement we say, ``Terminating a pregnancy is \n     performed in some circumstances to save the life or preserve \n     the health of the mother.'' It continues, ``A select panel \n     convened by [the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists] could identify no circumstances under which \n     this procedure, as defined above, would be the only option to \n     save the life or preserve the health of the woman.''\n\n  The statement goes on to say,\n\n       An intact D, [partial-birth abortion] however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman . . .\n\n  And listen closely,\n\n       . . . and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision.\n       For this reason, we have consistently opposed the partial-\n     birth abortion ban legislation.\n\n  He encloses the statement in full.\n  So what are we to do? Members of the Senate have conflicting medical \nopinions here. Some medical associations in my home State, some doctors \nwhom I respect, like Dr. Koop, feel that it is never necessary; and the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it may be the \nbest or most appropriate procedure and only the doctor can decide.\n  It puts us in a dilemma. Some think it is an easy call--never will we \nneed it; never should we use it. Then you read from the doctors who \nwork with these women who have come upon complications in their \npregnancy that they never expected.\n  When this matter was first debated, I met a woman from a suburb of \nChicago, from the Naperville area, who has been kind enough or brave \nenough to come forward and explain what happened to her. Her situation \nopened my eyes to the fact that this debate is not as easy as it \nsounds. She was the mother of a child, pregnant with another child, and \nhad determined through ultrasound that she was about to have a little \nbaby boy. She and her husband had picked out a name. She had painted \nthe nursery. They had bought the furniture. They were ready and \nexpecting parents, only to learn late in the pregnancy that the child \nsuffered from a serious deformity which precluded the possibility that \nit would survive after birth, and that the continued pregnancy could \njeopardize her health or her ability to ever have another child.\n  I spoke to her about what happened after the doctor made that \ndiagnosis. She spoke of sitting up all night crying with her husband \nover what they were to do. They did not believe in abortion. Yet what a \nterrible dilemma they faced. Continue the pregnancy at the risk to her \nhealth, at the risk of never having another baby, or terminate the \npregnancy of a fetus, a baby--whatever term you use--that could not \nsurvive. They made the decision to go ahead with the procedure that \nwould be banned by this legislation.\n  She told me that story. Then she introduced me to her new baby in the \nstroller she was pushing. They made the decision to go forward and look \nto the future with another baby.\n  I won't presume that everyone listening to this debate would have \nmade that same decision. Others might have seen it quite differently. \nIn her case, she thought she and her husband, with their doctor, did \nthe right thing, and their decision resulted in another baby boy that \nthey are very proud of and happy to have brought on this Earth.\n  So the belief that many people engage in this procedure for casual \nreasons--at least in this case--did not apply. We have to take care in \nthis debate that when we ban certain procedures and say doctors can \nnever use them, we apply them to all situations,\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\nincluding the one that I have just described.\n  Here is what I think we should do. I will vote to sustain the \nPresident's veto. I don't know if I will prevail or whether the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania will prevail. But I hope that we can leave this \ndebate without saying that they have had another wild debate in \nWashington, the issue went unresolved, and they will probably return to \nthat same debate next year--we have done that year after year after \nyear.\n  A number of us, today, came forward and said that we hoped that we \ncould take this debate to another position, another level, a more \nconstructive level, I hope, after we consider this legislation. I \njoined Senators in the press gallery today who have agreed to be \noriginal cosponsors of legislation which I have introduced. This is \nlegislation that is supported by Democrats and Republicans: Senators \nOlympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Republicans of Maine; Democrats \nTorricelli, Mikulski, Robert Graham, Landrieu, and Lieberman are my \ncosponsors on this legislation. I hope that in introducing this bill we \ncan move this debate to another level, a different level, and one that \nis not inconsistent with the philosophy of my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  What we attempt to do in this bill is say the following: Let us \nrestrict all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure--whether \nit uses this procedure or some other procedure--to two specific \nexamples: Situations where the life of the mother is at stake--in other \nwords, if she learned in the seventh, eighth, or ninth month of \npregnancy that if she continued the pregnancy she would die; or \nsituations where that same mother learns late in the pregnancy that if \nshe continues the pregnancy she runs the risk of grievous injury to her \nphysical health, like the case that I just described. Those are the \nonly exceptions. No other reasons.\n  It is not a question of being depressed or changing your mind--as if \nanybody would make a decision on an abortion for that matter. I don't \nknow that they ever would, but it is specifically prohibited under this \nlaw.\n  And we say that not only the doctor who performs the abortion must \ncertify these medical circumstances, but in addition, a second \nnontreating doctor must be brought in. He or she must certify in \nwriting that these medical conditions exist. Then and only then could \nthere be any abortion procedure, including this one, in a late-term \npregnancy.\n  We believe this is a constructive and, I hope, promising approach. It \nbuilds on an amendment offered last year by Senator Tom Daschle, the \nDemocratic minority leader, one that I supported. We have added the \nsecond doctor's opinion because criticisms were raised--I didn't agree \nwith them--that the doctor who performed the abortion might make a \ncertification that was dishonest. We think the second doctor's opinion \nwill argue against that.\n  The penalties involved in this are very serious. A doctor who would \nignore the law which we seek to have enacted in the bill which we will \nintroduce today faces a fine of $100,000 for the first instance, and a \npossible loss of his medical license. In the second case, a fine of \n$250,000 and the loss of his medical license.\n  I don't know how you can be more serious than the approach we have \ntaken, to say we want to make certain that late-term abortions are \nlimited to these situations.\n  Some people have asked, Why don't you just vote for the bill that is \nbefore the Senate as well as your own? I cannot do that. The reason I \ncannot do it is because there is no provision made in the bill offered \nbefore the Senate for cases where a woman discovers late in her \npregnancy that to continue the pregnancy would present the risk of \ngrievous injury to her physical health. There is a life-of-the-mother \nexception, but no exception for grievous injury to physical health. \nThat is the reason I will vote to sustain the President's veto. Later \ntoday, at the appropriate time, I will introduce the legislation which \nI have coauthored and described.\n  Let me say in closing that I respect the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand his views and I respect those who disagree with him. I believe this \ndebate is a debate over an issue of conscience and one that many of us \nstruggle with on a regular basis. I hope that what we have tried to do \ntoday on a bipartisan basis, to suggest an alternative approach, could \nlead us away from this long-term debate, to a resolution in a fair and \nhumane manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I can take a moment to specifically \nrespond to a couple of things from the Senator from Illinois. I commend \nhim for coming forward and expressing his views. We don't agree, but as \nis appropriate here in the U.S. Senate, we can disagree without being \ndisagreeable. I respect his right to articulate his viewpoints.\n  With respect to the letter from the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists that the Senator from Illinois read, they did say \nthey:\n\n       . . . could identify no circumstances under which this \n     procedure would be the only option to save the life or \n     preserve the health of a woman.\n\n  And they do go on to say:\n\n       . . . however, [it] may be the best or most appropriate \n     procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  However, no specific examples or circumstances under which an intact \nD would be the most appropriate procedure are given. In fact, they \nhave never been given. They have never put forward any procedure, any \ncircumstance in which they say it may be, but they have never given any \nhypothetical where it says it would be. That is somewhat troubling, to \nsort of hang your hat on a possibility when the very organization you \nare hanging your hat on refuses to give a possibility of whether it \nmeets their definition.\n\n  With respect to the constituent in the Senator's State, I can't tell \nyou how sorry I feel for her and for what she had to go through. But, \nunfortunately, many people in this country do not get the best medical \ninformation. One of the things I hope we can accomplish with this \ndiscussion--and I think to some degree we have--is to improve the \nquality of information women get in this country with respect to \ndecisions about pregnancy, particularly late-term, and particularly \nwhen it comes to disabled children or children who maybe just aren't \nperfect.\n  I just know from all of the information we have been provided from \nthe AMA, from the physicians--and Senator Frist is going to talk about \nit from the point of view of a physician --in every case the President \ncited, including the case the Senator referred to in Illinois, there \nwere other, better alternatives available to her that would have been \nsafer for her to have as opposed to this. It doesn't mean her doctor \ndidn't want to perform this. The doctor may well have. But the fact is, \nwe don't always get the best doctors who give us the best advice. We \nwent to the experts, and what the experts have told us is that this \nprocedure is not the safest.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee, the only physician \nin the U.S. Senate, to talk about that very subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to really cut through a lot of the \nemotion and a lot of the rhetoric and really bring together how I view \nthis particular issue. And really I will take very few minutes because, \nto me, it becomes very clear once the facts are put on the table.\n  I speak as a U.S. Senator, as someone who understands an obligation \nto his fellow man, as being a trustee in the U.S. Senate to the \nAmerican people; but I also want to speak as a physician, one who has \nspent his entire adult life in the practice of medicine, reaching out \nto people, being trained at hospitals across this country, exposed to \naccepted therapeutic procedures, understanding what peer review is \nabout, and to let you know how I assess where we are today.\n  It really comes down to a single statement, which is as follows: \nPartial-birth abortion should never--should never--be performed, \nbecause it is needlessly risky to the woman, because it is an \nunnecessary procedure, because it is inhumane to the fetus, and because \nit is medically unacceptable and offends the very basic civil \nsensibilities of people all across this country.\n\n[[Page S10481]]\n\n  Several points. No. 1, there has been this whole myth of how common \nthis procedure is. Let me just say that the procedure is being done \ntoday as we speak. Initially, it was billed as being a very rare \nprocedure, that really just a handful are being done, and therefore we \ndon't need Federal legislation. Well, one of the byproducts of this \nongoing debate over the last 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years has been that we know \nthis procedure is being performed every day. In fact, we looked at \ninformation that has come out and we know that one facility has \nreported almost 1,500 of these in 1 year. One physician reported doing \nmore than 700 of these procedures, and another, over 2,000 of these \nprocedures. Remember, these are brutal procedures.\n  A second point. This procedure has been defined on the floor, and it \nwill be defined again, because it is important for people to understand \nwhat a brutal procedure this is. But an equally important point is that \nthis procedure poses substantial risk for the mother, for the woman. It \nis a dangerous procedure being performed every day on the fringe, \noutside of mainstream medicine.\n  It is important for people to understand that this procedure is not \ntaught in any medical school in the United States of America. It is \nimportant for the American people to understand that generally accepted \ntextbooks do not even mention this procedure. It is not defined. It is \nimportant for America to understand that there are no peer-reviewed, \ncredible studies on partial-birth abortion that evaluate in any way its \nsafety. It is important for the American people to know that our OB/\nGYN, obstetrics/gynecologic, residencies who train residents to deliver \nbabies in the future do not have this procedure as a part of their \ncurriculum. Why? Because it is dangerous, it is fringe, outside of the \nmainstream. It has not been evaluated. Yet, it goes on every day, \nhurting women all across this country.\n  What are the complications? Well, there are a number of standard \ncomplications that occur during a third-trimester abortion. That \nincludes perforation of that organ, the uterus, which contains the \nfetus. There is a second risk of infection when an abortion is \nperformed in that third trimester. There is a third, and that is of \nbleeding. But, in addition, because the way this procedure--this \nfringe, brutal procedure--is performed--and remember, it is performed \nin a blind way, with the hand inserted into the uterus with scissors \nthrust up underneath that head and into the base of the skull. That is \nall done blindly, in a uterus which is large, containing the fetus, \nwhich is engorged, has huge blood vessels within a centimeter of where \nthese scissors are blindly being thrust into the base of the skull.\n\n  I describe it that way because that is the reality, and the risk is \nthere for this procedure, and it is not for other types of procedures, \nof laceration, of hemorrhage, of bleeding, of having those scissors \nnick one of those blood vessels and have the patient suffer. One of the \nproblems is because these procedures are not performed at the \nMassachusetts General Hospital where I practiced, or Vanderbilt Medical \nCenter where I practiced, or Stanford Medical Center where I practiced, \nwhere there is peer review, where people are looking in. And because \nthese procedures are performed in clinics not subjected to peer review, \nwe never hear about those complications. But the complications are \nthere, and hospitals see these patients admitted after this procedure. \nIt is a dangerous procedure. The risks are there to women. Yet, we as \nan American people have allowed that to occur all across this country.\n  A third point. This really applies, I think, and enters the field of \nethical considerations, which is what we do to the fetus. Remember, the \nfetus is very far along. This is just prior to delivery of that infant. \nI want to make this point, and I don't want to dwell on the point, but \nthat taking of scissors and thrusting it into the base of the skull, \nthe expansion of those scissors and the ultimate evacuation of the \nbrain, those contents, is painful to that infant. That infant feels \nthat pain. Thus, it is an inhumane procedure in which no specific pain \nmanagement is given, and that forcible incising of the cranium, or \nhead, is painful.\n  Fourth point. This procedure is unnecessary. It is never --never--the \nonly option. According to the Society of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, who will be referred to again and again, ``We could \nidentify no circumstance under which this procedure would be the only \noption to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.'' That \nstatement is a very important one because it basically says this is an \nunnecessary procedure.\n  There will be colleagues to follow--and there will be comments by \nmany of my colleagues--saying, ``Yes, that is right. We can't identify \nany particular circumstance where there is not a safer accepted \nmainstream procedure that could be used.'' But I don't like the Federal \nGovernment doing anything and saying it is against the law to do any \nparticular procedure, even if you could find it in detail like you \nhave. I don't want them coming in just in the event something will come \nup.\n  Again, let me go back. This is a fringe procedure. It is out of the \nmainstream, not subjected to peer review. We know it is dangerous. \nThere are always alternative procedures available.\n  It is a common procedure performed frequently. It is a dangerous \nprocedure--dangerous to the woman. It is an inhumane procedure \nthrusting those scissors into that fetus' head. It is an unnecessary \nprocedure. Never is it the only option. Alternative procedures are \nalways available.\n  Over the last couple of years as I have studied this issue, a lot of \nthings have been made apparent to me. We need data collection. We need \npeer review of these sort of fringe procedures that are performed \noutside of the mainstream.\n  There has been, I believe, extraordinary medical consensus that has \ncome forward. It was difficult 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years ago, because \nphysicians who are trained in our 125 academic and medical centers and \nmedical schools have never been exposed to this procedure. It is only \nthe fringe physicians in clinics outside of the major hospitals doing \nthe procedure. Most people didn't know what a partial-birth abortion \nwas. We have educated physicians. We have educated people in the health \ncare arena. And, as a product of that, there has been this \nextraordinary medical consensus that has emerged.\n  Yes, on the floor you can always hear people who stand up and say, \n``We are against the Federal legislation because it infringes on our \nright to make decisions about our patients.'' They don't come out and \ndefend the procedure.\n  We need to come back again and again and recognize that this is not a \ndebate about pro-life, or pro-choice, or abortion to me in any way. \nBecause of the way the bill is written, it focuses very narrowly on a \nspecific procedure that is unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to coming back and continuing our \ndiscussion. I know we have a number of people on the floor who want to \nspeak on this particular issue.\n  But let me just close with one final comment before turning back to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nhave done an outstanding job in terms of leadership, and say once again \nthat partial-birth abortion should never be performed because it is \nneedless risk, it is inhumane, it is ethically unacceptable, and it is \ntotally unnecessary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis expert witness testimony here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We \nare fortunate to have an expert in the area of medicine to provide us \nwith this kind of information. I, very much, appreciate his willingness \nto come forward and speak so intelligently and forcefully on this \nissue.\n  I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been very \npatient letting the Senator from Tennessee and now the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Faircloth, be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it saddens me that we are here again debating partial-\nbirth abortion. I feel inadequate at this point after hearing Dr. Frist \ngive a thorough, methodical, and definitive reason why it is such a \ncruel and brutal procedure that it never even should be considered. How \nanybody could vote to sustain a veto after hearing Dr. Frist,\n\n[[Page S10482]]\n\nSenator Frist, explain the brutality and the fringe element that is \ndoing this procedure is more than I can imagine.\n  There are 125 medical centers and schools in this Nation, and not one \nof them teaches the procedure as a method of medicine. It is totally a \nfringe element, as he well says.\n  I feel so inadequate here following him, who is an authority, and \nspent his life in medicine, and understands the medical reasons why we \nshould not be doing it.\n  But the very idea of just taking a pair of scissors and driving them \ninto the skull of a child that is practically ready to be born, to me \nis horrible beyond anything we can think of--the pain to the child, and \nthe danger to the mother. It is absolutely incomprehensible to me how \nanyone could vote to continue this procedure.\n  It was said by Dr. Frist that it is done by a fringe element, but \nthey are doing a lot of them. They are not even taught by medical \ndoctors in medical schools. Yet, we are here authorizing it.\n  Again, how many times will President Clinton stand in the way of the \nCongress and to overwhelming feelings of the people of America and veto \nour attempt at outlawing this horrible procedure?\n  For me, this is about values, our values. It is one of the great \nmoral questions of our time. It is a moral question. We know that late-\nterm abortions are wrong. We know it from everything we are taught--\nfrom our religious beliefs, to our medical authorities, which we just \nheard. We need to summon the moral courage to draw a clear line of \nconscience by saying simply flat and straight out, ``no more partial-\nbirth abortions,'' not just from the facts that we heard from Senator \nFrist, but just the overall facts. The American Medical Association \nsays that partial-birth abortions are medically unnecessary. That one \nstatement is true is enough to outlaw this procedure. But it actually \nis not even done in the medical profession. It is a fringe procedure \nthat goes far outside the normal circles of medicine.\n  Former Surgeon General Everett Koop said partial-birth abortions may \nharm a mother's fertility. We hear from other segments of the American \nmedical society that it probably will harm a mother's fertility. \nSpiritual leaders from every segment of religion in the country--\nreligious leaders such as Billy Graham, Pope John Paul--have spoken out \non the horrible procedure that this is and how it should be eliminated \nfrom our society forever and outlawed forever.\n  We are talking about taking the life of a child who can survive \noutside the mother's womb. We just heard Senator Frist describe it can \nsurvive, and how that life is taken by the cruel process of pushing a \npair of scissors into it and expanding it and removing the brain.\n  It is a horrible procedure. Both pro-life and pro-choice should be \nable to agree that those children deserve our law and protection.\n  I am asking my colleagues--and, most importantly, President Clinton--\nto put values ahead of votes and end the tragedy of partial-birth \nabortion.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I yield any time I may have.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from California is here, and \nshe said she is not quite ready so we will proceed with another \nspeaker. The Senator from New Hampshire has been very patient. I yield \nto him such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator \nfor his leadership.\n  I wish to start my remarks by saying what an honor and privilege it \nis for me to stand here on the Senate floor with such distinguished \ncolleagues as Senator Frist, Senator Faircloth, Senator Santorum and \nothers who have spoken out so eloquently against this terrible practice \nthat takes place, unfortunately, too many times in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I was particularly impressed with the remarks from our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Frist, who today I think is more important as a \ndoctor than as a Senator perhaps, listening to his very impressive and \ntechnical remarks about just exactly what this procedure is and how it \nis not necessary for the health or the life of the mother, to save the \nlife or to enhance the health of the mother, and he noted, as has been \nsaid, the fringe element who perform these horrible procedures.\n  In addition to that, I would just mention that here in this \nnotebook--Senator Frist you heard from. He had a press conference this \nmorning with four distinguished physicians, obstetricians and \ngynecologists, who spoke out saying the exact same thing that Senator \nFrist said. Here in this book are 180 letters. These are just the ones \nI have received in my office. These are from all the doctors who say \nthat it is unnecessary to save the life of the mother or to enhance the \nhealth of the mother--180. I am sure there are many other Senators who \nhave received similar correspondence saying exactly the same thing.\n  But having been involved for almost 4 years now in this debate, \ncoming to the floor, fighting your heart out, losing, it is pretty \ntough, and it is very emotional. And I know it has been the same for my \ndear friend and colleague, Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, who has \npoured his heart and soul into this issue.\n  I remember very clearly, and I am sure the Senator does as well, in \n1995, when I was pretty much alone on the floor of the Senate--and I \nwant to get into that a little bit in a moment as to why I was here--\nthere was a newly elected Senator, fairly newly elected Senator from \nPennsylvania named Santorum who was not saying anything but listening \nto the debate. There was a very emotional exchange privately between \nthe Senator and myself. He just indicated to me that he had to get \ninvolved in this because of the horror of it, and he has. He has been a \ngreat leader, and I certainly appreciate another horse in the harness, \nso to speak.\n  This is beyond, I should say, the in-your-face politics that we have \nendured on the floor in the past. I know I have gotten beyond it. I \ndon't want to get into anybody's face on abortion or partial-birth \nabortion. I want to get in your heart. I want to get in your hearts \nbecause that is what this is about. I know that as we debate on the \nfloor you don't see a huge crowd here. Hopefully, somebody is watching \non the monitor. Of that 36 out there who have yet to see our way, maybe \nsomehow, some way, some will see that it is wrong to continue to \ntolerate this in America and their votes will change, at least enough \nvotes will change to end this horror.\n  This is America, supposedly the moral leader of the world. What does \nit say to our children when we kill children, their colleagues, with a \npair of scissors and a suction hose as they exit the birth canal? What \ndoes that tell them? How do you say to your children, ``Be good today; \ndo your homework; mind your parents; do what's right; live a good life; \nbe a good Christian; do unto others; be good''--how can you say that \nand support this? What message are you giving them?\n  No one should be surprised about the immorality that we see in our \ncountry today because we are not setting the example. We have an \nawesome responsibility as leaders in this country, whether we are in \nthe Senate or whether we are just ordinary parents every day setting an \nexample for our children. It is an awesome responsibility.\n  I remember when I spoke in the Chamber 3 years ago, I was chastised \nby a colleague for showing those same medical charts that Senator \nSantorum has shown in front of young pages sitting in the well. Well, I \nthink they had to see that. I think they needed to know what we as \nadults are doing to their younger colleagues, the unborn children who \nhave done nothing against anybody. This is the execution of a child as \nit enters the world. You cannot color it up. You cannot make it any \nnicer.\n  You can talk about all the legalities. I heard my colleague, Senator \nDurbin from Illinois, a few minutes ago say we had to follow the \nguidance of Roe v. Wade. I might change that slightly and say the \nmisguidance of Roe v. Wade. This is not about technicalities. It is not \nabout legal definitions. It is not about falsely creating definitions \nof what threats to health or threats to life are. This is about real \nchildren really dying every day as we speak. As this debate occurs, \nmore will die, and we are letting it happen. And three\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nvotes in this Chamber tomorrow morning, three more than we had the last \ntime, will end it all, will stop it. So when you think about whether \nyour vote counts, whether it matters, my colleagues, it matters. It \nmatters.\n  I stood in the Chamber 3 years ago. Initially, I didn't know what \nthis was. I could not believe that anything that would even resemble a \nso-called partial-birth abortion would occur in this country. I didn't \nbelieve it. So I checked it out. I talked to people who actually \nassisted and performed them. I took the charts. I came down in the \nChamber. I held up the same medical doll that four doctors held up in a \npress conference today. I showed exactly what happened with a medical \ndoll--not a plastic fetus, as the critics in the press like to call it, \nbut a medical doll. I simply showed the same size as a real child, the \nsame size as that child who is being held by the abortionist, to simply \nshow what happens.\n  I said then and I will say now, in any community in America--you pick \nit, you name it, your hometown, wherever it is--if you picked up your \nhometown paper tomorrow and in that hometown paper it said all the \npuppies and cats in your local humane society were going to be killed \nwith no anesthetic, with a scissors to the back of the skull, open the \nskull and insert a tube to suck the brains out, I think you would \nprobably be pretty upset. And you know what? It would probably be \nstopped. It probably wouldn't happen. But it is happening to children \nand we are letting it happen right here, tomorrow, on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate unless three Senators have the courage to put the politics \naside and change their vote.\n\n  When I came down here in 1995, I had one cosponsor because, frankly, \npeople didn't know what this was. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas was an \noriginal. We have come a long way since then, and we are not there yet. \nWhen the partial-birth abortion ban first passed the Senate on December \n7, 1995, it did so with the support of 54 Senators. When the Senate \nvoted whether to override President Clinton's veto on September 26, \n1996, 57 Senators voted, and when the Senate passed H.R. 1122, on May \n20, 1997, 64 Senators voted in favor.\n  You see, in here it is a numbers game. It is a game of numbers. But \nout there every day in those abortion clinics, it is a life game. It is \na little child that is being killed for no other reason, other than it \nis not wanted. That is the reason.\n  I, as I total up those thousands, and I think about it, I ask myself \nhow many times have I said this, night after night, as I thought about \nthe horrors of this--how many of these children may have grown up to be \na physician? Maybe a chaplain? Maybe a President? Maybe a scientist, to \ncure cancer?\n  Jefferson wrote so eloquently the Declaration of Independence that we \nhave ``the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' You \ncannot have liberty, you cannot pursue your dreams, if you are killed \nbefore you are born. I do not often quote from the Bible, but you reap \nwhat you sow, and we will reap what we sow if we do not end this \npractice in America.\n  When the historians write about this age and this era--and I am \nstanding right now at the desk of Daniel Webster. I think about it \nevery time I speak. It is the only original desk in the Senate. There \nwas a resolution passed in the 1960s that said for now and ever more, \nthis desk belongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire. Nobody else \nwill ever get it. That is one of the highest honors that anybody could \never have.\n  But the point I am making is we are here for only a short time. \nWebster occupied this desk. It did not belong to Webster, and it does \nnot belong to me. It belongs to the people of New Hampshire and the \npeople of America. The years will go by and the historians will look \nback, just like they look back on Lincoln and the Civil War, and they \nare going to write about this era. I know one thing, Senator Santorum, \nwe are on the right side. History is going to judge us as being on the \nright side, I promise you that. Don't worry about it. It is a done \ndeal. We are on the right side, for the same reason that Abraham \nLincoln was on the right side.\n  Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln taking a poll on whether or not we \nshould end slavery? Putting his finger to the wind and trying to decide \nwhat the politically expedient thing to do is, to end slavery? Could \nyou imagine Patrick Henry taking the floor of the Virginia Assembly and \nsaying I wonder if these folks want liberty or whether they want death? \nMaybe I ought to poll them before I make this speech.\n  Those were men of principle. Those were men of principle. They were \nnot afraid of the political ramifications. When Patrick Henry said \n``Give me liberty or give me death,'' he meant it. He was prepared for \ndeath if he could not have liberty. He meant every word of it. And \nLincoln meant every word of it when he said slavery was wrong and it \nwas immoral. And I mean every word of it when I say that this is wrong \nand this is immoral, and we will be judged on the basis of this vote. \nWe have the chance to override the veto and send a powerful message.\n  Today, 3 votes short, 67 votes. There have been a lot of facts \npresented here today and there will be more, probably, before the day \nis over. Take a fresh look, I ask my colleagues. I beg you. Examine \nyour consciences. This is a huge conscience issue.\n  I believe the reason we have made so much progress towards our goal \nof outlawing partial-birth abortion is that more and more Senators are \nrealizing that the opposition to this bill was built on a foundation of \nlies--lies. I do not use that word lightly. I am using the very word \nthat one of the Nation's leading abortion industry lobbyists used, Ron \nFitzsimmons. He has been quoted here earlier, but he publicly admitted \nlast year that he ``lied through [his] teeth'' when he helped \norchestrate the campaign against partial-birth abortion.\n  When I stood on the floor here, I was told that there were just a few \ndozen a year, that I was some kind of an extremist, a radical. \nPresident Clinton, Vice President Gore, Mrs. Clinton, came to New \nHampshire in 1996 and campaigned against me in the last week of the \nelection on this issue.\n  In an interview published in the New York Times on February 27, 1997, \nand in an article published in the American Medical News on March 3, \n1997, Fitzsimmons made the surprisingly candid admission that he had \n``lied'' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are rare.\n  In those same interviews Fitzsimmons also conceded that he ``lied'' \nwhen he claimed that partial-birth abortions are performed only on \nwomen whose lives are in danger or whose unborn children are severely \ndisabled. ``It made be physically ill,'' he told his interviewer. ``I \ntold my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' '' A man of \nconscience. In seeking to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act last year, the New York Times points out, ``President \nClinton echoed the argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons.'' In other words, in \njustifying his veto, Mr. Clinton relied on the same statements of \n``fact''--or wrong facts--that have now been conceded by a key leader \nof the abortion industry to be ``lies.''\n\n  In summary, the President used Fitzsimmons' argument; Fitzsimmons was \nlying, and the President should change his position. If the President \nof the United States, tonight, would say to his colleagues in the \nSenate, ``I was wrong, override me,'' imagine the impact that would \nhave on this Nation.\n  Regarding the President, I called upon the President a couple of \nyears ago with a personal, handwritten note, to meet with me, to meet \nwith my colleagues privately, publicly, any way he wanted to; on the \nrecord, off the record, with doctors, with his doctors, with my \ndoctors--any way he wanted, any location, any way, any how, any shape \nor form, to discuss this issue so I could present, in 5 or 10 minutes--\nthat's all I asked for--what I believe to be the truth and to show \nwhere he was being told things that were wrong. He never answered my \nletter. Never answered my letter.\n  Let me repeat it tonight, Mr. President, and I think I speak for \nSenator Santorum. We would love to come over and talk to you tonight \nabout this. We will bring our doctors. You can have all of yours. I \nappeal to you to take me up on this. What have you got to lose? Maybe \nyou will agree with us. If you do, you can ask your colleagues in the \nSenate to change their votes.\n  The truth, Mr. Fitzsimmons told the New York Times, is that ``[i]n \nthe vast\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\nmajority of cases, the [partial-birth abortion] procedure is performed \non a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 or more weeks \nalong.'' Five months. And, as Mr. Fitzsimmons told the American Medical \nNews, ``[t]he abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks \nknow it, and so, probably, does everybody else.'' Except, Mr. \nFitzsimmons might have added, for President Clinton, who vetoed this \nbill, even though the reasons he gave to justify his previous veto had \nturned out to be lies.\n  Mr. President, following Mr. Fitzsimmons' startling revelations, on \nMarch 4 the Washington Post ran an unusually blunt editorial entitled, \n``Lies and Late-Term Abortions.'' After recounting Mr. Fitzsimmons' \nlies and his candid admissions that he lied, the Post editorial drew \nthe final conclusion:\n\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons' revelation is a sharp blow to the \n     credibility of his allies. These late-term abortions are \n     extremely difficult to justify, if they can be justified at \n     all. Usually pro-choice legislators such as Senator Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan and Representatives Richard Gephardt and \n     Susan Molinari voted for the ban. . . . Opponents of the ban \n     fought hard, even demanding a rollcall vote on their motion \n     to ban charts describing the procedure from the House floor. \n     They lost. And they lost by wide margins when the House and \n     Senate voted for the ban. They probably will lose again this \n     year when the ban is reconsidered. And this time, Mr. Clinton \n     will be hard-pressed to justify a veto on the basis of \n     misinformation on which he rested his case last time.\n\n  Please listen, Mr. President. Please listen to those words.\n  When the President vetoed H.R. 1122, he did so on the same \ndiscredited basis that he used before. Partial-birth abortions, he \nsaid, are ``sometimes necessary to preserve the woman's health.''\n  That is a false statement. We have had doctor after doctor say it. We \nhad Dr. Frist say it on the floor, and we have had other testimony, \nand, as I said, 180 letters from other physicians saying it as well.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton's assertion that partial-birth \nabortions are sometimes needed to protect a woman's health, again, is \nnot true. Even the AMA, who has been quoted today, has said that. The \nAmerican Medical Association said in the New York Times, May 26, 1997:\n\n       The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of \n     killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most \n     Americans and physicians. Our panel could not find any \n     identified circumstances in which the procedure was the only \n     safe and effective abortive method.\n\n  In other words, as Senator Frist has said on the floor, it is a \nfringe element that performs that.\n  There you have it, Mr. President. My colleagues can take a look at \nthese choices: On the one hand, the claim by the President that \npartial-birth abortions should remain legal because it is needed to \nprotect a woman's health; on the other hand, the American Medical \nAssociation, which is, by the way, pro-choice, saying that partial-\nbirth abortions should be banned because it never was needed to protect \na woman's health. I will take the American Medical Association on this \none.\n  Aside from the Fitzsimmons revelations and the AMA's dramatic \ndecision to support H.R. 1122, I believe another reason why the \npartial-birth abortion ban continues to attract greater and greater \nsupport in the Senate is that Senators are coming to realize that this \nissue really does transcend abortion. I never made any secret about my \nposition on abortion. All abortions are wrong. I am speaking for \nmyself. They all are a taking of a human life, and they are all wrong, \nwhich is why I have introduced a human life amendment to the \nconstitution of the amendment. I am proud of it. I don't care if I only \nget five cosponsors. I am proud of it. I stand on that record, and I \nthink I will be judged correctly for having introduced it, whether I \nget any cosponsors or not.\n  Indeed, as one Senator, Senator Moynihan, who supported us on the \nveto override in the last Congress, put it, partial-birth abortion is \n``too close to infanticide.'' Let me go one step further, and it has \nbeen said here, it is infanticide. All abortion is wrong, but this is \nnot abortion. This is infanticide. This is taking a child in your hands \nand executing it.\n  We need to move away from the partisan rhetoric--not partisan, but \nthe rhetoric on the pros and cons whether the pro-life community or the \npro-choice community supports this; get away from that and look into \nyour hearts. It is never too late to change your position on something. \nI have done it, and others have in here, I am sure. This was a pretty \nstark, truthful way to put it by Senator Moynihan, Mr. President. It \ntook courage for him to say it, and I commend him for it. It takes a \nreal person with a lot of courage and a lot of guts to say he was wrong \nand change his vote.\n  Another Senator who didn't support the bill the first time around \nalso joined us on that override, Senator Arlen Specter, who believes, \nhe says, that partial-birth abortion is more like infanticide than it \nis abortion. Senator Specter said it on the Senate floor September 26, \n1996:\n\n       In my legal judgment, the medical act or acts of commission \n     or omission interfering with, or not facilitating the \n     completion of a live birth after a child is partially out of \n     a mother's womb constitute infanticide.\n\n  I stood on that Senate floor in 1995 with Senator Specter arguing \nwith me heatedly and differing with me. To Senator Specter's credit, he \nstudied it, he looked at it, and he had a change of heart. Again, that \ntakes courage. The line of the law is drawn, Senator Specter said:\n\n       When the child is partially out of the womb of a mother, it \n     is not an abortion, it is infanticide.\n\n  When you hear about this being an abortion to protect the health of \nthe mother or the life of the mother, how does it help the health or \nlife of the mother to restrain a child from being born, holding it in \nthe birth canal, head only, until it is killed? No doctor has told me \nyet how that enhances the health or the life of the mother.\n  Those are strong words from Senator Specter, a pro-choice Senator. It \ntook a lot of guts for him to say it, but he said it.\n  We are picking up support in the Senate. As I have argued today, more \nand more Senators are realizing that the case against this bill is on a \nfoundation of what have now conceded to have been ``lies.''\n  We are also picking up greater and greater support because more and \nmore Senators are realizing that this issue transcends abortion--that \nthe tiny little human being whom we are talking about is a partially \nborn baby who is just inches from drawing her first breath.\n  To those Senators who are still considering joining the ever-\nincreasing majority of Senators who support the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act, let me address a few more comments to you. Perhaps the \nNation's most respected and revered doctor--``America's Doctor''--is \nthe former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop. I am \nparticularly proud of Dr. Koop because he is a part-time resident of my \nhome state of New Hampshire.\n  This is what Dr. Koop has to say: ``Partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. \nOn the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both \nher immediate health and future fertility.''\n  We all know that Dr. Koop is not a man who uses words lightly. On the \ncontrary, Dr. Koop is a doctor who chooses his words with care and \nprecision. Listen to those words again: ``Partial-birth abortion is \nnever medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future \nfertility.''\n  Now, of course, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, even the \nAmerican Medical Association, which is ``pro-choice'' on abortion, has \nendorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. So, my colleagues, if you \nare worried about protecting women, listen to the words of Dr. Koop and \nlisten to the American Medical Association. They are for the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act because partial-birth abortion is never \nnecessary to protect a woman's health.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who are still \nundecided about this bill to look at it in light of our beloved \nNation's history. We all know those beautiful and majestic words that \nThomas Jefferson wrote for our Declaration of Independence: ``We hold \nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that \nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that \namong these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.''\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\n  Mr. President, one does not have to agree with my view that human \nlife begins at conception to see that a living baby who is in the \nprocess of being born has, in Jefferson's words, been endowed by her \nCreator with the unalienable right to life. Can anyone seriously doubt \nwhere that great American, Thomas Jefferson, would stand on that \nquestion?\n  Another of America's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln, made one of \nthe most dramatic and prophetic statements of his life in a speech that \nhe delivered on June 16, 1858. In that speech, Abraham Lincoln said ``I \nbelieve this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half \nfree.'' Today, Mr. President, as we debate this Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act in this great Capitol of the Union that Lincoln saved, I would \nsay this: The moral foundation of this government cannot endure \npermanently when even the half born are not free to live. Can anyone \nreally doubt where that moral giant, Abraham Lincoln, would have stood \non the question before us here today?\n\n  Let us rise to the moral level to which our Nation's history calls \nus. Let us recognize the unalienable, God-given right to life of the \npartially-born. Let us protect the partially-born from a brutal death. \nLet us be worthy of the Nation that Jefferson helped create and that \nLincoln surely saved. Let us pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \nwith a two-thirds' majority and thus override President Clinton's \nunconscionable, immoral, and dishonest veto of this bill.\n  I was honored when, in 1996, the National Right to Life Committee \nrecognized my work in the Senate on behalf of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act by presenting me with its ``Proudly Pro-Life Award'' \nat a banquet at the historic Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. \nThe most memorable moment of the evening, however, was not when I \nreceived the award. Rather, it was when I heard Gianna Jessen sing.\n  Gianna Jessen is a beautiful young woman whose life was nearly ended \nbefore she was born. Gianna's teenage biological mother had her aborted \nin the final three months of pregnancy by the so-called saline solution \nabortion procedure, but Gianna miraculously survived.\n  Though she survived the abortion attempt, Gianna weighed just two \npounds at birth and was afflicted with cerebral palsy. She spent the \nfirst few months of her life in a Southern California hospital. Though \nher doctors doubted that she would ever be able to sit up, to crawl, or \nto walk, after years of physical therapy and surgeries, Gianna, now 21 \nyears old, today enjoys an active, productive, and happy life.\n  As Gianna Jessen stood before the crowd at the Waldorf-Astoria that \nnight and sang ``Amazing Grace,'' there was not a dry eye in the \nhouse--including mine.\n  In July of this year, a media report reached my office about the \nfirst known survivor of an attempted partial-birth abortion. According \nto the Associated Press and other media accounts, personnel at the A-Z \nWomen's Center in Phoenix, Arizona, told a 17-year old mother that her \nunborn baby was between 23 and 24 weeks' gestational age (in other \nwords, between 5 and 5\\1/2\\ months).\n  Reportedly, after beginning the partial-birth abortion procedure, \nabortionist John Biskind found himself dealing with a 6-pound, 2-ounce \nbaby girl of about 37 weeks (near full term), and he delivered her \nalive. She was kept in the hospital with a fractured skull and ``two \ndeep lacerations'' on her face, but no brain damage.\n\n  When I learned about this baby, who pro-life activists call ``Baby \nPhoenix,'' I immediately thought of Gianna Jessen. How wonderful it is \nthat Baby Phoenix will now be able to grow up in this great country of \nours. She may some day stand in front of a pro-life dinner and sing \n``Amazing Grace.'' She may become a scientist and help find a cure for \ncancer. She may become a United States Senator. She may become the \nfirst woman President of the United States. She may become a Supreme \nCourt Justice and vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. With life, anything is \npossible. I praise God that Baby Phoenix lives.\n  The case of Baby Phoenix, the first known survivor of an attempted \npartial-birth abortion, illustrates that we are dealing with real human \nbeings here. For Baby Phoenix, once that partial-birth abortion \nprocedure was started, all that stood between her and a full life was \nan abortionist. In his hands, he held the power of life and death.\n  Thankfully, Mr. President, the abortionist in Baby Phoenix's case, \nJohn Biskind, had a conscience. He saw that he was dealing with a \nlittle human being--all 6 pounds and 2 ounces of her. And he didn't \nbrutally punch a hole in her skull. He didn't take a suction device and \nremove her brain. He didn't kill her. He let her live.\n  Unfortunately, Baby Phoenix is the only known survivor of an \nattempted partial-birth abortion. All the other abortionists who \nperform the partial-birth abortion procedure don't have the conscience \nof John Biskind. They, too, know that they are dealing with little \nhuman beings. They manipulate their little living bodies. They feel \nthose tiny babies move. Then, with unspeakable brutality, they forcibly \nrestrain those little babies from being born, brutally poke scissors \ninto their little skulls, and then literally suck the lives out of \nthem.\n  Today, we can put a stop to the unspeakable brutality of partial-\nbirth abortion. Two-thirds of the United States House of \nRepresentatives has said ``Yes, stop partial-birth abortion.'' The \nAmerican Medical Association has said ``Yes, stop partial-birth \nabortion.'' President Clinton has said, ``No, I want partial-birth \nabortion on demand to be legal.'' Today, the United States Senate can \nsay to President Clinton, ``You are wrong.''\n  I plead with my colleagues. Listen to two-thirds of the House of \nRepresentatives. Think about Baby Phoenix. Listen to the American \nMedical Association. Don't listen to the cravenly political deceptions \nof President Clinton.\n  Vote your conscience. Vote your heart. Vote to stop partial-birth \nabortion. Vote to override the President's veto and let the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act become the law of this land. We will be a better \ncountry for it.\n  I can go on, Mr. President. I know there are lots of other things \nthat I can say, but I will close at this point in the debate by again \nreminding my colleagues to separate yourself from the heated exchanges \nthat we have all had. I see the Senator from Nebraska on the floor. We \nhave had a couple of exchanges in the past on this issue. But try to \nlook into your hearts and see if we can't get out of each other's faces \nand into each other's hearts and see if we can't get three more votes \nto change this horrible procedure.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from California.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield such time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls time. \nDoes the Senator yield to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do, as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, in the spirit of the \nsuggestion made by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and \nearlier, as well, by the Senator from Pennsylvania, I reached my \nconclusion as to what our law ought to be. This is unquestionably a \ndecision that required not just a considerable amount of research about \nwhat our laws and our Constitution permit us to do, but also a \nconsiderable amount of soul-searching.\n  In Nebraska, there are many people--friends, family and people whom I \ndo not know--who have offered their prayers for me during this \ndeliberation. Before I offer my own words as to why I believe the law \nas proposed is both unconstitutional and incorrect, let me say that I \nvery much appreciate those prayers. I have offered them myself on this \nparticular issue. I have had a career now of some 14 years serving the \npeople of Nebraska and have told them almost from day one that though I \nmay sound from time to time as if I am absolutely convinced on an \nissue, I have never, if the evidence proves otherwise, been unwilling \nto change my position.\n  I say to my colleagues, I nearly did so in this case, on account of \nvery good friends who were urging me otherwise, on account of the \nprayers and concerns and the good wishes that were extended to me by \npeople in Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S10486]]\n\n  Mr. President, abortion is a choice a woman makes and, at least in my \nlimited conversations with women who have had to make that choice, is a \ndecision that produces a considerable amount of grief, a feeling that \nsomething has been ended no matter at what stage, whether it is done in \nthe first week or whether it is done in the 15th week. No matter when \nit occurs, it produces a considerable amount of grief. Even when the \ntermination is spontaneous, when it is a spontaneous abortion, a \nmiscarriage, there is a sense of loss. Something has happened that was \nunanticipated. The idea of something good happening has been \ninterrupted by something that is, to the woman's mind anyway, bad.\n  It is very important, it seems to me, to begin with that \nunderstanding. I was very moved, I must say--in fact, I told the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania--by an article not long ago \nabout the struggles he and his wife endured. It was a very moving \npiece. It does, I think, something that very often is missed by the \npublic--this comment is unrelated to this particular debate--it shows \nthe human side of our Members. It is unfortunately true that people \noften see us through our positions, through the positions we have \ntaken, our identity as a Democrat, a Republican and they form an \nimpression. Sometimes we love you, sometimes we hate you, just based \nupon that position. I appreciate very much the willingness of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania to allow that story to be told because it \nshows the human dimension of this issue, and the grieving and the \nterror and the soul-searching that does occur.\n\n  I say that, Mr. President, because one of the things that needs to be \nunderstood is, the law does not direct women to make this choice. It \nmerely gives them the choice, the opportunity to make this decision. It \ndoes not make the decision any easier, it does not make the decision \nfree of soul-searching and prayer, and, again, from my experience in \ntalking with women who have made this decision, it does not produce a \nfeeling that they have just done something wonderful. Indeed, some of \nthe most powerful people in opposition to a woman's right to choose, to \nthe current law, are people who have gone through this procedure. So \npeople need to understand that we begin by extending our prayers, not \njust to us lawmakers, but to people who are going through this \ndecisionmaking process.\n  What we have attempted to do over the course of this debate is to \nbalance the rights of the woman who is carrying the fetus and the fetus \nitself--not an easy debate. The Senator from New Hampshire again makes \na case, I believe, that abortion in all circumstances should be \nillegal. It is very moving, and I am impressed by his passion and the \ncommitment to this issue.\n  But in the process of trying to settle this debate, Mr. President, we \nhave been given guidance by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the guidance of \nthe Supreme Court in both the decision known as Roe v. Wade and the \ndecision known as the Casey decision in Pennsylvania. The language of \nthese decisions needs to guide this Congress and needs to guide the \nAmerican people in drafting legislation, drafting laws that determine \nhow we are going to balance those rights. Otherwise, you should come \nas, again, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has said he \nwould like to come, and change our Constitution. He wants to change the \nConstitution so the Supreme Court can reach a different decision than \nthey did in either the Roe v. Wade decision or the Casey decision.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am coming to the floor very mindful of the \nwishes and prayers of many people in Nebraska who have listened and \nheard this procedure described. And they say, ``It's awful. How can you \nallow it to go on under the law?'' And I am going to describe how I \nreached the conclusion that this piece of legislation would be, I \nbelieve, both unwise and, I believe, unconstitutional.\n  First of all, listen to the language--first the language of the \ndecision in 1973:\n\n       For the period of pregnancy prior to this compelling point \n     [that is the moment of viability; approximately 24 weeks into \n     pregnancy], the attending physician, in consultation with his \n     patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the \n     State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy \n     should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the \n     judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of \n     interference by the State.\n\n  That is us. That is what we do with our laws; we determine whether \nadditional laws need to regulate this decision.\n  Again, going on:\n\n       With respect to the State's important and legitimate \n     interest in potential life, the ``compelling'' point is at \n     viability . . .\n\n  I emphasize that. Very often I will hear people who are pro-choice \nadvocates say, ``Well, why are you doing this at all?'' The Court did \nsay there is a legitimate interest. The Court did provide us guidance \nas to how we can pass laws and restrict this type of health service. \nThere are instructions that enable us to, if we wanted to. We could \nwrite legislation that followed this guidance. I will get to that point \nlater:\n\n       This is so because the fetus then presumably has the \n     capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. \n     State regulation protective of fetal life after viability \n     thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the \n     State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, \n     it may go so far as to proscribe [prevent] abortion during \n     that period, except where it is necessary to preserve the \n     life or health of the mother.\n\n  Those are the instructions. And I am willing to vote, and have in the \npast, to place restrictions, to proscribe, and say that abortions \ncannot be done if the life or the health of the mother is not at stake. \nThat is what the Court has said. And in many instances there have been \nchallenges brought by people who have different views and say the \nConstitution does not provide that right.\n  Again, most recently, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court \nconfirms:\n\n       Roe's essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three \n     parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to \n     choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it \n     without undue interference from the State. Before viability, \n     the State's interests are not strong enough to support a \n     prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial \n     obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the \n     procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to \n     restrict abortion after fetal viability, if the law contains \n     exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman's health.\n\n  So again, Mr. President, the Court has held--they have heard the \narguments, and they have come back and said yes, to those who say that \nGovernment should not be engaged at all in writing laws, the State does \nhave a legitimate right to proscribe abortions after viability. Again, \nI emphasize, I have voted for such restrictions.\n  But the Court has held that there must be a protection for the \nwoman's right to choose if either life or health are at stake. That is \nthe language of the Court. That is what the Court has said under \nchallenge from those who believe that the Court erred in its judgment \nin 1973.\n  Thus, when the AMA comes and argues that this procedure should be \nbanned, I give them heavy weight, substantial weight. But I have as \nwell to give substantial weight to the Constitution and those who are \ninterpreting that Constitution on our behalf, the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We should attempt, when we write laws governing abortion--for those \nof us who believe that a woman should have the right to make a largely \nunburdened decision, burdened only by her own conscience, which is \nsubstantial; I say it again for emphasis, I am troubled very often in \nthis debate that an insufficient amount of attention is paid to the \ngrieving, to the suffering, to the difficulty that a woman faces at \nthis particular moment and afterwards--to balance the rights of the \nwoman against the right of the fetus. That is what we should do. We \nshould write a piece of legislation that keeps a constitutional balance \nin place.\n  Mr. President, I believe this particular piece of legislation fails \nthat test. It might, indeed, be a useful exercise, but it is going to \nbe thrown out. It is going to be thrown out, Mr. President, because it \ndoes two things that the Court has said repeatedly are \nunconstitutional.\n  First of all, let me just read the language, Mr. President. It is a \nfairly short and clear description of what the proponents would like \nthe law to be. It says that:\n\n       Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and \n     thereby\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\n     kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n\n  That brings the State into it, obviously. The doctor could be fined \nor placed in prison as a consequence of doing this procedure in all \nStates. It gives a right of legal action to the father. It gives a \nright of legal action to, I believe, the woman s parents as well. It \ngives the State the right to come in and bring a case against that \ndoctor--but not, Mr. President, only post-viability.\n  The language of this law does not reference either Roe or Casey. It \ndoes not say that this would apply only post-viability; it applies in \nall cases. And though it is quite true that many, as I understand it, \nof these procedures are done post-viability--and, by the way, there are \nmany other procedures that are done, most of which, as they have been \ndescribed to me, are equally grizzly and therefore difficult, on a \npersonal basis, to sustain the argument that this is a good thing to \ndo--many are done before viability. But the Constitution says that we \nare to provide that woman with an uninhibited choice in that \npreviability stage. And this law makes no distinction between pre- and \npost-viability.\n  Indeed, one of the reasons I supported Senator Daschle's proposal \nlast year, which was sharply criticized as a way to provide political \ncover, is because it did address the legitimate interests of the State \nin the post-viability period.\n  I have no idea whether or not there will be additional bills, or \nwhether or not the President's veto will be overridden, but my guess \nis, even if the veto is overridden--assume for the moment that it will \nbe--this will not be the last time that we address the question of the \nState role to regulate abortion, particularly post-viability.\n  I say to my colleagues here, and to the people of Nebraska who have \noffered their prayers, that I am willing to enter into earnest \nnegotiations with the goal of placing additional restrictions around \nabortions late in pregnancy. And this will probably involve some \ncareful definitions around the issue of a health exception, and \ntherefore the circumstances under which a woman can legally choose \nabortion.\n  This bill would create an unspecified prohibition on a particular \nprocedure--a prohibition that would result in the State putting \nrestrictions on pre-viability choices and decisions that a woman and \nher doctor make. Thus, I believe strongly that the Court would find \nthis legislation, this law, unconstitutional and that it would strike \nit down.\n  Even more compelling--and I know we have had this debate before, and \nI don't want to drag it out because I want to merely offer my thoughts \nnot so much to my colleagues, who I suspect have mostly made up their \nminds on this particular piece of legislation, but to the people in \nNebraska--the Court over and over has used the words ``life or \nhealth.''\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire say he did not \nfind any doctor who could justify this procedure. I don't remember his \nexact language. However, our reference in this case can't be only \nphysicians. Our reference has to be the Constitution. The Court has \ngiven us instructions. They told us what we can do and what we can't \ndo. Unless we change the Constitution, we are not going to be able to \nsimply ignore the Court's repeated opinion that post-viability \nrestrictions must include both life and health exceptions.\n  Again, I come to the floor, having heard the prayers of thousands of \nNebraska friends and people who I don't know quite so well, who have \nhoped that I would cast a vote to override this veto. I cannot. Not \nbecause I do not believe that the government has a legitimate interest \nto restrict abortions after viability. In fact, I believe it is in all \nof our interests to do so.\n  This legislation does not do that. This legislation deals with a \nsingle procedure across the span of pregnancy. As a consequence of \nthat, I cannot in either good conscience, or in faith to this \nConstitution, cast my vote to override the President's veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nbegin by thanking the Senator for the work he has done on this \nlegislation. This is, obviously, an issue of great importance, one of \nthe most important issues we have dealt with in this Congress. His \nleadership on this issue has, I think, been a great motivation to many \npeople here. He has had a great deal of influence in the national \ndebate on this issue. I compliment him for what he has done and what I \nknow he will continue to do between now and the vote on this tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I am here to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of \nthe ban on partial-birth abortion. The abortion issue has been a \ndifficult and a divisive one for this country. The unfortunate \nprocedure of partial-birth abortion need not be. The vast majority of \nAmericans--even those who call themselves pro-choice--oppose partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  This overwhelming opposition helped produce legislation to ban that \nprocedure. Unfortunately, the legislation was vetoed by President \nClinton. Now is the time for the Members of this body to stand up and \nto say no to the unnecessary, dangerous and morally troubling procedure \nof partial-birth abortion.\n  We now know that this practice is not rare and that it is not \nundertaken only in cases of severe fetal deformity. Literally thousands \nof partial-birth abortions are performed in this country every year. \nAbortion lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons has said at least 3,000 to 5,000 \npartial-birth abortions are performed nationwide each year. According \nto the prominent abortion doctor, W. Martin Haskell, over 80 percent of \nthe partial-birth abortions he performs are purely elective. Ron \nFitzsimmons reports that in the vast majority of cases the procedure is \nperformed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus.\n  I know that not everyone shares the pro-life position. But in my \nview, it is clear that any reservations about restricting abortion need \nnot, and should not, apply to partial-birth abortion. Regardless of \nwhere one stands on the broader abortion debate, all of us should be \nable to see partial-birth abortion for what it is--an unjustifiable and \nwholly unnecessary tragedy.\n  People on the other side of the pro-life debate often say that the \ndecision of whether or not to undergo an abortion should be left to a \nwoman and to her doctor. Shouldn't we then listen to the official \nposition of the American Medical Association, the official professional \nassociation of doctors in America? The AMA has come out unequivocally \nagainst partial-birth abortion in endorsing this legislation. Dr. John \nSeward, executive vice president of the AMA, referred to partial-birth \nabortion as a procedure ``we all agree is not good medicine.'' The AMA \nhas made a professional judgment based on the medical expertise of its \nmembers that partial-birth abortion is simply not good medicine.\n  Further, our former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, has observed \nthat:\n\n     . . . partial-birth abortion is never [and that is his \n     emphasis] never medically indicated to protect a woman's \n     health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true. The \n     procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both \n     the pregnant woman's health and fertility.\n\n  Those are quotes from Dr. Koop.\n  Earlier today, we heard from the Senate's only physician Member, Dr. \nFrist, who spoke, I thought, both eloquently and with great insight \nbased on his own scientific knowledge and his background as a \nphysician, essentially reaching the same conclusions as the American \nMedical Association and Surgeon General Koop:\n\n       There is simply no valid reason for this procedure to \n     exist. It saves no lives. It puts mothers at increased risk \n     for sterility and other complications, and it is in and of \n     itself, in my judgment, morally unacceptable.\n\n  I reference a recent story from the Associated Press that shows just \nhow dangerous this procedure can be. According to the AP, on June 30 of \nthis year, Dr. John Biskind delivered a full-term baby girl. \nUnfortunately, this little girl was almost killed. She suffered cuts to \nher face and a skull fracture. Luckily, this little girl survived and \nwas adopted by a loving couple. But she literally came within a hair's \nbreadth of being killed on the threshold of life. This little girl has \nsurvived, but we should not lose track of the cause of her injuries.\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\n  Dr. Biskind attempted to perform a partial-birth abortion. The 17-\nyear-old mother had come to Dr. Biskind's A to Z Women's Center seeking \nan abortion. The clinic performed an ultrasound, determining what they \nhad was a 23\\1/2\\-week fetus, and decided to perform a partial-birth \nabortion. Dr. Biskind thought he was performing this procedure on a \nfetus two-thirds of the way to term; that would be bad enough. But, in \nfact, the clinic had made a mistake in the ultrasound. The girl \nactually was approaching full term and Dr. Biskind did not realize this \nfact until he had already begun aborting her.\n  This is astounding. According to Dr. Gerster, a Phoenix physician, a \n24-week-old fetus weighs an average of 2 pounds, whereas a 36-week-old \nfetus weighs, on the average, about 6\\1/2\\ pounds. As Dr. Gerster \ncommented:\n\n       I don't know how such a grave error could be made in \n     estimating the size. There shouldn't be that kind of \n     discrepancy in an ultrasound. It is horrendous.\n\n  Horrendous, indeed, Mr. President. Yet, this is the kind of situation \nwe are attempting to address with this legislation. I think cases like \nthis are why it is time for us to override the President's veto and \npass this bill.\n  As I have said throughout my discussion here today, there are \nreasonable differences--we understand that--in this Chamber and across \nthis country over the substantive issue of abortion rights. Even those \nwho advocate abortion rights are frequently saying--including the \nPresident of the United States--that abortion should be safe and legal \nand rare. It is hard for me to believe that these types of abortions, \npartial-birth abortions, don't fit outside that definition.\n  Mr. President, we all have to come to these decisions in our own way, \nand I am not here today to tell people who have reached different \nconclusions that they are in any way going about it in the wrong \nfashion. But I think that this issue is one that is so important, an \nissue that I think the country is so united behind, that it is time for \nus to take ourselves out of the context of the debate on abortion \nrights and look at this from the perspective of what is morally right. \nIn my judgment, Mr. President--and I know not what decisions others are \ngoing to make tomorrow--it is just not morally right to allow this kind \nof procedure to continue.\n  Each of us here has our own stories, and I respect the stories of my \ncolleagues on both sides. In our own family, we have had several \ninstances of children born very early. In my own case, we have twins \nwho were born several weeks early. We were fortunate; they did not have \nserious complications, but they were in a neonatal unit of a hospital \nfor about 3 weeks. While we were there, we saw less fortunate \nsituations around us. We saw children that were much smaller, born much \nearlier than our babies, clinging to life, children that were born \nweighing less than 2 pounds, children that were born 10 and sometimes \n12 weeks early. The fight those children all made to survive left me \nwith an indelible impression about life that I really hadn't had before \nthat experience.\n  Yes, I was pro-life, but I had never touched or felt or seen in that \nfashion exactly what is at stake. The notion that some of those babies \nwe saw fighting for life, who had been born in the very timeframe that \npartial-birth abortions are occurring, the knowledge that these tiny \ninfants were real people, the realization of that, left me with a \nmemory that I will never forget and left me committed to support the \nefforts Senator Santorum has led here today, which I hope will finally \nresult in the end of this practice.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote to override tomorrow. I hope that \nenough of my colleagues will join in that effort so we are successful. \nI recognize that this is an issue that people have different views on. \nI hope that finally, at the end of this debate, we can come together \nand move forward with something that I think is in the best interest of \nour country, and more importantly, in the best interest of our \nchildren.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I was touched by the remarks of the Senator from \nMichigan about having premature babies of his own. I stand here today \nas a mother, a grandmother, and a Senator. When my babies were born, \none was born 2 months early and one was 6 weeks early. There wasn't one \nprayer that I didn't say, there wasn't one emotion I didn't feel. And I \nfeel that same emotion toward any child born in that circumstance. My \nbabies grew up healthy and they are now in their thirties, and one has \nmade me a grandmother.\n  But that is not what this debate is about. This debate is about \nwhether we are going to protect the lives of women and whether we are \ngoing to protect the health of women. I say here today that, as long as \nI am here, I will work to do that. These are women who find themselves \nin tragic situations, traumatic situations, with a pregnancy that has \ngone terribly wrong. With a pregnancy which could endanger their \nhealth, their life, their fertility, and their ability to have a family \nin the future.\n  This bill is extreme. It is dangerous for women. Why do I say that? \nIt has no exception to protect women's health. The exception for a \nwoman's life is very narrowly drawn. It is not the true life exception \nthat we have used in other bills. So this bill is extreme, the bill is \ndangerous, and the bill turns its back on the health of women. As \nSenator Kerrey from Nebraska has said, clearly, it is unconstitutional. \nI am not just standing here because the bill is unconstitutional. Very \nclearly, the constitutional law that governs is Roe v. Wade, which says \nyou must always consider the life or the health of a mother.\n  I am standing here because I care about the health of women and their \nlives. I don't want to see this bill become the law of the land. I hope \nmy colleagues will stand for the health and the life of women and \nsupport the President's veto.\n  Roe v. Wade guarantees American women the right to choose. In the \nearly stages of a woman's pregnancy, a State may not interfere with her \nright to end the pregnancy. In the midterm of a pregnancy, a State may \nregulate abortion procedures, but only to protect the woman's health. \nThat is what Roe says. After viability of the fetus, when the fetus \ncould live outside the woman either with or without life support, a \nState can regulate and, yes, even prohibit abortions under Roe. States \ncan prohibit abortions after viability, except--except--for the life of \nthe woman or the health of the woman.\n  The life and the health of women must always be protected. That is \nthe law. If we chip away at those exceptions, we endanger women \nbecause, make no mistake, this isn't the first attempt to stop a \nprocedure and walk away from the life or health exception. There will \nbe many attempts. There will be other procedures. There will be other \nways to stop them. My colleagues on the other side are very honest \nabout it, they want to criminalize abortion. They are honest about it \nand I appreciate that. I know this is just one way they are going to \ntry to get to their ultimate goal. If we don't hold the line here on \nlife or health, we will lose this right.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are debating directly contradicts Roe. As \nI said, and as the Senator from Nebraska before me said, it is \nunconstitutional because it doesn't protect the health of the woman. It \nis silent. It doesn't use the words ``health of the woman.'' Again, it \ndoesn't contain a true life exception. It is a very narrow life \nexception. So even her life would be threatened if we allow this bill \nto become law.\n  My colleagues have quoted the fine Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nFrist, who is a doctor. They have quoted Surgeon General Koop. They are \nnot OB/GYNs. They are not obstetrician-gynecologists. The American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--those are the doctors who \nbring babies into the world. Those are the doctors who deal with these \nemergency abortions--39,000 strong. They are specialists in women's \nreproductive health. What do they say about this legislation? They \noppose it. The organization says that this bill is--and I am quoting--\n``dangerous.'' Who is it a danger to? It is dangerous to women. It is \ndangerous to the women.\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\n  The American Medical Women's Association also firmly opposes this \nlegislation.\n  This bill, if it becomes law, will force doctors to make medical \ndecisions that jeopardize women's health. Doctors will be afraid. They \nwill be fearful because, if they can't meet the very narrowly drawn \nexception for life, but they use the procedure because they are afraid \nthe woman would die, the doctor can go to jail for 2 years and be \nfined. If the woman made this decision, let's say after she learned \nthat the baby's brain is developing outside the head, and she didn't \nwant to carry the pregnancy to term--maybe because she was afraid that \nher husband might disapprove, or maybe he was an alcoholic, or maybe he \nwas a drug addict, maybe he was estranged--the husband can also sue the \ndoctor. He can sue, very interestingly, for psychological distress.\n  When we talk to our colleagues on the other side, they don't want to \ninclude any psychological reason whatsoever when a woman has to choose. \nBut, yes, if the man is suffering psychological distress, he can sue.\n  No woman, in my opinion, wants to visit her doctor about her \npregnancy--and I have done it in my own life--and see her Senator \nlurking over the doctor's shoulder. People often don't like us lurking \nover any parts of their life, let alone, let alone, when they have a \nmedical procedure.\n  I find it interesting that some Senators who come here and say there \nis too much government--``get government off our backs, there is too \nmuch government''--believe that they know more than physicians, OB/\nGYNs, who deal with real life in the real world. These Senators believe \nthat they know better than a family about what to do in such a \nsituation.\n  No woman wants to walk into her doctor's office and see a sign that \nsays, ``Warning, Senate interference in your doctor's decisions may be \nhazardous to your health.'' Or, ``Warning, your doctor's hands are \ntied, he or she may not choose the best procedure for you because your \nSenator has decided what procedure is allowed and what procedure is not \nallowed.'' Forget what you learned in medical school; forget about what \nyou think is best for women; the Senator is telling you what procedure \nto use.\n  My colleagues in the Senate say it is dangerous. Whether you have \ncancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, Parkinson's, heart disease, or any \ncondition--all the diseases we fear--Senators should not be making \ndecisions about what procedures should be used. Senators should not \nprevent a doctor from using a procedure that he or she determined was \nneeded to protect the patient's health, to protect her from \ninfertility, to protect her from paralysis, or worse. Government should \nnot be in the business of eliminating safe, medical options for \npatients.\n  We all want to know, I say to my colleagues who are loving parents, \nwhat would you do if your physician called you and said, ``I just \nexamined your daughter, and I believe her life is threatened,'' or ``I \nbelieve she might never have a child again, and I believe the only \nprocedure to use is the one that Senators here want to ban.'' I believe \nin your heart of hearts you would get down on your knees, pray to God, \nand say, ``Save my daughter's life. Help her be able to have a child \nagain.'' I believe that.\n  If you didn't, if you chose another way, that is fine for you. But \ndon't force everyone into that situation where they don't have the \noption that they need. If it is all right for you to narrow your \noptions for your daughter, for your granddaughter, I bless you for it. \nNo one is forcing you to do that. But I think it is important that \nwomen have the option to save their lives, to save their health. And, \nyet, there is not one word in this about an exception for health, and \nit is a very narrowly drawn exception for life.\n  Doctors should make medical decisions in consultation with their \npatients. Doctors should be free to make decisions that are best for \ntheir patients' health. When doctors take their Hippocratic oath, they \nsay, ``Do no harm.'' ``Do no harm.'' But if in their heart they believe \nthey are going to do harm, and it is because Senators tied their hands, \nthey find themselves in an unacceptable situation. They can't look at \nthe woman or her husband; they can't look in the eyes of the parents of \nthat woman and say, ``I am doing everything I can,'' when they know \nthey are afraid to use a procedure because they cannot understand the \nvague language that Senators put into a bill.\n  If enacted, this bill could threaten the health of women across the \ncountry--our sisters, our daughters, our mothers, our nieces, our \ncoworkers, our friends, our granddaughters.\n  I want to talk about the life exception. It is very narrow.\n  A woman's life would be protected only if her life is in danger by a \n``physical disorder, illness, or injury.'' That is a quote from the \nbill. But if her life is in danger for any other reason, the life \nexception does not apply. In other words, if the pregnancy itself \nendangers a woman's life, the exception does not apply. Even the new \nHyde language, which narrows the exception for life of a woman, \nacknowledges that the pregnancy itself may endanger a woman's life. \nBut, yet, the language in this bill includes an exception only if she \nhas a physical disorder, illness, or injury, and not any condition that \narises from the pregnancy itself.\n  So today I think we need to face the fact that this bill has crafted \na unacceptable life exception. And for those who are voting for it who \nthink that they are protecting the life of the woman, read it again. \nRead again the Henry Hyde language which we have used for many years. \nEven the narrow version is different than this. This is dangerous.\n  Let me say again: this bill, as it is currently written, is \ndangerous.\n  We have some people in the galleries today who have had procedures \nthat would be banned by this bill. They are loving mothers. They are \nloving, loving mothers. Tiffany Benjamin is from California--this is \nher picture. This is her beautiful 3-year-old baby. He is now 3. He is \na little younger here. She had this child after undergoing a procedure \nwhich her doctors recommended and which this bill would ban. And now \nshe has this beautiful child.\n  Also up in the gallery is Maureen Britell from the District of \nColumbia area, who had also had a procedure which would be banned by \nthis bill. Maureen is a devoted mother.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The Senator is reminded of rule 19, section 7, which reads: ``No \nSenator shall introduce or bring to the attention of the Senate during \nthe session any occupant of the Gallery of the Senate. No motion to \nsuspend this rule shall be in order, nor may the Presiding Officer \nentertain any request to suspend it by unanimous consent.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I was unaware of the \nrule.\n  I will say, then, that there are women who are here today in Congress \nwalking the Halls. And they are looking into the eyes of Senators. They \nare asking them, please don't do anything. Don't do anything to \njeopardize the health and the life of any woman.\n  These are women who have had procedures that would be banned by this \nbill. These are women who are loving mothers. These are women who are \nbegging us, begging us, to protect the lives and the health of women.\n  I am going to tell you some stories.\n  As I understand it, it is all right to show photographs of women. Is \nthat correct, Mr. President? Am I permitted to show photographs of \npeople from the State?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is so permitted.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  This is Coreen Costello. She is a registered Republican. She \ndescribes herself as very conservative. The reason I mention that is \nbecause what we are debating here today is not a partisan issue. Coreen \nis clear that she and her family are strongly opposed to abortion, and \nyet she wants us to stand with the President on this veto.\n  In March of 1995, when she was 7 months pregnant with her third \nchild, Coreen had premature contractions and was rushed to the \nemergency room. She discovered through an ultrasound that there was \nsomething seriously wrong with her baby. The baby, named Katherine \nGrace, had a deadly neurological disorder and had been unable to move \ninside Coreen's womb for almost 2 months. The movements Coreen had been \nfeeling were not the healthy kicking of a baby, they were actually \nnothing more than bubbles and amniotic\n\n[[Page S10490]]\n\nfluid which had puddled in Coreen's uterus.\n  The baby had not been able to move for months. The chest cavity was \nunable to rise and fall. Her lungs and chest were left severely \nunderdeveloped, almost to the point of nonexistence. Her vital organs \nwere atrophying. The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was \nnot going to survive, and they recommended terminating the pregnancy. \nCoreen said, ``This is not an option. I will not have an abortion. I \nwant to go into labor naturally.'' She wanted the baby born on God's \ntime. She did not want to interfere.\n  The Costellos spent 2 weeks going from expert to expert. They \nconsidered many options, but they all brought severe risks. They \nconsidered inducing labor. They were told it would be impossible due to \nthe baby's position. Also, the baby's head was so swollen with fluid, \nit was already larger than that of a full-term baby, so labor--let me \nrepeat, labor--was not an option.\n  They considered a cesarean section, but the doctors were adamant that \nthe risks to her health were too great. In the end, they followed their \ndoctor's recommendation and Coreen had an abortion procedure that my \ncolleagues want to outlaw today.\n  You just heard a story, a real story. Coreen and her husband faced a \ntragedy that most people never have to face. But because Coreen had \naccess to the medical procedure her doctor felt was the safest and most \nappropriate, she and her husband were able to keep their dream of \nhaving a large family, and you see them here in this picture. They now \nhave three happy, healthy children, and Coreen is due to deliver \nanother child any day now.\n  Coreen writes to us, to every Member of the Senate, I could not have \nhad this family without this procedure. ``Please, please, give other \nwomen and their families this chance,'' she says. ``Let us deal with \nour tragedies without any unnecessary interference from our Government. \nLeave us with our God,'' she writes to us, ``our families, and our \ntrusted medical experts.''\n  Now, I want to say to my colleagues this story is what happens to \nreal people. This is real. This is a woman who says she is very \nconservative and she is very against abortion. But she is asking us to \nnot do away with the procedure she had, so that other women will have \nthe opportunity she had to bear children in the future.\n  In the spring of 1994, Viki Wilson, a registered nurse, and her \nhusband Bill, a physician, were expecting their third child. Viki was \nin 36th week of her pregnancy, and the nursery was ready. Her family \nwas anticipating the arrival of their new ``little one.''\n  Her doctor ordered an ultrasound which detected something that all \nher prenatal testing had failed to detect. Approximately two-thirds of \nher daughter's brain had formed on the outside of her skull.\n  This deformity was causing Viki's daughter to have seizures. Over \ntime, these seizures became more and more severe. They threatened to \npuncture Viki's uterus. Even if Viki could carry her daughter to term, \nthe doctors feared that her uterus would rupture in the birthing \nprocess.\n  Viki could not give birth to her child without seriously jeopardizing \nher own health--or even her life.\n  After consulting with other doctors and their clergy, Viki and her \nhusband made the painful choice to have an abortion in order to protect \nViki's health.\n  In December 1996, Viki and Bill were thrilled to welcome a baby boy \nnamed Christopher into their family.\n  Viki Stella was in the third trimester of her pregnancy when her son \nwas diagnosed with nine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled \ncranium with no brain tissue at all, compacted flattened vertebrae, and \nskeletal dysplasia. Her doctors told her that the baby would never live \noutside of her womb.\n  Viki writes ``My options were extremely limited because I am diabetic \nand don't heal as well as other people. Waiting for normal labor to \noccur, inducing labor early, or having a C-section would have put my \nhealth at risk.'' She continues ``My only option . . . was a highly \nspecialized, surgical abortion procedure developed for women with \nsimilar difficult conditions.''\n  Though she was distraught over losing her son, Viki knew the \nprocedure was the right option. As promised, the surgery preserved her \nfertility. In December 1995, she gave birth to a darling son, Nicholas.\n  Viki's situation was heart wrenching. She was told her son was dying \ninside her. Her diabetes severely limited her medical options. Congress \nhas no business interfering with these difficult and personal medical \ndecisions.\n  The point is, we must not go back to the days before Roe v. Wade when \nwomen died or women were maimed. We can not go back to the days when \nwomen's health was not considered important, when women's lives were \nnot considered important. Any restrictions on women's access to \nabortion must always make an exception for the life and health of the \nwoman. If we do not, as sure as I am standing here, women will die, \nbecause we know what happened before Roe. They did die.\n  In response to arguments that proponents of this bill make that it \nbans one specific abortion procedure, I respond that we are not asking \nanyone to undergo any abortion procedure who has a moral problem with \nit. For those who think abortion is wrong, who would rather their \ndaughters have a cesarean and believe that God would take care of it, \nthat is what they should do. That is what is important about being pro-\nchoice; we give people the choice. No one has to undergo any abortion \nprocedure if they do not want to. All we are saying is, do not outlaw a \nprocedure for every woman, because there will be women like this who \nwill choose that procedure because they want to make sure that they can \nhave children again.\n  Now, I want to point something out. In the last debate we had on \nthis, Senator Feinstein and I offered an amendment. It was a substitute \nfor the bill we are debating today. And do you know what it said? It \nsaid that we oppose all late-term abortions except for life and health \nof the woman. We went to our Republican colleagues, and we said, ``Why \ndon't you join hands with us on this? Roe says you can restrict in the \nlate term. We are willing to do that. Of course, we are in favor of \nRoe. And we will walk down this middle aisle here, hold hands across \nparty lines here, and say no more abortion late term except for life \nand health.''\n  They did not want to do it. And when I asked them why, they were \nhonest. They said, ``We don't believe women will tell the truth about \nthe health exception. We believe they will say it is about health but \nin their heart it is not about that.''\n  I want to challenge that today. I know that a woman in this \ncircumstance, who has carried a child into the late term, desperately \nwants that baby. I have been there myself. When my babies were born \nprematurely, I can't even tell you the feeling that I had, that I might \nlose them, because in those years it was very difficult. But they made \nit. They hung on.\n  So I know that a woman who gets to the late term is not going to lie \nabout her health and say, ``Oh, give me this abortion; it's the \nseventh, eighth month. I have decided against this.'' That is not what \na woman will do.\n  The health exception is only for circumstances when there is \nsomething seriously wrong.\n  So I think suggesting that a woman in the late term will not tell the \ntruth about her health and why she is seeking an abortion is more than \ninsulting to women. It is dispiriting. I know my colleagues could never \nthink that of their children, their daughters, their nieces. I know \nthey could not. Then why would they leap to that conclusion of other \nwomen?\n  I strongly support passing legislation that says no late-term \nabortion whatsoever except to protect the life and the health of a \nwoman.\n  But I say to you that I will not support this legislation, with \nabsolutely no health exception, and with a life exception that is very \nnarrowly drawn. If this legislation becomes law, women like Coreen, who \nare pro-life and anti-abortion, but who want to protect their ability \nto have children in the future, may not have the chance to become \npregnant again. Women who are pro-life, who are anti-abortion, may not \nhave the chance to have a family just like Coreen Costello pictured \nhere, yet again pregnant with her fourth child. Coreen, very \nconservative, writes to us: Please, please support the President's \nveto.\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\n  So, I say to my friends, I know what a difficult debate this is. I \nknow the heartfelt emotions on both sides, and I respect the heartfelt \nemotions on both sides. I am going to close here with a letter that \neach member of the Senate received from 729 rabbis. I think this is \nappropriate since we are going into the most holy time of the Jewish \npeople. This is what the rabbis conclude:\n\n       Abortion is a deeply personal issue. Women are capable of \n     making moral decisions, often in consultation with their \n     clergy, families and physicians, on whether or not to have an \n     abortion. We believe that religious matters are best left to \n     religious communities, not politicians. . . . We urge you to \n     vote to sustain President Clinton's veto.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 10, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to vote to sustain \n     President Clinton's veto of H.R. 1122, the so-called \n     ``Partial-Birth Abortion'' Act of 1997.\n       As rabbis, we are often called upon to counsel families \n     facing difficult decisions concerning reproductive health \n     choices, including abortion. Like other members of the \n     clergy, we turn to religious law and teachings for guidance \n     in providing such counsel. Judaism has laws governing the \n     issue of abortion, but each case is considered individually.\n       As in other religions, in Judaism, there are different \n     interpretations of these laws and teachings, and we respect \n     and welcome debate on these issues. However, this debate \n     should remain among those who practice our faith, not on the \n     floor of Congress.\n       The debate surrounding reproductive choice speaks to one of \n     the basic foundations upon which our country was \n     established--the freedom of religion. It speaks to the right \n     of individuals to be respected as moral decision makers, \n     making choices based on their religious beliefs and \n     traditions as well their consciences.\n       In addition, we are concerned about the language of the \n     bill itself. Given the fact that the ``Partial Birth \n     Abortion'' Act uses vague and non-medical language to \n     describe the prohibited procedures, it would be very \n     difficult for anyone, whether clergy or physician, to be \n     certain about which medical procedures would be banned. Given \n     the bill's nebulous language and the importance of the issue, \n     we find it difficult to engage in a theological debate on \n     this matter.\n       Abortion is a deeply personal issue. Women are capable of \n     making moral decisions, often in consultation with their \n     clergy, families and physicians, on whether or not to have an \n     abortion. We believe that religious matters are best left to \n     religious communities, not politicians.\n       Once again, we urge you to vote to sustain President \n     Clinton's veto.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Signed by 729 rabbis.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this letter is signed by rabbis from \nArkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Florida, \nGeorgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington State, West Virginia \nand Wisconsin.\n  I thank my colleagues who have participated in this debate. I see \nSenator Robb is here. I know this is a tough one. I know this is hard. \nI just appreciate his being here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion about some of the things that she stated in her testimony?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will come back onto the floor shortly. At the moment I \nhave a meeting, and people waiting for me.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of overriding \nPresident Clinton's veto of the partial birth abortion ban. I would \nlike to begin by thanking the manager of the bill, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, for his continuing and outstanding work on this important \nissue.\n  No issue cuts to the core of our values like the issue of abortion. \nIt challenges us to define our notion of liberty and calls into \nquestion our most fundamental assumptions about life. Today, we do not \ndebate whether enactment of a measure will positively or negatively \naffect the welfare of some Americans. Today, we debate life and death.\n  Last Congress and again last year, we voted to end the barbaric \nmethod of infanticide known as partial birth abortion. Both times, the \nPresident vetoed the ban. In so doing, he ignored the testimony of \nmedical experts who assured us that this procedure is never necessary \nto preserve the life or health of the mother. He also dismissed \nevidence showing that thousands of partially-born children are \nroutinely and electively killed across the country each year.\n  The President not only accepted, but helped disseminate the lies and \nfalse testimony of pro-abortion advocates. Though the lies were finally \nexposed, the President demonstrated that his support for this procedure \ndid not depend on the truth. The distortion reached a point where even \nhis allies in the media could no longer defend the President's veto. \nRichard Cohen, an avowed liberal and pro-choice columnist with the \nWashington Post, concluded,\n\n       President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about \n     late-term abortions, now ought to look at the new data. So \n     should the Senate. . . . Late-term abortions once seemed to \n     be the choice of women who, really, had no other choice. The \n     facts are now different. If that's the case, then so should \n     be the law. (Wash. Post, 9/17/96.)\n\n  And yet, once again, the President's apologists have taken to the \nfloor to defend the indefensible.\n  This procedure is never necessary to save the life and preserve the \nhealth of the unborn child's mother. Four specialists in OB/GYN and \nfetal medicine representing the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth \nhave written:\n\n       Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \n     partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and \n     fertility. (Wall St. Journal, 9/19/96).\n\n  Indeed, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated,\n\n       I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisors on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, \n     partial birth, and then the destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \n     mother.\n\n  Nor should we accept the myth that this procedure is rarely utilized. \nAccording to interviews conducted by the Record of Bergen County, New \nJersey, physicians in New Jersey alone claim to perform at least 1,500 \npartial birth abortions each year--three times the number which the \nNational Abortion Federation has claimed occur in the entire country.\n  Mr. President, a legislative ban on partial birth abortions is \nconstitutional. Indeed, allowing this life-taking procedure to continue \nwould be inconsistent with our obligation under section 5 of the 14th \nAmendment to protect life.\n  Although opponents will point to decisions in which activist federal \njudges invalidated state-passed bans, language nearly identical to that \nwhich is in this bill has been upheld in a number of courts. The ban's \nrequirement that the abortionist deliberately and intentionally deliver \na living fetus that is then killed implicate the partial birth \nprocedure and no other. Judges who deemed the ban unconstitutionally \nvague ignored the text, and instead, saw fit to substitute their views \nin place of the views clearly expressed by the various state \nlegislatures.\n  Mr. President, I want to share a word of caution with those claiming \nthat a ban on partial birth abortions is unconstitutional. If they \ntruly believe that outlawing this procedure is impermissibly vague, the \ninevitable conclusion people will draw is that infanticide and abortion \nare indistinguishable. I do not see how this argument provides any \nsolace to the defenders of this gruesome procedure.\n  Finally, before this debate is through, I expect those defending the \nPresident's veto will say that opponents of partial birth abortion are \nreally against all abortions. Well, Mr. President, I cannot speak for \nother Senators, but on that charge, I plead guilty. I believe abortion \nis the taking of innocent human life and has no place in a culture that \nvalues human life. I believe that precious human life\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\nshould be nurtured in love and protected in law. For this reason, I \nsupport a constitutional amendment to protect human life.\n  On January 20th of this year, I chaired a hearing in the Constitution \nSubcommittee on the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We looked at how \nthe Supreme Court's decision failed to provide a framework for sound \nconstitutional interpretation or to reflect the reality of modern \nmedical practice. This latter failure is not surprising since the Court \nhad neither the capacity to evaluate the accuracy of the medical data, \nnor a way to foresee the remarkable advances that would make the then-\ncurrent data obsolete.\n  From Dr. Jean Wright of the Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory \nUniversity, we learned that the age of viability has been pushed back \nfive weeks, from 28 to 23 weeks, since Roe was decided. We learned that \nsurgical advances now allow surgeons to partially remove an unborn \nchild through an incision in the womb, fix a congenital defect, and \nslip the ``pre-viable'' infant back into the womb. However, I think the \nmost interesting thing we learned at the hearing is that unborn babies \ncan sense pain in just the 7th week of gestation.\n  Mr. President, these facts should help inform this debate. For \ninstance: If we know the unborn can feel pain at seven weeks, why is it \nsuch a struggle to convince Senators that stabbing a six month, fully-\ndeveloped and partially-delivered baby with forceps and extracting its \nbrain is wrong?\n  I realize, however, that not everyone agrees with my view on \nabortion. Indeed, I recognize that the American people remain deeply \ndivided on this issue. But where there is common ground, we need to \nmove forward and protect life.\n  One issue on which there is consensus is parental consent. Most \nAmericans agree that parents should be involved in helping their young \ndaughters to make the critically important decision of whether or not \nto have an abortion. A recent CNN/USA Today survey found that 74 \npercent of Americans support parental consent before an abortion is \nperformed on a girl under age 18.\n  Last month, I introduced the Putting Parents First Act, which would \nrequire parental consent before a minor could obtain an abortion. \nEnactment of this legislation would allow Congress to protect the \nguiding role of parents as it protects human life.\n  Today's vote--to end the cruel practice of partial birth abortion--\npresents another opportunity for Americans on both sides of the \nunderlying abortion issue to find common ground. The American people \nagree that a procedure which takes an unborn child, one able to be \nsustained outside the womb, removes it partially and then kills it is \nso cruel, so inhumane, so barbaric as to be intolerable. Indeed, after \nthe procedure was described for them, fully 84 percent of the American \npeople said Congress should outlaw it.\n  Mr. President, legislatures in more than 20 states have followed \nCongress's lead and passed laws outlawing this procedure. Two-thirds of \nthe House of Representatives already has voted to overturn the \nPresident's veto. And when this chamber voted, more than a dozen \nDemocrat Senators joined us in attempting to override the veto.\n  Mr. President, a consensus has formed. The American people and a \nsubstantial majority of their elected representatives in Congress want \nto eliminate this gruesome procedure from our nation's hospitals and \nclinics. The will of the American people should not be thwarted by the \ntwisted science and moral confusion that has engulfed this \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying that if we are not successful \ntoday in overriding the President's veto, this will not be the end of \nthe debate. We will come back next year and we will vote again. We will \ncontinue to vote on this issue of life and death until the voice of the \nAmerican people is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one of the most tragic and saddest days in \nour nation's history was the day the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade \nthat unborn babies can legally be killed by their mothers. Each of us \nwho has fought, heart and soul, to undo that damaging decision, \nunderstood so well on January 22, 1973, that we had yet to see what \ndevastation would come of such a horrendous rule.\n  Indeed, when a nation condones instead of condemns the inhumane \nprocedure known as partial birth abortion, it is clear our worst fears \nhave come true.\n  I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSantorum) for his strength and conviction in standing up in defense of \ncountless unborn babies. Rick Santorum's willingness to lead the fight \non behalf of passage of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is a \ndemonstration of courage.\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to him and Karen, for their loss of \ntheir precious baby son, Michael Gabriel.\n  Mr. President, since May 20, 1997, when the Senate voted 64-36 to \noutlaw the partial birth abortion procedure, a six-pound baby girl was \nborn in the state of Arizona. Of course, there have been countless \nother precious little lives who have graced this world with their \npresence since that time.\n  What is exceptional about this baby girl, is that she is the first \nknown survivor of the partial birth abortion procedure. Amazingly \nenough, while the abortionist was in the process of performing the \npartial birth abortion, this little one's life was spared when it was \nrealized that she was further along in her gestational development than \nthought.\n  Incidentally, it is due to this type of unawareness regarding the \ndeveloping stages of a baby growing inside a mother's womb, that has \nled to the senseless murder of millions of the most innocent human \nbeings.\n  Thankfully, this baby girl is no longer faceless. Although, her head \nhas been marred by the instruments of the abortionist, and she may \ncarry this scar as a reminder of her close encounter with death, she \nhas been given a name and a home. Not surprisingly, one of the millions \nof couples who are anxiously waiting to adopt, has taken her into their \nloving family. Proving once more, there is no such thing as an unwanted \nbaby, just unwanted by some.\n  I sincerely pray, Mr. President, that this country has not grown \ncompletely stone-cold in its response to the sanctity of human life. \nBut, that Americans would be moved to reevaluate their views on the \ntroublesome issue of abortion when they hear of the baby girl in \nArizona, who was just minutes away from having her life cruelly and \npainfully ended. More specifically, I pray one individual in particular \nwill not for a third time, turn a deaf ear to the countless cries of \nthe other unborn babies who may not be as fortunate to have their lives \nmiraculously spared. I am of course referring to the President of the \nUnited States, who has signed the death sentence of the most innocent \nand helpless human beings imaginable by twice vetoing the underlying \nlegislation.\n  President Clinton, and his cadre of extreme pro-abortion allies, have \nsought to explain the necessity of a procedure that allows a doctor to \ndeliver a baby partially, feet-first from the womb, only to have his or \nher brains brutally removed.\n  However, well-known medical doctors, obstetricians and gynecologist \nhave repeatedly rejected the assertion that a partial birth abortion is \nneeded to protect the health of a women in a late-term complicated \npregnancy. Even the American Medical Association wrote a letter \nendorsing the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  Mr. President, there is much to be said about the facts surrounding \nthe number of partial-birth abortions performed annually and the reason \nthey are performed--or at least the given, stated reason. It is hard to \noverlook the confession of Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, who admitted that he, \nhimself, had deceived the American people on national television about \nthe number and the nature of partial-birth abortions.\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons now estimates that up to 5,000 partial-birth \nabortions are conducted annually on healthy women carrying healthy \nbabies. This is a far cry from the rhetoric espoused by Washington's \npro-abortion groups who maintain that only 500 partial-birth abortion \nare performed every year, and only in extreme medical circumstances.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Senate to once and for all settle \nthis matter and pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a veto-\nproof vote and affirm the need to rid America of this\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\nsenseless, brutal form of killing. It is also important to note that \nthe American people recognize the moral significant of this \nlegislation. The majority of Americans agree that the government must \nout-law the partial birth abortion. A poll conducted by CNN/Time in \nJanuary of this year, shows that 74 percent of Americans want the \npartial birth procedure banned. In fact, more than two dozen states \nhave passed legislation similar to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  Mr. President, regardless of the outcome, when the Senate votes on \nthe question of whether to override President Clinton's veto of the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the impact will have grave \nconsequences. For those who care deeply about the most innocent and \nhelpless human life imaginable, failure to override the Clinton veto \nwill border on calamitous.\n  The President of the United States should have to explain to the \nAmerican people why he will not sign this ban over and over again. The \nspotlight will no longer shine on the much-proclaimed right to choose. \nSenators have been required to consider whether innocent, tiny baby-\npartially-born, just 3 inches from the protection of the law-deserves \nthe right to live, and to love and to be loved. The baby is the center \nof debate in this matter.\n  I remember so vividly the day in January 1973, when the Supreme Court \nhanded down the decision to legalize abortion. It was hard to find many \npeople to speak up, certainly on the floor of the Senate, on behalf of \nunborn babies.\n  But it is time, once again, for Members of the Senate to stand up and \nbe counted for or against the most helpless human beings imaginable, \nfor or against the destruction of innocent human life in such a \nrepugnant way. The Senate simply must pass the Partial Birth Abortion \nBan Act, and I pray that it will do it by a margin of at least 67 votes \nin favor of the ban.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is the eve of the second Senate vote \nto override the President's veto of the Partial Abortion Ban Act. I am \nproud to be a co-sponsor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nlisten to their consciences and vote to override the veto and enact the \nban.\n  Contray to the assertions of some, this bill is not about a woman's \nright to choose to have an abortion. It's not about Roe v. Wade. \nRegardless of one's views on abortion in general, the partial birth \nabortion procedures should be abhorrent in a civilized society. It is a \ngruesome procedure, performed late in the term, which most physicians \nbelieve is never medically necessary. Most Americans agree it should be \nbanned.\n  The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban has passed the Congress twice now with \nmy support, first in 1996 and again last year. However, the President \nhas twice vetoed this legislation against the will of the American \npeople. I hope the Senate does the right thing by overriding the veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nchargeable to the Democratic manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to urge colleagues who had the \ncourage to oppose this legislation when it was considered by the Senate \nlast year to demonstrate again that same courage by voting to sustain \nthe President's veto of the so-called partial-birth abortion bill.\n  There is no question that this is a gut-wrenching issue. I know how \npassionately most of those feel who gather at the Capitol today and \ntomorrow to support a ban on this medical procedure and want us to \noverride the President's veto. Those who have been telephoning, \nwriting, and e-mailing us in such overwhelming numbers are equally \nemotional in expressing the depth of their feeling in opposition to \nabortion generally and to this procedure in particular.\n  This will be a very tough vote. But, as a matter of sound public \npolicy, it is the right vote, and it is consistent with our \nConstitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. If this legislation \nwere to become law, the Congress would be telling physicians how to \npractice medicine, and Senators, with one exception, are not trained or \ncertified to do that. In fact, the only Member of this body who is a \nphysician made a comment during an interview on HMO reform recently \nabout who should, and, more important, who should not be practicing \nmedicine. He said that ``[Congress] should not be practicing medicine. \n. . . Doctors should be practicing medicine. That's very clear.''\n  Mr. President, it is important that everyone understand what is \nreally at issue here. This debate is not about whether or when to \nterminate a pregnancy, because this bill will prevent not a single \nabortion; it is only about how to terminate a pregnancy. If it is \notherwise lawful for a woman to terminate a pregnancy, this bill will \nonly require that she and her doctor choose another medical procedure, \neven though her doctor may believe that procedure is less protective of \nher health.\n  In some States, it is legal for a woman to terminate a pregnancy in \nthe third trimester, even when the life or health of the mother are not \nat issue. This bill does not address that situation at all.\n  It is appropriate to note, however, that some of us supported a tough \nban on third-trimester abortions when this bill was considered last \nyear, but our efforts were defeated by proponents of this bill in an \neffort to keep a very politically potent issue alive. But I ask those \nwho want to keep abortions safe, legal, and rare, as I do, and who are \ndisturbed by this procedure, as I am, to stop for a moment and think: \nWhat specific abortion procedure would you prefer? Because this \nlegislation will necessarily encourage the use of some other procedure \nthat I believe, if we focus on the specific details of the alternative \nprocedure, we would find equally disturbing.\n  In truth, this debate is really about how an abortion is performed \nand, more essentially, about who chooses. It is about whether Congress \nchooses or whether American women and their doctors choose. I believe \nAmerican women and their doctors should choose. I am troubled that at \nthe heart of this legislation is an incredible presumption, the \npresumption that this Congress is more concerned or better qualified to \njudge than expectant parents about what is best for their families.\n  In matters this personal, what is best for American families should \nbe decided by American families based on their individual beliefs and \nfaith. Most opponents of this ban have very strong convictions about \nwhen life begins. But ultimately, Mr. President, the very question of \nwhen life begins is also a matter of belief, a matter of faith, a \nmatter between individuals and their God. Some denominations believe \nlife begins at conception. Others believe life begins at birth. Still \nanother believes life begins 120 days after conception, at the time the \nsoul enters the fetus.\n  My point here is that we must be very careful when legislating \nmatters of faith, ours or someone else's. And in the absence of \nknowing, rather than believing, when life begins, we are forced to draw \nsome very difficult lines. That is what the Supreme Court did in Roe v. \nWade. The Court said that in the first trimester, the decision to \ncontinue a pregnancy is solely within the discretion of the mother; in \nthe second trimester, the Government may impose reasonable regulations \ndesigned to protect the health of the mother; and in the third \ntrimester, the rights of the unborn child are recognized, with the \nrights of the child weighed against the rights of the mother to escape \nharm or death.\n  The Court has been clear in protecting a woman's life and health, \nboth before and after viability, even striking down a method-of-choice \ncase because it failed to require that maternal health be the \nphysician's paramount consideration.\n  Proponents of this bill frequently cite the American Medical \nAssociation's support for this legislation, but not the College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists' opposition to it. In fact, the ACOG \nhas told us ``the intervention of legislative bodies into medical \ndecisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised and dangerous.''\n  Again, Mr. President, we are a Congress of legislators, not a \nCongress of physicians. There are places we should\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\nnot go and decisions we should not make. A respect for the judgment of \nphysicians, a respect for the rights and needs of families in often \nexcruciatingly difficult circumstances, and a respect for our \nConstitution ought to lead us to conclude that this bill should not \npass.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I am pro-choice, I am not pro-\nabortion. I respect those who believe that abortions should never be \nperformed, for religious or moral or personal reasons, and I believe \nthat those individuals should follow their faith and choose not to have \none. I particularly admire the convictions of those who choose life, \neven in the most difficult circumstances. But in choosing life, they \nchoose. They choose life, just as families that make different and \nsometimes agonizing choices should also be allowed to choose.\n  I believe that, as legislators, we have an obligation to protect the \nrights of all those who live in our States. We all believe in freedom. \nWe all understand that with freedom comes responsibility. Yet, at its \nheart, this legislation says to the women of America: We don't trust \nyou with the freedom to choose; we don't trust you to do what we think \nis right; so we will take away your freedom to search your hearts, to \nfollow your conscience, to rely on your faith and the judgment of your \nphysicians and to make a very personal decision that affects your lives \nand your families.\n  That is why I will vote to sustain the President's veto, and I hope \nat least those who opposed the bill last year will do so again.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will respond in one quick way to the \ncomments of the Senator from Virginia. What has been sort of taken as a \nmatter of record is that 80 to 90 percent of the partial-birth \nabortions performed in this country are on healthy women with healthy \nbabies and that these are done for truly elective reasons. The idea \nthat somehow we are holding on to this myth that we are doing this to \nsave unhealthy women or because a baby is so severely deformed that \nthey cannot live just isn't what the facts dictate. And that is from \nadmissions from folks who perform the procedures, not our side coming \nup with these numbers.\n  I hope we can stick with the facts as to what we are really talking \nabout.\n  I have no speakers on my side, so I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the facts and \nshare with listeners a letter from Kate Hlava, from Oak Park, IL. These \nare her words:\n\n       My pregnancy had been complicated from the beginning, but \n     doctors kept assuring us that everything was fine. We went in \n     for a routine ultrasound at 20 weeks, and our world came \n     crashing down. The results of that ultrasound were an \n     expecting parent's worst nightmare. The baby had a serious \n     heart condition known as tetrology of fallot with absent \n     pulmonary valve and overriding aorta.\n       We saw numerous experts across the Midwest, resulting in \n     just as many prognoses. At that time, we were given the \n     option of terminating the pregnancy. We chose not to because \n     we so desperately wanted the baby. We hoped and prayed every \n     day that the baby would make it to term. If he was born \n     prematurely, he would not have been able to have the \n     operation he needed to survive, a surgery he would have \n     needed every few years as he grew.\n       Unfortunately, he was not strong enough to make it to term. \n     He began showing signs of heart failure during the 27th week \n     of my pregnancy. His liver was huge, his heart was enlarging, \n     and I was retaining too much amniotic fluid. I had started to \n     dilate and was going to go into labor soon. There was nothing \n     the doctors in Illinois would do.\n       I couldn't leave my house. I was contemplating suicide. As \n     my baby was dying, so were pieces of myself, and no one here \n     would help me stop it. In Illinois, had my baby been born, \n     even prematurely and with no real chance of survival, the \n     doctors would have been legally obligated to try to keep \n     him alive. They would have performed fruitless and painful \n     procedures on him, making his few moments on this earth a \n     living hell. I didn't want that for my son. No parent \n     would.\n       It was then that my obstetrician suggested that we go to \n     Kansas for a therapeutic abortion because of fetal anomaly. I \n     have lived my entire life believing that abortion may be \n     right for other people but that I never wanted to make the \n     decision. I absolutely do not believe that a woman should be \n     able to choose to terminate her pregnancy at 27 weeks because \n     she is tried of being pregnant or because she was told the \n     baby had brown eyes instead of blue.\n       I have met other women who have undergone a similar \n     procedure. Not one did so because she didn't want the baby. \n     These women, like myself, wanted their babies and still miss \n     them, but the prospect of bringing an extremely sick baby \n     into the world, who would suffer a short life full of painful \n     medical procedures, felt inhumane. Medical science is \n     sophisticated enough to diagnose such anomalies at the fifth \n     month of pregnancy.\n       I am not sure where Bryne [The Editorial writer to whom Ms. \n     Hlava is Responding] got his description of the procedure, \n     but it is not the procedure I had. He described it as ``all \n     but the head of a living fetus is pulled from the mother, its \n     brains sucked out, causing death and making it easier to \n     remove the baby.'' This description is enraging. In my case, \n     the baby was given an injection to stop his heart and then, \n     through the insertion of laminaria, labor was induced.\n       I saw my son after delivery. He was beautiful, and his body \n     and head were intact. The process was very humane and the \n     baby was saved from any undue suffering.\n       I wish that I did not have to go to Kansas in January. I \n     would give anything if my baby could have been born healthy. \n     I think about him every day and miss him terribly. The one \n     thing I am thankful for is that my son was able to die \n     peaceful and painlessly.\n                                             Kate Hlava, Oak Park.\n\n  That is a letter, from a real woman who had this procedure performed \non her this year, that just appeared in our local papers in Illinois.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton was right to veto this legislation. \nHe was right because Congress, as a body, is not licensed to practice \nmedicine. If the imposition of our judgment serves to condemn women to \ndeath or premature disability or cause the kind of harm that Kate Hlava \ntalked about, then we will have clearly failed to live up to our \nresponsibility to act in the best interests of the people who sent us \nhere.\n  This debate is about whether or not women are going to have the \nability to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health, \nwhether they will retain their constitutional rights, and whether they \nwill be able to make decisions regarding their own pregnancies. In the \nfinal analysis, it is ultimately about whether or not women are going \nto retain their current status as full citizens of these United States.\n  If the issue were creating sound public policy, then the Senate could \nvote to enact a bill that I cosponsored with Senators Feinstein and \nBoxer which sought to ban late-term abortions except in situations in \nwhich the life or health of the mother is at risk--a requirement that \nhas been set by the Supreme Court. The legislation we are debating \ntoday, however, contains no exception to protect the health of the \nmother, and an inadequate one with regard to protecting her life. I \nbelieve that even the sponsors of this legislation are fully aware that \nunder the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade this bill, as \npresently written, is unconstitutional.\n  I believe the sponsors of the legislation would like to pretend that \nRoe v. Wade does not exist as the law of the country. That is the only \nway they can argue that this bill is a constitutional measure.\n  But let's look at the facts. In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates recognized a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion \nprior to fetal viability. Roe also established this right is limited \nafter viability at which point States may ban abortions as long as an \nexemption is provided for cases in which her life or health is at risk. \nThese holdings were reaffirmed by the Court in its 1992 decision in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  That is the constitutional standard that this legislation has to \nmeet--and it clearly does not. The ban in this bill would apply \nthroughout pregnancy. It ignores the Court's distinction between pre- \nand postviability. Moreover, this legislation fails to provide an \nexception in cases in which the banned procedure is necessary to \npreserve a woman's health. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that \nsuch a thing, such a measure is unconstitutional.\n  You do not have to be a constitutional scholar to figure that out, \nalthough, as professor Laurence Tribe has stated for the record, this \nlegislation is plagued by ``fatal constitutional\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\ninfirmities.'' That is also why, Mr. President, courts in 17 out of 18 \ncases--Federal and State courts; including a court in my home State of \nIllinois--have ruled that laws similar to this legislation are \nunconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, allow me a moment to look at some of the specifics of \nthe bill. First, I would like to examine the ban's exception to save \nthe life of the mother. Under this legislation, the banned procedure \nmay be performed if a mother's life is endangered by a physical \ndisorder, illness, or injury.\n  Something is missing here. What if the mother's life itself is \nendangered by the pregnancy? The legislation is silent with regard to \nwhether an exception exists under those circumstances. If this bill \nwere to become law, the result of a problematic pregnancy could very \nwell be that protecting the life of the fetus--even one capable of \nliving outside the womb on its own for only a few moments--protecting \nthe life of that fetus could result in the death of its mother.\n  This element of the bill would be particularly devastating to those \nwomen who are poor and/or who live in rural areas and therefore might \nnot have access to the top-quality tertiary kind of health care that \ncan make a difference in a life-or-death situation. There is a \ndifference between women who have access to that kind of quality health \ncare and those many women who do not.\n  The simple fact is if the President's veto is overridden, women's \nlives will not be fully protected in our country. Women fought for \ngenerations for the full protections and guarantees contained in our \nConstitution. It has only been 78 years that we have been granted the \nright to even vote. With this legislation, we would turn back the \nclock--for it does nothing less than abridge women's hard-earned status \nas full citizens of this country.\n  Most of the people--and I hate to say this, Mr. President, but it is \nfact and it must be said--most of the people making the decision to \nvote on this issue cannot themselves ever experience the trauma of \npregnancy or, for that matter, abortion. It is being made by people who \nthemselves are not at risk with regard to this decision.\n  Moving beyond the issues surrounding the legislation's unsatisfactory \nlifesaving exception, I would like to address the bill's total lack of \nan exception for the health of the mother. In Roe, the Court held that \neven after a fetus was viable, States could not place the interests and \nwelfare of that fetus above those of the mother in preserving not just \nher life, but her health as well.\n  Under this bill, women's health would be a complete nonissue. Certain \nprocedures developed in the years since Roe v. Wade to protect pregnant \nwomen's health would be unavailable to our physicians, our doctors. So \nthis legislation would simply turn us back to the status of the law as \nit existed before Roe v. Wade, a time when more than twice as many \nwomen died in childbirth as do today.\n  I want to give you some numbers here, Mr. President. I think it is \nimportant to put this in historical perspective as well. At the turn of \nthe century, the death rate in childbirth for women--childbirth was \nmuch more dangerous than it is today --but the rate of mothers dying \nwas 600 women per 100,000 live births. By 1970, medical advances had \nbrought that rate down to 21.5 women for every 100,000 live births. \nThat is the point at which Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme \nCourt. Today, that number is less than 10 per 100,000 live births.\n  We expect that women are going to survive a pregnancy, complicated or \nnot. That was not the expectation 100 years ago. It was not even the \nexpectation 20 years ago. The fact of the matter is, that in addition \nto the medical advances, the ability of physicians to make these kinds \nof judgments, and women being able to choose, in consultation with \ntheir doctors, has served to protect the health as well as the lives of \nwomen.\n  Again, under this bill, women's health will be a complete nonissue. \nProcedures that have been developed since Roe v. Wade would be made \nunavailable. Thus, we would be turning back the clock. The Supreme \nCourt said in abortion rulings that a woman has a constitutionally \nprotected right to protect her own health at every stage of her \npregnancy. Therefore, I submit that the bill's lack of an exception to \npreserve the health of the mother, like its incomplete lifesaving \nprovision, would strip women of fundamental rights that are guaranteed \nto them under the Constitution.\n  Now, while the term partial-birth abortion is not a medical term--and \nI think that has been debated and everybody knows that--a procedure \nthat certainly would be banned under this bill is a procedure known as \nintact dilation and extraction, or intact D The American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents over 90 percent of \nthis Nation's OB/GYNs, opposes this bill. They said:\n\n       The potential exists that legislation prohibiting specific \n     medical procedures, such as intact D, may outlaw techniques \n     that are critical to the lives and health of American women.\n\n  They are absolutely correct. If this legislation were to become law, \nwomen's health would be jeopardized because doctors would be forced to \nuse abortion procedures that may not be the best or the most \nappropriate for a particular woman.\n  As was eloquently stated by the speaker before me, Congress presumes \nto substitute its judgment for the judgment of physicians or doctors in \nregard to medical practice with this legislation. There can be no \ndenying the fact that if the President's veto is overridden, we will be \nsending a message that women should be allowed to suffer irreparable \nharm due to pregnancy even though their doctors have the ability to \nhave prevented that harm.\n  In opposing this legislation, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists also stated:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous.\n\n  That is precisely right. Politicians should have nothing to do with \nthis issue. We have no place in the examining room, operating room, or \nthe delivery room. The question of how to deal with the pregnancy \nshould rest squarely with the pregnant woman, her doctor, her family, \nher God, and not with Members of the U.S. Congress.\n  Some have argued that we have a responsibility to get involved and \nban the procedure because it is not safe. In my view, it is physicians, \nnot Senators, who should be the ones to make that decision. It is their \njob to do so, not ours.\n  Some have argued that the procedure to be banned is unnecessary, and \nyet the legislation contains an exception to save the life of the \nmother. That exception is there because of the undeniable fact that in \nsome circumstances the procedure addressed by this legislation is \nnecessary--sometimes to protect a woman's health, sometimes to protect \nher life. But we don't have to look at the bill to know that. \nPhysicians have repeatedly stated this is the case.\n  What all of this tells me is that this is essentially a medical \nmatter. Doctors must have the freedom to be able to decide which \nprocedures to use in cases of a troubled pregnancy. To the extent that \nthis Congress limits their freedom of action, their freedom of \ndecision, we put the lives and health of women at risk. Consider what \nthe effect of risking women's health in this way could mean for family \nlife in the United States. The inability to address one's own \nreproductive health as a woman and her doctor believe is necessary, \nincreases the possibility that a woman's reproductive system could be \nirreversibly damaged and she would be unable to bear children for the \nrest of her life. Other effects of such a pregnancy on her health may \nleave a woman unable to care for the children she is already raising.\n  All of this should make clear that this legislation poses a mortal \nthreat to the ability of women to make choices about their own bodies \nand their own futures that all Americans ought to be able to make as \nessential and fundamental freedoms. Choosing to terminate a pregnancy \nis the most personal, private, and fundamental decision that a woman \ncan make about her own health and her own life. Essentially, choice \nequates to freedom. The right to choose goes straight to the heart of \nthe relationship of a female citizen and her doctor. Choice is a \nbarometer of equality and a measure of fairness. I believe it is \ncentral to our liberty as women.\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\n  Now, having said that, I do not personally favor abortion as a method \nof birth control. My own religious beliefs hold life dear. I would \nprefer that every potential child have a chance to be born. But whether \nor not a child will be born must be its mother's decision--not \nCongress', not ours.\n  I fully support the choice of those women who carry their pregnancy \nto term regardless of the circumstances. Some women have died having \nmade a decision that turned out to have been ill-advised under the \ncircumstances. But I also respect the choice of those women who, under \nvery difficult circumstances in which their life and health may be \nendangered by a pregnancy, choose not to go forward with it. So, while \nI would like to live in a society where abortions never happen, I also \nwant to live in a society in which they are safe and they are legal.\n  I am going to put aside for a moment the abstract arguments in favor \nof sustaining this veto, and bring us back to the real-life situations. \nI read one letter. The last time I spoke on this issue I related the \nstory of Vikki Stella who lives in Naperville, IL. Vikki has a story as \nheart-wrenching as the one I started with when I began my remarks on \nthis issue.\n  I won't go through the details of Vikki's case right now because, \nfrankly, I don't believe aggravating the emotions on this issue serves \nany good purpose at this point. We have people who have clear \ndisagreement in regard to these situations. I am sure there are stories \nthat can be told for the rest of this day. I, frankly, believe that \nwhile the stories illustrate, they should not be used to aggravate or \nto inflame passions on this issue.\n  I think it is important for us to remember that for every story of a \nwoman who made the choice and it came out all right, there is another \nstory of a woman who made the choice and it didn't come out all right. \nI think it is inappropriate for those of us in this room to force those \nwomen to die, or alternatively, to lose their reproductive health \nbecause of our intervention in their personal and private decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect the decisions of these women, to \nrespect their freedom as citizens, to respect their fundamental rights \nas citizens of this great country and give them the respect that goes \nwith the notion that ultimately people want to do the right thing, \nultimately people want to choose life, ultimately people want to do the \nright thing by their children, and that we in this Congress should \nallow those decisions to be made by women and their physicians in \nconsultation with their family and their God.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, would the Senator from Illinois yield \nfor a couple of questions?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. First, I say to the Senator from Illinois that I \nappreciate her comments.\n  With respect to the first letter that the Senator read, I have a \nquestion. Did you say that the baby's heart, when the abortion was \ndone, was injected with digoxin?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The letter did not say what procedure was used.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thought that is what you said.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will share the letter with the Senator:\n\n       . . . was given an injection.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Into the heart?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. ``In my case, the baby was given an injection to \nstop his heart and then, through the insertion of laminaria, labor was \ninduced.''\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest to the Senator from Illinois, if you read the \ndefinition of partial-birth abortion in the bill, partial-birth \nabortion is partially vaginally delivering a living fetus.\n  So if the baby in this case had an injection in the heart to stop the \nheart, the baby would have died at that point, and then the baby would \nbe removed from the uterus, the baby would be dead, and therefore would \nnot fall under the definition.\n  So in the case that you mentioned, she did not have a partial-birth \nabortion by definition. She couldn't, because the baby was dead at that \npoint.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I appreciate my colleague allowing for that \nexception in interpreting her situation in that way.\n  But I think, if anything, my colleague's argument goes exactly to the \nheart of my position in this matter, which is that we are forcing \nphysicians to consult the language of this bill in making that kind of \na judgment about what kind of procedure is appropriate for which woman \nin what circumstance.\n  If a physician has concerns, as you just said, by making an \ninjection, killing the fetus in utero, and then delivering it, falling \noutside of the exception, well, if that is the case, then I appreciate \nmy colleague making legislative history.\n  I think, if anything, it points to the fallacy of the nonphysicians \nin this Chamber making these kinds of medical judgments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I respond to that by saying I think it points out the \ncruelty, unnecessary cruelty, of doing the procedure that we are \nattempting to ban here.\n  What was done by the woman and the doctor in this case, I think, \nfirst off, the baby was not delivered, was not outside the mother, and \nthen painfully and brutally killed. The baby was killed in utero by an \ninjection. While I don't like abortion, period, I think that less \nshocks the conscience of our country than delivering a baby, as in the \ncase of partial birth, most of them being healthy with healthy mothers. \nIn this case, that is not the case. But there is a real distinction \nhere, and what I think your case points out is that there are viable, \nless-invasive, less-dangerous-to-the-mother alternatives available, \neven for cases where you have pregnancies that have gone awry, and that \nare less cruel and barbaric to the baby and less dangerous to the \nwoman.\n\n  You talked about preserving maternal health. There is nothing more \nthat I want to accomplish with this bill than preserving maternal \nhealth. But we have ample evidence, including from the AMA who \ntestified, that this procedure is not healthy for women, and there are \nother procedures, such as the one the Senator outlined, that are safer \nfor women who may elect to have an abortion--a legal abortion, which we \ndon't outlaw with this bill. We just say that there are alternatives. \nThe letter you read says, in fact, a viable and often-used alternative \nto a partial-birth abortion that would continue to be available, which \nis less risky to the mother, and that is less gruesome, barbaric, and \nhorrific to the child.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Again, I know we have irreconcilable differences \nof opinion about this, but I think it is important to remember that, as \nwe legislate, we are legislating in broad strokes, not in specifics. \nThe problem with this bill, as I have said in my debate, is that one \nsize does not necessarily fit all. Frankly, talking about when her \nbaby's heart stopped, that is not an exact definition of death, either. \nThose are my words, colloquial terms. We are not physicians. That is \nthe problem. To hamstring and say to a physician that you can make \ndecisions about this, except here, here, here and here will, by \ndefinition, cause them to, frankly, shy away from exercising their best \nmedical judgment. We are not physicians and one size does not fit all. \nThat is why I believe the President's veto of this bill was appropriate \nand correct.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, once again, we are on the floor \ndebating this very difficult issue. I commend the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his perseverance in the realities of protecting the \nrights of women to control their own bodies and our obligation to \nprotect the rights of those unborn. That is something that we will be \ndiscussing an extended period of time--probably without any degree of \nfinality.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, we must vote yes or no on this. As a \nconsequence, it is my fervent hope that enough votes will be cast to \nput an end to this tragic procedure. It is a tragic procedure in its \nvery nature--partial-birth abortion.\n  The President defended his veto by stating that a partial-birth \nabortion is\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\na procedure that is medically necessary in certain ``compelling cases'' \nto protect the mother from ``serious injury to her health.''\n  Unfortunately, the President, in my opinion, was badly misinformed. \nAccording to reputable medical testimony and evidence given before this \nCongress by partial-birth abortion practitioners, partial-birth \nabortions are, one, more widespread than its defenders admit; two, used \npredominantly for elective purposes; and three, are never medically \nnecessary to safeguard the mother's health. That is a pretty broad \nstatement, but that is what we are told.\n  The former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, whom we all admired when \nhe functioned in that position, stated he ``believed that Mr. Clinton \nwas misled by his medical advisers on what is fact and what is fiction \nin reference to late-term abortions.''\n  Dr. Koop went on to say, ``In no way can I twist my mind to see that \nthe late-term abortion as described as . . . partial birth . . . is a \nmedical necessity for the mother.''\n  In a New York Times editorial, C. Everett Koop added, ``Recent \nreports have concluded that a majority of partial-birth abortions are \nelective, involving a healthy woman and a normal fetus.''\n  Other physicians agree: In a September 1996 Wall Street Journal \neditorial, three physicians who treat pregnant women declared that \n``Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-\nbirth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health \nor her fertility.''\n  Mr. President, a partial-birth abortion is not only tragic, it is \nviolent. The procedure is one in which four-fifths of the child is \ndelivered before the process of killing the child begins. Sadly, \nthroughout this procedure, the majority of babies are alive and able to \nmove and may actually feel pain during this ordeal.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, in a House hearing on the issue, succinctly stated \nwhy Congress must act:\n\n       The baby is literally inches from being declared a legal \n     person by every State in the Union. The urgency and \n     seriousness of these matters therefore require appropriate \n     legislative action.\n\n  Mr. President, it's not easy for any here to discuss this topic, but \nunfortunately, there are stark and brutal realities of a partial-birth \nabortion.\n  I, and others who support this Act, sympathize with a woman who is in \na difficult and extreme circumstance, but no circumstance can justify \nthe killing of an infant who is four-fifths born. My good friend and \ncolleague Senator Moynihan, has said the practice of partial-birth \nabortions is ``just too close to infanticide.''\n  Mr. President, this procedure cannot be defended medically and cannot \nbe defended morally. That is why I hope that this is the one issue that \ncan unite pro-life and pro-choice individuals. I strenuously urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of overriding President Clinton's veto of \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his leadership and \nsupport. He has always come to the floor and spoken in strong support \nof this, and he has been a great and committed warrior in this cause. I \nthank him for that.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California gave her remarks and she \ntalked about women here in town who had horrible things happen to them \nduring pregnancy, and that they were faced with very difficult \ndecisions to make. I understand that those are difficult decisions. She \nsaid, in one case, that a baby was well along and was, unfortunately, \nhydrocephalic, which means water on the brain. They could not do a \nvaginal, natural delivery. For some reason, she did not want to do a C-\nsection. There were no other options available to save this mother's \nhealth. Let me just read to you what a doctor said, a board-certified \nOB/GYN:\n\n       Sometimes in the case of hydrocephalus, in order to drain \n     some of the fluid from the baby's head, a special long needle \n     is used to allow a safe vaginal cephalic head-first delivery. \n     In some cases, when the vaginal delivery is not possible, a \n     doctor performs the Cesarean Section. But in no case is it \n     necessary, or medically advisable, to partially deliver an \n     infant through the vagina and then cruelly kill the infant.\n\n  Another piece of information that the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Illinois were talking about is that women would have their \nhealth and life at risk with having an abortion, going through with the \npregnancy later in term. The facts are just the opposite. The Senator \nfrom Illinois said, ``Let's not deal with anecdotes, let's deal with \nfacts.''\n  Here is the statistical evidence: At 21 weeks or more--that is the \ntime in which partial-birth abortions are done because they begin to be \ndone at 20 weeks gestation--the risk of death from abortion is 1 in \n6,000 and exceeds the risk of maternal death from childbirth, which is \n1 in 13,000. You are twice as likely to die if you have an abortion \nthan if you deliver the baby after 21 weeks.\n\n  So this whole concept that these procedures are necessary--a \nprocedure that is much more risky than others, much more dangerous than \nother procedures to the mother--aside from the fact that they are \nbrutal procedures, this is a procedure that is much more risky to the \nmother; that just the medical evidence shows, the statistics show, that \nhaving an abortion--and there are other complications--termination of a \npregnancy at more advanced--again, this is from an article, from the \nJournal of the American Medical Association, August 26, 1998, current \nedition, which talks about two obstetricians from Northwestern \nUniversity. It says:\n\n       Termination of pregnancy at more advanced gestational ages \n     may predispose to infertility from endometrial scarring or \n     adhesion formation.\n\n  It is documented in one study that 23.1 percent of patients had \ninduced midtrimester abortions. Nearly a quarter of those. Again, that \nis all midtrimester abortions. You hear the argument in this paper and \nby hundreds of physicians that partial-birth abortion is even more \ndamaging to the cervix and to the future ability for a mother to carry \na baby to term.\n  It continues on:\n\n       . . . and from pelvic infections, which occur in 2.8% to \n     25% of patients following midtrimester terminations. Dilation \n     and evacuation procedures commonly used in induced \n     midtrimester abortion may lead to cervical incompetence, \n     which predisposes to an increased risk of subsequent \n     spontaneous abortion, especially in the midtrimester. \n     Cervical incompetence is more prevalent after midtrimester \n     termination of pregnancy than first trimester termination \n     because the cervix is dilated to a much greater degree.\n\n  And other physicians have gone on to say that because this is a \nprocedure that takes 3 days to dilate--you hear so much about this may \nbe necessary to save the life or health of the mother because of some \nemergency. This is a 3-day procedure. The cervix is dilated over a 3-\nday procedure, which makes the probability of an incompetent cervix, \nwhich means the ability to carry a baby in future pregnancies--it \ninhibits the ability to carry a baby in future pregnancies. It \nincreases the risk of infection, because now for 3 days the cervix is \nopen. And they are not in a hospital setting. They are out, either back \nat their home, or in a hotel, waiting for the procedure to be done. \nThis is an unhealthy procedure for women.\n  If we are concerned about women's health, let's look at the fact \nabout what this does to women's health. Frankly, it sounds to me, if \nyou look at the evidence, there seems to be a sort of pushing aside of \nall of the nonanecdotal evidence about women's health and putting forth \nlegal arguments about what the Supreme Court says. They are one of \nthree branches of Government, folks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \nas long as I may consume under the remaining time left on the other \nside with the understanding that if anybody comes I will be happy to \nyield the floor at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, they are focusing on legal arguments. \nThe fact of the matter is we are one of three branches of Government. \nWe can put forward things that we believe are constitutional. We can \ntest what they are. I have seen a lot of decisions at the Supreme Court \nthat have moved all over the place on this issue.\n  It seems very clear to me that we are not providing an undue burden. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\nhere. We are eliminating one procedure that is not taught in any \nmedical school, that has not been peer-reviewed, that has not been done \nin a hospital. It is done in clinics, and, in fact, was invented--\ncreated--not by an obstetrician.\n  Someone referred to earlier that Senator Frist and C. Everett Koop \nare two people who testified against this procedure. They are not \nobstetricians. That is true. But the person who invented this procedure \nis not an obstetrician, either. He was a family practitioner who did \nabortions.\n  So the fact of the matter is that C. Everett Koop was a pediatric \nsurgeon--someone who dealt with these little babies, who understands \nvery well what damage is done to these little babies, and, in fact, \nwhat is available to save their lives. He knows very well about what he \ntalks about, as does the Senator from Tennessee who has studied this \nissue thoroughly, and who has reviewed the literature thoroughly.\n  Let's walk away from the facts for a moment. Let's deal in the realm \nof what the other side seems to point to--the pictures.\n  The Senator from California suggested that there will be women here \nwho have had this procedure who will be in the Halls looking at Members \nas they come in to vote tomorrow to insist that they keep this \nprocedure legal. I only wish, I only wish, that the children who have \nfallen victim to this would have the opportunity to stand in that Hall \nand look at the Senators and plead with them to ban this procedure.\n  We may have one such person which I will talk about in a moment.\n  But I am going to talk to you first about a little boy--a little boy \nwho was the first child of Whitney Goin. Whitney was 5 months pregnant \nwith her first child. She went in for her first sonogram, and a large \nabdominal wall defect was detected. She described her condition after \nlearning that there was a problem with the pregnancy:\n\n       My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother \n     arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely \n     deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other \n     defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He \n     went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect \n     are often stillborn, live very shortly or could survive with \n     extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence \n     of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The \n     complications and associated problems that a surgical baby in \n     this condition could suffer include but are not limited to: \n     bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, \n     diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular \n     malformations, ect.\n\n  A perinatologist suggested she strongly consider having a partial-\nbirth abortion. The doctor told her it may be something she ``needs'' \nto do. He described the procedure as one where the baby would be \npartially delivered except for the head, and the pregnancy would be \nterminated.\n  The Goins made a different choice.\n  If there is one thing that those who are listening to this debate--if \nthere is one thing that I hope for that results from this debate today, \nit is that people who will be watching this debate understand one \nthing: Whether we pass this override of the President's veto or not, \nplease understand that there are other choices. There are other \noptions--and to follow your heart, to follow your love for your child, \nand pursue those options, as Whitney Goin did.\n  The Goins chose to carry the baby to term. But complications related \nto a drop in the amniotic fluid created some concerns. Doctors voiced \nto the Goins that the baby's chances for survival would be greater \noutside the womb. So on October 26, 1995, Andrew Hewitt Goin was \ndelivered by C-section. He was born with a condition in which the \nabdominal organs--stomach, liver, spleen, and small and large \nintestines--were outside the baby's body.\n  Here is the picture. In the incubator there is little Andrew Hewitt \nGoin.\n  Andrew had his first of several major operations 2 hours after he was \nborn. Andrew's first months were not easy. He suffered from \nexcruciating pain. He was on a respirator for 6 weeks. He needed tubes \nin his nose and throat. They continually suctioned his stomach and \nlungs. He needed eight blood transfusions. His mother recalled, ``The \nenormous pressure of the organs being slowly placed into his body \ncaused chronic lung disease for which he received extensive oxygen and \nsteroid treatments.'' It broke his parents' hearts to see him suffering \nso badly.\n  Remember how we heard about someone who said that it would just break \nyour heart to see your child suffer so badly. And I understand what she \nfeels. But it breaks the hearts of thousands of parents every day to \nsee their children suffer. But that is no reason, that is no reason, to \nkill your child. It is all the more reason to love that child, to draw \nthat child near to you, and to accept that child as part of your \nfamily.\n  Andrew fought hard to live. And he did. This is Andrew Hewitt Goin at \n3 years of age.\n  I would also note that Andrew will not be the only child for much \nlonger. Next March, the Goins will welcome their second child into the \nfamily. Contrary to the misinformation about partial-birth abortion \nthat has been so recklessly repeated, carrying Andrew to term did not \naffect Whitney's ability to have future children.\n  I think if you asked Andrew a few years from now whether he would \nprefer to have suffered that pain or be listening to music, or not be \nlistening to that music, or not be alive today, the answer would be \npretty clear.\n  Not all the stories turn out as happily as Andrew's. Not all of them \ndo. But what does turn out happily in so many more instances is for \nparents to have the recognition that they have the capacity to love \ntheir children even when it is so hard to do that. Whether we override \nthe President's veto is less important than that simple fact that I \nhope the people listening here will understand.\n  The next case I want to talk about is Christian Matthew McNaughton. \nFor 4 years, Christian Matthew McNaughton fought the odds. An \nultrasound revealed that he had hydrocephalus 30 weeks into pregnancy--\nagain, the condition that has been described as one that is necessary \nto kill the child and perform a partial-birth abortion, the very case \njust cited in this Chamber as the reason for keeping this procedure \nlegal.\n  After Dianne McNaughton learned of their son's dim prospects because \nof hydrocephaly, which can cause a variety of problems including, \nbecause of the water on the brain, the lack of brain development, \nDianne asked for information on hydrocephaly. The counselor called \ndoctors on staff and explained the request, and imagine Mrs. \nMcNaughton's surprise when the counselor told her the hospital felt \n``it was better if she didn't know anything.''\n  Still, Dianne and her husband, Mark, determined to educate themselves \non what to expect from now and how to care for a child who had \nhydrocephaly. They continued to persevere. Life was very stressful for \nthe McNaughtons after the diagnosis. Dianne suffered from nightmares. \nShe never considered aborting the baby, but she worried about how her \nother two children would be affected by having a disabled child in the \nhome. With the help of Dianne's brother, who happened to be a doctor, \nthe McNaughtons found a specialist in Philadelphia to deliver their \nbaby.\n  As we learned last year with the case of Donna Joy Watts, another \nchild with hydrocephaly, the Watts family had to go to three hospitals \nin Maryland before they could find a physician team and a hospital that \nwould deliver their child, because children with hydrocephaly are \nthought not to have the ability to live and are simply seen as abortion \nclients; they are seen as disposable.\n  They were advised again to end their pregnancy. They were warned that \nhydrocephaly is associated with spina bifida, Down's syndrome, and \ncerebral palsy. The baby might never achieve bowel or bladder control; \nhe might not be able to move his arms or legs; he might be born blind; \nhe might not even be able to swallow.\n  The McNaughtons were offered a partial-birth abortion. As a doctor \nexplained it, the baby would be partially delivered, a sharp surgical \ninstrument would be inserted into the base of the skull, and the brains \nwould be extracted--of course, the doctor noted, ``what there was of \nthe brain.'' The rest of the body would then be delivered. This option \nwas rejected.\n  As if the shock of being advised to undergo a gruesome partial-birth \nabortion was not enough, one doctor said the shunt surgery to relieve \nthe pressure and the fluid in the baby's brain would not be performed \nif the child's ``quality of life'' prospects did not warrant it.\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\n  I again go back to the case of Donna Joy Watts just so you don't \nthink this is one isolated case. For 3 days, Lori Watts had to plead \nwith the doctors at the hospital to do a shunt operation to relieve the \nfluid pressure on the brain, and the doctors refused to because the \ndoctors didn't think she had any chance of a quality life. Donna Joy \nWatts is here in Washington today. She is 5, almost 6, years of age.\n  Christian was born June 20, 1993. He was a beautiful, 8-pound baby \nboy. He did require a lot of medical care. A CAT scan revealed that he \nsuffered a stroke in utero which caused excess fluid to build up in his \nbrain. It also showed that the lower left quadrant of his brain was \nmissing. Within a week of delivery, Christian had his first shunt \nsurgery to drain the fluid. He had a follow-up procedure in 3 months.\n  As he grew, Christian exceeded everyone's expectations. A baby that \ndoctors initially believed would be blind or could do virtually nothing \nwas a little boy who walked, ran, talked, and sang. He played baseball \nand basketball. He attended preschool. His heroes were Cal Ripken, Jr, \nBatman, Spiderman, and the Backstreet Boys. He loved whales and \ndolphins. His favorite movie was ``Angels in the Outfield.'' And he \nespecially loved his baby sister who was 2 years younger than he. \nChristian McNaughton brought joy to all who were fortunate enough to \nknow him.\n  In August of 1997, Christian began experiencing severe head pains. \nHis shunt was malfunctioning. It had to be replaced. He went into \nsurgery and experienced cardiac and respiratory distress in surgery, \nand he slipped into a coma. Christian fought hard to live but he never \nrecovered. He died on August 8, 1997, at the age of 4.\n  But if you talked to his parents and you talked to those who knew him \nand you asked them whether they would have traded those 4 years for \ndenying Christian's humanity by aborting him in such a brutal and \ninhumane way, they would have said no.\n  On the anniversary of his death, they entered these memorials to \nChristian in the Harrisburg Patriot News:\n\n       Christian, we love you. We miss you. We wish we could kiss \n     you just one more time. Until we meet again. Your loving \n     sisters, Meghan and Kelly.\n\n  The McNaughtons were worried about whether their children would \naccept a disabled child in the home. I think it is pretty clear that \nthey accepted him very well, and he added to their lives, and he \naffirmed their lives.\n  A letter from the brother:\n\n       Dear Christian. I have a poem for you.\n       Blue jays are blue and I love you.\n       Robins are red and I miss you in bed.\n       Sparrows are black and I wish you were back.\n       I am sorry for the bad things I did to you. You are the \n     best and only brother I ever had. Please watch over us and \n     take care of us.\n\n  We wonder whether those children accepted this child. This is a sad \nstory, but it is a joyous story. It is a story of acceptance and love.\n  One of the things that often confounds me about how people deal with \nthis issue is that people who are in the tradition of the Democratic \nParty, who have sought for the past 100 years to be inclusive in our \nsociety, to welcome those who are on the outside of society, to fight \nfor civil rights, to fight for rights for the disabled, are always \nfighting to include those who are most vulnerable, now turn their backs \nto the most vulnerable of all. How does that speak to a country where \nHubert Humphrey once said: ``We are judged by how we treat the least of \nus.'' Can you think of anything less in our human family than a little \nbaby outside of the mother's womb, 3 inches from life, asking only to \nbe given a chance; prone, with its back to the abortionist, helpless \nfrom what might happen next? Just like baby Phoenix, helpless. But, \nthank God, a moment, finally a moment of conscience hit him and he \ndecided, no, I can't thrust those scissors into this child. And now \nthis temporarily unwanted baby is so loved and wanted somewhere in \nTexas, by parents who cherish that little girl every day.\n\n  The question is, in this debate--you can talk about legal axioms, you \ncan talk about medical theories, you can talk about ethics, you can \ntalk about all sorts of things. The question here is how inclusive are \nwe going to be in our family? As I see the empty seats on this side of \nthe aisle, and I look for the men and women who have given great talks \non the floor of the U.S. Senate about the need for rights for the \ndowntrodden: Find me a more helpless creature in our human family, a \nmore downtrodden, helpless, beautiful creation of God than a little \nbaby, his back to the doctor who is going to kill him or her, waiting \nfor the pain to stop.\n  Mr. President, do we have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \non debate has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nKansas be recognized for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his work and his effort in this area. I want to talk in the brief \nperiod of time that I have about the soul of a nation, the soul of our \nNation and what happens to it when, once pierced with consciousness \nthat this procedure goes on, allows it to continue to go on.\n  Government-sanctioned brutality presently exists in America in the \nform of partial-birth abortion. We know that now. The cold mechanics of \npartial-birth abortion involve the near delivery of a late-term infant \nto facilitate the extraction of the child's brains. This procedure will \nbe performed several times this month throughout our Nation, and we \nknow that, and we know that we sanction that as a State-sanctioned form \nof death.\n  I speak today of deep concern for the soul of our Nation which is \npermitting these defiling acts to continue with our consent. Why do \notherwise decent nations permit their young to be ripped apart? Why do \nthey permit the shameless repeated acts of cruelty against their \nweakest and most vulnerable? People of conscience must intervene now.\n  I draw attention of the people here in this body to the words that \nadorn the doorways as we walk in. As you preside, you stare up at the \nwords, ``In God we trust.'' As you look across the walkway, ``He, God, \nhas smiled on our undertakings.'' Above this doorway we have ``A new \norder for the ages.'' All thoughts of our founders; all thoughts, I \nthink, they had towards the newborn child, towards any nature of life \nin this Nation, that, ``In God we trust.''\n  With a nation of such a conscience and such a soul, would it tolerate \nsuch a procedure once it knows that this procedure exists? I think not. \nI urge my colleagues, as we look at this, as we consider the soul of \nour Nation, would we, should we, can we continue to tolerate this \noutrageous form of death? History teaches us that tolerated acts of \ncruelty both brand a nation for infamy and sear its conscience. \nTolerance is complicity, and nations will eventually be judged for \ntheir failure to stop the course of unbridled cruelty.\n  America is distinguished around the world basically because of one \nphrase: America is distinguished for her goodness. I don't think we can \nexcuse this act. No adequate excuse exists for the death of an innocent \nchild by this horrific surgical procedure. This is a human rights abuse \nof the basest form, which, if condoned, will singe the soul of our \nNation now that we know it exists.\n  We must force ourselves to look squarely into the face of this \nbrutality, regardless of the many sophisticated arguments. I close with \na quote from Edward R. Murrow on this point. He would say: ``There are \nnot two sides to every story.'' There are not two sides to this story. \nPartial-birth abortion must be banned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the resolution.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 279) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate supporting the right of the United States citizens in \n     Puerto Rico to express their desires regarding their future \n     political status.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nin support of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution that recognizes the \nrights of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to decide their political \nfuture.\n  I publicly commend the distinguished Senator from New Jersey and the \nSenator from Florida for their outstanding leadership in bringing us to \nthis point. Resolutions of this kind and legislation dealing with this \nparticular issue have had a roller-coaster ride in this Congress. Were \nit not for the tremendous persistence of the Senator from New Jersey \nand the Senator from Florida, we would not be here tonight. So I \npublicly express, on behalf of all of our colleagues, our thanks to \nthem for their leadership, their persistence, and their diligence in \nbringing us to a point where we hope on a unanimous basis this \nresolution will at long last be adopted tonight.\n  Very simply, the resolution states that the people of Puerto Rico \nshould be given an opportunity to express their views on the political \nstatus of Puerto Rico through some form of plebiscite. President \nKennedy once said, ``The most precious and powerful right in the world \nis the right to vote in an American election.''\n  The great Mexican patriot, Benito Juarez, once said that ``democracy \nis the destiny of humanity.'' In the case of Puerto Rico, democracy \ndelayed is democracy denied. The destiny of Puerto Rico's political \nfuture should be in the hands of the people of Puerto Rico. Congress \nshould pass legislation that provides the congressional framework to \nrecognize and implement their decision.\n  Our Nation is built on democratic principles of equality, opportunity \nand the right of self-determination.\n  Yet, American citizens on the island of Puerto Rico lack the rights \nto express the basic tenet of democracy, a government chosen by the \npeople.\n  In the words of Thomas Jefferson, ``That government is the strongest \nof which every man feels a part.'' In regard to Puerto Rico, formal \nrecognition of these democratic ideals is long-overdue. Since the end \nof the Spanish-American War 100 years ago, we have shared a social, \neconomic, and political union with Puerto Rico. In 1917, Congress \ngranted citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In 1952, the people of Puerto \nRico took on local self-government.\n  In 1963, President Kennedy called for self-determination for the \npeople of Puerto Rico.\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\n  More than a quarter of a century later, we are still debating the \nissue in the Senate as 4 million Americans are denied basic democratic \nrights. I hope we will all agree that this is simply unacceptable.\n  The people of Puerto Rico have long demonstrated their patriotism to \nthe United States. Tens of thousands have served in the American \nmilitary. More than 1,200 Puerto Ricans have died in combat to preserve \nour democratic way of life.\n  Mr. President, I support the right of self-determination for U.S. \ncitizens living in Puerto Rico. That is why I am a cosponsor of S. 472, \nthe ``United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act,'' which provides \na congressionally recognized framework for U.S. citizens living in \nPuerto Rico to freely decide statehood, independence, or the \ncontinuance of the commonwealth under U.S. jurisdiction.\n  As a first step, Congress should adopt this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution this year in an effort to resolve the question of Puerto \nRico's political status in a fair manner.\n  We must ensure we provide full democratic rights for all American \ncitizens, including those who live in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution with mixed feelings. I would have much preferred to \nbe speaking tonight in behalf of legislation that would have provided \nfor the first time in the 100-year relationship between the United \nStates and Puerto Rico for a congressionally sanctioned plebiscite \ngiving to the people of Puerto Rico the sense of confidence from \nrespect that their voice would be heard as to their desires for their \npolitical future.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives passed such a \nplebiscite bill. Unfortunately, after months of hearings, we will not \nhave the opportunity to present from the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee to the full Senate such legislation. I commend Senator \nMurkowski who made a valiant effort to do so, including developing \nlegislation which I think could have been the basis of a consensus on \nthis matter and would have resulted in a favorable vote in the full \nSenate and the nucleus of a compromise with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  But the world goes on. The Governor of Puerto Rico has, with the \nconcurrence of the Puerto Rican Congress, called for a referendum on \nthe political future of Puerto Rico to be held on December 13. It is \nimportant that, as a minimal statement of our commitment to the \nprinciple of self-determination, we adopt this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution and express our position in favor of that plebiscite and \nindicate that we will take its results with appropriate seriousness.\n  We recognize, and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution proclaims, that \nthe ultimate decision as to the political future of Puerto Rico will be \nmade by this Congress, but by giving the degree of recognition to the \nPuerto Rican-called plebiscite on December 13 that this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution will do; it will give additional standing, additional \nconfidence, to the people of Puerto Rico that their vote on that day \nwill have an important impact here as we decide what next steps to take \nrelative to the political future of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that we cannot continue with the status \nquo. A decision is going to have to be made, and I believe made soon, \nas to what the permanent political status of Puerto Rico will be. We \nhave had this expedience throughout America's history.\n  After the first 13 colonies, there was the Northwest Ordinance which \nlaid out the basic principle by which future States would be carved out \nof the large territories of America and joined to the Original States. \nAnd that principle included the fact that those new States would join \nwith equal dignity, with equal political rights and responsibilities to \nthe Thirteen Original States. These have been basic tenets of our \ndemocracy which now we are called upon to make available to the people \nof Puerto Rico.\n  My colleague, Senator Torricelli, in comments last week made the \nstatement which I think summarizes the essence of the debate that we \nare having this evening, and that is, that Puerto Rico represents the \nunfinished business of American democracy. And it cannot be ignored--\nunfinished business. We need to set about our task of completing that. \nAnd that task begins by a respectful listening to the desires of the \nalmost 4 million U.S. citizens who live on the island of Puerto Rico.\n  I remind my colleagues that we are not talking about 4 million people \nwho are citizens of a foreign land. Every one of those 4 million people \nin Puerto Rico is a citizen of the United States of America. These are \nfellow citizens who have never been afforded the opportunity for a \nclear congressionally sanctioned expression of their opinion as to what \ntheir political future should be. The nearly 4 million U.S. citizens \nwho reside in Puerto Rico are entitled to that opportunity. And this \ncombination of a Puerto Rican congressionally called plebiscite with \nthis degree of sanction by the U.S. Congress is as close as we can \nreach to that objective in 1998.\n  The sense of the Senate is the very least that we can do to honor the \nrequest of our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and send them a \nclear message that we are listening to their desires.\n  The sense of the Senate, in conjunction with the House-passed bill, \ntakes an important step in the right direction. I thank all of my \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. I thank all of those \nwho have been so active in the effort to secure a congressionally \nsanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico.\n  I say to our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, we admire your \ncontribution for a century to the development of our land. We admire \nyour patriotism in time of war and your great contributions in time of \npeace. We extend to you this statement of our respect.\n  We urge your full participation in the plebiscite on December 13. We \nwill be anxious to receive your statement of your desires for your \npolitical destiny. And then I hope that my colleagues here in this \nChamber and our companion Chamber will hear with dignity what you have \nsaid and will move towards, with your direction, providing a permanent \npolitical status for the U.S. citizens on the island of Puerto Rico.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from \nNew Jersey for authoring and bringing forth Senate Resolution 279. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of it, along with the chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski; for he and I have, \ncan I say, labored mightily, along with the Senator from Florida, over \nthe last good many months, first of all, to work on the issue of self-\ndetermination for Puerto Rico.\n  I certainly thank all of my colleagues for the cosponsorship of S. \n472, legislation that I introduced a year ago that I hoped, as does the \nSenator from Florida, that we could be voting on at this time--debating \nit, voting on it, and giving our Puerto Rican friends and fellow \ncitizens the opportunity, a clear direction as it relates to self-\ndetermination. That is not going to be the case. Time has not allowed \nthat.\n  So I hope that by next year the record before the Senate might \ninclude the results of another plebiscite in Puerto Rico that the \nSenator from Florida has just mentioned. That is why the resolution \nbefore us today, I think, is very important.\n  In accordance with their rights of self-determination, the citizens \nof this Nation--the people of Puerto Rico--acting through their \nconstitutional process and elected representatives, have empowered \nthemselves to conduct a vote based on the record created in the House \nand the Senate deliberations in the Congress since the 1993 vote.\n  Since any act of self-determination in Puerto Rico is not self-\nexecuting, the resolution of Puerto Rico's political status is a \nFederal matter that can only be fully and finally determined by an act \nof Congress. However, in the exercising of its powers in this regard, \nCongress must be informed by the freely expressed wishes of the \ncitizens of Puerto Rico. Thus, this resolution recognizes that the \ncoming vote will advance the process of self-determination\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\nwithin the framework of our great Nation's Constitution.\n  Contrary to rumors in Puerto Rico, there was no great intrigue or \npolitical reaction to videotapes from the local status campaigns that \nprevented the Senate from moving forward with legislation at this time. \nRather, faced with what we all understand is a very complicated \nschedule here in the final days before we adjourn, and concern on the \npart of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have brought Senate \nResolution 279 to the floor to express at this time, as the House has \nexpressed, an opportunity for the Puerto Ricans to advance the cause of \ntheir self-determination. And I hope that the resolution and our vote \non it tonight reflects that.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate ends its prolonged silence on the \nquestion of Puerto Rico's political status. The 105th Congress will not \nend without a Senate response to the 1994 and 1997 petitions of the \nLegislature of Puerto Rico to Congress. By our action today, the Senate \njoins the House in responding to those petitions by recognizing the \nneed for further self-determination in Puerto Rico. This is because the \n1993 status vote in Puerto Rico did not resolve the status question. \nIndeed, no option won a majority in 1993.\n  That is why I sponsored a bill to recognize the need for further \nself-determination. I thank my colleagues from both parties who joined \nme by cosponsoring S. 472.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, for his assistance and leadership to \nestablish a record to support action by the committee and the full \nSenate on this matter. I regret that the draft chairman's mark has not \nbeen acted on, but I applaud his commitment to move the self \ndetermination issue forward.\n  It now appears that by next year the record before the Senate may \ninclude the results of another plebiscite in Puerto Rico. That is why \nthe resolution before us today is so very important. In accordance with \ntheir right of self-determination, the people of Puerto Rico, acting \nthrough their constitutional process and elected representatives, have \nempowered themselves to conduct a vote based on the record created in \nthe House and Senate deliberations in Congress since the 1993 vote.\n  Since any act of self-determination in Puerto Rico is not self-\nexecuting, resolution of Puerto Rico's political status is a federal \nmatter that can only be fully and finally determined by an act of \nCongress. However, in exercising its powers in this regard Congress \nmust be informed by the freely expressed wishes of the residents of \nPuerto Rico. Thus, this resolution recognizes that the coming vote will \nadvance the process of self-determination within the framework of our \ngreat Nation's Constitution.\n  Contrary to rumors in Puerto Rico, there was no great intrigue or \npolitical reaction to videotapes from the local status campaigns that \nprevented the Senate from moving forward with legislation at this time. \nRather, faced with the difficulty of completing a full Senate debate on \nthe draft chairman's legislative mark, this body is doing the right \nthing by moving forward with a Resolution recognizing the need for \nfurther self-determination and recognizing the constraints placed upon \nit.\n  I am proud of the Senate today, and I am proud of the people of \nPuerto Rico for seizing the moment and organizing an act of self-\ndetermination that is based upon the arguments heard in the \nCongressional process which will continue next year. This action is \ngood for Puerto Rico and serves the interests of our entire Nation as \nwe move forward together to seek to resolve the territorial status \ndilemma that began 100 years ago. I wish our fellow U.S. citizens in \nPuerto Rico well in exercising their God given right of self-\ndetermination. I hope they will join me in trusting that their voice \nwill be heard and that Congress will answer. In America, we have no \nalternative to democracy and desire nothing more.\n  I join with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey--now the chairman \nof the full committee is here on the floor--to say to our friends and \ncitizens of Puerto Rico that we ask them to go forward with their vote \nin December. We hope that that is an advanced expression of their \ndesire to advance the cause of statehood, but most importantly to \nadvance the cause of self-determination so that the Congress can have \nthe kind of direction that we hope that vote will bring.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In view of my colleagues who have waited longer than I \nhave, I simply want to identify the time on either side, and if I may, \nif there is no objection, I would like to control the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 20 minutes; the minority has \n13 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to--obviously, I will not speak for \nthe minority--but I would yield whatever time to the minority or \nperhaps Senator Torricelli would like to control the time for the \nminority.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that Delia Lasanta, Luis Rivera, \nand Danielle Quintana of my staff and Susan Nisar of Senator D'Amato's \nstaff be accorded floor privileges for the remainder of today's \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent request \nproposed by the Senator from Alaska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold for a moment, 10 \nminutes of the minority's time is already under the control of Senator \nSarbanes under a previous order.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto control the remainder of the minority time and the Senator from \nAlaska control the remainder of the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time does the Senator from New York desire?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me at the outset say how tremendously \nproud and pleased I am that one of my great and dear friends, the \nSenator from Alaska, has worked so hard and so diligently to attempt to \nadvance a cause that this Nation espouses to so many.\n  We talk about the lack of freedom throughout the world. We talk about \ndemocracy. Indeed, it is unfortunate that there are strong forces, \npeople who I know and who I respect, who even at this very time give \nlip service rather than meaningful and true support for that cause. \nSenator Murkowski understands that freedom and democracy are not \nsomething that just should be for some, but should be for all, and that \nthe right of self-determination is an inalienable God-given right. It \nis one that this country is founded on. People have paid the greatest \nprice and sacrifice with their life, jeopardizing their families, in \nthe fight for freedom and democracy.\n  I have to tell Members that it is more than imperative, it is a moral \nnecessity, that we strongly encourage the process of self-determination \nfor 4 million Americans, U.S. citizens who live in Puerto Rico, that \nthey should determine by what rules and what form of government they \nshould live.\n  We have for years talked about the lack of democracy in all areas of \nthe world. We talk about it in China, Korea, here, there. We should be \nashamed that it has taken us so long to come forth with a rather simple \nresolution, and that it has taken such an incredible effort by the \nSenator from Alaska and others, to bring us to this point. This is a \npittance in comparison to those who have bled, who have sacrificed for \ndemocracy, for self-determination.\n  I hope we understand that we want to encourage people, saying the \nright to vote, the right to determine one's own destiny, is \ninalienable.\n  I would like to have a recorded vote. I would like for us to say: We \nare going\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nto recognize your hopes and your aspirations and your dreams. It is my \nhope that the people vote for statehood. But that is their right. They \nmay determine that they want to continue the present situation, but \nthey should have that inalienable right, and we should say to them that \nwe are ready and willing to recognize your choice, your decision, as \nfree men and women, and, yes, that we would be willing and ready to \nundertake supporting that decision because we respect the inalienable \nrights of people to make their own determination.\n  As we mark the 100th anniversary of Puerto Rico becoming a part of \nthe United States, I think it is important to recognize that their sons \nand daughters have made the supreme sacrifice. They have answered the \ncall of duty. They have been there. And now it is time for us to say: \nYou can be a part of this great Nation, not just as citizens, but as a \nState, if you choose, if you determine, and then send your response to \nus.\n  There are those who say it doesn't matter. Well, it does matter, and \nit is bigger than partisan politics. It is bigger than Republicans and \nDemocrats. I believe that in the fullness of time what an incredible \nbeacon a 51st State might be. But that is for the people of Puerto Rico \nto determine. What an example to all of Central America and South \nAmerica, in terms of sharing our cultures, our values, with this island \nas part of this great Nation. Certainly at the very least, the people \nof Puerto Rico, our citizens, should have that right which we declare \nday in and day out is inalienable for people throughout the country, \nfor all corners of the world.\n  I congratulate my friends who have brought it to this point, and the \nSenate majority leader, and Senator Torricelli for his unwavering \nsupport of that commitment to justice, to democracy, to self-\ndetermination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to first express my \ncongratulations to Senator Murkowski without whose efforts in committee \nwe would not, today, be discussing this resolution; Senator Graham of \nFlorida, who has labored for so long on this cause; Senator Daschle; \nSenator Landrieu; Senator D'Amato; Senator Craig; so many Members of \nthis institution who have taken the cause and interests of the people \nof Puerto Rico and made them their own.\n  There are few more solemn responsibilities to come to the Congress of \nthe United States than the issue of admission into this great Union. It \nis solemn because to join in union is to share a future, to pledge our \nfortunes, our lives, together. It is a serious occasion because the \nprospect of joining this Union raises the prospect of ``forever,'' \nbecause this Union is indivisible, it is permanent. The judgment to \njoin this Union is made by any peoples and any lands but once in their \nhistory, and it is never revisited again.\n  For 100 years, the people of Puerto Rico and these United States have \nshared a common history. Our people have fought together, bled \ntogether, and died together. Our cultures over a period of time \nincreasingly have merged. Hundreds of thousands, indeed, millions, of \npeople of Puerto Rico have chosen to live among other Americans in \nthese United States. Indeed, the judgment that potentially might be \nmade by the people of Puerto Rico who reside on the island has \neconomically and culturally and even politically already been made by \nmillions of others in how they live and where they choose to live.\n  The history of the United States for these 200 years has been a \nhistory of constant enfranchisement, expanding the right to vote to \nAfrican-Americans, to women, people 18 years of age, in our own \ngeneration to the people of Hawaii and Alaska.\n  It is part of the great history of this country that we, unlike other \nnations, were not satisfied to simply enfranchise ourselves but \nrecognized we were the greater and the better people through our \nexpansion. Now we, potentially, visit that question again. It is a \njudgment that can only be made by the people of Puerto Rico for \nthemselves. This is ultimately their responsibility to decide. But it \nis the responsibility of this Congress that they have the right to \ndecide. It is a peculiar and tragic irony of history that the first \nrepublic to be created out of colonialism might now enter the 21st \ncentury in a neocolonialist position.\n  No American should be content with this contradiction of our own \nhistory, and some might claim--some might even accuse--that this U.S. \nGovernment is in a position with the people of Puerto Rico that is \nanything less than full, free, fair, and democratic. Yet, by the \ndefinition we have applied for ourselves, it would be difficult to \ndefend against the charge. Written on the walls of this Capitol from \nthe inaugural address of President Harrison in 1841 is, ``The only \nlegitimate right to government is an expressed grant of power from the \ngoverned.''\n  Yet, Mr. President, every day, the people of Puerto Rico are \nsubjected to fees, rules, regulations, policies, and determinations \nfrom this Congress, having no representative who has a right to vote \nand make a judgment on their behalf. The relationship between the \npeople of Puerto Rico and the United States is a contradiction with \neverything that we hold dear and every principle upon which this \ncountry was founded.\n  Mr. President, I urge the people of Puerto Rico to take this judgment \nseriously between this date and December 13 and to think carefully. If \nthey decide to join this Union, this is a moment that they will not \nvisit again. Joining this Union is permanent. If it were my judgment, \nI, like the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, would choose to \njoin the Union. I believe history has given us the right and the \nresponsibility to face the future together. But I recognize mine is no \nmore than a casual opinion. The decision rests with the people of \nPuerto Rico alone. The importance of this resolution is that as the \npeople of Puerto Rico vote, they should recognize that the U.S. \nCongress considers Puerto Rico to genuinely be the unfinished business \nof American democracy.\n  The people of Puerto Rico should recognize as they vote that the \nCongress of the United States is watching, that we recognize our \nresponsibilities and are prepared in the 106th Congress to receive \ntheir judgment and make our own decision about the future of this \nUnion.\n  Mr. President, once again, I want to congratulate Senator Murkowski \nfor having presided over these issues these months, and Senator Graham \nfor his leadership, and each of my colleagues who come to this floor on \na bipartisan basis, across ideological lines, uniting in our common \nbelief that there is no right to govern without the consent of the \ngoverned and that it is not good enough, in spite of the \nenfranchisement of all of our people across this continent, that there \nremains a single exception. America is too good a land, our history is \ntoo great, for anyone to be an exception to these great and lasting \nprinciples.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this side \nhas about 15 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Domenici from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say that it is most \nappropriate that we take this action tonight during the second week of \nHispanic Heritage Month in the United States. It is quite appropriate, \nwhile we are honoring the contribution which Hispanic culture has made \nto our country, that we are now saying to one group of Hispanics who \nlive on the island of Puerto Rico that we are willing to see you take a \nvote regarding whether or not you would choose to become the next \nState.\n  Mr. President, this resolution affirms that the first step in any \nchange of political status for the community of Puerto Rico rests with \nthe people of that island. When they express that opinion in December--\nDecember of this very year--then it will be up to Congress to take \nwhatever steps are necessary to consider that decision.\n  Let me say that there are a number of Senate heroes with reference to \nthis Puerto Rico resolution. First, I must say that the individuals \nmost likely to recall the difficulties of taking a vote and deciding \nwhether to become a State are the citizens represented by\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\nthose Senators whose States were last admitted, or close to being last \nadmitted. So the hero tonight is Frank Murkowski of the great state of \nAlaska. For anybody wondering, that is not a Hispanic name--Murkowski--\nbut it is a name of European descent, perhaps Polish. He understands \nwhat it is for a State to go through this process of deciding whether \nyou are going to become a part of the Union, the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I remind the Puerto Ricans--who are Americans in their own right--\nthat Americans think that the United States is so important that we had \na Civil War over whether you could unilaterally drop out of the Union \nonce you joined it. So I want you to take it seriously, Puerto Rico, \nbecause it is serious. We had the biggest battle within the borders of \nour own Nation about the issue of keeping this great country together, \nand you should know that and you should be concerned about that.\n  Secondly, let me suggest that in the State of New York there is a \nSenator named Senator D'Amato, and the Puerto Ricans know that is not a \nSpanish name either; it is Italian like mine, Domenici. But this \nSenator from New York understands what the Puerto Ricans in his State \nand the Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico mean to our Nation. He has always \nbeen willing to give the people in Puerto Rico an opportunity to \ndetermine their destiny. And I believe second to Senator Murkowski on \nour side of the aisle, behind the scenes, Senator D'Amato has made it \nvery clear that this night should occur--not next year or the year \nafter, but now. So I compliment my good friend and a friend of the \nPuerto Rican people in New York and across the country. I compliment \nthe Senator for his tremendous, tremendous regard for what Puerto Rico \nbelieves is right and fair.\n  I must say, from the other side of the aisle, it is most interesting \nthat tonight we have a series of Senators with these strange names--\nMurkowski on our side, D'Amato on our side, Domenici speaking, and \nTorricelli from New Jersey. I compliment Senator Torricelli for his \nvigilant and absolute persistence that something should be done on this \nissue before we leave here.\n  So tonight, without any question, the Puerto Rican people can already \nsay across the island and throughout the rest of America, because it is \na foregone conclusion, that the Senate will vote on this resolution \npropounded by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. Frankly, it \nwill pass overwhelmingly. There will be no dissenting votes tonight, \nbecause for those who would like to dissent, they have already decided \nthat they are not going to make a point of it.\n  As a consequence, we are going to approve this in just as formidable \na way as if we had voted, when the U.S. Senate says without a \ndissenting vote tonight, that we agree with this resolution.\n  Mr. President, once again, many of us came here from around the \nworld, or our parents or grandparents did. And we know the validity and \nthe great value of America. We hope the people in Puerto Rico \nunderstand that and act accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe Senator Hatch would like \nrecognition for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been to Puerto Rico. I have to say \nit is a beautiful land.\n  These are our fellow citizens. They have to make this determination. \nOf course, we should give them that right.\n  I have heard both arguments within Puerto Rico. Some feel it is a \ngreat idea to have statehood. Others don't think it is quite so great. \nThere are disadvantages to becoming a State. There is no question about \nit. But there are great advantages as well.\n  All we are doing here this evening is acknowledging as Members of the \nU.S. Senate the right of our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico to \nexpress democratically their views regarding their future political \nstatus through a referendum or other public forum, and to communicate \nthose views to the President of the United States and to the Congress.\n  That is the least we could do. These are good people. These are proud \npeople. These are people who have contributed to this country--and who \nwill contribute to this country--even though their status has been \ndifferent from other citizens.\n  I personally endorse and support this resolution here this evening. I \nhope and I know that it will pass. It will pass unanimously, which I \nthink is the high tribute to the people of Puerto Rico and to those on \nboth sides of this issue down there.\n  I congratulate all of those who have worked so hard to get this done, \nespecially Senator Murkowski, Senator Torricelli, the others who have \nbeen mentioned, Senator D'Amato and Senator Domenici.\n  This is a wonderful evening, a wonderful day, and something that is \nlong overdue. I congratulate my colleagues for having accomplished this \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, in the concluding minutes \nthat we have before our vote, let me recognize from the House of \nRepresentatives our good friend, Carlos Romero-Barcelo, who is with us \nwatching this historic action of the U.S. Senate. It is a pleasure to \nhave you with us, my friend. Your contribution to these moments have \nbeen immeasurable, and your people of Puerto Rico can be very proud of \nyour contribution in bringing this matter from the House of \nRepresentatives to the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight.\n  Mr. President, let me acknowledge my good friends and colleagues who \nhave had such a significant role in moving this to where we are today. \nOf course, that would include Senator Torricelli and Senator D'Amato.\n  I think it is important to recognize the constituency associated with \nmany of the Members who have come forth as initial sponsors. Senator \nLautenberg referred to Senator Hatch; my good friend from Hawaii, \nSenator Akaka; Senator Daschle; Senator Landrieu; Senator Lieberman; \nSenator Graham of Florida; and Senator Domenici, and there are many, \nmany more.\n  But the significance of the commitment, particularly of Senator \nD'Amato and Senator Torricelli, I think represent an extraordinary \nsensitivity as brought out in the statements not necessarily \nindividually of their feeling towards what America is all about but \nperhaps better in the comments that were made by the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, who indicated, as you look at the names of \nsponsors on this legislation, that you have a potpourri, if you will, \nof the mixture of Americans committed to democracy.\n  I must acknowledge in my thanks to my colleagues that this Senator \nfrom Alaska does not have a large Puerto Rican constituency. But I do \nhave a long memory.\n  Alaska has been a State since 1959. I grew up in a territory. We had \ntaxation without representation. My father used to say he felt good \nabout being able to write on his income tax form in a red pen ``filed \nunder protest, taxation without representation.'' But that is the \nextent of what made him feel good.\n  I can recall seeing neighbors when I was too young to go into the \ndraft being drafted. We were second-class citizens, Mr. President. We \nhad special identification cards to leave the territory of Alaska to \nvisit the State of Washington. It was quite a blow to the sensitivity \nof American citizens, and as a consequence we have a situation with \nregard to Puerto Rico today.\n  Mr. President, I would like to have the clerk reserve at least 2 \nminutes of my time remaining for one of my colleagues who is here with \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may, I want to specifically cite \nthe fact that I support this resolution. I fully support the objective \nof this resolution in reaffirming the right of our fellow citizens in \nPuerto Rico to express their desires on political status through \npopular referenda and to communicate those desires to the federal \ngovernment. I also agree that the federal government should carefully \nreview and consider any such communication.\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\nThis resolution is fully consistent with the objective of the draft \nchairman's mark that I circulated immediately prior to the recess.\n\n  I want to thank my colleagues who reviewed the draft chairman's mark \nand who provided me with comments and suggestions. As I stated in my \npress release last week, I do not think that there will be time to \nfully consider the legislation this session, but I think we have made \nconsiderable progress. This resolution is fully consistent with the \nphilosophy of my draft that the initiative for any political status \nchange lies exclusively with Puerto Rico.\n  During this Congress, the House of Representatives has passed \nlegislation requiring a referendum in Puerto Rico. Similar legislation \nwas introduced in the Senate. I stated at the outset of this Congress, \nthat I consider the matter of political status one of the most \nimportant constitutional responsibilities of the Congress and of my \ncommittee.\n  I cautioned when those measures were introduced that as much as some \nwould like to see legislation enacted in this centennial year of Puerto \nRico coming under United States sovereignty, this was an \nextraordinarily complex and important issue and deserved full and fair \nconsideration because I recall what happened in my own State of Alaska. \nIt took a long time. Although the committee conducted a series of \nmeetings in Puerto Rico at the beginning of the Congress, I made the \ndecision that we would wait for the House to pass legislation before we \nbegan the formal committee process. I made that decision so that our \ncommittee would have all the various proposals before us.\n  By the time the House passed its legislation, it was already clear \nthat it would be very difficult to resolve the many questions presented \nby the legislation this year. I want to emphasize the words ``this \nyear,'' because I think there has been too much emphasis on timing and \nnot enough on substance.\n  I am committed to the enactment of responsible legislation and not \nsimply to the enactment of legislation this year.\n  Nonetheless, and despite the limitations of the Senate schedule and \nthe importance of the other measures pending before the committee, we \nheld a series of workshops, oversight hearing, and legislative \nhearings. I circulated a draft chairman's mark prior to the August \nrecess to my colleagues on the committee. I asked for a review and \ncomments. Several Members submitted very thoughtful amendments to the \ndraft chairman's mark. While I have directed the staff to continue to \nwork on these amendments, I do not see that attempting to force the \nlegislative process would either be wise or helpful in view of the \nremaining time left in this session.\n\n  The initial workshop heard from the Governor and the leadership of \nthe three recognized political parties in Puerto Rico. The Governor \nexpressed the desire of the government of Puerto Rico to obtain an \nexpression from the federal government of status alternatives. The \nparties agreed that so long as each political party is able to craft \nits own definition, those definition, those definitions would be \npolitical statements and as a result, no referendum would provide the \nclarity that Congress would want.\n  The first oversight hearing considered the fiscal and economic \nimplications of any change in status. Those proceedings shed \nconsiderable light on some of the difficulties involved in any \ntransition to prepare Puerto Rico for either consideration of an \nAdmissions Act or for the withdrawal of United States sovereignty.\n  The second oversight hearing focused on the individual issues \ninvolved in separate sovereignty, either as full independence or in \nsome form of free association. In addition to a consideration of the \nissues, especially that of citizenship, the hearing also served to \nfocus on sovereignty as the test for consideration of those issues.\n  Those hearings and the legislative hearing that followed demonstrated \nhow unique the present circumstances of Puerto Rico is and how \ndifficult any change in status will be. The hearings also demonstrate \nthat the federal government is responsible for the present situation \nand the creation of the obstacles that must be overcome prior to any \nchange in status.\n  A major defect, in my mind, in the measures pending before the \ncommittee and in the definitions used in past referenda in Puerto Rico, \nis the failure of the definitions for Statehood or Independence to \nacknowledge that Puerto Rico is not presently prepared for federal \nconsideration of either option.\n  There is a very complex and difficult process involved before either \noption could be implemented, as our hearings demonstrated.\n  For Statehood, that process would entail, at a minimum, significant \nconsideration of several entitlement programs as well as the extension \nof the Internal Revenue laws in concert with a complete overhaul of \nPuerto Rico's local tax code. This is not a simple matter and I do not \nexpect that it can be done rapidly. Only after that transition is \ncomplete should Congress consider fully extending the Constitution to \nPuerto Rico.\n  As my colleagues know, the Constitution does not fully apply to \nPuerto Rico. Puerto Rico has never been ``incorporated'' into the \nUnited States. Alaska and Hawaii were fully incorporated well before \nthe first Admissions Act was even introduced. Only after the debate on \nincorporation has concluded and when the Constitution is fully \napplicable in Puerto Rico can the political debate on admissions begin.\n  The point that I tried to achieve in my draft chairman's mark, is \nthat Congress has created a series of obstacles to the achievement of \nany change in political status. I think we owe our fellow citizens an \nexplanation of what the process is likely to be to overcome those \nobstacles so that they can express their desires with a clear \nunderstanding of the process that lies before them.\n  A second major defect in the legislation was that it required Puerto \nRico to vote on federally defined options. How and whether Puerto Rico \nseeks to petition the Congress should not be dictated by the federal \ngovernment. If we are serious about local self-government, then we \nshould be willing to allow the local government to determine how to \nrespond to the desires of its constituents. Not all territories \nconducted referenda on future political status and none were ever \nrequired to hold one by the federal government. As part of the Enabling \nor Admissions Act, some territories were required to agree to the terms \nof a particular Statehood proposal, but that came after Congress had \nenacted the legislation to provide for their admission.\n  We should not constrain Puerto Rico in how it seeks to approach a \nrequest to the federal government. Perhaps they will continue to use \nreferenda, perhaps they will use resolutions of the legislature, \nperhaps they will use petitions. Each territory has approached the \nprocess from its own political perspective and we should not dictate to \nour fellow citizens in Puerto Rico what process they must use.\n  As a result of our workshops and hearings, I circulated a draft \nchairman's mark prior to the August recess to my colleagues on the \ncommittee. I asked for their review and comments. Several Members have \nsubmitted very thoughtful amendments to my draft chairman's mark. While \nI have directed staff to work on those amendments, I do not see that \nattempting to force the legislative process would be either wise or \nhelpful.\n  I support the objectives of this resolution and they are fully \nconsistent with the framework of my draft chairman's mark. There is no \nquestion that Puerto Rico, either through popular referenda or \nresolution of the legislature or simple petition, has the right to \nexpress its desire on political status. There should also be no \nquestion that the federal government should respond to any such \nexpression seriously and with due consideration.\n  The government of Puerto Rico has now enacted legislation calling for \na referendum on December 13 of this year. In developing the definitions \nthat will be placed before the voters, the draftsmen had before them \nthe language contained in the House-passed measure, the Senate-\nintroduced measure, and my draft chairman's mark. They also had the \ntestimony of the administration.\n  They chose to adopt definitions based on their own judgement. I want \nto make absolutely clear that even had\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\nthe draft chairman's mark been enacted, Puerto Rico would not have been \nobliged to adopt the definitions contained in it. My draft mark was \nstrictly advisory as will be the results of any referendum. That is as \nit should be. All we could hope to do would be to provide some guidance \nas to what this Congress thinks the process would likely be. Just as we \ncan not bind a future Congress, neither can an advisory referendum bind \nus.\n  I believe that we still owe our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico a fair \nstatement of the alternatives and process involved in future political \nstatus so that they can express their desires in a meaningful way. \nPassage of this resolution does not in any sense diminish the \nimportance of providing that information. This resolution does reaffirm \nthat the initial step for any political status change rests with out \nfellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Only they can decide whether and when \nto petition the Congress for consideration of a change in status. Only \nCongress can consider the legislation necessary to remove the obstacles \nto such a status and, in the philosophy of the Northwest Ordinance, \nprepare Puerto Rico for consideration of that status.\n  I think that ultimately we need to clarify that process in \nlegislation. Time is running out for this session of Congress, but I \nintend to resume where we are now at the beginning of the 106th \nCongress. In the interim, I think we have made considerable progress in \nclarifying the issues through our hearings and in the reactions to the \ndraft chairman's mark. This resolution is completely consistent with \nthat progress.\n  My best wishes go to the Governor and the people of Puerto Rico as \nthey prepare to express their preference on the December 13 referendum \nvote.\n  I yield the time I have remaining to the senior Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  I come to the floor to congratulate him and the other members of his \ncommittee for the action they are taking tonight to recognize the \ncontinuing support of the Congress for the determination by the people \nof Puerto Rico of what their future status should be.\n  The first resolution dealing with Alaska was introduced in the \nCongress in 1913. Final action on statehood for Alaska took place in \n1958. We became a State in 1959, as Senator Murkowski said. It is a \nlong process to seek to change the political status of a portion of the \nUnited States, and Puerto Rico is a portion of our country. Its people \nreally deserve the opportunity to express themselves on what their \nfuture should be.\n  So my congratulations to everyone for moving this resolution forward. \nI hope the day will come when I am still in the Senate that we can vote \non statehood for Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey controls 4 minutes \n40 seconds.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, let me finally, in conclusion, also \nthank Carlos Romero-Barcelo. The fact that this Senate has come \ntogether in this extraordinary judgment would not have been possible \nwithout his leadership. And also, as Senator Murkowski said, Governor \nPedro Rossello has been such an important person in building this very \nbroad coalition. To the Governor, I offer my very sincere \ncongratulations. He is an extraordinary man who has given great service \nto his people in making this night possible. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, \nyour service has been nonetheless a great credit to the people of \nPuerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from New Jersey \nparticularly for his leadership in bringing this resolution forward and \nto express my own pleasure at being a cosponsor along with a bipartisan \ngroup of cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, this resolution is about principle. It \nis not about politics. It is about the principle of self-determination, \nwhich was at the heart of the creation of America--the principle of \nself-determination, democracy, self-rule. It has continued throughout \nour history to today, when it remains a fundamental priority element of \nour foreign policy toward other peoples and other nations.\n  Really, what this is about is taking that fundamental American \nprinciple which we are eager to apply around the world and applying it \nto 4 million of our fellow American citizens who live on the islands \nthat constitute Puerto Rico, who served and died in defense of \nAmerica's freedom in disproportionate numbers. They deserve the right \nto become fully free, determine their destiny, participate fully, if \nthey choose and how they choose, in our democracy.\n  Senator Murkowski has been a very steadfast leader in this effort. It \ndidn't get as far as he or we wanted, but this resolution at least \ngives us the possibility, before the 105th session adjourns and prior \nto the referendum that will be held in Puerto Rico in December, to say \nas Members of the Senate of both parties we welcome the exercise and \nrecognize the right of our 4 million fellow Americans in Puerto Rico to \nexpress themselves to us and that we will review any such communication \nthat results from the vote that they hold in December. It is the least \nwe can do to be true to our principles.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nresolution. I am pleased that we are passing this resolution on the \nsecond day of Hispanic Heritage Month because Puerto Ricans, like all \nHispanic Americans, have made a great contribution to the culture and \neconomic growth of America.\n  There are nearly 4,000,000 American Citizens who live in the Islands \nof Puerto Rico. They are an integral part of our nation, they pay taxes \nand serve and die in our nation's military. Furthermore, there are \nmillions of American Citizens with Puerto Rican heritage who live on \nthe continent, hundreds of thousands of whom live in New Jersey. In \nmany ways, New Jersey is a second home for Puerto Ricans.\n  I strongly believe that the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico \nshould have the right to a democratic vote to determine the future \nstatus of these islands. I am pleased that such a referendum will take \nplace in December. After this vote, Congress should take the \nappropriate legislative action that reflects the will of the American \ncitizens living in Puerto Rico. And I will work with my colleagues to \nmake sure that this happens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I see no other Senator wishing to speak.\n  I believe there is no more remaining time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 2 minutes; \nthe Senator from New Jersey controls 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would be very pleased, if there is no \nother Senator wishing recognition, to yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the resolution and \nthe preamble are agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 279), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 279\n\n       Whereas nearly 4,000,000 United States citizens live in the \n     islands of Puerto Rico.\n       Whereas 1998 marks the centenary of the acquisition of the \n     islands of Puerto Rico from Spain;\n       Wheras in 1917 the United States granted United States \n     citizenship to the inhabitants of Puerto Rico.\n       Whereas since 1952, Puerto Rico has exercised local self-\n     government under the sovereignty of the United States and \n     subject to the provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States and other Federal laws applicable to Puerto Rico;\n       Whereas the Senate supports and recognizes the rights of \n     United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to express \n     their views regarding their future political status; and\n       Whereas the political status of Puerto Rico can be \n     determined only by the Congress of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A REFERENDUM ON THE \n                   FUTURE POLITICAL STATUS OF PUERTO RICO.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate supports and recognizes the right of United \n     States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to express \n     democratically their views regarding their future political \n     status through a referendum or other public reform, and to \n     communicate those views to the President and Congress; and\n       (2) the Federal Government should review any such \n     communication.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Graham, \n     Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3600 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  [The amendment was not available for printing. It will appear in a \nfuture edition of the Record.]\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \ncosponsored by Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa on our side and Senator \nBob Graham of Florida and Senator Dick Durbin on the Democrat side, all \nof whom I would like to thank for their hard work on this important \nmatter.\n  The Hatch-Graham-Grassley-Durbin pension amendment, among other \nthings, is designed to do the following: Provide a uniform exemption \nfor all types of tax-favored qualified pension plan assets in \nbankruptcy including Roth IRAs whose status under current bankruptcy \nlaw is uncertain, protect retirement assets that are in the process of \nbeing rolled over into a new qualified plan, and protect loans from \npension funds in bankruptcy.\n  Under present law, retirement plans which have received a \ndetermination letter from the IRS pursuant to section 7805 of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which have not been revoked \nby a court or by the IRS have, in many instances, been held by the \nbankruptcy courts not to be qualified plans. This holding allows the \ntrustee for the bankruptcy estate to seize the interest of the bankrupt \nparticipant in the plan.\n  Similarly, if a retirement plan that is not eligible to receive a \nfavorable determination letter but has in all other respects operated \nunder the ERISA provisions and has not had its status revoked by a \ncourt or by the IRS, such a plan has been found by the bankruptcy court \nnot to be a qualified plan.\n  This amendment addresses this problem by providing, 1, that if a plan \nhas received a favorable determination letter that is in effect, the \nplan is presumed to be exempt from the bankruptcy estate; and, 2, if a \nplan is not eligible for a determination letter, the plan may be exempt \nfrom the bankruptcy estate if there has been no prior determination by \na court or the IRS to the contrary and the plan is in substantial \ncompliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended.\n  Further, Mr. President, under present law, if there is a direct \ntransfer of an individual's retirement funds by the trustee of a plan \nexempt from the bankruptcy estate to the trustee of another retirement \nplan that is exempt from the bankruptcy estate, there is a question as \nto whether these retirement funds are exempt while in transit. It is \npossible that a bankruptcy court may hold that such funds are in a \n``pay status'' and thus subject to attachment by the bankruptcy \ntrustee. If there is a distribution of a plan's assets to a distributee \nand the latter within 60 days transfers them to another qualified plan, \nERISA rules do not treat that as a distribution.\n  There is some question whether these funds in transit are protected \nfrom the bankruptcy estate. If a participant is in bankruptcy when \neither of these types of transit occur, the bankruptcy trustee may be \nauthorized by the bankruptcy court to seize the funds. The result would \nbe to severely reduce or wipe out the participant's retirement funds. \nThis is contrary to sound public policy.\n  The proposed amendment provides that a direct transfer of retirement \nfunds from one qualified retirement plan to another shall be exempt \nfrom the bankruptcy estate. In addition, it provides that eligible \n``rollover'' funds from a qualified retirement plan shall be exempt \nfrom the estate if rolled over to another qualified plan within the \nallowed 60 days of the initial distribution.\n  Finally, on the issue of qualified plan loans, the amendment provides \nthat qualified plan loans outstanding when the participant is in \nbankruptcy are not dischargeable, and that payroll deductions used to \nrepay plan loans are not stayed by the court.\n  The retirement savings of hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans \nare at risk in bankruptcy proceedings. In 1997, an estimated 280,000 \nAmericans age 50 and older filed bankruptcy. Almost one in five \nbankruptcy cases involve one or both petitioners who are 50 or older. \nThis amendment has the full support of the AARP, which has stated that:\n\n       The accumulation and preservation of retirement funds \n     represents an important national goal.\n\n  I could not agree more. With this national goal in mind, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say I am happy to support this \namendment. I am happy to be a cosponsor with my friend from Utah, \nSenator Hatch. I had prepared an amendment on this subject and I am \nhappy to join him in making this a bipartisan effort.\n  I will not take any time because I know a number of Members have to \nreturn to their families this evening, but I concur with him, with the \nincreased number of Americans over the age of 50 filing for bankruptcy, \nthis is a problem which we should address and address directly. It is \nnot only to the benefit of senior citizens who are saving for their own \nretirement, it is certainly to the benefit of their families who are \nconcerned that they be allowed to live in independence and security in \ntheir retirement years. We have traditionally given special \nconsideration to 401(k) plans. This amendment will extend that \nconsideration to IRAs and other vehicles that allow people to put \nsavings away for their future retirement.\n  I am happy to support this and I am happy to say that the amendment \nwhich I offered, and I am sure this one as well, had the support of the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons and virtually every major \nsenior citizens group in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois first talked about this amendment, I was telling him I thought \nhe had a winner on his hands. I could not imagine anybody opposing it. \nI was delighted to see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah has \nalso adopted the same idea of the Senator from Illinois. I think it is \nan excellent piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n  I suspect it will pass unanimously. I realize that is one of the \nreasons why it is brought up as a bed-check vote at 8 o'clock at night \ntonight, because everyone knows the Senator from Illinois has a good \nidea and the Senator from Utah has a good idea. Those are the kind that \nwe use for bed-check votes.\n  I should tell the American people, though, notwithstanding that, it \nis a very valuable piece of legislation and I am delighted to see it \nand I am going to be very happy to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \noverriding of the President's veto on partial-birth abortion. Before I \ngive my comments and observations, I want to look across the Senate to \nthe freshman Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum. I want to say to \nhim that when he spoke on this issue today, and when he spoke on this \nissue the last time we debated it here, I was never more proud of a \nSenator than I was to observe him and watch him. I can assure him that \neven though he may not have won the last time in terms of what we are \ndoing in a veto override, and he may not win this time, there are \nmillions of Americans who have watched him. Whether they were concerned \nabout this issue or not, if they watched for a while, they are \nconcerned right now. You can't ask for anything more.\n  I read the Senator's wife's book with reference to the problems they \nhad with reference to an abortion they had no control over, an early \ndelivery of a child that died. I am so proud, I can hardly express it \ntonight.\n  I want to once more congratulate him for what he has done here on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is not easy, but he did it with great, great \nstyle.\n  Mr. President, this debate is about infanticide. Frankly, I didn't \ndream that concept up. There is a very distinguished Senator from the \nState of New York--I know Senator D'Amato from New York is here and I \nthink he would concur when I say a distinguished Senator named Senator \nMoynihan--who looked at this problem and it didn't take him very long. \nWe talk all around it. He talked right to it when he said this is \ninfanticide.\n  So this debate is about humanity and necessity. The procedure of \npartial-birth abortion, to put it bluntly, is inhumane.\n  By now, many Americans are uncomfortably aware of the details of \npartial-birth abortion. They have heard the testimony of doctors who \nperformed this procedure, nurses who witnessed this procedure, and they \nhave most likely seen informational ads or read descriptions of this \nprocedure. Maybe they have even watched us debate this issue on prior \noccasions. So I am not going to go through the details of the \nprocedure. I will only say that, at a minimum, it is cruel and \ninhumane. I find it ironic that our Constitution, via the eighth \namendment, protects criminals from cruel and unusual punishment; \nhowever, that same amendment does not protect innocent babies when it \ncomes to cruel and inhumane procedures that are known as partial-birth \nabortions.\n  Proponents of partial-birth abortion claim that the procedure is \nrare, occurring only about 500 times a year. However, that is simply \nnot true. The number of partial-birth abortions is closer to between \n3,000 and 5,000 a year. In New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 procedures \nare done each year. Besides being inhumane and quite prevalent, \npartial-birth abortion is also unnecessary.\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that partial-birth abortion is \nnecessary to protect the health of the mother. However, most experts \nsay this is also simply not true. According to more than 500 doctors \nnationwide, who make up what is called the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition \nfor Truth, it is never--I repeat never--medically necessary to perform \na partial-birth abortion to protect the health or fertility of the \nmother. A former Surgeon General, who we admire and respect when he \nsort of agrees with our views but we ignore him when he disagrees, \nSurgeon General Everett Koop, has also stated that partial-birth \nabortion is never medically necessary to protect the mother's health or \nfertility. So amidst all this evidence, how can the opponents of this \nbill tell the American people that partial-birth abortion is sometimes \nmedically necessary?\n  If this procedure is not medically necessary, why do we allow it? As \nI told you, Mr. President, this debate is not about Roe v. Wade or the \nchoice of life. It is not about any of those things. But it is about a \nbaby, a life that is destroyed in a cruel and inhumane way. It is about \na life that is unnecessarily destroyed and need not happen. It is for \nthese reasons that I will gladly vote to override the President's veto \nof the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997.\n  I suggest tonight to my good friend, the leader of this cause, that \nif at first you don't succeed, try, try again. If indeed that means \nthat you have already tried three times, then try and try again. What \nis so patently right will soon prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made \nby my distinguished friend and colleague, the great senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici. He touched on the eloquence and passion \nand the rightness and the moral certainty of\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\nSenator Santorum's very cogent argument and presentation. This entire \nsubject, I believe, is uncomfortable for all of us. But it is so \nnecessary. Senator Domenici spoke about the great senior Senator from \nNew York, and I say that because I have great admiration and respect \nfor the senior Senator from New York, who is fearless and courageous in \nsaying that this was infanticide. That is what this is--the killing of \na youngster, which is absolutely unnecessary, when the AMA, the \nAmerican Medical Association, has come out and said there is no reason \nfor this procedure. What are we talking about when we move down this \nline and say that anyone can do anything, even where we have a life, a \nnew and innocent life?\n  And so, Mr. President, I, too, say to my colleague and friend from \nPennsylvania, we thank you for having the moral certainty and courage \nof not giving up and fighting to preserve the opportunity for those \nlives that have really come into being, to be what they can be and what \nthey should be. When we talk about preserving the sanctity of life, \nthere is no greater fight, no greater cause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Santorum, for all you \nhave gone through and all the courage that it has taken for you to do \nwhat you have done, I hope that tonight, by staying here a few minutes \nwith you--and there is nobody else on the floor but us--you understand \nthat we are very appreciative of your leadership and we are with you. \nWe are going to vote with you, and we are going to vote with you again, \nuntil it finally prevails. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico and \nthe Senator from New York for their overly gracious comments. They have \nbeen in this Chamber a lot longer than I and have been fighting many \nnoble causes, including the cause of life. They have served as \ntremendous models for me in this effort. I thank them for their \nterrific heartfelt support on this issue and other issues pertaining to \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10509-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the ban on the \npartial-birth abortion procedure and in support of the vote to override \nthe President's veto. It is inexplicable to me why that veto occurred, \nand I think it is unfortunate and tragic. We have an opportunity \ntomorrow to right that wrong. I join my distinguished colleagues in \npraising Senator Santorum, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwho has so eloquently put forth the case for banning this procedure and \nappealing to our consciences as Americans, as human beings, and as \ncivilized people to end the condoning of this procedure in this \ncountry.\n  I think, as I listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania this \nafternoon, and as I recall the previous debates on this issue, I was \nmoved, as I know millions of Americans were moved, as we listened to \nnot only the logic but the moral persuasiveness of the need to ban this \nprocedure. I think this evening, as I say those laudatory words about \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania, it is appropriate that we say also that \nthere are many in the other Chamber, the House of Representatives, who \nhave fought this battle over and over to ensure that that veto was \noverridden in the House of Representatives.\n  I think of my friend from Florida, Charles Canady, who is the \nchairman of the Constitution Subcommittee in the House of \nRepresentatives, who has so eloquently and so forcefully argued for \nthis legislation and carried this crusade across this country.\n  I think of the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, who has come under such unfair and scathing attack in recent \ndays and yet who has been, I think, the most eloquent and passionate \nvoice for the unborn that modern America has seen.\n  I rise in defense of him and in support of Congressman Hyde this \nevening and appreciation for all that he has done for the cause of the \nunborn. On more than one occasion, as I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I saw minds change and hearts change under the \npersuasiveness of his oratory.\n  It is my hope that even as we look at this very important vote in the \nmorning, that, yes, there will be those in this body who will look deep \nwithin their soul, who evaluate their own conscience, and examine their \nown hearts, and that we might even yet see those two or three votes \nnecessary to change in order to see this veto overridden.\n  It is often suggested in this debate that government should stay out \nof the abortion issue. But if the protection of innocent lives is not \ngovernment's duty, then I ask, What is government's duty? Thomas \nJefferson once wrote, ``The care of human life--not its destruction, is \nthe first and only legitimate objective of good government. Legislative \nefforts to protect the weak and defenseless are right and should be \npursued.'' I can think of none who are weaker, I can think of none in \nthe human family more defenseless, than those who are but inches from \nenjoying life.\n  In fact, in March of last year, my home State of Arkansas joined a \nnumber of other States in banning such a procedure when the State \nlegislature passed and the government signed our partial-birth abortion \nban in the State of Arkansas.\n  This procedure is a barbaric, uncivilized procedure, shockingly close \nto infanticide, as has been so frequently observed on the floor of the \nSenate today. It is so close to infanticide that, in fact, no civilized \ncountry, no compassionate people, should allow it. Any woman knows that \nthe first step of partial-birth abortion--breach delivery--is something \nto avoid, not something to intentionally cause.\n  During the last debate that we had on this subject, I quoted Jean \nWright, associate professor of pediatrics and anesthesia at Emory \nUniversity. It is a quote that I think deserves being said again during \nthis debate. She was testifying against the argument that fetuses who \nare candidates for partial-birth abortion do not feel pain during the \nprocedure. She testified that the fetus is sensitive to pain, perhaps \neven more sensitive--more sensitive--than a full-term infant. She \nadded, and this is the part that is especially striking, and I quote \nher words as she testified: ``This procedure, if it was done on an \nanimal in my institution, would not make it through the institutional \nreview process.'' And then she said, ``The animal would be more \nprotected than this child is.''\n  How tragic that we allow that situation to exist where, in an \ninstitution of higher learning in this country, animals have greater \nprotections than do unborn children.\n  So I am glad this evening very briefly to rise in support of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, to rise in support of this override of the \nPresident's veto. As has been said, this is not about choice nor \ncompulsion, it is about inhumane disposal of unwanted babies.\n  This legislation does not prevent a woman from receiving medical care \nor reproductive care. It does not overturn Roe v. Wade. It simply ends \nan unnatural and unhealthy practice that results in the loss of human \nlife. We must help the helpless, we must defend the defenseless, and we \nmust give voice to the voiceless.\n  I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania and my colleague from Ohio, \nwho will speak soon, for giving voice to the voiceless, for standing up \nand defending the defenseless, and for helping the most helpless and \nmost innocent in our society, the unborn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes. \nI know the Senator from Ohio, the Presiding Officer, will be coming \ndown and speaking.\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n  I want to point out one thing. Several comments have been made on the \nother side about the life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. I just \nwant to read it. There is some concern that there is no life-of-the-\nmother exception in the bill. Let me assure everyone in this Chamber \nand everyone within the sound of my voice that there is a clear life-\nof-the-mother exception that gives physicians the right to make those \ncritical medical decisions that unfortunately may occur that would \nnecessitate the killing of a baby in a crisis situation that is in \nthe process of being delivered.\n\n  If you do not believe me, let me read from a letter that was written \nduring the debate last year by the American Medical Association that \nendorsed this bill. I will read the pertinent language with respect to \nthe life-of-the-mother exception.\n\n       Our support of this legislation is based on three specific \n     principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimate \n     exception where the life of the mother was endangered, \n     thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any \n     medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother.\n\n  This is a group of physicians who in the previous paragraph said:\n\n       Although our general policy is to oppose legislation \n     criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has \n     supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly \n     defined and not medically indicated.\n\n  So while they have reticence, and had reticence, about supporting any \nkind of a ban on the procedure, one of the things that made them \ncomfortable about supporting this particular piece of legislation was \nthe language having to do with the life-of-the-mother exception. They \nfelt it gave physicians sufficient room to be able to make that call if \nin fact someone was in a life-threatening situation and a baby would \nhave to be killed in the process of saving the mother's life, if so \ndetermined by the doctor. We have provided that.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that Members on the other side have \nraised this red herring that has no basis in fact--no basis in the \nlegal language.\n  I don't want to go any further. I will come back and read the exact \nlanguage in the bill for anyone who has a question.\n  It is a very clear life-of-the-mother exception that gives plenty of \nleeway for the physician to be able to take whatever action is \nnecessary to save the mother. And to perpetrate that hoax on Members of \nCongress and those who might be listening who might not have the bill \nin front of them is really, I should add, another lie to the lies that \nI enumerated earlier, the six lies. Now I have to add a seventh--that \nthere is somehow no life-of-the-mother exception in the bill when the \nvery organization whose physicians are going to be practicing says \nthere is a legitimate exception, thereby preserving the physician's \njudgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the \nmother.\n  I don't know how more clear you can be. I will have more to say.\n  I will yield the floor so the Senator from Ohio, who is one of the \ngreat champions of pro-life in this country, someone who is outspoken \nnot just here on the Senate floor but around the country, and he has \nlived by example as well as by his speeches. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, let me congratulate my colleague \nand friend from Pennsylvania.\n  Senator Domenici said it very, very well: Keep trying and keep \ntrying, and eventually we will succeed, because I believe what we are \ntrying to do is right. The vast majority of the American people agree \nwith us. We will succeed.\n  I congratulate Senator Santorum, my friend from Pennsylvania, who has \nfought so hard, who has argued so eloquently on this floor.\n  I would also like to associate myself with the Senator from New York, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator from Arkansas, who just in \nthe last few minutes so eloquently argued in favor of our override of \nthis veto tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I think it is truly regrettable that we still have to \ndebate this after so many years.\n  We are talking about a procedure that is morally wrong. The facts are \nreally not at issue. No one denies this procedure is designed to kill, \nto kill a living, partially delivered baby, a baby that is usually 5 to \n6 months old, 5 to 6 months in gestation.\n  No one denies that only a few inches separate this barbaric practice \nfrom outright murder. Partial-birth abortion is perhaps the only legal \nprocedure where live birth and death become virtually simultaneous.\n  The vote we will cast tomorrow morning will be a clear moral decision \nabout life and about death. It is a decision really about who we are as \na people, our moral identity as a people. Banning this procedure \nrepresents the moral consensus of the American people by an \noverwhelming margin.\n  Dr. LeRoy Sprang and Mark Neerhof stated in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion should not be performed because it \n     is needlessly risky, inhumane and ethically unacceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree with this characterization, as do the \nAmerican people. It is no secret that America has been experiencing a \nmoral crisis, and we have reached a crossroads. The questions which I \nasked on this floor just about a year ago, I guess, about partial-birth \nabortion really remain unanswered. These questions are more profound \nthan ever. What does our toleration for this immoral practice say for \nus as a country? What does it say about us as a people? I believe one \njudges a country by what it is for but also you judge a country by what \nit is against. We judge a country by what it tolerates. We tolerate too \nmuch in this country. We tolerate a lot in this Nation. But at some \npoint we simply have to draw the line. We have to stop hiding behind \nthe phrase, ``Oh, I really don't like this but it's someone else's \nprivate matter and I don't want to interfere. We will put up with it. \nIt's not my business.''\n  We have to stop hiding behind that. In a country that is based on \nrespect for freedom, this is, of course, a very important principle. \nBut it does have limits, limits that are based on the same respect for \nhuman rights that is the very foundation for freedom itself. Why, after \nall, is the argument based on personal freedom so powerful in our \npolitical debates? It is because we all have in our hearts the immortal \nwords of Thomas Jefferson, the words that we hold these truths to be \nself-evident, that we have the inalienable right to life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness. This is our profound moral conviction.\n  But what does it say about our moral convictions when we continue to \nallow in this country this barbaric practice? What does it say about us \nas a people? Does allowing this practice bespeak a commitment to the \nsanctity of human life, of a human person? No, if we do not say at some \npoint that our tolerance draws the line on a practice so brutal and so \ninhumane, we run the severe risk of eroding this moral foundation that \nreally lies at the base of all our other freedoms. A country that \nallows this barbaric procedure to be inflicted on innocent human lives \nis a country that cannot be trusted when it proclaims a respect for \nother freedoms. What freedom will such a country not discard in the \nname of mere convenience?\n  For me, the decision is clear. This is where we draw the line. Now is \nthe time that we draw it. We must ban this uncivilized, this barbaric, \nthis immoral procedure, and we must do it tomorrow morning.\n  Many people agree that this procedure is closer to infanticide than \nit is to abortion. One of the reasons banning this procedure has been \nsupported by doctors, including the American Medical Association, the \nPhysicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, and even by otherwise pro-\nchoice individuals, including even some abortionists, is because it is \na procedure that is never a medical necessity. It is never a medical \nnecessity. The evidence is overwhelming. It is done for sheer \nconvenience.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, while it \ndoes not support this bill, could nevertheless not identify any \ncircumstances in which this procedure would be the only option to save \nthe life or preserve the health of a mother.\n  Most people in America oppose this procedure. And they oppose it for \nthe simple reason they know what it is.\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\n For those who do not or who need to be reminded of what it is, let me \nagain describe it. And I know this is a procedure that has been \ndescribed on this floor many, many times, but it goes to the heart of \nthis debate.\n  Partial-birth abortion involves the partial delivery of a baby by its \nfeet. The head is left inside the mother's womb. The head remains in \nthe uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing scissors \ninto the base of the child's head, suctioning out the baby's brain with \na small tube, then completing the delivery of a now dead child. In this \nbarbaric procedure, Mr. President, the abortionist does not even \nadminister an anesthesia to the fetus.\n  A moment ago, the Senator from Arkansas pointed out that dogs are \ntreated better than this. The dogs that are used in medical research \nare required to be given pain management therapy under Federal \nstandards. The treatment of these human fetuses that we are talking \nabout would not even meet the bare minimum Federal standards for dogs \nused in medical research. Knowing that, why then have we not banned \nthis procedure? Why are we still here debating again what should be \nself-evident, that this practice is a crime against our common \nhumanity?\n  The answer, I am afraid, is very simple. My friend from Pennsylvania \nspent a good amount of time in this Chamber outlining the reason. The \ncase supporting this procedure is built on misinformation. It is built \non lies, and they are intended to poison the public debate and obscure \nthe truth. That is the fact.\n  In the beginning of the partial-birth abortion controversy, many \npeople were misled to believe that this procedure was rare. We were \ntold it was rare. Now, today, we know that simply is not true. Almost \neveryone is aware by now that Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of \nthe National Coalition of Providers, admitted that he lied. He said, \n``I lied through my teeth''--when he said partial-birth abortions were \nperformed rarely and only in extreme medical circumstances. He admitted \nlater after the debate that that was a lie.\n  In the interest of medical accuracy, let me emphasize and be specific \nabout how Mr. Fitzsimmons lied. He lied plainly and, in his own words, \nhe ``lied through his teeth.'' We were misled again when we were told \nthat this procedure was the only late-term abortion procedure that \ncould be used in certain instances to save the life of the mother. \nAgain, that is not true. It is simply not true. This procedure is not \nmedically necessary. It is not medically indicated ever, nor is it the \nonly option available. That is not based on what Mike DeWine says or \nwhat Rick Santorum says. That is based on the American Medical \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, we were told yet another falsehood--lie. We were told \nthat this procedure was to preserve the health of the mother. We were \nmisled about that as well. This is simply not true. Dr. Martin Haskell, \nthe man who invented this procedure, said that 80 percent of the \nabortions he performs are elective --80 percent. This is the \nabortionist. This is the man who invented this procedure. He said 80 \npercent of the ones he performed are elective.\n  A survey which asks women who had late-term abortions why they waited \nfound that 71 percent did not know they were pregnant or misjudged the \nage of the baby. This procedure is being performed for convenience, \npure and simple.\n  We have also been told the procedure is appropriate because the baby \nis not viable anyway. But even this is certainly not always true. Many \ntimes it is not true. Research in a recent article in the New England \nJournal of Medicine found 56 percent of babies are viable outside their \nmother's womb at 24 weeks. At 25 weeks, 79 percent of them are viable.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues have had the same experience that I \nhave when we have gone home to our home States, visited neonatal \nintensive care units at children's hospitals or other hospitals, and we \nhave seen 22-week-old children, 23-week-old children that have been \nborn prematurely who are fighting for life. Many of them do, in fact, \nmake it. We have seen that with our own eyes. We have all talked with \ndoctors who are frantically trying, working so hard every day to save \nthem, and many can be saved.\n  Unfortunately, the President of the United States, in vetoing this \nlegislation, as in his veto of the previous legislation, has justified \nhis position precisely on these types of falsehoods. In fact, if you \nlook at his veto message last time, what you find is all these facts \nthat are outlined there, that he says are facts, are simply not true. \nThe President, tragically, is wrong. While it is true that everyone is \nentitled to his or her own opinion, none of us is entitled to our own \nfacts. And the facts clearly indicate that what the President put down \nin his veto message is wrong.\n  The falsehoods spread by defenders of partial-birth abortion are, \nfrankly, offensive. But even more offensive than some of these lies is \nwhen the proponents of partial-birth abortion tell the truth. For \nexample, when they say the partial-birth abortion procedure is needed \nin order to get rid of ``defective'' infants. The late Dr. James \nMcMahon, who had performed thousands of these partial-birth abortions, \nsaid he performed some of these abortions because the baby had a cleft \nlip. That is right, a cleft lip. Maybe it is time to rewrite our sacred \ndocuments to say, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that most \nof us are endowed with inalienable rights, the right to life, liberty \nand the pursuit of happiness, but people with cleft lips or other \nproblems, other ``defectives,'' are to be the victims of a painful and \nbarbaric murder.''\n  No, that is not the moral attitude of the America that I want to \nbelieve in or that I do believe in. That is the moral attitude of \nanother civilization, one that arose in this vicious century only to \nvanish from the face of the planet by the force of American arms and, \nmore important, American values. It is in our power to say no to this \nthrowback to the days of the Nazis, to say no to the selection of the \nfittest, to say no to infanticide. That is what we are about today on \nthe floor of the Senate. That is what we will be about tomorrow morning \nwhen we cast our vote.\n  I would like to note briefly that a number of State statutes have \nsought to ban these partial-birth abortions. Some States have had \nsuccess and others have not. Many of those statutes which have been \nstruck down, however, are very distinguishable from this legislation. I \nwould like to talk about this constitutional aspect of this bill, \nbecause the issue has been raised time and time again on the floor of \nthe Senate. So let me turn to an examination of the bill, based on our \nConstitution, based on Roe v. Wade and Casey and the other Supreme \nCourt decisions.\n  First, let me say of the cases, of the statutes that have been struck \ndown, the proposed statute that is before us is clearly \ndistinguishable. For example, the first law to ban the partial-birth \nabortion procedure was enacted in my home State of Ohio. Unfortunately, \nthis law was recently struck down as vague, as overbroad, particularly \nas it banned more than just partial-birth abortion. But the bill we are \nvoting on today has, frankly, none of these problems.\n  Partial-birth abortion bans are fully in effect in seven States of \nthe Union. Several State and district courts have enjoined State \nstatutes attempting to ban partial-birth abortion. However, no \nappellate court has ruled on the constitutionality of any of these \nlaws.\n  Unfortunately, in the decisions that I have reviewed, none squarely \nconfront the constitutional issue that this Federal bill presents; \nnamely, the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of a partially \nborn child. Because that is what this legislation is truly about, what \nthe issue is, is the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of a \npartially born child.\n  Roe v. Wade explicitly avoided deciding that issue, so it cannot be \ncited and should not be cited as an argument against this piece of \nlegislation. Roe v. Wade explicitly avoided deciding that issue, which \nwas actually part of the Texas law in question in that case, a law that \nprohibited ``killing a child in the process of delivery.'' In fact, \nTexas case law is consistent with both Louisiana and California law. An \nearly California court aptly said:\n\n       It should equally be held that a viable child in the \n     process of being born is a human being within the meaning of \n     the homicide statutes, whether or not the process has been \n     fully completed.\n\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\n\n  While many of the State court decisions have relied on Planned \nParenthood v. Casey, that case does not reach the question of the \nconstitutionality of forbidding the killing of a partially delivered \nbaby either. However, under the Casey analysis, an abortion restriction \nis unconstitutional only, only if it creates an ``undue burden,'' on \nthe legal right to abortion. Banning a single dangerous procedure such \nas we are doing in this case, when there are other alternatives \navailable--which is true--should not constitute a burden under this \nCasey analysis.\n  Doctors, those who are for, as well as those, some of whom are \nagainst this legislation--agree that partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility, \nand is never the only option. Over 30 legal scholars who have looked at \nthis question agree that the United States Supreme Court is unlikely to \ninterpret a postviability health exception to require the Government to \nallow a procedure that gives zero weight to the life of a partially \nborn child and is itself a dangerous procedure.\n  The bottom line is that there is no substantive difference between a \nchild in the process of being born and that same child if she is born. \nNo difference, really, between a child that is in the process of being \nborn and a child that is born. A current illustration, I think, is very \nhelpful. This is a true story, one that occurred in our minority \nleader's home State, South Dakota.\n  On January 5 of this year, Sarah Bartels was pregnant with twins. She \nwas 23 weeks into her pregnancy. Doctors were unable to delay the birth \nof one of the twins, Sandra, who was born at 23 weeks old. Sandra \nweighed 1 pound, 2 ounces--23 weeks.\n  Mr. President, 88 days later Sandra's sister Stephanie was born. Both \nchildren are alive and well today. Yet Stephanie was not a ``legal \nperson,'' and could have been the victim of a partial-birth abortion \nany time after that 23-week period.\n  Stephanie's life had zero worth until she was completely born, though \nSandra was alive and well outside the same womb that held her sister.\n  Mr. President, the delivery of 80 percent of a child--the child is \nalmost all the way out--a living baby certainly should have some value, \nsome rights, some respect under our law. There is no moral \njustification for killing a live, partially delivered baby using a \nprocedure that is neither medically necessary nor safer than \nchildbirth. I believe we must make it the national policy to prohibit \nthe partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  My friend, Henry Hyde, who you quoted and cited a few moments ago, \nMr. President, is one of the most eloquent--the most eloquent really--\ndefenders of human rights in this country today, one of the most \neloquent defenders of human rights, frankly, who has ever been in this \ncountry. Henry Hyde likes to say in defending these powerless humans, \nwe are ``loving those who can't love us back.'' I think he is \nabsolutely right.\n  I will add the phrase, ``those who can't love back'' includes not \njust fetuses in the womb, but also the future generations who will live \nin this country and the moral climate we are choosing to build for \nthem.\n  The vote we cast tomorrow morning will help determine, Mr. President, \nthat moral climate. Banning partial-birth abortion is the just, it is \nthe right thing to do, and we should do it now.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first, again, I thank the Senator from \nOhio for his excellent comments and particularly his latter focus on \nthe legal issues that were not brought up earlier. I had not had the \nopportunity, and neither did anybody else, to focus attention on why \nthis particular legislation is, in fact, constitutional and that should \nnot be a reason to not vote for this legislation. An excellent job \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10510-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am glad to stand with the distinguished \nMajority Leader and the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee to explain how we plan to proceed with respect to reform of \nthe copyright compulsory license governing the retransmission of \nbroadcast television signals by satellite carriers. Let me thank them \nfor their interest in these important issues and their cooperation in \nthis process. The Majority Leader has been particularly helpful in \nfacilitating a process allowing for a joint reform package from our two \ncommittees.\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has been working on these \nissues for more than 2 years. We have always recognized that some of \nthe reforms we need to undertake in relation to the compulsory \ncopyright license would require reforms in the communications law which \nhas traditionally been dealt with in the Commerce Committee. I am glad \nthat we have been able to work out a process whereby we can move a bill \nto the floor that will be the joint work product, and thus using the \njoint expertise, of both the Judiciary and Commerce Committees.\n  We will proceed in the Judiciary Committee by working on a bill on \nthe subject that has already been referred to the Judiciary Committee, \nS. 1720, which Senator Leahy and I introduced earlier in this Congress. \nWe will mark up a Chairman's mark substitute amendment of that bill \nwhich will cover the copyright amendments, including the granting and \nextension of the local and distant signal licenses, respectively, as \nwell as the copyright rates for each of those licenses. Other important \nreforms include eliminating the current waiting period for cable \nsubscribers before getting satellite service, and postponing the date \nof the enforcement of the so-called white area rules for a brief \nperiod. As of today, a large number of satellite subscribers who have \nbeen found to be ineligible for distant network signals will be turned \noff in early October. Our bill will delay any such terminations to \nallow subscribers and satellite carriers to adopt other service \npackages, including local service packages where available, to work \nwith local affiliates to work out a coverage compromise, and to allow \nthe FCC to review the rules governing the eligibility for the reception \nof distant network signals. The text of this Chairman's mark will be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks and is supported \nand cosponsored by the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nMcCain, as well as Senators Leahy, DeWine, and Kohl.\n  While the Judiciary Committee works on these copyright reforms, our \ncolleagues in the Commerce Committee will be working on related \ncommunications amendments regarding such important areas such as the \nmust-carry and retransmission consent requirements for satellite \ncarriers upon which the copyright licenses will be conditioned, and the \nFCC's distant signal eligibility process. Chairman\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\nMcCain will be introducing this legislation today as well.\n  It is our joint intention to combine our respective work product as \ntwo titles of the same bill, S. 1720, in a way that will clearly \ndelineate the work product of each committee, but combine them into the \nseamless whole necessary to make the licenses work for consumers and \nthe affected industries.\n  In conclusion, let me again thank the Majority Leader for his \ninterest in and leadership with respect to these issues, and I thank \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee for his collegiality and \ncooperation in this process. I look forward to working with them and \nwith our other colleagues on these important issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Chairman's mark \nsubstitute for S. 1720 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  [The material was not available for printing. It will appear in a \nfuture edition of the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10513-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10514-S10515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BILL TO PREVENT CUTOFFS OF SATELLITE TV SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard from scores of Vermonters \nlately who are steaming mad after being told by their home satellite \nsignal providers that they are about to lose some of their network \nsatellite channels. They have every right to be upset. It is within \nCongress's ability to un-muddle this mess, and the public has every \nreason to expect Congress to get its act together to do that, and to do \nthat promptly.\n  While the hills and mountains of Vermont are a natural wonder, they \ncan also be barriers to reception of clear TV signals over-the-air with \nrooftop antennas. At my home in Middlesex, Vermont, we can only get one \nchannel clearly, and lots of ghosts on the other channel we receive. We \nget so many ghosts on our family set that it looks like Mark McGwire \nand Sammy Sosa are hitting four homeruns at a time.\n  That is why Vermonters have chosen satellite reception: They cannot \nget a clear picture without it.\n  I am gratified tonight that we are finally in a position to announce \nan understanding that I hope will keep satellite TV viewers from having \nto lose station signals this year. I am joining with both the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee \non two separate bills designed fix these problems. I am certain that \nmost Senators will be pleased with this breakthrough, and I hope we can \npass this bill without objection in the Senate.\n  Under a court order, thousands of viewers--many of them living in my \nhome state of Vermont--will be cut off from receiving satellite TV \nstations that they are paying to receive. We have 65,000 home satellite \ndishes in Vermont. the court order directly affects only those \nsubscribers who signed up for service after March 11, 1997, but most \nsubscribers are being warned nonetheless by their signal providers that \nthey will soon lose several network channels they now receive.\n  This huge policy glitch is intruding right now into hundreds of \nthousands of homes. It is a royal mess, and Congress and the FCC need \nto fix it.\n  I introduced a bill in March of this year with Chairman Hatch so that \nwe could try to resolve this issue before it became a major problem. We \nhave tried in the many months since then to push Congress toward a \nsolution. Many viewers have lost signals already. We are trying to get \nthese bills passed in the next couple of weeks to restore service and \nto keep other households for losing their satellite TV signals--not \njust in Vermont but throughout the nation.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and I have worked out arrangements \nwith the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Senators active \non this issue, including Senators DeWine and Kohl, that significantly \nraise the prospects that Congress can soon pass a bill to prevent the \ncutoff of thousands of viewers this month and in October. We hope and \nwe believe that all Senators can support this approach.\n  This legislation would keep signals available to Vermonters and \nsubscribers in other states until the FCC has a chance to address these \nissues by the end of next February.\n  Our legislation will direct the FCC to address this problem for the \nfuture, and our proposal ultimately will mean--as technology advances--\nthat Vermonters will be able to receive satellite TV for all Vermont \nfull-power TV stations. Viewers in all states would be similarly \nprotected. This effort eventually will promote head-to-head competition \nbetween cable and satellite TV providers.\n  The goal is to provide satellite home viewers in Vermont and across \nthe nation with more choices and more channel selections, and at lower \nrates. The evidence is clear that in areas of the country where there \nis full competition between cable providers, rates to customers are \nconsiderably lower. The same will be true when there is greater \neffective competition between cable providers and satellite signal \nproviders.\n  Over time, this effort will permit satellite TV providers to offer a \nfull selection of local TV channels to viewers--even to those living in \nor near Burlington, Vermont, where local signals are now blocked.\n  Under current law, those families must get their local TV signals \nover an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. These \nbills eventually will remove that legal limitation that prohibits \nsatellite carriers from offering local TV signals to viewers.\n  Over time, satellite carriers will have to follow the rules that \ncable providers have to follow which will mean that they must carry all \nlocal Vermont TV stations. In addition, Vermont stations will be \navailable over satellite to many areas of Vermont that today are \nunserved by satellite or by cable.\n  Vermonters now receive network satellite signals with programming \nfrom stations in other states. In other words, they may get a CBS \nstation from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate.\n  By allowing satellite providers to offer a wider variety of \nprogramming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be \nable to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing \nwith satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a highly effective \ncompetitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet \nconnections to homes and businesses.\n  The second major improvement offered through our legislation is that \nsatellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of \nprogramming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout our state. The \nsystem will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or \nDMAs. Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state--the \nBurlington-Plattsburg DMA, and two smaller ones in southeastern \nVermont--the Albany-Schenectady-Troy DMA includes Bennington County--\nand in southwestern Vermont, where the Boston DMA includes Windham \nCounty.\n  Using current technology, signals would be provided by spot-beam \nsatellites using some 150 regional uplink sites throughout the nation \nto beam local signals up to two satellites. Those satellites would use \n60 or so spotbeams to send those local signals, received from the \nregional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High-definition TV \nwould be offered under this system at a later date. This system is \nlikely to take two to three years to be put into full operation. In the \nmeantime, another company called EchoStar may provide some local-into-\nlocal service in some parts of the country.\n  Under the bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced in March, this \nspotbeam technology would mean that home owners with satellite dishes \nin downtown Burlington, and in every county in Vermont except Windham \nand Bennington, would receive all the full-power TV stations in the \nBurlington-Plattsburg DMA, including PBS stations. Bennington residents \nwould receive the stations in the Schnectady-Albany-Troy DMA, and \nWindham County residents would receive Boston signals, since they are \nin the Boston DMA. Over time these counties could be blended into the \nBurlington-Plattsburg DMA.\n  Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be \ndeveloped before this bill is fully implemented that would provide \nsimilar service but using different technology. And existing systems \nwould be accommodated\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\nunder our legislation, but those systems would follow rules similar to \ncurrent rules until conversion to this new technology takes place.\n  It is time for this Congress to step up to the plate and solve this \npolicy nightmare that is now at the door of countless homes across the \nnation. Our constituents rightly will not take ``not now'' as an \nacceptable answer.\n  I commend Chairman Hatch and Chairman McCain for the leadership they \nhave shown in solving this problem, and I look forward to continue \nworking closely with them and with other Senators as we move this \nsolution toward, and eventually across, the goal line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10514-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADMINISTRATION'S UPDATED ENCRYPTION POLICY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Administration first announced the \nencryption policy that has been in effect for the past two years, I \nwarned on October 1, 1996, that:\n\n       The general outline of the Administration's plan smacks of \n     the government trying to control the marketplace for high-\n     tech products. Only those companies that agree to turn over \n     their business plans to the government and show that they are \n     developing key recovery systems, will be rewarded with \n     permission to sell abroad products with DES encryption, which \n     is the global encryption standard.\n\n  The Administration announced yesterday that it is finally fixing this \naspect of its encryption policy. New Administration guidelines will \npermit the export of 56-bit DES encryption without a license, after a \none time technical review, to all users outside the seven terrorist \ncountries. No longer will the Administration require businesses to turn \nover business plans and make promises to build key recoverable products \nfor the freedom to export 56-bit DES.\n  In 1996, I also raised serious questions about the Administration's \nproposal to pull the plug on 56-bit DES exports in two years. I warned \nat the time that this ``sunset'' provision ``does not promote our high-\ntech industries overseas.'' I specifically asked,\n\n       Does this mean that U.S. companies selling sophisticated \n     computer systems with DES encryption overseas must warn their \n     customers that the supply may end in two years? Customers \n     both here and abroad want stable suppliers, not those jerked \n     around by their government.\n\n  I am pleased that the Administration has also changed this aspect of \nits policy and adopted an export policy with no ``sunset.'' Instead, \nthe Administration will conduct a review of its policy in one year to \ndetermine how well it is working.\n  Indeed, while 56-bit encryption may still serve as the global \nstandard, this will not be the situation for much longer. 128-bit \nencryption is now the preferred encryption strength.\n  In fact, to access online account information from the Thrift Savings \nPlan for Federal Employees, Members and congressional staff must use \n128-bit encryption. If you use weaker encryption, a screen pops up to \nsay ``you cannot have access to your account information because your \nWeb browser does not have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128-bit \nencryption (the strong U.S./Canada-only version).''\n  Likewise, the Department of Education has set up a Web site that \nallows prospective students to apply for student financial aid online. \nSignificantly, the Education Department states that ``[t]o achieve \nmaximum protection we recommend you use 128-bit encryption.''\n  These are just a couple examples of government agencies or associated \norganizations directing or urging Americans to use 128-bit encryption. \nWe should assume that people in other countries are getting the same \ndirections and recommendations. Unfortunately, while American companies \ncan fill the demand for this strong encryption here, they will still \nnot be permitted to sell this strength encryption abroad for use by \npeople in other countries.\n  Nevertheless, the Administration's new encryption policy announced \ntoday moves in the right direction to bolster the competitive edge of \nour Nation's high-tech companies, allow American companies to protect \ntheir confidential and trade secret information and intellectual \nproperty in communications with subsidiaries abroad, and promote global \nelectronic commerce. These are objectives I have sought to achieve in \nencryption legislation that I have introduced and cosponsored with \nbipartisan support in this and the last Congress.\n  I remain concerned, however, that privacy safeguards and standards \nfor law enforcement access to decryption assistance are ignored in the \nAdministration's new policy. These are critical issues that continue to \nrequire our attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10515-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10515-S10517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 158\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on developments concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 of March 15, 1995, and matters relating to the measures in \nthat order and in Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, and in \nExecutive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997. This report is submitted \npursuant to section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA), section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 505(c) of the \nInternational Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 \nU.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 and does not deal with those relating to the emergency \ndeclared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the hostage crisis.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12957 (60 Fed. Reg. \n14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with respect to \nIran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, management, or \nsupervision by United States persons of the development of Iranian \npetroleum resources. This action was in response to actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. A copy of the Order was provided to the Speaker of the House and \nthe President of the Senate by letter dated March 15, 1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 (60 Fed. \nReg. 24757, May 9, 1995) to further respond to the Iranian threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. The terms of that order and an earlier order imposing an import \nban on Iranian-origin goods and services (Executive Order 12613 of \nOctober 29, 1987) were consolidated and clarified in Executive Order \n13059 of August 19. 1997.\n  At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to authorize through specific licensing \ncertain transactions, including transactions by United States persons \nrelated to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, \nestablished pursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other \ninternational obligations and U.S. Government functions, and \ntransactions related to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant \nto preexisting contracts consistent with section 5712(c) of title 7, \nUnited States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing \nUnited States persons through specific licensing to participate in \nmarket-based swaps of crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian \ncrude oil in support of energy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and \nTurkmenistan.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n  Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A \ncopy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Congressional \nleadership by letter dated May 6, 1995.\n  2. On August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13059 in order to \nclarify the steps taken in Executive Order 12957 and Executive Order \n12959, to confirm that the embargo on Iran prohibits all trade and \ninvestment activities by United States persons, wherever located, and \nto consolidate in one order the various prohibitions previously imposed \nto deal with the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995. A copy \nof the Order was transmitted to the Speaker of the House and the \nPresident of the Senate by letter dated August 19, 1997.\n\n  The Order prohibits (1) the importation into the United States of any \ngoods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran except information or informational material; (2) \nthe exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States \nor by a United States person, wherever located, of goods, technology, \nor services to Iran or the government of Iran, including knowing \ntransfers to a third country for direct or indirect supply, \ntransshipment, or reexportation to Iran or the Government of Iran, or \nspecifically for use in the production, commingling with, or \nincorporation into goods, technology, or services to be supplied, \ntransshipped, or reexported exclusively or predomininatly to Iran or \nthe Government of Iran; (3) knowing reexportation from a third country \nto Iran or the Government of Iran of certain controlled U.S.-origin \ngoods, technology, or services by a person other than a United States \nperson; (4) the purchase, sale, transport, swap, brokerage, approval, \nfinancing, facilitation, guarantee, or other transactions or dealings \nby United States persons, wherever located, related to goods, \ntechnology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, \ndirectly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran, or to goods \nor services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government \nof Iran; (5) new investment by United States persons in Iran or in \nproperty or entities owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (6) \napproval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States \nperson of any transaction by a foreign person that a United States \nperson would be prohibited from performing under the terms of the \nOrder; and (7) any transaction that evades, avoids, or attempts to \nviolate a prohibition under the Order.\n  Executive Order 13059 became effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern \ndaylight time on August 20, 1997. Because the Order consolidated and \nclarified the provisions of prior orders, Executive Order 12613 and \nparagraph (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of section 1 of Executive Order \n12959 were revoked by Executive Order 13059. The revocation of \ncorresponding provisions in the prior Executive orders did not affect \nthe applicability of those provisions, or of regulations, licenses or \nother administrative actions taken pursuant to those provisions, with \nrespect to any transaction or violation occurring before the effective \ndate of Executive Order 13059. Specific licenses issued pursuant to \nprior Executive orders continue in effect, unless revoked or amended by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. General licenses, regulations, orders, \nand directives issued pursuant to prior orders continue in effect, \nexcept to the extent inconsistent with Executive Order 13059 or \notherwise revoked or modified by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The declaration of national emergency made by Executive Order 12957, \nand renewed each year since, remains in effect and is not affected by \nthe Order.\n  3. On March 4, 1998, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended \nthe authority for the current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran \nin effect since May 1995. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade \nwith Iran is prohibited except for trade in information and \ninformational materials and certain other limited exceptions.\n  4. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 560 (the ``ITR''), since my report of March \n16, 1998.\n  5. During the current 6-month period, the Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) made numerous \ndecisions with respect to applications for licenses to engage in \ntransactions under the ITR, and issued 12 licenses.\n\n  The majority of denials were in response to requests to authorize \ncommercial exports to Iran--particularly of machinery and equipment for \nvarious industries--and the importation of Iranian-origin goods. The \nlicenses that were issued authorized certain financial transactions and \ntransactions relating to air safety policy. Pursuant to sections 3 and \n4 of Executive Order 12959, Executive Order 13059, and consistent with \nstatutory restrictions concerning certain goods and technology, \nincluding those involved in air safety cases, the Department of the \nTreasury continues to consult with the Departments of State and \nCommerce on these matters.\n  Since the issuance of Executive Order 13059, more than 1,500 \ntransactions involving Iran initially have been ``rejected'' by U.S. \nfinancial institutions under IEEPA and the ITR. United States banks \ndeclined to process these transactions in the absence of OFAC \nauthorization. Twenty percent of the 1,500 transactions scrutinized by \nOFAC resulted in investigations by OFAC to assure compliance with IEEPA \nand ITR by United States persons.\n  Such investigations resulted in 15 referrals for civil penalty \naction, issuance of 5 warning letters, and an additional 52 cases still \nunder compliance or legal review prior to final agency action.\n  Since my last report, OFAC has collected 20 civil monetary penalties \ntotaling more than $110,000 for violations of IEEPA and the ITR related \nto the import or export to Iran of goods and services. Five U.S. \nfinancial institutions, twelve companies, and three individuals paid \npenalties for these prohibited transactions. Civil penalty action is \npending against another 45 United States persons for violations of the \nITR.\n  6. On January 22, 1997, an Iranian national resident in Oregon and a \nU.S. citizen were indicted on charges related to the attempted \nexportation to Iran of spare parts for gas turbines and precursor \nagents utilized in the production of nerve gas. The 5-week trial of the \nAmerican citizen defendant, which began in early February 1998, \nresulted in his conviction on all counts. That defendant is awaiting \nsentencing. The other defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal \nconspiracy and was sentenced to 21 months in prison.\n  On March 24, 1998, a Federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, \nreturned an indictment against a U.S. national and an Iranian-born \nresident of Singapore for violation of IEEPA and the ITR relating to \nexportation of munitions, helicopters, and weapons systems components \nto Iran. Among the merchandise the defendants conspired to export were \nparts for Phoenix air-to-air missiles used on F-14A fighter jets in \nIran. Trial is scheduled to begin on October 6, 1998.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures to \nIranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the \nimport prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried \nover from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \nviolations are being aggressively pursued.\n  7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 15 through September 14, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are reported \nto be approximately $1.7 million, most of which represent wage and \nsalary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely \ncentered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office \nof Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the \nUnder Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General \nCounsel); the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic \nand Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research, and the Office of the Legal Adviser); and \nthe Department of Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the \nGeneral Counsel's Office).\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\n  8. The situation reviewed above continues to present an extraordinary \nand unusual threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States. The declaration of the national emergency \nwith respect to Iran contained in Executive Order 12957 and the \ncomprehensive economic sanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 \nunderscore the Government's opposition to the actions and policies of \nthe Government of Iran, particularly its support of international \nterrorism and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and \nthe means to deliver them. The Iranian Transactions Regulations issued \npursuant to Executive Orders 12957, 12959, and 13059 continue to \nadvance import objectives in promoting the nonproliferation and anti-\nterrorism policies of the United States. I shall exercise the powers at \nmy disposal to deal with these problems and will report periodically to \nthe Congress on significant developments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 and the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish and \nimprove programs to increase the availability of quality child care, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                         child development act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, right now in our country there are \nabout 10 million children--of course, when I talk about children, I am \ntalking about their parents as well--who are eligible for good \ndevelopmental child care opportunities. As it turns out, we provide \nassistance to 1.4 million out of this 10 million. In other words, fully \n86 percent of children who are eligible to receive some assistance so \nthat they will get better child care in those critical early years \nreceive no assistance at all.\n  I introduce today this piece of legislation, which I have called the \nChild Development Act. I have been working on it for the last year and \na half. Altogether, over the next 5 years, it calls for $62 billion, \nabout $12 billion--less than 1 percent of the budget--to be invested in \nthe health, skills, intellect and character of our children.\n  About $37.5 billion just increases funding for the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Program (CCDBG), which has been a proven \nsuccess in providing more money so that we can expand child care in our \nStates and provide help to many working families that need this help.\n  In addition, the bill provides funding for improving afterschool \nprograms. We have funds that are set aside to improve the quality of \nchild care. Children Defense Fund studies have shown that six out of \nseven child care facilities in this country provide only poor-to-\nmediocre service, and one out of eight centers actually put children at \nrisk.\n  There is additional funding for professional training, for new \nconstruction, and I say to my colleagues, there is also funding for \nloan forgiveness, which is the effort that I have been working on with \nmy colleague, Senator DeWine from Ohio, so that those men and women who \ndo their undergraduate work and receive training in early childhood \ndevelopment, where the wages are so low, at least will receive loan \nforgiveness which will help them. Finally, there is some $13 billion in \ntax credits for low- and middle-income working parents to help them \nafford child care.\n  Research has shown that much of what happens in life depends upon the \nfirst three years of development. The brain is so profoundly influenced \nduring this time that the brain of a three-year-old has twice as many \nsynapses (connections between brain cells) as that of her adult \nparents. The process of brain development is actually one of \n``pruning'' out the synapses that one does not need (or more \naccurately, does not use) from those that become the brains standard \n``wiring.'' This is why the first three years of development are so \nimportant--this is the time that the brain must develop the wiring that \nis going to be used for the rest of one's life. According to a report \non brain development published by the Families and Work Institute, \n``Early care and nurture have a decisive, long lasting impact on how \npeople develop, their ability to learn, and their capacity to control \ntheir own emotions.'' If children do not receive proper care before the \nage of three, they never receive the chance to develop into fully \nfunctioning adults.\n  We are not allowing our children a chance in life when we do not \nprovide them with proper care in their early years. If America is to \nachieve its goal of equal opportunity for our children, we need to \nstart with proper care in their early years. It is a painful statistic \nthen that our youngest citizens are also some of the poorest Americans. \nOne out of every four of our country's 12 million children under the \nage of three live in poverty. It becomes very difficult to break out of \nthe cycle of poverty if poor children are not allowed to develop into \nfully functioning adults.\n  Yet many parents in America do not have the option of providing \nadequate care for their children. For parents who can barely afford \nrent it is nearly impossible to take advantage of the Family Medical \nLeave Act, and sacrifice 12 weeks of pay in order to directly supervise \na child. Many mothers need to return to work shortly after giving birth \nand find that the only options open to them are to place their children \nin care that is substandard, even potentially dangerous--but \naffordable. According to the Children's Defense Fund, six out of seven \nchild care centers provide only poor to mediocre care, and one in eight \ncenters provide care that could jeopardize children's safety and \ndevelopment. The same study said that one in three home-based care \nsituations could be harmful to a child's development. How can we abide \nby these statistics?\n  This is a serious problem, and frighteningly widespread. The \neligibility levels set for receiving child care aid through the federal \nChild Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is 85 percent of a \nstate's median income. Nationally, this comes out to about $35,000 for \na family of three in 1998. However, according to the Children's defense \nfund, fully half of all families with young children earn less than \n$35,000 per year. Half! A family that has two parents working full time \nat minimum wage earns only $21,400 per year. This is not nearly enough \nto even dream of adequate child care.\n  Child care costs in the United States for one child in full day care \nrange from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. It is not surprising that, on \naverage, families with incomes under $15,000 a year spend 23 percent of \ntheir annual incomes on child care. And in West Virginia, if a family \nof three makes more than that $15,000, they no longer qualify for child \ncare aid! In fact, thirty-two states do not allow a family of three \nwhich earns $25,000 a year (approximately 185 percent of poverty) to \nqualify for help. Only four states in our nation set eligibility cut \noffs for receiving child care assistance at 85 percent of median family \nincome, the maximum allowed by federal law. There is obviously not \nenough funding to support the huge need for child care assistance in \nour nation, and that is why I am proposing the Child Care Development \nAct.\n  There is widespread support for expanded investments to improve the \naffordability and quality of child care. A recent survey of 550 police \nchiefs found that nine out of ten police chiefs surveyed agreed that \n``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in \nprograms to help children and youth get a good start'' such as Head \nStart and child care. Mayors across the country identified child care, \nmore than any other issue, as one of the most pressing issues facing \nchildren and families in their communities in 1996 survey. A recent \npoll found that a bipartisan majority of those polled\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nsupport increased investments in helping families pay for child care--\nspecifically, 74% of those polled favor a bill to help low-income and \nmiddle-class families pay for child care, including 79% of Democrats, \n69% of Republicans, and 76% of Independents.\n  It is clear that many like to talk about supporting our children, and \nmany are in favor of supporting our children, but what action is \nactually taken? Yes, the addition of new child care dollars in 1996 has \nhelped welfare recipients, but it has done nothing for working, low-\nincome families not receiving TANF. The Children's Defense Fund \nrecommends that Congress pass comprehensive legislation that guarantees \nat least $20 billion over five years in new funding for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant (CCDBG). My Child Care Development Act goes \nbeyond this, yet even my bill is just a first step. This bill is \ndesigned to provide affordable, quality child care to half of the ten \nmillion American children presently in need of subsidized care. It will \nprovide $62.5 billion over 5 years--$12.5 billion a year--nearly three \ntimes the amount proposed in the President's most ambitious, and still \nunprosecuted, proposal. In 1997 the President proposed extending care \nto 600,000 children from poor families, leaving fully 80% of eligible \nchildren without aid. That was the last we heard of it. And it wasn't \ngood enough, anyway.\n  If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting \nchildren, we need to invest more in families and in child care help for \nthem. Enabling families to work and helping children thrive means \ngiving states enough money so that they can set reasonable eligibility \nlevels, let families know that help is available, and take working \nfamilies off the waiting lists.\n  The Child Care Development Act will require $62.5 billion over five \nyears. There will be several offsets necessary if we are serious about \ngiving children in this country the type of care they need and deserve. \nShifting spending from these offsets demonstrates that our true \nnational priority is children, not wasteful military spending and \ncorporate tax loopholes.\n  The offsets that will be necessary are as follows. If we repeal the \nreductions in the Corporate Minimum Tax from the 1997 Budget Bill, we \ncreate $8.2 billion. The elimination of the Special Oil and Gas \nDepletion Allowance will make room for and additional $4.3 billion. An \noffset of $.575 billion will come from a repeal of the Enhanced Oil \nRecovery Credit and an offset of $13.767 billion will come from the \nelimination of exclusion for Foreign-Earned Income. From these four \ndifferent offsets in tax provisions a sub total amount of $26.835 is \ncreated to spend on child care.\n  Defense Cuts will also be necessary in the amount of $24.4 billion. \nThis will come from canceling the F-22, a plane plagued with troubles, \nwhich will free up $19.29 billion, and $5.11 billion will come from a \nreduction in Nuclear Delivery Systems Within Overall Limits of START \nII.\n  The remaining offsets can be made by reducing the Intelligence Budget \nby 5 percent, which would save $6.675 billion; by reducing Military \nExport Subsidies by $.85 billion; and by canceling the International \nSpace Station, which costs $10.045 billion. All of which, when added \ntogether, allows for an additional $68.805 billion to be used to \nsupport our children.\n  This is, finally, a child care bill on the same scope as the problem \nitself. We as a nation are neglecting the most vulnerable and important \nportion of our society--our children. Here is an ambitious solution to \nthis vast problem that has been plaguing our country. So that we don't \nhave to be a country that just talks about putting our children first.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit from the heart. We are \nnow at a point in our session where we have maybe 2\\1/2\\, 3 weeks to \ngo. I think it is a tragedy that, in many ways, we are not involved in \nthe work of democracy. From my point of view as a Senator from \nMinnesota, the work of democracy is to try to respond and speak to the \nconcerns and circumstances of people's lives.\n  As I travel around Minnesota and travel around the country, I believe \nthat, more than anything else, what families are saying to us is, ``We \nwant to do our very best by our kids, because if we as parents,'' or a \nsingle parent, ``can do our best by our kids, we will do our best by \nour country.''\n  One of the reasons we--I am talking about the people now in the \ncountry--are so disillusioned about our political process, above and \nbeyond all that they hear about every day, which I hate, is that all \nthat is happening is no good for our country. I think the polls show \nthis as well, people are saying, ``Get on with your governing, too; \nplease govern; please be relevant and important to our lives.'' People \nfeel like we are not doing that.\n  I have to say that if we can respond to what most people are talking \nabout, which is how we earn a decent living and how do we give our \nchildren the care we know they need and deserve, we will be doing well \nby people. If we can do everything that we can do as Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and if the private sector plays its role and \nwe also engage in voluntarism and a lot of good things happen at the \ncommunity level and non-Government organizations, and nonprofits play \ntheir role, and I say to Rabbi Shemtov, our guest chaplain today, the \nreligious community needs to play their role: if we all do everything \nwe can to enable parents or a parent to do their best by their kids, \nthen that is the best single thing we can do.\n  What saddens me and also angers me is that all of a sudden, the focus \non children is just off the table. We have lost it. It wasn't that many \nmonths ago that we were having conferences and we were talking about \nreports that were coming out and we couldn't stop discussing the \ndevelopment of the brain; how important it is to make sure that we get \nit right for our children because by age 3, if we don't get it right \nfor them, they are never going to be ready for school and never be \nready for life.\n  What happened? What happened to our focus? We have lost our focus. We \nhave lost our way. We are talking a lot about values, and we are \ntalking a lot about moral issues and we should--we should. But isn't it \nalso a moral question or a moral issue that one out of every four \nchildren under the age of 3 is growing up poor in America today, and \none out of every three children of color under the age of 3 is growing \nup poor in America today?\n  With our economy still humming along, how can it be that we cannot do \nbetter? I don't understand that. I say to the Rabbi and Chaplain, in \nthe words of Rabbi Hillel, ``If not now, when?''\n  Here we are with 3 weeks to go to this Congress, and we haven't done \nanything to help families, to help children, to fill their void so that \nwe make sure that every child who comes to kindergarten comes to \nkindergarten ready to learn. If we are going to talk about education, \nand we are going to have a discussion about education--maybe we won't \non the present course--I think we have to focus on the learning gap.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, we do quite well for kids in our public \nschools if they come to kindergarten ready to learn. It is the kids who \ncome to kindergarten not ready to learn for whom we don't do well.\n  I am not trying to take K-12 off the hook. We need to do much better. \nBut couldn't we say that as a national goal we want to make sure that \nevery child who comes to kindergarten comes to kindergarten ready to \nlearn? So that she knows the alphabet. He knows colors and shapes and \nsizes. She knows how to spell her name. They have been read to widely \nand they come with the readiness to learn.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator DeWine, is as committed to children as \nany Senator in the Senate. He knows what I am saying.\n  This is a cost-neutral bill. I will not go on about this bill's \noffsets. I cut into some tax loopholes and some subsidies that go to \nsome of the largest corporations in America that do not need it. I \nraise some questions about whether we need some additional missiles and \nadditional bombers. I redefine national security, and say, yes, we need \na strong defense, but we need to take some of the money and invest for \nchildren. People can agree or disagree about where I get the money for \nthis. Can't we agree that we take 1 percent of our budget and invest it \nin the\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nhealth and skills and character and intellect of our children? They are \n100 percent of our future.\n  I must repeat this point. I cannot believe that not that many months \nago we were all talking about development of the brain, early childhood \ndevelopment. We were all talking about legislation--we were all talking \nabout how we were going to do something to help parents do better by \ntheir kids, and we are not doing that.\n  That is why I introduce this legislation today. I do not think it is \na cry in the wilderness, because I hope next year we are going to get \nthis bill enacted. I am going to fight for this. And maybe, if I have a \nchance--I don't know that I will, given the next 3 weeks--I will bring \nsome of it up as amendments. But we have to start speaking out about \nthis, Mr. President. I say to Senator DeWine, the Presiding Officer, we \nhave to start speaking out about this because we should be doing \nbetter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 2490. A bill to prohibit postsecondary educational institutions \nfrom requiring the purchase of goods and services from on-campus \nbusinesses, intentionally withholding course information from off-\ncampus businesses, or preventing students from obtaining course \ninformation or materials from off-campus businesses; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the college costs savings act of 1998\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this fall millions of college \nstudents are returning to campus. Today I introduce legislation that \nwill ease the financial burden for these students, and reduce the costs \nof student financial aid on the taxpayers.\n  My bill seeks to inject some good, old-fashioned competition in the \nmarket for the purchase of college textbooks. Every student knows that \nthe costs of textbooks can run into hundreds of dollars. It has become \na major expense for most college students. My bill would bar financial \naid to any university or any student attending a university that, \ndirectly or indirectly, requires students to purchase textbooks \nexclusively on campus. Further, the legislation would require that non-\ncampus businesses have reasonable access to the textbook requirements \nof college courses, so that they too could stock textbooks and have \nthem available to students at a more competitive price.\n  Regrettably, the way aid is currently disbursed by the Department of \nEducation is artificially raising costs for students throughout the \ncountry. There is a nationwide use of financial aid to, in effect, \nchannel funds exclusively to college ``business-like'' enterprises. \nThese funding methods prevent financial aid from being spent at small \nbusinesses attempting to compete in the campus area marketplace.\n  Through the use of Department of Education-permitted ``student \naccounts,'' colleges are creating their own dominance in such areas as \ncollege bookstores. Off-campus choice is virtually unavailable, even if \noff-campus stores offer students a less-expensive alternative. With the \ndevelopment of ``campus cards,'' aid is even more captive to the on-\ncampus economy.\n  I raised this issue with Secretary Riley at a hearing this spring and \nthrough a subsequent letter. The Department claims such distribution of \naid funds is voluntary. The Department of Education stated in its June \n22nd response that off-campus businesses can accept these campus cards \nonly if an institution ``wishes to establish a business relationship \nwith an off-campus business.'' In most cases, that is not their wish. \nIn most cases, only on-campus enterprises benefit. The Congress never \nintended financial aid funds--or any other funds--to be used for \npurposes of monopolization on college campuses. Competition in the \ncampus-area marketplace is being restricted--and in many cases--\neliminated. Students have little to no choice in shopping for books and \nmaterials.\n  The net result is that students are often paying higher costs for \nthese goods and services, like textbooks. And, the federal government, \nproviding student aid, is paying the higher price too.\n  There isn't a college student in this country that does not think \nthat textbooks cost too much. Buying course books has become a major \nexpense for the vast majority of students.\n  Evidence shows that off-campus bookstores are generally less-\nexpensive if students receiving financial aid had full access to them. \nA recent report of the National Association of College Stores \n(``NACS'') reports that each student spends an average of $300 for new \ntextbooks at an on-campus bookstore compared with less than $200 for \ntextbook purchases at an off-campus bookstore.\n  Additionally, another unfair practice that I have been informed about \nis that some institutions refuse or obstruct access by off-campus \ncollege bookstores to the titles of textbooks required by the teaching \nstaff. This legislation addresses both of these problems.\n  Further, I believe we should be taking any reasonable steps that we \ncan to reduce the cost of attending college. A 1998 Congressional \nCommission on the Cost of Higher Education Report tells us that America \nhas a ``college cost crisis.'' It found that 71 percent of the public \nbelieves that a four-year education is not affordable for most \nAmericans. Clearly, people are concerned about the ever-growing costs \nof higher education.\n  This legislation could save every student hundreds of dollars a year \nin college costs, if we can promote greater free market competition in \nthe sale of college textbooks. As for financial aid, if this \nlegislation can only save one percent of the amount that is spent on \nfinancial aid, it would approximate a $500 million savings.\n  Clearly parents, students and the federal government could use this \nkind of financial relief. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2491. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \nchildren from sexual abuse and exploitation, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce S. 2491 the \nHatch-Leahy-DeWine ``Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act \nof 1998.'' I want to especially thank Senators Leahy and DeWine for \ntheir cooperation in drafting this exemplary piece of legislation. S. \n2491 strengthens the ability of law enforcement and the courts to \nrespond to high-tech sexual predators of children. Pedophiles who roam \nthe Internet, purveyors of child pornography, and serial child \nmolesters are specifically targeted.\n  The Internet is a wonderful creation. By allowing for instant \ncommunication around the globe, it has made the world a smaller place, \na place in which people can express their thoughts and ideas without \nlimitation. It has released the creative energies of a new generation \nof entrepreneurs and it is an unparalleled source of information.\n  While we should encourage people to take full advantage of the \nopportunities the Internet has to offer, we must also be vigilant in \nseeking to ensure that the Internet is not perverted into a hunting \nground for pedophiles and other sexual predators, and a drive-through \nlibrary and post office for purveyors of child pornography. Our \nchildren must be protected from those who would choose to sexually \nabuse and exploit them. And those who take the path of predation should \nknow that the consequences of their actions will be severe and \nunforgiving.\n  How does this bill provide additional protection for our children? By \nprohibiting the libidinous dissemination on the Internet of information \nrelated to minors and the sending of obscene material to minors, we \nmake it more difficult for sexual predators to gather information on, \nand lower the sexual inhibitions of, potential targets. And by \nrequiring electronic communication service providers to report the \ncommission of child pornography offenses to authorities, we mandate \naccountability and responsibility on the Internet.\n  Additionally, law enforcement is given effective tools to pursue \nsexual predators. The Attorney General is provided with authority to \nissue administrative subpoenas in child pornography cases. Proceeds \nderived from these offenses, and the facilities and instrumentalities \nused to perpetuate these offenses, will be subject to forfeiture. And \nprosecutors will now have the power to seek pretrial detention of \nsexual predators prior to trial.\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\n  Federal law enforcement will be given increased statutory authority \nto assist the States in kidnaping and serial murder investigations, \nwhich often involve children. In that vein, S. 2491 calls for the \ncreation of the Morgan P. Hardiman Child Abduction and Serial Murder \nInvestigative Resources Center. That center will gather information, \nexpertise and resources that our nation's law enforcement agencies can \ndraw upon to help combat these heinous crimes.\n  Sentences for child abuse and exploitation offenses will be made \ntougher. In addition to increasing the maximum penalties available for \nmany crimes against children and mandating tough sentences for repeat \noffenders, the bill will also recommend that the Sentencing Commission \nreevaluate the guidelines applicable to these offenses, and increase \nthem where appropriate to address the egregiousness of these crimes. \nAnd S. 2491 calls for life imprisonment in appropriate cases where \ncertain crimes result in the death of children.\n  Protection of our children is not a partisan issue. We have drawn \nupon the collective wisdom of Senators from both sides of the aisle to \ndraft a bill which includes strong, effective legislation protecting \nchildren. I call upon my colleagues to support this bill and speed its \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nedition of the Record.]\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know everyone is concerned about \nprotecting this country's children from those who would prey upon them. \nThose concerns have intensified in recent years with the growing \npopularity of the internet and the world wide web. Cyberspace gives \nusers access to a wealth of information; it connects people from around \nthe world. But it also creates new opportunities for sexual predators \nand child pornographers to ply their trade. The challenge is to protect \nour children from exploitation in cyberspace while ensuring that the \nvast democratic forum of the Internet remains an engine for the free \nexchange of ideas and information.\n  The bill that we are introducing today meets this challenge. While it \nis not a cure-all for the scourge of child pornography, it is a good \nstep toward limiting the ability of cyber-pornographers and predators \nfrom harming children.\n  This bill differs markedly from H.R. 3494, the child protection and \nsexual predator bill that the House passed last June. I should note \nthat this bill mirrors a Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute to H.R. 3494, \nwhich passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent this \nafternoon.\n  I thank the Chairman for working with me to fix the many problems in \nH.R. 3494, and to make this bill more focused and measured. Briefly, I \nwould like to highlight and explain some of the differences between the \nbills.\n  As passed by the House, H.R. 3494 would make it a crime, punishable \nby up to 5 years' imprisonment, to do nothing more than ``contact'' a \nminor, or even just attempt to ``contact'' a minor, for the purpose of \nengaging in sexual activity. This provision does not appear in the \nHatch-Leahy-DeWine bill. The act of making contact is not very far \nalong the spectrum of an overt criminal act: it is only the expression \nof a criminal intention without follow through. A simple ``hello'' in \nan internet chat room, coupled with bad intentions, would expose the \nspeaker to severe criminal sanctions. Targeting ``attempts'' to make \ncontact would be even more like prosecuting a thought crime.\n  Another new crime created by the House bill prohibited the \ntransmittal of identifying information about any person under 18 for \nthe purpose of encouraging unlawful sexual activity. In its original \nincarnation, this provision would have had the absurd result of \nprohibiting a person under the age of consent from e-mailing her own \naddress or telephone number to her boyfriend. We fixed this problem by \nmaking it clear that a violation must involve the transmission of \nsomeone else's identifying information. In addition, to eliminate any \nnotice problem arising from the variations in state statutory rape \nlaws, we lowered the age of the identified minor from 18 to 16--the \nfederal age of consent. Finally, we clarified that the defendant must \nknow that the person about whom he was transmitting identifying \ninformation was, in fact, under 16. This change was particularly \nimportant because, in the anonymous world of cyberspace, a person may \nhave no way of knowing the age of the faceless person with whom he is \ncommunicating.\n  I had many of the same concerns regarding another provision of the \nHouse bill, which makes it a crime to transfer obscene material to a \nminor. Again, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill lowers the age of minority \nfrom 18 to 16 and provides that the defendant must know he is dealing \nwith someone so young. I would add that this provision of the bill \napplies only to ``obscene'' material, that is, material that enjoys no \nFirst Amendment protection whatever--material that is patently \noffensive to the average adult. The bill does not purport to proscribe \nthe transferral of constitutionally protected material that may, \nhowever, be unsuitable for minors. Besides raising serious \nconstitutional concerns, such a provision would also have the \nunacceptable consequence of reducing the level of discourse over the \nInternet to what would be suitable for a sandbox.\n  The original House bill would also have criminalized certain conduct \ndirected at a person who had been ``represented'' to be a minor, even \nif that person was, in fact, an adult. The evident purpose was to make \nclear that the targets of sting operations are not relieved of criminal \nliability merely because their intended victim turned out to be an \nundercover agent and not a child. The new ``sting'' provisions \naddressed a problem that simply does not currently exist: no court has \never endorsed an impossibility defense along the lines anticipated by \nthe House bill. The creation of special ``sting'' provisions in this \none area could lend credence to impossibility defenses raised in other \nsting and undercover situations. At the same time, these provisions \nwould have criminalized conduct that was otherwise lawful: it is not a \ncrime for adults to communicate with each other about sex, even if one \nof the adults pretends to be a child. Given these significant concerns, \nthe ``sting'' provisions have been stricken from the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine \nbill.\n  Another major problem with the House bill is its modification of the \nchild pornography possession laws. Current law requires possession of \nthree or more pornographic images in order for there to be criminal \nliability. Congress wrote this requirement into the law as a way of \nprotecting against government overreaching. By eliminating this numeric \nrequirement, the House bill puts at risk the unsuspecting Internet user \nwho, by inadvertence or mistake, downloads a single pornographic image \nof a child. The inevitable result would be to chill the free exchange \nof information over the web. I was unwilling to accept this \npossibility; the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill keeps current law in place.\n  Unlike H.R. 3494, the bill we are introducing today contains no new \nmandatory minimum sentences. I oppose the use of mandatory minimums \nbecause they take away the discretion of the sentencing judge, which \ncan result in unjust sentences and can also induce defendants who would \notherwise have pled guilty, hoping to obtain some measure of leniency \nfrom the court, to proceed to trial.\n  Another problematic provision of the House bill gives the Attorney \nGeneral sweeping authority to subpoena records and witnesses in \ninvestigations involving crimes against children. We should be \nextremely wary of further extending the Justice Department's \nadministrative subpoena power. The use of administrative subpoenas \ngives federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any \noversight by a judge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the \ngrand jury secrecy requirements. That being said, the secrecy \nrequirements may pose a significant obstacle to the full and efficient \ncooperation of federal/state task forces in their joint efforts to \nreduce the steadily increasing use of the Internet to perpetrate crimes \nagainst children, including crimes involving the distribution of child \npornography.\n  In addition, it appears that some U.S. Attorneys Offices are \nreluctant to open\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\na grand jury investigation when the only goal is to identify \nindividuals who have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as \nopposed to state or local) offense. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill \naccommodates all the competing interests by granting the Department a \nnarrowly drawn authority to subpoena only the information that it most \nneeds: routine subscriber account information from Internet service \nproviders. Importantly, subscribers may obtain notice from their \nservice provider.\n  The new reporting requirement established by H.R. 3494 is also \ntroubling. Under current law, Internet service providers are generally \nfree to report suspicious communications to law enforcement \nauthorities. Under H.R. 3494, service providers would be required to \nreport such communications when they involve child pornography; failure \nto do so would be punishable by a substantial fine.\n  Of course, we are all committed to eradicating the market for child \npornography. Child pornography is inherently harmful to children. \nService providers that come across such material should report it, and, \nin most cases, they already do. We must tread cautiously, however, \nbefore we compel private citizens to act as good Samaritans or to \nassume duties and responsibilities that are better left to law \nenforcement.\n  Working with the service providers, we have refined the House bill in \nvarious ways.\n  First, we raised the bar for the reporting duty; a service provider \nhas no obligation to make a report unless it has ``probable cause'' to \nbelieve that the child pornography laws are being violated. By setting \nsuch a high standard, we intended to discourage service providers from \nerring on the side of over-reporting every questionable image. This \nwould also overwhelm the FBI and law enforcement agencies.\n  Second, we provided that there is no liability for failing to make a \nreport unless the service provider knew both of the existence of child \npornography and of the duty to report it (if it rises to the level of \nprobable cause).\n  Third, we made clear that we are not imposing a monitoring \nrequirement of any kind: service providers must report child \npornography when they come across it or it is brought to their \nattention, but they remain under no obligation to go out looking for \nit.\n  Fourth, we added privacy protections for any information reported \nunder the bill.\n  Fifth, we lowered the maximum fine for first offenders to $50,000; a \nsecond or subsequent failure to report, however, may still result in a \nfine up to $100,000.\n  Thus improved, I am confident that the reporting requirement will \naccomplish its objectives without unduly burdening the service \nproviders or violating the privacy rights of internet users.\n  Beyond this, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill strips the House bill of \nvarious other extraneous or improvident provisions. Our bill is also \nfree of certain add-ons that appeared in the original version offered \nby Senator Hatch. In particular, the original version would have opened \nthe floodgates of federal inchoate crime prosecutions by creating a \ngeneral attempt statute--making it a crime to commit each and every \noffense in title 18--and by making the penalty for its violation as \nwell as for violation of the general conspiracy statute (which is now \ncapped at 5 years) equal to the penalty for the offense that was the \nobject of the attempt or conspiracy. The Chairman's original bill also \ncreated a new rule of criminal procedure requiring defendants to \nprovide notice of their intention to assert an entrapment defense.\n  I think there are good reasons why these ideas have been rejected in \nthe past, both by the Congress and by the Federal Judicial Conference, \nand why they are opposed by business and civil liberties groups alike. \nAt the very least, we should not usher in such radical changes to the \nfederal criminal law without more careful consideration, after proper \nhearings.\n  In conclusion, I commend Senators Hatch and DeWine for their efforts \nto address the terrible problem of child predators and pornographers. I \nam glad that we were able to join forces to construct a bill that goes \na long way towards achieving our common goals.\nMr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage at \nthe depraved criminals who are using the Internet to exploit children.\n  Recently, the United States Customs Service, in cooperation with \nauthorities in fourteen other nations, conducted successful raids on an \nextensive Internet child pornography ring. The ring, called the \nWonderland Club, had been distributing more than 100,000 pornographic \nphotographs of children. Some of the children were as young as 18 \nmonths. I am deeply disturbed, and disgusted, that people would \nvictimize innocent children in this way.\n  I want to commend the Customs Service and the other international law \nenforcement agencies involved on their successful effort. They made 46 \narrests worldwide and there may be hundreds more after all the evidence \nis analyzed. The raids also covered 22 states, including one location \nin my home state of New Jersey.\n  While this raid has put this one ring of Internet pedophiles out of \nbusiness, I am concerned that there may be others. Many law enforcement \nofficials are concerned that the advancements in Internet technology \nare making it that much easier for pedophiles to conduct their \nsickening schemes. Additionally, the anonymity of the Internet makes it \neasier for these criminals to evade detection.\n  Clearly, we must fight back against these cyberspace criminals. One \nstep that we can take is to ensure strong penalties for those who use \nthe Internet for these horrible purposes. That is why I support the \nChild Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. This \nmeasure would double the maximum penalty for sexual abuse of a child \nunder twelve--from ten years to twenty years. It would also increase \nthe prison terms and fines for anyone using the Internet, or the mail, \nto contact a minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity or \ntransferring obscene material.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I hope it will pass \nthe Senate before we adjourn this year. We must act quickly to help \nprevent another generation of children from suffering.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2492. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the long-term care insurance costs of all individuals who \nare not eligible to participate in employer-subsidized long-term care \nhealth plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               long-term care and retirement security act\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Long-Term Care \nand Retirement Security Act. This bill is an important first step in \nhelping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. A companion \nbill to the Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Nancy \nJohnson.\n  Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the \nprogress and advances made by our society. However, all Americans must \nbe alert and prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private \nlong-term care insurance is critical in meeting this challenge.\n  The financial challenges of health care in retirement are not new. \nIndeed, too many family caregivers can tell stories about financial \ndevastation that was brought about by the serious long-term care needs \nof a family member. Because increasing numbers of Americans are likely \nto need long term care services, it is especially important to \nencourage planning today.\n  Most families are not financially prepared when a loved one needs \nlong-term care. When faced with nursing home costs that can run more \nthan $40,000 a year, families often turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, \nMedicaid pays for nearly two of every three nursing home residents at a \ncost of more than $30 billion each year for nursing home costs. With \nthe impending retirement of the Baby Boomers, it is imperative that \nCongress takes steps now to encourage all Americans to plan ahead for \npotential long-term care needs.\n  The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act will allow Americans \nwho do not currently have access to employer subsidized long-term care \nplans to deduct the cost of such a plan from their taxable income. This \nbill will encourage planning and personal responsibility while helping \nto make long-\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\nterm care insurance more affordable for middle class taxpayers.\n  This measure will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare \nfor their own long term care needs by making insurance more affordable. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nedition of the Record.]\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nGrassley, to introduce legislation designed to protect our nation's \nfamilies hard-earned savings and ensure quality long-term care.\n  Our nation has achieved great strides in the 20th century in \ndelivering quality health care and improving the standards of living of \nits citizens. Just last year Congress added preventive benefits to the \nMedicare program, thereby ensuring that Americans will have longer, \nmore productive lives. In fact, thanks to these developments life \nexpectancy has increased from 47 years in 1900 to 68 years in 1950, and \nhas steadily increased to 76 years in 1991. These tremendous advances \nin medicine have also produced challenges because as more and more \npeople live longer, chances increase that they will experience chronic \nillnesses and disability.\n  A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As \na result, nearly half of all nursing home residents who enter as \nprivately-paying patients exhaust their personal savings and lose \nhealth insurance coverage during their stay. Medicaid becomes many \nretirees' last refuge of financial support.\n  Another challenge facing America in the future will be the aging of \nthe ``baby boomers.'' Unfortunately, many ``baby boomers'' are not \nplanning for the future because they are preoccupied with more \nimmediate concerns. This portion of our population represents more than \nhalf of all workers and are the parents of 75% of the nation's children \nunder age 18. Child care, housing expenses and saving for their \nchildren's college education tend to dominate their budgets.\n  Many Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare will pay for their \nlong-term care needs. ``Baby boomers'' need to understand the \nlimitations of government programs with regard to long-term care. In \nreality, this program primarily focuses on hospital stays and physician \nvisits. Without adequate private insurance a significant number of \nretirees are likely to deplete their assets in order to receive \nessential long-term care.\n  Insurance products are available to ensure that an individual's long-\nterm care needs are met. However, current tax law establishes several \nobstacles to purchasing long-term care insurance. First, most Americans \npurchase health insurance through their employer. Over sixty-five \npercent of 235 million individuals, under age 65, purchase their health \ninsurance through their employer or union. However, tax law prohibits \nan employer from offering employer subsidized long-term care insurance \nproducts through its employee benefits plans.\n  Since the enactment of the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation of 1996, \npurchasers of qualified long-term care insurance policies are permitted \nto deduct the premiums as part of their medical expenses. However, for \ntaxpayers other than the self-employed, the tax code restricts the \nmedical expense deduction to the portion of expenses exceeding 7.5 \npercent of their income--a threshold that bars the deduction for 95 \npercent of non-self employed people.\n\n  Kennedy-Kassebaum also precluded employees from purchasing long term \ncare insurance on a pre-tax basis through their employer. Specifically, \nthe legislation prohibited the inclusion of long-term care insurance in \nemployer-sponsored cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts. Only \nif the employer actually pays for the insurance can the employee obtain \nthe coverage on a tax-free basis, but few employers currently are \nwilling to pay for the coverage. The result is that only a small \npercentage of purchasers of long-term care insurance can obtain the \ninsurance on a pre-tax basis.\n  Second, long-term care insurance paid directly by the taxpayer is \nonly deductible if the individual both itemizes his or her deductions \nand already has deductible medical expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of \ntheir adjusted gross income.\n  Suppose Mr. and Ms. Jones earn $40,000 per year and want to purchase \nlong-term care insurance. Under current law, health and medical \nexpenses are not deductible unless they exceed 7.5 percent of $40,000, \nwhich is $3,000.\n  Suppose the premiums for long-term care insurance totaled $1,000. The \nJoneses would get no tax benefit from the deduction of the premiums \nunless they already had $2,000 in other qualified medical expenses, and \nwould not get the full benefit of the deduction unless they had $3,000 \nin other qualified expenses.\n  Even if they meet this threshold, the Joneses still will not benefit \nfrom the current deduction unless their total itemized deductions--\nhealth and non-health--exceed the standard deduction, currently $6,900 \nfor a married couple.\n  It becomes clear that the current deduction for log-term care \ninsurance premiums is not providing a very strong incentive to prepare \nfor one's health retirement. A recent survey shows that premium \ndeductibility was cited most frequently as the action that would make \nnon-buyers more interested in long-term care insurance.\n  Looking into the future, there are two key goals for retirement \nsecurity: (1) saving enough money for retirement, and (2) protecting \nagainst life's uncertainties, including long-term care costs. An \nunanticipated nursing home stay can deplete hard-earned savings and \nthreaten a family's financial future. This situation could be \nespecially difficult for the surviving spouse of someone who has had a \nlong-term care stay and depleted all of their retirement savings. The \nwidow or widower can have many years left to live and no remaining \nretirement assets.\n  A recent study by the American Council for Life Insurance indicates \nthat long-term care insurance has the potential to significantly reduce \nfuture out-of-pocket and Medicaid expenditures for long-term care. If \nindividuals are covered by long-term care insurance, they are less \nlikely to become Medicaid beneficiaries, thus preserving the \nindividual's savings and decreasing government spending. This would \nalso reinforce Medicaid's intent of serving as a safety net for those \nwho are most needy.\n  With the provisions in this legislation, Americans can be more \nassured of a financially secure retirement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2493. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for the nutrient management costs of animal feeding \noperations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      the animal agriculture environmental incentives act of 1998\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, recently we have seen growing \nconcerns around the country about the environmental problems associated \nwith livestock, dairy and poultry production. Continued reports of \nmanure spills, evidence of water pollution from manure runoff, and \nongoing complaints about odor and air pollution are creating increasing \npressure on the livestock and poultry industry.\n  Last year, I introduced the Animal Agriculture Reform Act, the first \nlegislation of its kind to call for national environmental standards \nfor animal feeding operations. Just this week, the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced what \nthey call a Draft Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding \nOperations. That is a big title, but what it boils down to is a \ncomprehensive, national plan for tackling the environmental problems of \nthe livestock and poultry industry.\n  The Administration's Strategy looks a lot like my bill, so I think it \nis a good start. The Strategy calls for mandatory nutrient management \nplans for larger operations and restrictions on manure application to \nprotect the environment--those provisions are at the heart of my bill \nand also are the focus of the EPA/USDA Strategy.\n  However, the Administration's plan is only a strategy and it must be \nimplemented. We will still see manure spills, runoff and threatened \nwaterways\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\naround the country until we have better management and better controls \nat animal feeding operations.\n  One of the keys to getting this job done, and to helping producers \ncomply with EPA regulations, is finding solutions rather than imposing \nsanctions. That is why today I am introducing a bill that would provide \na 25 percent tax credit to livestock producers to purchase equipment \nfor new and innovative ways to process and use manure.\n  The aim of my bill is to help producers help themselves when it comes \nto manure management, particularly in circumstances where too much \nmanure is generated to be safely applied to land.\n  The tax credit would cover equipment that allows farmers to carefully \napply only as much manure as their crops need, and equipment that \nprocesses manure for safer handling, better nutrient value, or \nalternative uses like energy generation. This is the kind of equipment \nthat producers need to comply more easily with nutrient management \nplans, move manure more economically to areas where crop land is \navailable, or adopt alternative uses for manure.\n  The bottom line as I see it is that livestock, dairy and poultry \nproducers in this country are going to face limits on manure \napplication. These limits are going to have a serious effect on some \noperations, and particularly in certain regions of the country.\n  Of course, there are all kinds of operations that make up our \nlivestock, dairy and poultry industry, and each producer needs an \nenvironmental solution that makes sense for that individual operation.\n  Some producers have enough land to apply all of their manure. For \nthese producers, up to date facilities and careful management should be \nsufficient. For other producers, simple composting or efficient solid \nliquid separation may be the solution, so that solids can be \ntransported more economically for off-site land application. In still \nother situations, particularly for very large operations or in regions \nwith intensive production, we may need to adopt more advanced \ntechnology.\n  I believe that the bill I am introducing today is just a first step \nalong the way to making the adoption of better technologies, whether \nlow-tech composting or high-tech processing, more affordable for any \nsize producer.\n  I want to thank the National Pork Producers Council for its support \nof this tax credit initiative. The National Pork Producers have been \nfar in front of the crowd in engaging policy makers at the national \nlevel and in working with pork producers to address environmental \nproblems. I look forward to continuing to work with them on these \nissues.\n  Let me be clear that I want the livestock industry to thrive in both \nIowa and across the United States. But for our industry to flourish, we \nneed to get our environmental house in order. I do believe that we can \nhave both a healthy livestock industry and a sound environment, and I \nhope that the Congress will act quickly to enact this tax credit to \nhelp producers get the tools they need to reach this goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter of \nendorsement from the NPPC be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nedition of the Record.]\n                                                     National Pork\n\n\n                                             Producers Council\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I'm writing on behalf of the members \n     of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) to express our \n     support for allowing livestock producers to claim an income \n     tax credit for innovative environmental management equipment. \n     We believe the goal of any tax credit for livestock manure \n     handling practices and equipment should be to enhance the \n     quality of surface and ground water and the air. The focus \n     should be on those practices which are an alternative to \n     traditional storage and handling practices or which \n     significantly improve the function of traditional storage and \n     handling methods.\n       Pork producers have been very aggressive in the development \n     of new regulations for their operations through the National \n     Environmental Dialogue on Pork Production recommendations. We \n     recognize that sound environmental management and compliance \n     with new regulations will, in many cases, require producers \n     to adopt and pay for new equipment. In an increasingly \n     competitive world pork industry, such a tax credit will \n     provide U.S. producers an important advantage in the rapid \n     development of sustainable, affordable production systems.\n       We look forward to working with you to enact this important \n     initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Donna Reifschneider,\n                                                President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. DeWine, and \n        Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2494. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n151 et seq.) to enhance the ability of direct broadcast satellite and \nother multichannel video providers to compete effectively with cable \ntelevision systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             THE MULTICHANNEL VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OF 1998\n\n   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \naddress two problems confronting the millions of Americans who \nsubscribe to satellite TV service. I am delighted to have Senators \nHatch, Leahy, DeWine and Kohl as original co-sponsors.\n  These two problems involve the legal and practical difficulties \nsatellite TV providers currently face in providing network TV stations \nas part of their service package.\n  The first problem is that the law effectively prevents satellite TV \ncompanies from providing local network stations to their subscribers. \nThat hampers the ability of satellite TV to compete effectively with \ncable TV and, by doing so, to check cable rate increases.\n  The second problem is that existing law also forbids satellite TV \nproviders from offering distant network stations unless the subscriber \nhappens to be located beyond the reach of local network stations. But \nthe satellite companies and their subscribers claim that the law's \ndefinition of what constitutes decent off-air TV reception is too \nnarrow. This has resulted in many situations in which consumers who \ncannot receive local network stations as a practical matter, are \nnevertheless regarded as being able to receive them, as a legal matter. \nIn many cases, satellite TV providers are offering distant network \nsignals even though it's actually illegal. This has led to litigation \nand a court order that could cause more than a million satellite TV \nsubscribers throughout the country to lose their network TV within the \nnext several weeks.\n  Mr. President, we need to fix these problems, and we need to fix them \nquickly. No satellite TV company should be forced to suddenly \ndiscontinue any customer's network TV service, and satellite TV \ncompanies should be able to provide their subscribers with local \nnetwork TV stations, just as cable TV companies can.\n  The legislation being introduced today is intended to strike a \nreasonable balance between the competing interests of cable operators, \nbroadcasters, and satellite TV providers, to enable satellite TV \nproviders to offer network stations, to assure that no satellite TV \nsubscriber is unfairly deprived of network TV service, to assure local \nbroadcasters are not deprived of the support of their local audience, \nand to make satellite TV a more effective competitive alternative to \ncable TV.\n  This legislation will also require changes to the Copyright Act, the \nSatellite Home Viewers Act, and the Communications Act. The \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, has developed legislation to give satellite TV providers a \ncompulsory copyright license enabling them to offer local TV stations. \nI am also cosponsoring this legislation.\n  The bill I am introducing today will be merged with Senator Hatch's \nlegislation to provide a comprehensive and workable solution to all \nthese problems. Let me briefly describe what my bill provides.\n  My bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to straighten \nout the rules governing satellite TV companies' carriage of distant \nnetwork TV stations, and provides guidelines for the Commission's \ndecision. It will also guarantee that no satellite TV subscriber loses \nnetwork stations before the FCC issues revised rules next\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\nFebruary. It will require that satellite TV companies carry all local \nTV stations, just as cable systems must, when it becomes feasible for \nthem to do so. In the interim it will allow them to carry fewer than \nall local stations as long as they compensate any local stations that \nare not carried for any loss of revenue the stations will suffer as a \nresult.\n  During the last several weeks the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and \nthe Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Fritz Hollings, \nhave worked tirelessly with the broadcast and satellite industries to \ndevelop a compromise that will avoid the disruption of satellite TV \nsubscribers network TV service until this legislation can be enacted \ninto law. I would like to recognize them for their efforts on behalf of \nevery member of the public who subscribes to multichannel video \nservice, whether by satellite or by cable. All of us should be grateful \nfor their leadership on this issue.\n  I intend to hold hearings on the status of the parties efforts to \nreach a compromise, and on the legislation sponsored by Senator Hatch \nand myself, next week. It is my hope that broadcasters and satellite TV \nproviders can reach a mutually-acceptable temporary agreement that will \nenable Senator Hatch and myself to enact our comprehensive legislation \nas soon as possible, and in any event no later than early in the next \nSession of Congress.\nMr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support this measure, which will \nhelp create competition between satellite and cable television. Read in \ntandem with our Judiciary Committee proposal, it offers the promise of \na comprehensive solution that removes some of the roadblocks to true \nvideo competition. Let me commend Senators McCain, Hollings, Hatch, \nLeahy, DeWine and Lott for their efforts, all of which were \ninstrumental in the creation of a comprehensive package with a real \nchance to be enacted this year.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why we need to move on these measures \nbefore the opportunity passes us by. Consumers want real choices. But \nthey won't have a fair opportunity to choose between cable, satellite \nor other video systems if their network signals are, in essence, \nseparate and unequal.\n  The legislation that the Judiciary and Commerce Committees have been \nworking on together would eliminate this problem. They extend the \nSatellite Home Viewer Act, give satellite carriers the ability to \nprovide local television broadcast signals (while appropriately phasing \nin must-carry), reduce the royalty fees for these signals, give the FCC \ntime to take a much-needed second look at the definition of ``unserved \nhouseholds,'' and make sure no one--no one--is terminated before \nFebruary 28th of next year.\n  Mr. President, these bills are not perfect pieces of legislation. And \nwe invite the interested parties to work with us to improve them. But \nthe overall package is a fair and comprehensive one. If we continue to \nwork together, then consumers will have real choices among video \nproviders, and that television programming will be more available and \naffordable for all of us. In addition, we will help to preserve local \ntelevision stations, who provide all of us with vital information like \nnews, weather, and special events--especially sports.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills, which will \nmove us toward video competition in the next millennium, and I hope we \ncan enact them as one before this Congress adjourns in October.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 2495. A bill to establish the Kate Mullany National Historic Site \nin the State of New York, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the kate mullany national historic site act\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pride, with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator D'Amato, I introduce the ``Kate Mullany \nHistoric Site Act,'' a bill to designate the Troy, New York home of \npioneer labor organizer Kate Mullany as a National Historic Site. A \nsimilar measure introduced in the House of Representatives this year by \nCongressman Michael R. McNulty has engendered a great deal of support \nand cosponsorship by over 100 members.\n  Like many Irish immigrants settling in Troy, Kate Mullany found her \nopportunities limited to the most difficult and low-paying of jobs, the \ncollar laundry industry. Troy was then known as ``The Collar City''--\nthe birthplace of the detachable shirt collar. At the age of 19, Kate \nstood up against the often dangerous conditions and meager pay that \ncharacterized the industry and lead a movement of 200 female \nlaundresses demanding just compensation and safe working conditions. \nThese protests marked the beginning of the Collar Laundry Union, which \nsome have called ``the only bona fide female labor union in the \ncountry.''\n  Kate Mullany's courage and organizing skills did not go unnoticed. \nShe later traveled down the Hudson River to lead women workers in the \nsweatshops of New York City and was ultimately appointed Assistant \nSecretary of the then National Labor Union, becoming the first women \never appointed to a national labor office.\n  On April 1, 1998, Kate Mullany's home was designated as a National \nHistoric Landmark by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and on \nJuly 15 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented citizens of Troy \nwith the National Historic Landmark plaque in a celebration. Given the \nrecent attention to the contributions of Kate Mullany, I am quite \npleased to introduce this bill with my colleague Senator D'Amato \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2496. A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \nmedical center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, as the ``H. John Heinz III \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n           h. john heinz iii veterans affairs medical center\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor \nthe memory of Senator John Heinz by designating the Veterans Medical \nfacility in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, as the H. John Heinz III Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center.\n  Recognition of the distinguished work of Senator Heinz has been \nmemorialized in a variety of ways. This designation of the Veterans \nCenter pays tribute to his outstanding work for America's veterans. \nSenator Heinz, a veteran himself, made many contributions to this \nnation and to America's veterans.\n  H. John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938 in Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania. While he grew up in San Francisco, California, he spent \nmany summers in Pittsburgh with his father who was chairman of the H.J. \nHeinz Company founded in 1869 by the Senator's great-grandfather. John \ngraduated from Yale University with honors in 1960 and piloted a \nsingle-engine plane through Africa and the Middle East, ending up in \nSydney, Australia working as a salesman for a truck company. He entered \nHarvard Business School in 1961 and the following year worked for the \nsummer with the Union Bank of Switzerland in Geneva. While in \nSwitzerland he met his future wife, Teresa Simoes Ferreira, who was \nattending graduate school in Geneva. He received his Master's degree in \nBusiness Administration from Harvard in 1963.\n  After enlisting in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, John Heinz served on \nactive duty in 1963 at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. \nFor the remainder of his enlistment, he served with the 911th Troop \nCarrier Group based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. As an Airman \nThird Class, he received a U.S. Department of Defense citation for \nsuggestions to improve the management of parts and supplies, saving the \nAir Force $400,000 annually. With the rank of staff sergeant, he \nreceived an honorable discharge from the Air Force Reserves in 1969.\n  In 1964, John Heinz served as a special assistant to Senator Hugh \nScott (R-PA) in Washington, D.C. and as assistant campaign manager in \nSenator Scott's successful reelection bid. Returning to Pittsburgh, he \nwas employed in the financial and marketing divisions of the H.J. Heinz \nCompany from 1965 to 1970. He married Teresa in 1966, and they \nsubsequently had three sons: Henry John IV, Andre, and Christopher. He \ntaught at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie \nMellon University in Pittsburgh during the 1970-71 academic year.\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\n  Senator Heinz was a stalwart of the Republican Party, contributing \ngenerously of his time, talents and efforts by campaigning for others. \nHe was active in the campaigns of Governor William Scranton for the \nRepublican Presidential nomination in 1964, Judge Maurice B. Cohill for \nJuvenile Court in 1965, Richard L. Thornburgh for Congress in 1966, \nRobert Friend for County Controller in 1967, and John Tabor for Mayor \nin 1969. He chaired the Pennsylvania Republican platform committee \nhearings in 1968, won election as a delegate at the Republican National \nConvention in the same year (and again in 1972, 1976, and 1980), and \nchaired the Pennsylvania Republican State Platform Committee in 1970.\n  Upon the sudden death in April 1971 of Congressman Robert J. Corbett \n(R-PA), John Heinz pursued the unexpired term and won, making him the \nyoungest Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives at 33 \nyears old. In November 1972 and 1974, John Heinz was re-elected to the \nHouse.\n  When Senator Hugh Scott announced his retirement in December 1975, \nSenator Heinz, George Packer and I ran for the Republican nomination \nfor U.S. Senate in the April 1976 primary. After Senator Heinz won that \nprimary contest, I endorsed him at a major rally in September 1976 in \nDelaware County at the kick off of his campaign in Southeastern \nPennsylvania. Senator Heinz defeated Congressman William J. Green III \nand took his seat in the United States Senate on January 3, 1977.\n  In his capacity as Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, Senator Heinz gave me tremendous support and was \ninstrumental in my election to the United States Senate in November \n1980.\n  Thereafter, Senator Heinz and I established a very close friendship \nand working relationship. Although I cannot personally attest to all \nother Senate relationships, I believe that our cooperation and \ncoordination was as close as any two Senators from the same state in \nthe Senate's history.\n  When one of us was unable to attend a specific event, the other was \nalways ready, willing and able to take his place. We discussed the \npending international, national and state issues incessantly. On the \nlate night sessions, and there were many, I would drive John home in my \naging Jaguar leaving him off in the alley behind his home in \nGeorgetown.\n  On one occasion in 1982 we had a lengthy discussion about the \nupcoming vote the next day on a constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget. I laid out my reasons for opposing the amendment and John gave \nme his reasons for supporting it. I found his arguments so persuasive \nthat I voted for the constitutional amendment for the balanced budget \nthe next day. I was surprised to find that he voted against it. We had \na good laugh on that exchange of views and our reciprocal change of \npositions.\n  Senator Heinz and I made it a practice to inform and invite the other \nto all of our events. On April 3, 1991, our paths crossed in Altoona, \nPennsylvania, where he had scheduled a meeting with a group of doctors. \nI accepted his invitation and recall his warm greeting when Joan and I \narrived to join the discussion. He kissed Joan on the cheek and joked \nwith me about calling her ``blondie.'' We parted that day and that was \nthe last time I saw John Heinz because he had the fatal air crash the \nnext day, April 4, 1991, in a small plane from Williamsport, \nPennsylvania, to Philadelphia.\n  Senator Heinz was an extraordinary man and a great Senator. The \ndesignation of the Veterans Medical Center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, \nis an appropriate additional tribute to his memory.\n  Senator Heinz' work on behalf of the citizens of Pennsylvania, young \nand old, will long be remembered. He was a tireless advocate for \nseniors, working to ensure the long-term viability of the Social \nSecurity system. He fought to protect Medicare and Medicaid patients. \nHe authored the Age Discrimination and Employment Amendments of 1985, \nprotecting the employment rights of our nation's seniors. He authored a \nbill to strengthen the U.S. job training program for displaced veterans \nin the work force. For military families, he worked to ensure that the \nchildren of service members were adequately cared for. He worked on \nbehalf of U.S. workers and businesses in an increasingly international \nmarketplace. He also played an important role in ensuring appropriate \nenvironmental protections in Pennsylvania and across the nation. John \nHeinz had a remarkable career of public service.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I ask my \ncolleagues to support this measure naming the Department of Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, after our departed \ncolleague, Senator H. John Heinz III.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF H. JOHN HEINZ IN DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER, ASPINWALL, \n                   PENNSYLVANIA.\n\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in \n     Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, is hereby designated as the ``H. \n     John Heinz III Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center''. Any reference to such medical center in any law, \n     regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the \n     United States shall be considered to be a reference to the \n     ``H.

Mr. President, this is a great date in the history \nnot only of the United States, but of all free people, and of all \npeople who would be free. On September 17, 1787, a small group of truly \nremarkable Americans gathered to sign one of the greatest documents in \nall of human history, the Constitution of the United States.\n  George Washington signed it as the President of the Constitutional \nConvention and deputy from Virginia. The names of other signers are \nfamiliar to all Americans: Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and \nAlexander Hamilton. Other names should be more familiar than they are, \nnames like Morris and Pinkney and Dickinson and Rutledge.\n  We owe them a great debt. They have given us a firm foundation on \nwhich has been built our great and abiding stability. Even when this \nNation was torn by a terrible fight over the institution of slavery, \nthe Constitution allowed us to recover with amazing speed, become one \nNation again, and avoid the generations of smoldering conflict that \nafflict so many other countries.\n  Our Constitution is at once solid and flexible. It can and has been \namended from time to time to improve the machinery of government and to \nexpand the rights that citizens enjoy. Throughout our history we have \nsought to follow Madison's wise advice to limit amendments to ``certain \ngreat and extraordinary occasions.''\n  In Federalist No. 43, James Madison wrote that the Constitution \nestablishes a balanced system for amendment, guarding ``equally against \nthat extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable, \nand that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered \nfaults.'' The Constitution is profoundly conservative, in the best \nsense of that word. As Madison expressed in Federalist No. 49:\n\n       [A]s every appeal to the people would carry an implication \n     of some defect in government, frequent appeals would, in \n     great measure, deprive the government of that veneration \n     which time bestows on everything and without which perhaps \n     the wisest and freest governments would not possess the \n     requisite stability.\n\n  It is remarkable that although some 11,000 constitutional amendments \nhave been offered in our history, and more than 100 in the 105th \nCongress alone, the elected representatives in Congress and in the \nStates have adopted only 17 since the original Bill of Rights. We have \nrejected many amendments that seemed to be good ideas at the time, but \nwhich on further reflection proved to be unnecessary. We have found \nthat we could achieve the same results by statute, or have on sober \nreflection recognized that the amendments would have been mere symbolic \ngestures. We have avoided turning the Constitution into a mere bulletin \nboard on which we ``send a message.'' We have respected it and, most \nimportantly, we have resisted the temptation to limit the fundamental \nfreedoms of Americans. We have rejected the temptation to erode the \nBill of Rights.\n  I cannot ignore the fact that Congress and the States did succumb \nonce to what looked like a good idea without carefully considering the \nconsequences of their action. The eighteenth amendment imposed \nprohibition and conjured up a swarm of gangsters, bootlegging, and \nwholesale disobedience of the law. It was a bad idea that had to be \nundone by another constitutional amendment. We should regard the \neighteenth amendment as a reminder that we should go slow, and stop and \nconsider carefully all of the implications of any change before we put \nit in the Constitution.\n  I submit that the Constitution of the United States is a good \ndocument--not a sacred text--but as good a law as has been written. \nThat is why it has survived as the supreme law of the land with so few \nalterations throughout the last 200 years.\n  It has contributed to our success as a Nation by binding us together, \nrather than tearing us apart. It contains the Great Compromise that \nallowed small States and large States to join together in a spirit of \nmutual accommodation and respect. It embodies the protections that make \nreal the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and \ngive meaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit \nof happiness.\n  The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection \nof\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\nthe law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our freedom \nto worship or not as we each choose, and our political freedoms, as \nwell. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy and for \nlimiting government's intrusions and burdens in our lives.\n  I oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination with laying \nwaste to our Constitution and the protections that have served us well \nfor over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers and power \nof the purse should be supported and defended.\n  When we embarked in this Congress, we each swore an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution. That is our duty to those who forged this \ngreat document, our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect \nand defend our Constitution, our commitment to our constituents and our \nlegacy to those who will succeed us.\n  The Framers gave us a remarkable document, an extraordinary system of \ngovernment and protections for our individual liberties. So I celebrate \nthis day, not with the parades or fireworks of the Fourth of July, but \nwith solemn consideration of how the Framers guaranteed our freedom \nthrough checks on government power. Most of all, I mark this day with a \nrenewed commitment to cherish and to protect this most precious of \nlegacies, to resist easy amendments, to resist assaults on our Bill of \nRights, and to preserve the Constitution for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10528-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WOMEN'S ST. CLAIR SHORES CIVIC LEAGUE 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the St. \nClair Shores Civic League, in St. Clair Shores, Michigan on its 60th \nAnniversary. The mission of the League, ``to maintain a high standard \nof civic life . . . by activities designed to stimulate citizen \nparticipation in government and to promote the cultural growth of the \ncity'' is very respectable and has led the organization to be very \nsuccessful.\n  The Women's St. Clair Shores Civic League has grown tremendously over \nthe course of over six decades. The committee of six women that \neventually became the League, was formed in 1930 to aid the youth of \nthe community and assist in civic improvements. In an effort to better \nhandle their increasing tasks, the committee became the Women's St. \nClair Shores Civic League in 1939. Some the League's projects over the \nyears have included consolidating three school districts, building a \nmunicipal park, and incorporating St. Clair Shores.

Mr. President, today, 39 of my olleagues and I are \nsending a letter to the Senate Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, urging them to \ninclude school modernization tax incentives in any tax legislation \nconsidered by the Senate this year. While we may have different \npositions on the advisability of enacting such legislation, and \ndifferent positions on what that legislation should include, we are \nunited in believing that any tax legislation must include significant \nrelief for communities seeking to rebuild and modernize their schools.\n  This month, according to a recent report from the Department of \nEducation, a record number of students are pouring into our nation's \nclassrooms. 52.7 million children enrolled in elementary and secondary \nschools this year, a 500,000 student increase from last year. Ten years \nfrom now, according to the report, enrollment is expected to reach 54.3 \nmillion. We cannot continue to pack these children into today's \nschools. We need to build an estimated 6,000 new schools over the next \n10 years just to keep up with rising enrollment.\n  In addition, the U.S. General Accounting Office has documented $112 \nbillion worth of deferred maintenance and neglect of existing school \nbuildings. It will cost $112 billion nationwide--$13 billion in \nIllinois alone--to bring existing school buildings up to good, overall \ncondition. That is not the cost of equipping them with new computers, \nor even of retrofitting them so teachers have a place to plug in new \ncomputers. That is just the cost of bringing existing buildings up to \ngood, overall condition.\n  Crumbling and overcrowded schools are found in every type of \ncommunity, all across the nation. The GAO found that 38 percent of \nurban schools, 30 percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban \nschools are crumbling down around our children.\n  The problem is so pervasive because it is a symptom of our failed \nschool finance structure. For more than 100 years, we have relied on \nlocal property taxes to finance our schools. This system may have made \nsense when the nation's wealth was held and measured in terms of \nproperty, but it does not make sense today.\n  According to the GAO, our school finance system actually militates \nagainst most communities' best efforts to improve their schools. In 35 \nstates, poor districts have higher tax rates than wealthy \ndistricts, but raise less revenue because of lower property values.\n\n  In 11 states, courts have actually declared school finance systems \nunconstitutional. In nearly every case, states have complied by raising \nproperty or sales taxes to fund school improvements. Similar litigation \nis pending in another 16 states, and many of these lawsuits appear \nlikely to result in higher state and local taxes as well.\n  The Senate has an opportunity this year to break this cycle of \ncrumbling schools and higher local taxes. We have an opportunity to \ncreate a new partnership between the federal government, states, and \ncommunities to improve our schools. We can do this in a way that does \nnot reduce the projected budget surplus, which is properly being \nreserved for Social Security, and in a way that maintains continued \nfiscal discipline.\n  In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, the Congress took the first steps \ntoward the creation of this new partnership, when it enacted the \nQualified Zone Academy Bond program. Under this program, school \ndistricts issue zero-interest bonds, and purchasers of these bonds \nreceive federal income tax credits in lieu of interest. This mechanism \ncan cut the cost of major school improvements by 30 to 50 percent. In \nChicago, the school system will presently issue $14 million worth of \nthese bonds for a school renovation project. By using these bonds \ninstead of regular municipal bonds, the school system will save Chicago \ntaxpayers $7 million in interest costs. In other words, this project \nwill cost $14 million, instead of $21 million.\n  I propose that we use the same mechanism to facilitate school \nimprovements nationwide. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nwe can supply $22 billion worth of these special bonds to states and \ncommunities at a cost of only $3.3 billion to the federal treasury over \nthe next five years. That $3.3 billion cost actually represents tax \nrelief for purchasers of these school modernization bonds. Under this \nplan, communities get better schools and children get a better \neducation; local property taxpayers and federal income taxpayers get \nlower bills. This is the kind of innovative partnership we need to \nrebuild and modernize our schools for the 21st century.\n  Last week, President Clinton, Vice President Gore, governors, members \nof Congress, cabinet members, parents, teachers, and school officials \ngathered at 84 sites around the country to focus attention on the \nurgent need to create a new partnership to modernize our schools. \nSpeaking at a school in Maryland, President Clinton said our ``children \ndeserve schools that are as modern as the world in which they will \nlive.'' He went on to say that, ``Nothing we do will have a greater \neffect on the future of this country than guaranteeing every child, \nwithout regard to race or station in life or region in this country, a \nworld-class education. Nothing.''\n  That statement could not be more true. The rungs on the ladder of \nopportunity in America have always been crafted in the classroom, and \nin the emerging global economy, the importance of education continues \nto grow. As H.G. Wells noted, ``Human history becomes more and more a \nrace between education and catastrophe.''\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\n  As we approach the 21st century, we are faced with the real problem \nthat too many of our schools do not provide the kind of learning \nenvironment necessary to educate our children for a competitive, global \neconomy. Studies have proven a correlation between building conditions, \nstudent achievement, student discipline. The fact is, our children \ncannot learn in schools that are falling down around them.\n  I hope the Congress can use the remaining time we are in session, \nshort as it may be, to create a school modernization partnership that \nwill carry our children into the next century. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that \nour plan is a part of any tax legislation considered this year.\n  According to a recent Gallup poll, 86 percent of adults support \nproviding federal funds to repair and replace older school buildings. \nThat figure suggests that the American people want Congress to put \naside partisanship and ideology and work together to help improve our \nschools. I hope we won't let them down.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the letter to Senator Lott be \nprinted in the Record. An identical copy of the letter has been sent to \nSenator Roth.\n  The text of the letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As you know, the House and Senate have \n     each passed fiscal year 1999 Budget Resolutions calling for \n     the enactment of substantial tax relief legislation. We \n     believe that any such legislation should include major tax \n     relief for communities seeking to rebuild and modernize their \n     school facilities.\n       The problem of crumbling and overcrowded schools has grown \n     too large and is too important for Congress to ignore. \n     According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), it \n     will cost $112 billion just to bring existing schools up to \n     good, overall condition. In addition, the Department of \n     Education reports that the nation's school districts will \n     need to build an additional 6,000 schools over the next ten \n     years simply to keep class sizes at current levels as student \n     enrollment rises. Crumbling and overcrowded schools are found \n     in virtually every kind of community and every part of the \n     country. The GAO found that 38 percent of urban schools, 30 \n     percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools \n     reported needing extensive repair or replacement of one or \n     more buildings.\n       The large and growing school infrastructure deficit in the \n     United States reflects problems and inequities in our system \n     of school finance. In 35 States, poor districts have higher \n     tax rates than wealthy districts but raise less revenue \n     because of lower property values. School financing systems \n     have been ruled unconstitutional in 11 states. In nearly \n     every case, States have complied by raising property or sales \n     taxes to fund school improvements. Similar litigation is \n     pending in 16 other States, and many of these lawsuits appear \n     likely to result in higher state and local taxes as well.\n       The Senate has an opportunity in this year's tax \n     legislation to break this cycle of crumbling schools and \n     higher local taxes. We have an opportunity to create a new \n     partnership between the federal government, States, and \n     communities to improve the learning environment for our \n     children--our economy's most precious asset. We believe this \n     objective can be accomplished in a manner that does not \n     reduce the projected budget surplus, which is properly being \n     reserved for Social Security, and that maintains continued \n     fiscal discipline.\n       The condition of school facilities has been found to have a \n     direct effect on student behavior and achievement. By helping \n     States and communities rebuild and modernize their schools, \n     the federal government can make a constructive contribution \n     to the quality of education in America, while helping to free \n     resources at the local level for other school initiatives or \n     much-deserved property and sales tax relief.\n       This subject has been of growing concern to us in recent \n     years. Earlier proposals to commit federal resources to \n     address this problem have been unsuccessful, and it has \n     become clear that needed assistance to schools will only be \n     acceptable to a majority of Senators if it is in the form of \n     tax relief. Therefore, as the Senate considers tax \n     legislation this year, we look forward to working with you to \n     provide substantial tax relief targeted to the rebuilding and \n     modernizing of our nation's schools.\n           Sincerely,\n         Carol Moseley-Braun, Ted Kennedy, Patty Murray, John F. \n           Kerry, Robert Torricelli, Tom Daschle, Fritz Hollings, \n           Charles Robb, Chris Dodd, Dale Bumpers.\n         Max Cleland, Daniel Akaka, Joseph Lieberman, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Frank R.

Mr. President, few of my colleagues would dispute the \nnotion that capitalism is the foundation of America's economic success. \nUnder capitalism, competition inspires innovation. Innovation led in \nthe 19th Century to the industrial revolution, and in the 20th Century \nto the digital age. These developments have made the United States the \nrichest, most successful nation in the world. But this Administration \nseems to distrust our capitalist, competitive system and wants to \nreplace it with some sort of ``third-way'' in which government \nbureaucrats make major decisions about what innovations will be allowed \nin our economic system, and when.\n  I refer particularly, Mr. President, to the Justice Department's \nvendetta against Microsoft, a company that has had the ingenuity and \ndetermination to achieve the American dream. Against the odds, one man \nwith a good idea turned a workshop in his garage into the most \nsuccessful high technology company in the world. The Administration is \nnow on a path to destroy not only the man and his company but to \ndestroy the dream as well.\n  Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice \nDepartment's Antitrust Division, has declare war on success in the name \nof antitrust law. According to Joel Klein's world view, it is the duty \nof the United States government to protect not the consumer but the \ncompany that cannot compete on its own merits.\n  Mr. Klein has made his ambition abundantly clear. When he testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee in June he said, ``We reject \ncategorically the notion that markets will self-correct and we should \nsit back and watch.'' Instead, Mr. Klein believes the government should \ncontrol every move of America's most successful and innovative \ncompanies.\n  What candidate for president ran on this platform? The American \npeople were not informed that free markets were to be abandoned as our \nprincipal economic guide. Instead of allowing the best man, or in this \ncase the best company, to win, the Justice Department wants to control \nthe market and dole out slices of it to companies of its choice.\n  This is anathema to the free market, Mr. President.\n  The Department's case, after all, is merely an attempt to give \nNetscape and other Microsoft rivals a leg up in the ongoing battle for \nmarket share in the software industry. Microsoft has earned its current \nprominence in the software industry through hard work, innovation, and \nconsumer choice. The company has been successful because it has had \nbetter ideas and more efficient means of turning those ideas into \nsuperior products. Consumers in the United States and throughout the \nworld simply prefer Microsoft products.\n  But jealous rivals who have not reached the same level of success \nhave now enlisted the Justice Department to give them what they and the \nAdministration believe is rightfully theirs--more market share. These \nrivals, I fear, may soon regret ever having opened this Pandora's box. \nFor a precedent may have already been set. That precedent is that \ngovernment intervention in the market, in the absence of consumer \ncomplaint or dissatisfaction, is acceptable.\n  That is why I speak here today, Mr. President, as one in a growing \nnumber of voices in America in firm opposition to the Administration's \ncase against Microsoft.\n  As I see it, the Administration is not working for the greater good, \nbut for its own good. Those at the highest levels of this \nAdministration believe they, not the market and certainly not \nconsumers, know what is best for the nation. Rick Rule, former \nAssistant Attorney General for Antitrust under President Ronald Reagan, \nsummed it up best when he said, ``The Hubris reflected in the \ngovernment's case against Microsoft is monumental.''\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\n  This is just the beginning, Mr. President. Yesterday, at the Upside \nConference, a meeting of high-tech industry leaders here in Washington, \nRoberta Katz, General Counsel for Netscape, said of the government's \ncase against Microsoft, ``This is about a lot more than just \nMicrosoft.'' To Ms. Katz I say, be careful what you wish for, be very \ncareful what you wish for. Today the government's target is Microsoft, \nbut tomorrow, it could very well be Netscape.\n  The Antitrust Division, in filing its case against Microsoft, is \nworking to justify an expanded role for government in the high-tech \nindustry. The further its tentacles are allowed to reach into high-tech \nmarket, the tighter its grip on the industry will become.\n  In fact, at a hearing tomorrow before Judge Jackson, the Justice \nDepartment will request that it be allowed to expand the scope of its \ncase against Microsoft. There are two explanations for the Justice \nDepartment's motives; both are troubling. The first is that the \nAntitrust division is seeking to increase the aspects of the high-tech \nindustry over which it will gain control if it wins the case. The \nsecond is that the Division is becoming increasingly desperate to find \nan issue, any issue, on which is can prevail in court.\n  The first point should be of no little concern to Ms. Katz of \nNetscape and her counterparts at all the other high-tech companies \ncheering the Justice Department on. But it is the second point on which \nI would like to expand.\n  The Antitrust Division knows that its case against Microsoft is \nliterally falling apart at the seams. As my colleagues will recall, on \nJune 23 a three judge United States Appeals Court panel overturned the \npreliminary injunction issued against Microsoft last December. The \nheart of the injunction, and the heart of the Department's current case \nagainst Microsoft, is the company's decision to integrate its web \nbrowser into its Windows operating system.\n  As soon as the Appeals Court ruled that the integration of browser \ntechnology into Windows as not a violation of U.S. antitrust law, Joel \nKlein started scrambling frantically for other claims to make against \nMicrosoft. If the Administration's concern was truly that Microsoft was \nacting illegally in integrating products into Windows, the Justice \nDepartment would have and should have dismissed its case then and \nthere. But it didn't.\n  Joel Klein continued attempts to drag more and more issues into the \ncase is telling, Mr. President. Those attempts are a clear sign that \nthe government's real beef with Microsoft is its size. The government \ncan't stand the fact that Microsoft is successful. Microsoft, in the \neyes of the Administration, is just too big. So the Justice Department \nwill do everything it can to paint Bill Gates as the bad guy.\n  As Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. aptly described it in an editorial in \nWednesday's Wall Street Journal, Joel Klein ``has spraypainted the \nworld with subpoenas, calling companies to testify about every failed \nand not-yet-failed collaboration between competitive allies and allied \ncompetitors in the computer industry.''\n  the strategy, according to Rick Rule, is ``the old plaintiff's trick \nof throwing up lots of snippets of dialogue that try to tar the \ndefendant as a bad guy.''\n  Aside from all the legal commentary, the real issue, Mr. President, \nis that the Justice Department's case against Microsoft is a bad one. \nJoel Klein knows it, the high-tech community knows it, and I know it.\n  No legal wrangling can disguise the fact that what the Administration \nis doing is wrong. It is not only wrong in the sense that the Justice \nDepartment will probably lose in the end. But it is wrong in the sense \nthat the very premise on which it stands is at fundamental odds with \nthe free market capitalism that has made this nation great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10530-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S.-ASIA INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the U.S.-Asia Institute, a non-\nprofit organization, recently completed its 40th Congressional Staff \nDelegation to China and Hong Kong in cooperation with the Chinese \nPeople's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA). I am pleased to bring \nthis milestone to the attention of the Senate.\n  The Institute's commitment to promoting friendship and understanding \nbetween countries in Asia and the U.S. government goes back almost 20 \nyears. Founded in 1979 by Esther Kee, Norman Lau Kee, and Joji \nKonoshima, the U.S.-Asia Institute has been steadily working to achieve \nits goal through international conferences, seminars, student exchange \nprograms, and Congressional staff trips to Asia.\n  Among its numerous activities in support of cultural understanding, \nthe U.S.-Asia Institute's Congressional staff trip program to China and \nHong Kong is unrivaled. Since its inception in 1985, the China program \nhas hosted more than 320 Congressional staff members in numerous places \nthroughout China--from Heihe in the North on the Russian border to \nHainan in the South; from the dynamic coastal cities of Shanghai and \nGuangzhou to the remote city of Urumqi, an oasis on the ancient Silk \nRoad; and to the capital, Beijing. Over 150 Congressional offices have \nbenefited from the intense, hectic, fact finding programs that provide \nCongressional staff members a unique opportunity to observe this \ndynamic nation first-hand and to further their understanding of complex \nSino-U.S. relations. This program has survived the sometimes tumultuous \nrelationship between the two countries thanks to the steadfast \ncommitment of the U.S.-Asia Institute and the CPIFA to promote dialog \non issues of mutual interest to our two great nations.\n  I congratulate the U.S.-Asia Institute and CPIFA for their remarkable \nachievements and hope their longstanding partnership will continue into \nthe 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10531-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10531-S10532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL RICHARD A. BURPEE, U.S. AIR FORCE, \n                                RETIRED\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional leader in recognition of a remarkable career of service to \nhis country--Lieutenant General Richard A. Burpee, United States Air \nForce, retired. Dick Burpee has amassed a truly distinguished record, \nincluding 35 years of service in the Air Force uniform, that merits \nspecial recognition on the occasion of his retirement as chairman of \nthe board of directors of the Retired Officers Association.\n  Born and raised in Delton, Michigan, he is now a distinguished \ncitizen of the great State of Oklahoma. He enlisted in the Air Force \njust after the Korean War in 1953. Subsequently selected for pilot \ntraining, he earned his aviator's wings and Second Lieutenant's \ncommission in 1955.\n  Over the next decade, Dick served in a variety of flying and staff \npositions, including assignments as an instructor pilot and as an \nexchange pilot with the Royal Canadian Armed Forces. In the process, he \nsuccessfully completed studies leading to the award of a bachelor's \ndegree in economics and a master's degree in public administration.\n  During a 1967-68 tour of duty with the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing in \nVietnam, he distinguished himself with a record of 336 combat missions \nin the F-4 fighter and the award of the Silver Star, two Distinguished \nFlying Crosses, a Bronze Star and fifteen air medals.\n  Air Force leaders recognized the talent and potential of this \ngeneral-to-be and selected him for prestigious positions at Air Force \nheadquarters in Washington, DC, first in the Office of the Director for \nOperational Test and Evaluation and subsequently as an aide to the Air \nForce Vice Chief of Staff.\n  Following completion of the National War College and selection for \npromotion to the grade of Colonel, he returned to operational flying \nduty in a series of leadership positions, ultimately serving as \nCommander of the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) 509th Bombardment Wing \nin 1974-1975.\n  Exceeding even the Strategic Air Command's high standards of \nleadership excellence, Dick Burpee was hardly getting started. \nFollowing selection to General officer rank, he carved a path of \nperformance and achievement through assignments at Headquarters \nStrategic Air Command, as Commander of the 19th air division, and in \nsenior plans and operations positions at Air Force headquarters in the \nPentagon. From 1983 to 1985, the great State of Oklahoma had the good \nfortune to get to know Dick Burpee as a particularly outstanding \nCommander\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\nof the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center.\n  Oklahomans were not alone in recognizing his talents, as he was \nsubsequently promoted to three-star rank and assigned as Director for \nOperations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff--the highest ranking \noperations staff officer of our country's Armed Forces.\n  Finally, in 1988, he was appointed to command the Strategic Air \nCommand's prestigious 15th Air Force, a position he held until his \nretirement from active military service in 1990.\n  In addition to the impressive combat record I have already mentioned, \nI would note that General Burpee's military files reflect an \noutstanding total of 11,000 flying hours as well as the award of the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, two Distinguished Service Medals, \nand the Legion of Merit. A true warrior and leader, indeed.\n  Dick Burpee, however, is not a person who considers even 35 years of \narduous service a full working career. Following his retirement, he \nstarted a successful consulting business in management and marketing \nwith aerospace industries and government. Since relocating to Oklahoma \nCity in 1991, he has served as vice president for development and vice \npresident of administration at the University of Central Oklahoma, sits \non the board of directors of the United Bank in Oklahoma City, and has \nbeen deeply involved with the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. \nElected to the board of directors of the Retired Officers Association \n(TROA) in 1992, he was unanimously selected as TROA's chairman of the \nboard in 1996, a position from which he is now retiring.\n\n  Through his stewardship, the Retired Officers Association continues \nto play a vital role as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives \nto maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for all members \nof the uniformed service community--active, reserve and retired, plus \ntheir families and survivors.\n  I won't describe all of his accomplishments, but will briefly touch \non some highlights to illustrate his involvement and concern for \nmilitary people. As chairman, he has championed the fight for health \ncare equity for retirees of the uniformed services, whose access to the \nmilitary health care system has been severely curtailed by base \nclosures, downsizing, and shrinking military medical budgets. His \npersistent and well-reasoned proposals have translated into successful \nlegislative initiatives aimed at expanding Medicare-eligible retirees' \naccess to military facilities and allowing them to enroll in the \nfederal employees health benefits program. He also has been one of the \nmost vocal advocates for ending the practice of capping annual pay \nraises for active and reserve personnel below those enjoyed by the \naverage American. Happily, those efforts are now bearing fruit in the \nform of full-comparability raises for the troops in 1999 and, \nhopefully, from 2000 on.\n  Taken together, these comprise two of the most important \ninstitutional inducements to help reverse declining career retention \nstatistics in all services.\n  In forcefully articulating the urgency of honoring long-standing \nhealth care and retirement commitments to those who have already served \nand by championing improved quality-of-life initiatives for those now \nserving, Dick Burpee has significantly raised Congress' sensitivity to \nthese important retention and readiness issues.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Dick Burpee has distinguished himself and \nTROA from other, often strident, critics by consistently offering \ncogent, well-researched plans that outline workable legislative \nsolutions to these complex problems.\n  My closing observation, with which I am sure you will all agree, is \nthat General Dick Burpee has been, in every sense of the word, a leader \nin the military, TROA and the entire retired community.

Mr. Ratz, who resides with his wife, \nDoris, in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin, is one of the last \nsurvivors of the flourishing Jewish community of Latvia, which lost all \nbut 300 of its 35,000 members during the Holocaust.\n  Jack Ratz's memoirs is an eloquent refutation to those who would dare \nto trivialize, distort, or even deny the Holocaust's important lessons. \nHis book well reflects the affirmative message that Jack Ratz shares \nwith New York City school children during his regular visits to the \ncity classrooms.\n  As the survivors of the Holocaust succumb to old age there are fewer \nand fewer eyewitnesses to this tragedy. Jack Ratz has provided an \ninvaluable service with his moving account of the Latvian Holocaust \nexperience.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a recent article in the New York \nCity Jewish Week about Jack Ratz and ``Endless Miracles.''\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Jewish Week, Aug. 14, 1998]\n\n                         Memories and Miracles\n\n                           (By Nancy Beiles)\n\n       During a recent trip to Riga, Latvia, Jack Ratz visited a \n     museum commemorating Latvian Holocaust victims, and was drawn \n     to a series of photos of camp inmates hanging on the wall. \n     One in particular caught his attention--a black-and-white \n     photo of a 16-year-old boy, head shaven, wearing work clothes \n     decorated with the Star of David and the number 281.\n       ``I asked the guard, `Who are those people?' He said, `they \n     died a long time ago,' recalled Ratz, of Mill Basin, a \n     Latvian-born Holocaust survivor. ``I told him I know three of \n     those people. Two were father and son and yes, they were \n     killed. But the photo of the young fellow on the right--he is \n     talking to you. He is me.''\n       Ratz had come to Riga to say Kaddish for members of his \n     family killed in the Rumboli Forest in 1941, and to visit the \n     old ghetto where he and his father lived before being sent \n     off to a series of work and concentration camps.\n       ``All of a sudden I saw a picture of myself hanging on the \n     wall and a flash of memories came rushing back to me of 55 \n     years ago,'' Ratz recalls, tearfully. ``I could only cry. I \n     found myself hanging on the wall with all the dead people.\n       Of the 35,000 Jews who lived in Latvia at the time of \n     German occupation in 1941, Ratz is one of just 300 who \n     survived. Because of the scarcity of Latvian survivors, their \n     particular experience during the Holocaust is rarely \n     recounted. ``Very few Latvian Jews escaped because the \n     general population was not sympathetic to aiding the Jews,'' \n     says William Schulman, director of the Holocaust Resource \n     Center at Queensborough Community College. `The Germans made \n     use of the Latvians to guard the Jews and persecute them, to \n     send them to their death. So there are very few memoirs of \n     survivors.''\n       Ratz, who is retired from the television repair business, \n     and his American-born wife, Doris, are and trying to fill \n     that gap in Holocaust memory.\n       The four years he and his father spent in labor and \n     concentration camps and their subsequent liberation forms the \n     basis for `Ratz's newly-published memoir, ``Endless \n     Miracles'' (1998; Shengold Publishers Inc.). Ratz's account \n     caught the attention of Moshe Sheinhaum, president of \n     Shengold Publishers, precisely because it explores \n     episodes of the Holocaust that are not often talked about. \n     ``I've published over 70 books on the Holocaust and this \n     is one of the most exciting,'' says Sheinbaum. ``Very \n     little has been done about Riga.''\n       Starting with historical background about the Jewish \n     community in Latvia, the book's emotional beginning describes \n     the first Nazi programs in Riga that would eventually spiral \n     into genocide. Shortly after the Germans arrived in Latvia in \n     1941, displacing the Russians, who had occupied Latvia just a \n     year earlier, they created two Jewish ghettos. One was for \n     able-bodied men, the other for women, children and the \n     disabled. Just 14 at the time, Ratz could have stayed with \n     his mother and younger siblings, but he decided to ``take a \n     chance,'' he says, and go with his father.\n       This is the first of the ``endless miracles'' Ratz \n     describes--fortuitous decisions that saved his life. After he \n     and his father went to the Jewish workers' ghetto, over the \n     course of a few weeks the Nazis executed all the women, \n     children, elderly and disabled men from the other ghetto--\n     including Ratz's mother and siblings--in grisly mass \n     executions in the Rumboli Forest.\n       With no chance to grieve, Ratz writes, ``Even our mourning \n     was cut short. We were forced to return to work immediately \n     under penalty of instant death.'' The subsequent years are an \n     accumulation of sorrows and terror.\n       Ratz and his father were first sent to Lenta, a work camp \n     near Riga, then to Salaspils, a death camp, back to Lenta and \n     from there to Stuthoff, another death camp,\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\n     and Burgraben. During these four years, Ratz and his father \n     managed to stay alive by luck--for example, being in the \n     second half of a line from which the Nazis take the first \n     half to kill, and by what Ratz says can only be attributed to \n     God's grace.\n       Unlike many survivors, who lost not only their loved ones \n     but also their faith somewhere in the camps, Ratz's faith \n     stayed intact. It was his belief in God that allowed him to \n     weather those years and survive. ``If I would not believe in \n     God, I would not be alive today,'' he says. ``By believing \n     it, I felt I survived. God actually picked up his hand and \n     showed me the way.''\n       One time, that way meant masquerading as a skilled \n     craftsman with his father so they could be eligible for a \n     work slot in a factory near Stuthoff outside of the firing \n     range. On another occasion, it meant stealing cigarettes from \n     guards to trade for food from more recent arrivals who were \n     not yet starved. The loaf of bread that was bartered for two \n     cigarettes helped Ratz and his father ward off hunger a \n     little longer.\n       Ratz links his experience during those years to that of \n     Jews throughout history, dating back to biblical times--Jews \n     who were persecuted and whose faith was tested. Ratz, whose \n     Hebrew name is Isaac, says that when his father first went \n     with him to the ghetto in Riga, his father identified with \n     Abraham, sensing that he too was being called upon to \n     sacrifice his son, his Isaac.\n       For his part, Ratz appears in the book as a latter-day \n     Joseph. Like the biblical figure who gave food from the \n     Egyptian storehouses to his hungry brothers during a famine, \n     Ratz, himself weak and hungry, whenever possible retrieved \n     food to give to people in the camps who were hovering ever \n     closer to starvation. On one occasion, he managed to salvage \n     scraps of food from refuse bins in a camp kitchen where he \n     worked; another time, Ratz accidentally discovered a dead \n     horse from which he was able to give to people what was a \n     rare commodity in the camps: meat. ``God also showed me how \n     to help people instead of how Hitler destroyed people,'' Ratz \n     explains.\n       In Ratz's book, the brutality of the camps springs to life \n     most poignantly in small details that are often overlooked by \n     historians. He tells of sand irritating his throat because \n     the Nazis would use potatoes still caked with soil for the \n     inmates' soup and of relishing the straw matting on the bunks \n     in one camp because he had just come from a camp where he and \n     three others slept on a single wooden board. And he describes \n     his father sewing his few valuables into his hernia belt so \n     that he would have something to trade for food when all else \n     failed.\n       In 1945, when the Russians finally liberated Ratz and his \n     father, the freedom was initially hollow. ``You have to be \n     lucky how you're liberated also,'' Ratz says. ``To be \n     liberated by Russians was not freedom.''\n       Unlike the survivors liberated by Americans or British who \n     were immediately assigned to ``displaced persons'' camps and \n     given medical treatment, those freed by the Russians were \n     left to fend for themselves. ``We were all free, but we did \n     not know what to do or where to go,'' Ratz writes.\n       The Russian zone is described by Ratz as chaotic. When it \n     became clear the Russians were not making any arrangements to \n     treat the sick, some newly-free Jews stole to bring those in \n     need of medical care to a hospital. Those Germans from the \n     camps who eluded imprisonment tried to disguise themselves as \n     Jews so that the Russians would not capture them. Ratz \n     chillingly recounts seeing guards from the camp, now wearing \n     prisoners' uniforms, hiding in a crowd. Speaking to the \n     Soviet soldiers in Russian, he pointed them out and watched \n     as the soldiers shot them on the spot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10532-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1645\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, Senator Hatch has a substitute amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for Mr. \n     Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 3601.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nedition of the Record.]\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nS. 2193, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act (TLT Act), along \nwith some important technical amendments. I wish that Congress was \ndoing more work on intellectual property issues to maintain America's \npreeminence in the realm of technology. Specifically I wish we were at \nconference on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which would \nimplement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties. We \nshould also be passing the Patent Bill, which would help America's \ninventors of today and tomorrow. I am glad however, at the very least, \nthat we are at last considering the TLT Act.\n\n\n              the trademark law treaty implementation act\n\n  The TLT Act, which Senator Hatch and I introduced to implement the \nTrademark Law Treaty of 1994, is an important step in our continuing \nendeavor to harmonize trademark law around the world so that American \nbusinesses--particularly small American businesses like so many of the \nbusinesses in Vermont--seeking to expand internationally will face \nsimplified and straightforward trademark registration procedures in \nforeign countries.\n  Today more than ever before, trademarks are among the most valuable \nassets of business. One of the major obstacles in securing \ninternational trademark protection is the difficulty and cost involved \nin obtaining and maintaining a registration in each and every country. \nCountries around the world have a number of varying requirements for \nfiling trademark applications, many of which are nonsubstantive and \nvery confusing. Because of these difficulties, many U.S. businesses, \nespecially smaller businesses, are forced to concentrate their efforts \non registering their trademarks only in certain major countries while \npirates freely register their marks in other countries.\n  The Trademark Law Treaty will eliminate many of the arduous \nregistration requirements of foreign countries by enacting a list of \nmaximum requirements for trademark procedures. Eliminating needless \nformalities will be an enormous step in the direction of a rational \ntrademark system which will benefit American business, especially \nsmaller businesses, to expand into the international market more \nfreely. Fortunately, the Trademark Law Treaty has already been signed \nby thirty-five countries and was ratified by the Senate on June 26, \n1998.\n  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the International Trademark \nAssociation, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association all \nsupport the Trademark Law Treaty and the TLT Act. In a letter to me \ndated July 1, 1998, the International Trademark Association stated that \nthe Trademark law Treaty is ``critical to the success of U.S. companies \nas they operate in the rapidly expanding and ever increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace.'' The American Intellectual Property \nLaw Association, in a letter to me dated July 13, 1998, explained: \n``The Trademark Law Treaty harmonizes a number of the requirements and \nprocedures associated with the filing, registration and renewal of \ntrademarks. It has the potential to bring significant improvements in \nthe trademark practices of a number of important countries around the \nworld in which U.S. trademark owners seek protection. By conforming its \ntrademark law with the obligations of the TLT and ratifying the treaty, \nthe United States can exercise leadership to encourage additional \nnations, particularly those with burdensome procedural requirements, to \nalso adhere.''\n\n\n                     the technical corrections bill\n\n  I also support the amendment to this legislation of S. 2192, the \ntrademark technical corrections bill. This measure contains several \nmostly technical amendments to the Lanham Act. The most important of \nthese amendments addresses the status of ``functional'' shapes as \ntrademarks. Functional shapes are those whose features are dictated by \nutilitarian considerations. Under current law, the registration as a \ntrademark of a functional shape becomes ``incontestable'' after 5 years\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\neven though it should never have been registered in the first place. S. \n2192 would correct this anomaly by adding functionality as a ground of \ncancellation of a mark at any time. The U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice, the International Trademark Association, and the American \nIntellectual Property Law Association all support the trademark \ntechnical corrections bill. To date, I have not heard any opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  I hope that after passage of the TLT Act, Congress can get back to \nwork on our other pressing intellectual property issues, namely the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act and the Patent Bill, to fortify \nAmerican intellectual property rights around the world and to help \nunleash the full potential of America's most creative industries.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Res. 103\n\n       Whereas the International Commission of Jurists is a non-\n     governmental organization founded in 1952 to defend the Rule \n     of Law throughout the world and to work towards the full \n     observance of the provisions in the Universal Declaration of \n     Human Rights;\n       Whereas in 1959, 1960, and 1964, the International \n     Commission of Jurists examined Chinese policy in Tibet, \n     violations of human rights in Tibet, and the position of \n     Tibet in international law;\n       Whereas in 1960, the International Commission of Jurists \n     found ``that acts of genocide has been committed in Tibet in \n     an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group, * * \n     *'' and concluded that Tibet was at least ``a de facto \n     independent State'' prior to 1951 and that Tibet was a \n     ``legitimate concern of the United Nations even on the \n     restrictive interpretation of matters `essentially within the \n     domestic jurisdiction' of a State.'';\n       Whereas these findings were presented to the United Nations \n     General Assembly, which adopted three resolutions (1959, \n     1961, and 1965) calling on the People's Republic of China to \n     ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of the \n     Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and \n     religious life, and to cease practices which deprive the \n     Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms \n     including their right to self-determination;\n       Whereas in December 1997, the International Commission of \n     Jurists issued a fourth report on Tibet, examining human \n     rights and the rule of law, including self-determination;\n       Whereas the President has repeatedly indicated his support \n     for substantive dialogue\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n     between the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     the Dalai Lama or his representatives; and\n       Whereas on October 31, 1997, the Secretary of State \n     appointed a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to oversee \n     United States policy regarding Tibet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representative \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses grave concern regarding the findings of the \n     December 1997 International Commission of Jurists report on \n     Tibet that--\n       (A) repression in Tibet has increased steadily since 1994, \n     resulting in heightened control on religious activity; a \n     denunciation campaign against the Dalai Lama unprecedented \n     since the Cultural Revolution; an increase in political \n     arrests; suppression of peaceful protests; and an accelerated \n     movement of Chinese to Tibet; and\n       (B) in 1997, the People's Republic of China labeled the \n     Tibetan Buddhist culture, which has flourished in Tibet since \n     the seventh century, as a ``foreign culture'' in order to \n     facilitate indoctrination of Tibetans in Chinese socialist \n     ideology and the process of national and cultural \n     extermination;\n       (2) supports the recommendations contained in the report \n     referred to in paragraph (1) that--\n       (A) call on the People's Republic of China--\n       (i) to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives on a solution to the question of Tibet;\n       (ii) to ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of \n     the Tibetan people; and\n       (iii) to end those practices which threaten to erode the \n     distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the \n     Tibetan people and, in particular, to cease policies which \n     result in the movement of Chinese people to Tibetan \n     territory;\n       (B) call on the United Nations General Assembly to resume \n     its debate on the question of Tibet based on its resolutions \n     of 1959, 1961, and 1965; and\n       (C) call on the Dalai Lama or his representatives to enter \n     into discussions with the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China on a solution to the question of Tibet;\n       (3) commends the appointment by the Secretary of State of a \n     United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues--\n       (A) to promote substantive dialogue between the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives;\n       (B) to coordinate United States Government policies, \n     programs, and projects concerning Tibet;\n       (C) to consult with the Congress on policies relevant to \n     Tibet and the future and welfare of all Tibetan people, and \n     to report to Congress in partial fulfillment of the \n     requirements of section 536(a) of the Public Law 103-236; and\n       (D) to advance United States policy which seeks to protect \n     the unique religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage of \n     Tibet, and to encourage improved respect for Tibetan human \n     rights;\n       (4) calls on the People's Republic of China to release from \n     detention the 9-year old Panchen Lama, Gedhun Cheokyi Nyima, \n     to his home in Tibet from which he was taken on May 17, 1995, \n     and to allow him to pursue his religious studies without \n     interference and according to tradition;\n       (5) commends the President for publicly urging President \n     Jiang Zemin, during their recent summit meeting in Beijing, \n     to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama; and\n       (6) calls on the President to continue to work to secure an \n     agreement to begin substantive negotiations between the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai \n     Lama or his representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10536-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2286) to amend the National School Lunch Act and \n     the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to provide children with \n     increased access to food and nutrition assistance, to \n     simplify program operations and improve program management, \n     to extend certain authorities contained in those Acts through \n     fiscal year 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that I am, at the \nclosing here, passing this bill about which I have strong reservations \nbecause I was not able to place an amendment in and have an amendment \ndebated on this bill. But this is the child nutrition bill, and I \nunderstand a lot of very important things need to be done.\n  I very much would have liked to have had the opportunity to debate \nsomething that all the nutrition groups, all of the public interest \ngroups, as well as a lot of manufacturers who use peanuts, would love \nto have seen, and that is an opportunity for us not to have the Child \nNutrition Program paying an exorbitant amount of money, more than they \nneed to, robbing children of the ability to get food in other places \nbecause we pay such high prices for peanuts in this country for food \nprograms.\n  It would be nice if we would have been able to debate that amendment, \nbut we can't.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, is it my pleasure today to join my \ncolleagues on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee \nin supporting S. 2286, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization \nAmendments of 1998. This important bill expands subsidies for snacks in \nafter-school programs, establishes a research program for universal \nschool breakfasts, and makes several administrative changes in the \nschool food service programs, in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) \nProgram and in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). I believe \nthat we have developed a good bill that represents real progress for \nchild nutrition and school food services and I am pleased it has \nreceived strong bipartisan support.\n  I'd like to take a few moments to elaborate on a few aspects of the \nbill that are particularly important to South Dakotans and to all \nAmericans. I am a cosponsor of the Schools for Achievement Act, which \nwould give all children, regardless of income, access to a healthy, \nfree breakfast. While we were unable to find consensus on a way to fund \na universal breakfast program, S. 2286 establishes a multi-year free \nbreakfast study. The study will be conducted at several sites, both \nrural and urban, and will rigorously evaluate impact of free \nbreakfasts. The purpose of authorizing this study is to test whether \nproviding breakfast at school helps children perform better \nscholastically and improves overall levels of child nutrition. I am \nconfident the school breakfast project will justify consideration of \nthe Schools for Achievement Act.\n  For Congress to have access to the benefits of this study, however, \nwe need to ensure that it will be funded. Funding for the school \nbreakfast research project is uncertain in the House companion bill, \nbecause H.R. 3874 includes only authorizing language and relies on the \nAppropriations Committee to fund the project. As we all are aware, \nfunds available to the Appropriations Committee have been greatly \nconstrained by last year's Balanced Budget Agreement. If funding were \nunavailable, this research would be delayed, and the intentions of the \nauthorizers would be undermined. We in the Senate have determined that\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nthis study should be conducted and have fully paid for it in the \ncontext of the Senate bill. I hope the conferees will agree to this \nposition and agree to provide mandatory funding for this project.\n  I would also like to acknowledge that this is a study only. Nothing \nin this provision would automatically lead to full implementation of a \nfree breakfast program. Congress will need to revisit this issue to \ndetermine whether it would be in the best interest of the Nation to \ntake such a step. I believe this is a prudent way to proceed.\n  The liberalized administrative guidelines and expanded funding for \nafter-school snacks are also welcome ideas in South Dakota, where our \nstate government recently made a $700,000 commitment to promoting and \nincreasing after-school care. I strongly support that effort, as well \nas efforts to improve access to after-school programs nationwide. The \nlegislation before the Senate today is another small step toward better \ncare for our nation's school-age children.\n  Finally, I would like to reassert my support for the programs being \nreauthorized by this legislation. Federal nutrition programs have a \nlong, successful, track record of providing food, establishing \nnutrition standards, and collecting health information that have had a \ndramatic impact on reducing hunger in our country. School lunches are \nserved to 35 million children around the nation. Seven million children \nreceive school breakfasts. Teachers, parents, child care providers and \nschool cooks are educated on the importance of good nutrition and about \nthe necessary components of a healthy diet. Homeless children are \nserved, commodities are distributed, and thousands of school children \nreceive milk. Given the demonstrated effect of improved nutrition on \ncognition and behavior, the impact of our investment in the nutritional \nneeds of our nation has been profound. I commend the Committee's \nefforts and look forward to working with my colleagues to enact final \nlegislation to renew these very important child nutrition programs \nbefore the year is over.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, \nS. 2286, be considered read a third time, and the Senate then proceed \nto the consideration of calendar No. 480, H.R. 3874, the House-passed \ncompanion measure. I further ask consent that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and the text of S. 2286 be inserted in lieu thereof, \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table. I further ask consent that the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. I finally \nask that S. 2286 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3874), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

If I can, let us return to the issue that we have spent \na great deal of the day debating. I know the hour is late. Let me thank \nthe staff who are here, the pages, and others. The pages are actually \nvery happy I am up here talking, because if I talk for a little while \nlonger they will not have school in the morning. So that will be a good \nthing for them--as I see the smiles down there and the encouragement to \nwind it up and get going.\n  I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his indulgence in presiding \nduring these remarks. But as I mentioned today, I think this is one of \nthe most important issues we can face here in the U.S. Senate. As the \nSenator from Ohio eloquently said, it begins the process of defining \nwho we are as a country and what will become of us as a civilization if \nwe do not begin to draw lines where lines need to be drawn.\n  I just find it remarkable that we seem to create these fictions when \nit comes to life. When it comes to the life of little children, we \ncreate this fiction in our mind. And it was a fiction that was created \nback when Roe v. Wade was decided that these were not really babies.\n  We did not have good ultrasounds then and the kind of technology \nwhere we could really see how developed these little babies were in the \nwomb. They were just sort of passed off as these sort of blobs. Yet, we \nnow know, through the miracle of ultrasound, and other techniques, that \nthese are precious little developing babies.\n  It is very difficult as a father who has seen those ultrasounds of \nour children to dismiss the humanity, that my wife Karen was carrying a \nblob of tissue or something that was prehuman. But we tell these lies \nto ourselves in order that we can go on and in order that we can sort \nof live with our own internal inconsistencies.\n  One lie you cannot tell, one lie that is inescapable--inescapably \nalive--is the lie of partial-birth abortion being something that is \nmedically necessary or that simply this baby is just sort of this blob \nof tissue. This baby is outside of the mother. Its arms, its legs, its \ntorso, outside of the mother--just inches away from being born.\n  One of the things I often marvel at--and I just do not understand--is \nwhy wouldn't you, if you have gone through the process, as I described \nearlier today, of dilating the cervex over 3 days, reaching in with \nforceps and pulling the baby out in a breached position, which is \ndangerous, again, for the baby and mother, and you deliver that entire \nbaby, why wouldn't you just let the rest of the baby come out?\n  Why is it necessary to protect the health of the mother at that point \nin time--now that you have gone through all this other procedure--at \nthat very crucial moment when the doctor takes those scissors and \nbegins the process of killing that baby? Why at that moment is the \nmother's health in less danger if you kill that baby than if you just \ngave that little, helpless, defenseless and, yes, even at times \nimperfect life the opportunity for life?\n  Why does that so endanger the mother to do that? Why is it necessary \nto thrust these Metzenbaum scissors into the base of the baby's skull? \nWhy is it necessary to suction the baby's brains out?\n  So many doctors have described to me in testimony--and today at a \npress conference--the complications resulting from this blind procedure \nwhere the physician has to feel for the base of the neck and could slip \nand miss. As the Senator from Tennessee testified today, there are \nlarge vessels, blood vessels within a centimeter from the point where \nthis procedure is done that a minor miss could lacerate and cause \nhemorrhaging and severe complications, or by thrusting the scissors in \nthe back of the neck, through a bony part of the brain, you could only \nimagine what would happen to the skull of that baby and what damage \nthat skull could do to the mother.\n  How can we--how can we--continue to contend or pretend that this is \nhealthy for the mother to end this baby's life when it is this close \nand a delivery could be performed? Let's get away from that charade \nbecause it is a charade. It is not about the health of the mother; it \nis about killing a baby. It is about making sure, beyond any certainty, \nbeyond any doubt, that the result of this abortion you are going to \nhave is a dead baby.\n  That is what this is about. This is about a lethal form of abortion, \nnot a healthy form for the mother--far from it. Even folks who disagree \nwith this legislation will tell you that this very well may not be the \nsafest form. In fact, that organization has not done any studies to \nprove it is safe, that is, the American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecologists. They have done no studies to prove that this procedure \nis safe, that this procedure is preferable.\n  They say--they say--and I will quote them--they say:\n\n       [We] could identify no circumstances under which this \n     procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  That is an admission by the organization that all those in opposition \nto this bill use as their medical shield. Listen to what they say. They \nnever read this part of the letter. They only read the second part, \nwhich I will read to fully disclose. I will read it again, an ACOG \npolicy statement emanating from the review declared that:\n\n       A select panel [the panel they selected to review this] \n     could identify no circumstances under which this procedure \n     [partial-birth abortion], would be the only option to save \n     the life or preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  They went on to say that a partial-birth abortion:\n\n       . . . however, may be the best or most appropriate \n     procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or \n     preserve the health of a woman.\n\n  They say that:\n\n       . . . only the doctor, in consultation with the patient \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision.\n\n  That is what you hear from the other side. What you do not hear from \nthe other side is that this report lists no circumstances to support \nthat claim. They can give, and in fact have given--this was written \nwell over a year ago--they have given no medical situation, no \nscenario, no hypothetical where what they say may happen would, in \nfact, happen, which is that a partial-birth abortion would be \npreferable to some other procedure. They just think it might.\n\n  Now, I might be wrong, but there are probably very few things that \nare happening in obstetrics today that haven't happened for the past \nseveral years. There are not a lot of new things coming up. There are \nproblems that come up routinely. There may be some strange problems; \nthey are probably not new.\n  To make this kind of statement and support it with no evidence is \nirresponsible. To use this organization and this statement as a shield \nwhen they cannot provide one single example where this procedure would \nbe preferable, again, just builds up the record that I have laid out. \nThis entire debate is based upon a series of misleading statements to \ntry to divert attention away from the horrible, barbaric reality and \nthe fact that this is not a medically necessary procedure.\n  I want to get back for 1 minute to the issue of life of the mother \nwhich I addressed a few minutes ago. I said I would read the piece of \nlegislation itself to put to bed, if you will, any concern by anyone \nwho might be listening that there isn't a legitimate life-of-the-mother \nexception. I noted the American Medical Association's letter of \nendorsement of this bill. They believe there is a legitimate exception \nif the life of the mother is in danger.\n  Let me read the actual legislation, the paragraph on prohibition of \npartial-birth abortion:\n\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\n\n       . . . shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is \n     necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is \n     endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.\n\n  Now, I cannot imagine a life-of-the-mother situation this does not \ncover. In fact, I don't recall any example from the other side of a \nlife-of-the-mother situation that this does not cover. They just say it \nis different from other life-of-the-mother exceptions that we put \nforward. But they don't say where the ``hole'' is in the exception.\n  I think it is very clear and very certain that there is an adequate \nprotection in that case.\n  I will say that I cannot imagine--and I have talked to many \nphysicians on this point--I cannot imagine a woman coming into an \nemergency room where her life is in danger, whether she is hemorrhaging \nor has preeclampsia--I can't imagine a doctor, being presented with \nthis emergency case where they must act within a short period of time, \nsaying, ``We are going to dilate your cervix over a 3-day period of \ntime and we will perform this procedure.'' That just wouldn't happen. \nIt is almost absurd to suggest that this would actually be used in a \nsituation where the life of the mother was threatened.\n  Yes, there is a life-of-the-mother exception, but there is absolutely \nno circumstance I could conceive of--and I don't recall any information \nfrom any of the medical experts by the other side coming out and saying \nmedical experts believe that there is a case where the life of the \nmother is in danger in an emergency situation where they may use this. \nI don't think they even made claims of the woman presenting herself to \na hospital or a clinic, where her life is in danger, that any \npractitioner would use a 3-day procedure.\n  While there is a life-of-the-mother exception in there, and I think \nit is a solid one, it is certainly not one that I believe will ever be \nused, because this procedure certainly doesn't comport with a life-\nthreatening situation because of the time it takes.\n  Since I have the AMA letter here, I want to read it. I think it is \nimportant for the Record to reflect the support of the American Medical \nAssociation, ``physicians dedicated to the health of America.'' That is \ntheir saying under their logo.\n  They say:\n\n       Our support of this legislation is based on three specific \n     principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimate \n     exception where the life of the mother was endangered, \n     thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any \n     medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. \n     Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited \n     procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation \n     what act is to be banned. Finally, the bill would give any \n     accused physician the right to have his or her conduct \n     reviewed by the State medical board before a criminal trial \n     commenced. In this manner, the bill would provide a formal \n     role for valuable medical peer determination in any \n     enforcement proceeding.\n       The AMA believes that with these changes, physicians will \n     be on notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited \n     conduct.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards \n     restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.\n\n  Not good medicine.\n  With respect to the points they make, many of the courts--while some \nhave validated the statutes, some of the courts have been concerned \nabout vagueness, of what procedure we are actually defining.\n  We worked with the American Medical Association to come up with a new \ndefinition, a tighter definition that put the physician, as they say, \non notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited conduct, which I \nthink is important to meet constitutional scrutiny.\n  Second, we provide an opportunity for the procedure and the conduct \nof the physician to be reviewed by the State medical board to see \nwhether, in fact, it was necessary under some circumstance, which was \nan important peer review element that we think is a safeguard, if you \nwill, for the physician.\n  A couple of other points that I want to make before I go back to \ntalking about what I was talking about when we had to conclude debate \nearlier today.\n  This is a picture of a young man by the name of Tony Melendez. That \nis Tony. Tony Melendez will be here in Washington tomorrow up in the \nSenate gallery watching the vote on partial-birth abortion, because \nTony's disability, Tony's handicap, is one of the disabilities that has \nbeen mentioned here on the floor as a good reason to perform a partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  Senators come up and say there are children who will be so grossly \ndeformed. They may be blind--I am not making this up; this is what was \nsaid--blind, or without arms or without legs, and they went on with \nother deformities. Well, Tony Melendez is a thalidomide baby. Tony \nMelendez doesn't have any arms. Tony Melendez was born in Rivas, \nNicaragua. His father was a graduate of the International Academy of \nAgriculture in this town and had a good job in the sugar refinery.\n  Sara, his mother, was an elementary school teacher. They had their \nfirst child, named Jose. In the summer of 1961, she had a second \npregnancy. She was given thalidomide to treat her morning sicknesses \nbecause it was hailed as a safer alternative to other sedatives to deal \nwith morning sickness. On January 9, 1962, Sara gave birth to Tony. He \nhad no arms, 11 toes, and a severe club foot that would require \nsurgical repair if he were ever to have a chance to walk. He was \ntypical of babies who were exposed to thalidomide at the early stages \nof pregnancy.\n  Well, his family was very concerned about showing the baby to the \nmother because of the fear of her reaction. When they did give little \nTony to his mother, she embraced her child with the confidence that he \nwould live a full and meaningful life, regardless of his flaws. Still \nthere was question of how he could live a normal life with no arms. \nYoung Tony answered the question one day when he was in his crib. His \nmother had put away the toys that he had been given as gifts because \nshe assumed he would be unable to enjoy them. However, Tony showed he \ncould play just like any other child when a red balloon landed in his \ncrib. He began bouncing it up and down with his feet, laughing and \ngiggling. She placed the toys in the crib and vowed that day that she \nwould never assume Tony could not do anything because of his \ndisability. She would let him try.\n  Tony needed corrective surgery for his club foot. Since Nicaragua did \nnot have adequate facilities, or the level of care he needed, they went \nto Los Angeles. Due to the nature and length of time involved in Tony's \ncorrective surgery, the family decided to stay in the United States and \nbecome citizens. Tony spent most of his childhood in Southeastern \nCalifornia.\n  Tony enjoyed sports, particularly volley ball--volley ball?--where he \nwould hit the ball with his head back over the net. And, of course, he \nliked soccer. As a sixth grader, Tony wanted to play a game that the \nneighbor kids were playing, in which his brother Jose excelled--\nbasketball. He tried, with great difficulty, with his feet to do what \nhis peers did so easily with their hands. After being told by his \nbrother that he could not do it, he was determined to do it, and \ndespite blistering and even bleeding toes, one day he eventually \nsucceeded. The one thing Tony hated more than anything else was growing \nup and not being treated as an equal. When once asked whether he \npreferred to be called handicapped or disabled, Tony responded that he \nwould like to be called ``human.''\n  At the age of 14, in high school, he demanded to be transferred out \nof a handicapped class to the regular classroom with students. He was \nallowed to go to a normal gym class. In his first gym class, he was \nwatched intensely by the others when class started. Jumping jacks? How \nwould a kid with no arms do jumping jacks? The other kids tried to \ndetermine that, and they watched and tried to be subtle in looking. And \nTony jumped and shouted and counted in unison with the others. The rest \nof the class accepted him readily.\n  In his teenage years, Tony showed a talent for music. He learned to \nplay the guitar with his feet. At first, he played at various events, \nsuch as weddings, funerals, and special events at his church. \nEventually, he turned his guitar talent into a full-time vocation. Here \nis a picture of Tony Melendez today. In connection with his church, he \nwould also talk to groups of kids about his story and how one can \novercome difficulty. Tony's life was such an inspirational story, and \nhe was selected to be a ``gift'' to the Pope by a Catholic youth group \nduring a papal visit to California in 1987. Tony gave a performance to \na live audience of 6,000 at the Universal Amphitheater in Hollywood. He \nperformed at World Youth\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\nDay in 1991 and World Youth Day in Denver 1993. He also has appeared on \nnumerous television shows and performed at major sporting events, \nrecently singing the National Anthem at Yankee Stadium, I believe. Tony \nnow resides in Dallas, Texas.\n  Why do I talk about Tony Melendez? Today on the floor of the Senate, \nthe Senator from California referred to some people up in the galleries \nas women who needed to have partial-birth abortions, and that they \nwould be here tomorrow standing in the Halls staring at Senators as \nthey walked in here to make sure they knew--that we knew they were \nthere to keep this procedure legal. Tony Melendez, and so many like \nTony who are not perfect in the eyes of our society--but, of course, \nare perfect in the eyes of God--will be there also to represent the \nmillions of little babies who could not be there themselves, to remind \nevery Member that walks on this floor that there is a severe cost, a \nhuman cost to what we will be voting on tomorrow. And the ones who have \nthe arrow or the bull's-eye on their back, who are the target of \npartial-birth abortion--at least if you believe the arguments on the \nother side--are people like Tony Melendez who, because they are not \nperfect, don't deserve to live.\n  I have always found it ironic, and I will never forget the last time \nwe brought this bill up on the floor of the Senate. I remember standing \nhere waiting for the debate to begin and working on some remarks, and \nthe debate that was going on around us. The vote that was finally taken \nwas on a bill to provide individuals with disabilities the right to an \neducation in a classroom. I will never forget the Members, many of \nwhich oppose banning partial-birth abortions; I will never forget those \nMembers coming to the floor and standing up with passion, which I \nrespect, admire, and support, about how children with disabilities \nshould have the right to live a fulfilling, complete life, and should \nbe given rights to education. Or as they did under the Americans With \nDisability Act, where they should have the right to public \ntransportation, the right to have access to buildings, to cut the curbs \nat the corners so they can have access to sidewalks--rights, rights, \nrights--with the passion that was the hallmark of liberalism in this \ncountry--until this issue, because with the very next vote they cast \nthey made this statement: If you can survive the womb, we will defend \nyour rights. But we will not defend your right to be born in the first \nplace. In fact, you are the very reason this procedure needs to \ncontinue, because we don't want you. You are not what we are looking \nfor in people.\n  What a loss this country would have without Tony Melendez. But had \npartial-birth abortions been around when Tony was in his mother's womb, \nmany on this floor would stand up and argue that he is just the kind of \nbaby that we need to get rid of with this procedure. The Bible says, \nand Abraham Lincoln quoted, ``A house divided against itself cannot \nstand.'' You cannot stand up and passionately argue for the rights of \nthe disabled, and with the same breath not give them the right to exist \nin the first place. It doesn't make sense. It isn't logical or \nrational. Oh, it may be political; it may make sense because little \nbabies in the womb don't vote, but it makes no logical sense, and it \nmakes no moral sense to draw that line where it doesn't exist.\n  The Senator from Illinois said today that we should not have this \ndebate with anecdotes. Yet, this debate has been all anecdotes on the \nother side because the facts are not in their favor. So I thought it \nwas important to present some anecdotes on the other side, to lay out \nwhat we are missing. Tony's is a happy story, but earlier today I \ntalked about some stories that were not so happy. The endings were so \nfairy tale-like.\n  Let me talk about another one of those stories--a little girl named \nMary Bernadette French. In 1993, Jeannie French was overjoyed to learn \nshe was pregnant with twins. Four months into her pregnancy, tragedy \nstruck and Jeannie learned her daughter Mary was not developing \nnormally.\n  Specialists identified an opening at the base of the baby's neck. \nMary was diagnosed with occipital encephalocele, a condition in which \nthe majority of the brain develops outside the skull. Prospects for a \nnormal life for the child were very dim. Jeannie's doctors advised her \nto abort Mary due to the severity of the disability and in order to \nreduce the complications of the twin birth.\n  What a horrible thing she must have had to deal with--two lives \nwithin her, one, according to the doctor, potentially threatening the \nother. Because Mary could not have survived normal labor, Jeannie and \nher husband opted for a cesarean section. In December of 1993, Mary was \nborn 1 minute after her twin brother, Will. Hospital staff promptly \nmoved Will to the nursery. Mary stayed with her parents, was welcomed \ninto the world by her parents, grandparents, and close friends of the \nfamily. Mary was held, loved, and serenaded for 6 hours. She quietly \npassed away that afternoon.\n  That is little Mary in the arms, I believe, of her grandmother.\n  In memory of her daughter, Jeannie French testified in favor of the \nban on partial-birth abortions before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nShe explained that Mary's life was short but meaningful. She entreated \nthe committee: ``Some children by nature cannot live. If we are to call \nourselves a civilized culture, we must allow that their death be \nnatural, peaceful, and painless. And if other pre-born children face a \nlife of disability, let us welcome them into society with our arms open \nin love.''\n  For the Record, Jeannie French requested meetings with the President, \npleading with him on more than one occasion to listen to a fellow \nDemocrat, she said, who is on the other side of the debate. She \nexplained in the letter:\n\n       We simply want the truth to be heard regarding the risks of \n     carrying disabled children to term. You say that partial-\n     birth abortion has to be legal, for cases like ours, because \n     women's bodies would be ``ripped to shreds'' by carrying \n     their very sick children to term. By your repeated \n     statements, you imply that partial-birth abortion is the only \n     or most desirable response to children suffering severe \n     disabilities like our children.\n\n  What she showed is that instead of giving her child a death sentence, \nshe found it within herself to love that child. She found it within \nherself to name that child, to welcome that child into the family, to \ncommit to that child as a child who will always be part of the family, \nwho will always be in her memory and in the memory of her twin \nbrother--not a bag of tissue discarded and executed, ignored, and put \nbehind them, but loved, accepted, welcomed, and committed to memory; \nwith pain, yes, but with the knowledge that in the 6 hours that little \nMary Bernadette French lived, she knew love. She was loved by her \nmother and father. What greater gift can a parent give? What a life, as \nshort as it was, to know only love and her parents.\n  Jeannie continues her efforts today to educate the public about \npartial-birth abortion. She also works to ensure that people know that \nthe lives of disabled children, while short, are sometimes painful and \nnot in vain because they teach us so much about us.\n  Finally, a case--I hate to say ``case''; a little girl--a little girl \nwho I talked about a lot last year, a little girl by the name of Donna \nJoy Watts who, with Tony Melendez tomorrow, will be here as another \nexample--in this case, a real life example--of how a mother, who was \nnot only asked and encouraged but almost forced to abort her child, \ncould not find a hospital to deliver her child.\n  The Watts family, Donny and Lori Watts, had to go to three hospitals \nin Maryland to find a hospital that would deliver their child. We hear \nso much talk on the floor about, ``We need to make sure that women have \naccess to abortion.'' What we are finding out and what I have found out \nthrough this debate is that we actually need to make sure that women \nwho want to deliver their baby have access to a hospital to deliver \ntheir baby and have access to care once that baby is delivered.\n  The Wattses ended up at a hospital in Baltimore. Their daughter was \ndiagnosed with multiple problems. Hydrocephalus was the principal one. \nAgain, hydrocephalus is water on the brain. She had so much cerebral \nfluid that it impeded the normal development of the brain. In her case, \nthey believed that she had little to no brain. But the Watts family \nsaid they were going to move forward, that they were going to accept \nand love their child, and they wanted to deliver their child and give \nit every opportunity for life.\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\n  At every step of the process, even the last step, the OB/GYNs \nrecommended abortion, because not only did she have hydrocephalus but \npart of her brain was developing outside of her skull, and that this \nbaby had no chance of survival.\n  She was born on November 26, 1991, through cesarean section. Again, \nan option available for hydrocephalus, because the baby's head is too \nbig to go through the birth canal, is to do a cesarean section. There \nare other methods: Draining the fluid from the head and then delivering \nthrough the vagina. In this case, they chose cesarean section.\n  She was born with very serious health problems. The most remarkable \nthing after the birth was that the hospital staff made no attempt to \nfeed her in the traditional sense. The doctors at the University of \nMaryland where she was delivered believed that Donna Joy's deformities \nwould prevent her from suckling, eating, or swallowing. Because a \nneural tube defect made her feeding difficult, Donna received only IV \nfluids for the first days of her life. But Lori refused to give up. \nInitially, she fed breast milk to Donna Joy with a sterilized eye \ndropper to provide sustenance, because they wouldn't feed her. Then, at \n2 weeks of age, the shunt that was placed in Donna Joy's head--by the \nway, the shunt. It took 3 days for Lori and Donny to convince the \ndoctors to do an operation on her brain to relieve the pressure from \nthe fluid. The doctors thought she was just going to die, so they \ndidn't want to treat her. But finally after 3 days of pounding away at \nthe doctors they did the procedure. Two weeks later, the shunt, which \nallows the fluid to drain from the brain, failed, and she was \nreadmitted to the hospital for corrective surgery.\n\n  When the tray of food was delivered to their hospital room by \nmistake, Lori had a brainstorm. She mashed the contents together, \ncreated her own food for the newborn with rice, bananas and baby \nformula, and she fed the mixture to the baby one drop at a time with a \nfeeding syringe. Unfortunately, Donna Joy's fight for life became even \nmore complicated.\n  After 2 months, she underwent an operation to correct occipital--I \nwon't get into the terms but another problem. After 4 months, a CT scan \nrevealed that she also suffered from another condition which results \nfrom an incomplete cleavage of the brain. She also suffered from \nepilepsy, sleep disorder, and continued digestive complications. In \nfact, the baby's neurologist said, ``We may have to consider placement \nof a gastronomy tube in order to maintain her nutrition and physical \ngrowth.''\n  She still had hydrocephaly, or water on the brain, and she couldn't \nhold her head up because it was so heavy. She suffered from apnea--in \nother words, a condition where breathing spontaneously stops. She had \nseveral brushes with death. She had undergone eight brain operations.\n  Finally, through all of that trauma and all of the problems, she \nsurvived and she will be here tomorrow. Donna Joy continues to be, at 6 \nyears of age, an inspiration. She continues to battle \nholoprosencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, tunnel \nvision, and Arnold-Chiari Type II malformation that prevents formation \nof her medulla oblongata.\n  Despite these hardships, having only a small fraction of her brain, \nshe runs, walks, plays, has a healthy appetite and even likes Big \nMac's, and she is taking karate lessons now. She has earned her white \nbelt and performed in karate demonstrations.\n  Before Donna Joy moved to Pennsylvania, Greencastle, PA, Franklin \nCounty, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening honored her with a \ncertificate of courage commemorating her fifth birthday. Mayor Steve \nSager, of Hagerstown, MD, proclaimed her birthday Donna Joy Watts Day. \nMembers of the Scott Bakula Fan Club, who is someone who helped Donna \nJoy get through some very difficult times with his songs, have sent \ndonations and Christmas presents to the Watts family. People from \naround the world have learned about Donna Joy on the Internet and \nwrite, e-mail her, and send her gifts. But perhaps the most important \nthing was because of Donna Joy's determination, it inspired a Denver \ncouple to fight for their little boy under similar circumstances.\n  This is Donna Joy's story, this little girl who was considered by the \nmedical world as somebody who was not worthy to live, someone on \nrepeated occasions who would have been aborted using partial-birth \nabortion, who I have had the time to spend time with, and my children \nhave, too. She is not a burden, although I understand from Lori she can \nbe a handful like any other 6-year old. She is not a heartache or a \nsorrow, as some would describe children with disabilities who need to \nbe aborted. She is a beautiful, marvelous, wonderfully made gift from \nGod, who has inspired so many to understand just that fact. She will be \nhere tomorrow, possibly standing next to the women who want to keep \nthis procedure legal, so we can kill people like Donna Joy Watts in a \nbrutal fashion, in an inhumane fashion, in a painful fashion, in a \nfashion, as I quoted today from the AMA Journal, that would violate \nFederal regulations on the treatment of animals used in research. We \ncould not do to animals used in research legally in this country, we \ncould not do what we do every day in this country to little babies \nbecause they are not wanted, in some cases not wanted because of their \ndeformity but in the vast majority of cases they are just simply not \nwanted. What a high price to pay for one person not wanting you to be \naround, the ultimate price to pay.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to have the opportunity to show the world the \ndirection the United States of America is taking. We are involved right \nnow in a moral crisis in this country, on the front page of the paper \nevery day. It is no wonder that we are in a moral crisis.\n  Back in 1972, 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, many people said \nthat this was going to be a breakthrough for women and for children, \nthat all these wonderful things would happen to our society as a \nresult, to children and to women, as a result of the legalization of \nabortion. We would eliminate unwanted pregnancies, and the result of \nthat would be less child abuse because we wouldn't have all these \nchildren nobody wanted, illegitimacy would go down, child poverty would \ngo down because we wouldn't have all of these poor kids around that we \ndon't want. Spousal abuse would go down, divorce would go down, less \ncomplications in marriages and relationships.\n  It is a cruel joke. It almost seems laughable to think back 25 years \nand look at what has happened on every single count. All of the culture \nindicators that I mentioned go down worse and worse and worse. Those \nwho feared Roe v. Wade back in 1973 were very much on target. The fear \nwas that we would lose respect for life and that we would become so \ninsensitive to life that abortion would be just the beginning of the \nend of our selectivity of who we include in our society.\n  And so it has gone, to the point where now we can't even save a \nlittle baby almost born. I wish that were the worst. We now have State-\nassisted suicide laws. We now have debates, active debates on \neuthanasia. We even have an article from a professor at MIT who argues, \nor at least makes the case for infanticide--not infanticide on partial-\nbirth abortion but actual infanticide. And then we have the cases of \nprom mom and the Delaware couple and so many others where we hear \naround the country of babies being born and then murdered shortly after \nbirth. The initial reaction, while horror, at the same time is \nsympathy--sympathy for this difficult situation in which these children \nor kids were put.\n\n  We somehow see little children, little babies, different than older \nchildren. Older children--if you have killed your older children, that \nis really bad. We have no sympathy for you. But somehow, if you killed \na baby just born we try to figure out a way to get around it. We try to \nfigure out a way that that does not quite meet the threshold of murder. \nIf you look at the punishments meted out--substantially lower. They are \nsubstantially lower than other murder cases. We just do not value those \nlittle babies as much.\n  Why? Why? Is it any mystery why? If we start, as we have, down the \npath of not valuing those little babies because we do not value them in \nthe womb, or four-fifths outside the womb, or just newly outside the \nwomb, who is next? Look around. Who is going to be next? Who is going \nto be the next group of\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\npeople who we are not going to value, who does not have the might to \nforce down what they believe is right? I made it. I am here in this \nbody. I am whole. I am healthy. If you have not made it yet, watch it, \nbecause it then depends on whether you are on the committee that \ndecides, or you are on the court that decides who lives and who dies. \nBecause there is no line anymore. There is no truth on which we are \nbasing this. There is no ``life or nonlife.'' There is might. There is \npolitical power and that is what determines who lives and dies, who is \nvaluable and who is not.\n  Tomorrow, 34 Senators can exercise their might on who lives and dies. \nThey can decide for a country that a group of people, a group of little \nhelpless babies, do not belong.\n  I am hopeful that when tomorrow comes, after much prayer tonight by \nso many people all over the country, and the world, that three more \nMembers will open their eyes when they wake up in the morning and \nrealize that but for the grace of God, there go I, and that we have to \nopen our hearts more and include the least among us, the little \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/17/senate-section/article/S10545-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
