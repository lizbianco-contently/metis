Mr. President, as I understand the amendment, it would \nrequire States to enact the .08 alcohol content legislation instead of \nthe present, I think, .10 level of alcohol to be considered drunk. That \nhas to be done by September 30, 2000. Noncompliant States would lose 5 \npercent of highway funding on October 1, 2000, and then 10 percent \nthereafter. Currently, 15 States already have the .08 level of alcohol \ncontent to be considered drunk in drunk driving cases.\n  Mr. President, I think we should encourage people not to drink. We \nshould encourage all people not to drink excessively. We should do all \nthat we can to get the States to pass the lower level of .08. I support \nthat. We need to combat the problem of drunken driving.\n  I understand the tragedy and the ravages of people that drink and \ndrive. My father was killed in just such an accident. So this is not an \nissue that I take lightly. But I will oppose this amendment. This is a \ntypical Federal Government attitude--not to encourage you to do right, \nnot to say if you do the right thing, there will be incentives in it \nfor you; no; you do it our way, or we will punish you; you will lose \nfunds if you don't do it the way we say. Some people say President \nReagan did the same thing. Yes, and I opposed it then, too.\n  I am very much opposed to alcoholism and drinking and driving. But \nfor us to stand here and pontificate about how you must do it our way, \nthat this is the solution, or we are going to take your funds away, \nwhat about poor States like mine where people are killed every week \nbecause of bad roads, potholes in the roads, dangerous bridges? What \nabout safety? If a State, for whatever reason, by mistake or obviously \nfor the wrong reasons, doesn't do it, we take a big chunk of money away \nfrom them. Is that going to save lives? No. As a matter of fact, it may \nlead to more lives being lost.\n  So while I know this is well-intentioned, and while I support the \nintent or the goals of this legislation, the idea that we are going to \npunish States because you don't do it our way I think is the wrong \nthing to be doing. I hope my colleagues will think about this very, \nvery seriously before they cast a vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the able Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend our able majority leader on \nhis statement and the position he has taken in this matter. I am sick \nand tired of the Federal Government trying to dictate to the States and \nthreaten to withhold funds if the States don't do what the Federal \nGovernment wants.

I will yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, and \nthe Senator from Rhode Island wants 5 minutes, and the Senator from \nIllinois wants 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 10:30 is now evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nto add my voice to those of my colleagues, Senators Lautenberg and \nDeWine, in support of this amendment to require states to pass .08 \nblood alcohol content (BAC) laws.\n  People who drive while they are impaired are placing all of us in \nharm's way. The real issue is whether or not a person should be driving \nafter consuming alcohol. There is no good reason that this should be \naccepted as a standard practice in our society.\n  Opponents to this amendment will argue such things as ``this means \nthat a 120-pound woman could not drive after drinking two glasses of \nwine''. I believe they are missing the point. The point is that if a \nperson is impaired by alcohol, he or she should not be driving--period. \nThe point is that someone's BAC might reach .08 after consumption of a \ncertain amount of alcohol, and that BAC level might just be indicative \nof physical impairment that would affect driving ability. We are not \ntalking about someone being fallen-down drunk, but perhaps a young \nwoman whose reaction time might be slowed, so that as a young child \ndarts out into the street in front of her car, she is unable to react \nquickly, enough to hit the brakes in time to stop the car from hitting \nthe child. Was this woman ``drunk''? No, but the alcohol in her body \nslowed her reaction time.\n  Here are some facts from the National Institute on Alcohol and \nAlcohol Abuse at NIH that help to explain the issue:\n  The brain's control of eye movements is highly vulnerable to alcohol. \nIn driving, the eye must focus briefly on important objects and track \nthem as they and the vehicle being driven move. BAC's of .03 to .05 can \ninterfere with these eye movements.\n  Steering is a complex task in which the effects of alcohol on eye-to-\nhand reaction time are super-imposed upon the effects on vision, \nstudies have shown that significant impairment in steering ability may \nbegin at a BAC as low as .04.\n  Alcohol impairs nearly every aspect of information processing by the \nbrain. Alcohol-impaired drivers require more time to read a street sign \nor to respond to a traffic signal than unimpaired drivers. Research on \nthe effects of alcohol on performance by both automobile and aircraft \noperators shows a narrowing of the attention field starting at a BAC of \napproximately .04.\n  The National Public Services Research Institute reports the \nfollowing:\n  Approximately 10 percent of miles driven at BAC's of .08 and above \nare at BAC's between .08 and .10. Every year, crashes that involve \ndrivers at BAC's of .08 to .99 kill 660 people and injure 28,000.\n  Driving with a BAC of .08 is very risky. They estimate that crash \ncosts average $5.80 per mile driven with a BAC of .10 or higher, $2.50 \na mile for a BAC between .08 and .99, and only 11 cents a mile for each \nmile driven while sober.\n  The preliminary evaluation of the .08 legislation by the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration indicates that this law will \nreduce alcohol-related fatalities by 5 to 8 percent. This is at least \ncomparable to the impact of other laws such as zero tolerance for \nyouth, administrative license revocation or graduated licensing.\n  The evidence is clear. There is no good argument against the .08 \nlegislation. In fact, responsible alcohol distributors and \nmanufacturers should favor it. There is no excuse not to implement a \nlaw that could decrease traffic fatalities by 600 each year, and \ndecrease traffic-related injuries by many thousands. We need to be \nresponsible and encourage the implementation of .08 legislation in all \nstates, and to provide incentive for doing so.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to add my voice to my colleagues, \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator DeWine, and support this amendment to \nrequire States to pass the .08 blood alcohol content law.\n  Mr. President, people who drive while they are impaired are placing \nall of us in harm's way. That is really the issue. Now, opponents of \nthis amendment have argued that this is going to mean such a thing as, \n``A 120-pound woman could not drive after drinking two glasses of \nwine.'' I believe they miss the point. The point is, if a person is \nimpaired by alcohol, he or she should not be driving, period.\n  There are some important facts laid out by the National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse. It lays out clearly why this amendment is so important. \nThe evidence is really clear. There is no good reason and no good \nargument to be against this .08 legislation. In fact, responsible \nalcohol distributors and manufacturers should favor it.\n  There is no excuse not to implement a law that could decrease \nfatalities by 600 each year and decrease traffic-related injuries by \nmany thousands. We need to be responsible, and we need to encourage the \nimplementation of the .08 legislation in all States and to provide \nthose States incentives for doing so. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, I want to thank Minnesota Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving for all that they have done to educate all of us \nin my State, including me as a Senator. I have been at their \ngatherings, and I say to my colleague, Senator Lott, I absolutely \naccept what he says in the best of faith. I know he is committed to the \ngeneral concept. But I believe, after spending time with these families \nwho have lost so many loved ones in these accidents, that we ought to \nbe as tough as possible. This is a matter of public health. We ought to \nmake sure that we have as few people driving who are impaired from \nalcohol as possible around our country. This is an issue for our \nnational community. This is a\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\nmatter of public health. This is protection for families in our \ncountry. This is the right thing to do. I hope we get a strong majority \nvote for this amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lautenberg-\nDeWine amendment, and I commend both Senators for this excellent \namendment. It would, as previous speakers have discussed, establish a \n.08 blood alcohol concentration level, or BAC level, as a threshold for \ndriving under the influence throughout the United States.\n  As we all know, drunk driving is a scourge on the highways of the \nUnited States of America. It is something that we are all against. This \nlegislation would take a very positive step to ensure that all States \nprovide for a very rigorous .08 blood alcohol content standard as their \nmeasure of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n  This law builds on previous success. Since 1986, alcohol-related \nfatalities on our roads have decreased by 28 percent. That is a result \nof the efforts of many, many people. It is the result of tougher laws, \nincreased enforcement, public education, and particularly the work of \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, who have done so much to illustrate this \nproblem and reach policymakers throughout the United States. Although \nwe are proud of this success, we can and must do more.\n  In 1996, more than 17,000 people were killed because of drunk \ndriving. Now, these deaths are not accidents because these are \ntragedies that could have been avoided--many of them--if we had tougher \nlaws and better enforcement. That is what we are about today. We are \ntrying to declare throughout this country that we have a tough standard \nfor those who would drink and drive, a standard that would save lives \nthroughout this country in every community.\n  I don't think any of my colleagues would like to say to a family who \nlost a loved one and tell them, ``Well, the standard of .10 was OK,'' \nbecause in that situation it's not OK. We can do better. We know these \nlaws work, and we want to make them work much, much better.\n  In essence, the .08 blood alcohol concentration standard means fewer \ndeaths on the roads of America, fewer driving fatalities, fewer young \npeople cut down in the prime of their lives, and it means a safer \nAmerica. That is what we should stand for today.\n  Currently, 15 States already have adopted a .08 blood alcohol \nconcentration standard. A recent study by Boston University showed that \nthese States experienced a 16 percent decline in fatal driver crashes \nwhere the driver's BAC was .08 or greater. Already these States have \nshown that this standard saves lives. And we can do better.\n\n  It is estimated that nationally, if we adopt the .08 standard, we can \nsave between 500 and 600 lives a year. Those are impressive statistics. \nBut lives alone are not at stake. Each year drunk driving accidents \ncost this country $45 billion. That is six times more than we spend on \nPell grants. We can do better. We can save lives. We can save \nresources. We can make our world much, much safer.\n  There are those who argue that this would put a huge constraint on \nlaw-abiding Americans who occasionally will have a drink and then \ndrive. That is something I don't think is true at all because under \nthis standard a 170-pound man must consume more than four drinks in an \nhour on an empty stomach to reach this BAC. A woman of 135 pounds would \nhave to consume three drinks. That is not social drinking. That is \ndrinking irresponsibly, and then getting into an automobile.\n  This law will not affect the reasonable, rational, careful, \ndeliberate person who may have one social drink or two and then drive. \nIn fact, the American Medical Association said that really the \nbeginning of impairment is not .08, it is .05 blood alcohol content. So \nthis standard is far from what medical experts would argue is the \nbeginning of deterioration of motor skills when one drives an \nautomobile. We can do better. We have to recognize today that we must \ndo better.\n  There are those of my colleagues who have suggested that this \nproposal is an improper infringement on the prerogatives of the States. \nFirst of all, we have taken positive steps before in this land. For \nexample, just a few years ago we adopted through congressional action a \nzero-tolerance policy that would say for young people driving that the \nblood alcohol content was basically zero, that they should have no \ndrinks if they are driving an automobile, and we have seen success \nalready.\n  Mr. President, we have already seen the success of our zero-tolerance \npolicy throughout the United States, a policy that was promulgated \nthrough Congress and adopted by many States, where fatalities at night \nby younger drivers have dropped 16 percent in States that are following \nthe zero-tolerance policy.\n  So this law and this approach is not an impermissible imposition on \nthe States. It is a rational, reasonable way to encourage what is the \nright thing to do. It is small comfort that if one State, such as my \nState of Rhode Island, adopts this standard but it is not adopted next \ndoor in Massachusetts or Connecticut, and someone in Massachusetts \ncomes speeding into my State. That is not a States' rights issue. That \nis an issue of interstate commerce, of national economy, of national \nhighways that reach every corner of this country regardless of State \nlines. We don't stop the national highways at the State lines. We \nshouldn't stop good, sensible bills that will control drunk driving in \nthis country at the State lines.\n  I urge passage of this legislation, and again commend Senators \nLautenberg and DeWine for their excellent effort.\n  I yield my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes against \nthe amendment to the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regretfully I rise in opposition to this \namendment. I say regretfully because if I were in the State Senate of \nOklahoma, I would vote in favor of this amendment. Presently, there is \nno Federal standard or Federal law for blood alcohol level--none. So we \nhave an effort now to federalize a national problem. I don't think we \nshould do that.\n  I led the effort years ago that would allow the States to set speed \nlimits. I thought the States should set the speed limits, not the \nFederal Government. I didn't say that I thought every State should \nincrease their speed limits. I thought States should set the speed \nlimit.\n\n  What about the alcohol level? Again, if I were a State legislator, I \nwould support the lower level. Fifteen States have this level--.08. \nMaybe it should be lower. Let the States make that decision. I hate to \nfederalize problems, and I hate to tell the States that if they don't \ndo such and such we are going to withhold 10 percent of their money, or \n5 percent of their money the first few years and 10 percent thereafter.\n  Whose money is it? Is that Federal money? No. That money is paid for \nby our constituents, by our consumers, and by our people who are on the \nroad. They pay that money. It comes to Washington, DC, and now we start \nputting strings on it. We basically tell the States if you do not pass \na law that we have determined is best--and I don't know anything about \nblood alcohol limits. I have heard three beers, I have heard four \nbeers. I don't know. I have not done the homework. I will take their \nword for it. But really, should we be dictating or mandating that on \nthe States? I don't think so. And tell the States if they don't pass \nsuch and such, we are going to withhold 5 percent of their funds.\n  We are talking about millions and millions--hundreds of millions--of \ndollars. In a few years, it will be 10 percent. So it is a real heavy \npenalty if they don't subscribe to our Federal dictate. I just disagree \nwith that. That money came from the States. It came from individuals. \nThis is not Federal money. For us to put on these strings, I think is a \nmistake.\n  I am very sympathetic to the goal of the authors of the amendment, \nand I compliment them for trying to say we want to reduce drunken \ndrivers on the streets. I want to do the same thing. I just do not \nagree with their tactics.\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\n  The Commerce Committee amendment has some incentives to encourage \nStates to lower levels, and if the States lower those levels, they can \nget more money. In other words, a little bit of a carrot. This is a \nheavy stick. As a matter of fact, this is more than a heavy stick. This \nis a dagger. This says you have to do it. I think we should encourage \nit.\n  Again, I go back to the Constitution. Sometimes we ignore the \nConstitution. But the 10th amendment to the Constitution says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Time and time again we come to this body and we find a problem. And \ndrunk driving is a real serious problem. But we want to have a Federal \nsolution: The Federal Government knows best. I think the framers of the \nConstitution were right when they said we should reserve those powers \nto the States and to the people, and encourage the States--maybe even \ngive them a little bonus--if they make some moves that we think would \nbe positive. But to federalize it and now, for the first time in \nhistory, have a blood alcohol content which has always been the \nprerogative of the States, in my opinion, is wrong.\n  I can count the votes. My guess is that the proponents probably have \nthe votes.\n  But I think, again, we are trampling on States' rights. We are also \ntrampling on this idea or encouraging this idea that if there is a \nproblem, we need a Federal solution, and we will not give back your \nmoney. I resented that when I was a State legislator. I resented the \nfact that when we sent our highway moneys to Washington, DC, from our \nState, we only got about 80 cents back. That bothered me. We would only \nget about 80 cents on the dollar back. Then, not only that, when we got \nthe 80 cents back, we got all the strings attached: You have to have \nthe Federal highway speed limit; you have to have all of these other \nFederal requirements; you have to have the Davis-Bacon standard. You \nhave to pass all of these rules. By the time we complied with those \nrules, that dollar would only buy about 60 some cents' worth of road. \nIt wasn't a very good deal for our State.\n  So I would like to not put more punitive actions on the States if \nthey don't comply with what we think--Government knows best.\n  Again, I want to compliment the authors. But I think this is an \nintrusion into States and I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Let me at the outset salute my colleagues, Senator Frank Lautenberg \nof New Jersey and Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, who are, on a bipartisan \nbasis, offering an amendment today which is critically important to the \nsafety of American families.\n  America has learned the dangers of drunk driving. Americans \nunderstand that we lose one of our neighbors, or one of our children, \nor one of our friends, or one of the people we work with every 30 \nminutes to a drunk driver--every 30 minutes. America understands that \nthis law which we are debating will save 500 to 600 lives each year. It \nwill spare countless parents, spouses, and friends from the senseless \ntragedy of drunk driving deaths.\n  America understands. Does the U.S. Senate understand? The vote will \nanswer the question in just a few moments.\n  Let me address the issue of States rights. I don't believe this \ndebate is about States rights. I think it is time, in this particular \nsituation, to reject this well-worn argument when it comes to saving \nlives.\n  I can remember this argument about States rights a few years ago when \nI served in the House because there was a hodgepodge of standards \naround the United States. In some States you could drink at the age of \n18, some at the age of 21, and we decided to make it uniform. The \nStates said this is a mistake, that the Federal Government shouldn't to \nit, that it is the heavy hand of Central Government trying to impose \nits will on States. Of course, it made no sense.\n  In my home State of Illinois, where the kids at night would drive \nacross the border to Wisconsin and drink legally and then drive home \ndrunk, killing themselves and innocent people, it made no sense. We \nrejected it. We said it will be a national uniform standard drinking \nage of 21. What we are saying here is that we will have a national \nuniform standard when it comes to drunk driving.\n  This debate is not about protecting States rights. This debate is \nabout protecting families that live in every State. It is about \nprotecting families who go on vacation from State to State and worry \nabout their safety. It is about people who go to the store and think it \nis just a casual trip in the car and find, because of a drunk driver, \nthat a fatal accident or a serious accident resulting. That is what \nthis debate is really about. Families that cross State lines shouldn't \nfear that there is more danger in one State or the other to drunk \ndrivers.\n  I think we have to react to the reality of the number of Americans \nwho are losing their lives each year because of drunk driving.\n  The New York Times probably said it best in the title to its \neditorial: ``One Nation, Drunk or Sober.'' Should it be a different \nstandard in each State because of the issue of States rights? Can you \nimagine going to the funeral home, can you imagine meeting with the \ngrieving parents, or the students when someone has lost a classmate, \nand saying, ``I am sorry we cannot do more on drunk driving because it \nis an issue of States rights?'' How empty that argument sounds when we \nare talking about saving lives.\n  When you look at the groups that are supporting this, listen to what \nthe Wall Street Journal has to say. This is no liberal organization. It \nis pretty conservative. And they say:\n\n       Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, \n     not the lobby for Hooters and Harrah's. The Lautenberg-\n     DeWine-Lowey amendment isn't a drive toward prohibition \n     but an uphill push toward health consensus.\n\n  Then go to the experts--not only the health experts--who will tell \nyou that the impairment of drivers at .08 is a serious matter. They \nestimate that some 40 percent of all of the alcohol-related accidents \noccur with people who have been drinking and have imbibed at a level \nthat doesn't quite reach .10 but is at .08, and still is very serious.\n  Then, of course, go beyond the health experts. Talk to the law \nenforcement people--the people who respond to these accidents, the \npeople who have to see the tragedy when someone makes a terrible \ndecision to drink and drive and, as a consequence, lives are lost and \npeople are injured. They stand shoulder to shoulder begging us to pass \nthis Lautenberg-DeWine amendment, as does the organization, Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving.\n  I want to salute them especially. This is the type of political \nmovement in America which is really, I guess, unique to our country; \npeople who have been touched by tragedy come together and say, ``Let's \nmake a difference; let's spare other lives that might be lost.'' \nMothers Against Drunk Drivers, Students Against Drunk Driving in \nIllinois and around the Nation have really led this debate.\n  I am happy to stand in support of the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. I \nthink doing this will not only save lives, but it will put to rest once \nand for all this empty argument that this is really about States \nrights. This is about much more. It is about the rights of every family \nin every State to get on the highway and to realize that they can be \nsafe.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I, in control of the opponents' time, \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman for the \ntime.\n  Mr. President, we are here again talking about an issue that seems to \ncome up every time there are highway bills and highway funds to be \ndistributed. We always come up with this question of process, of who \nhas the responsibility to make the kinds of laws that would be there.\n  I am disappointed that some of the speakers just previous have \nindicated\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\nthey don't think the States have the ability to make the decisions, \nthat they don't think the State legislatures feel as passionately about \ndrunken driving as we do. I think they do. I have been there. To say, \n``Well, this is something the States simply can't do, or aren't capable \nof doing, or don't care about,'' it seems to me is not fair or \nbalanced.\n  I think we ought to talk about the process here. And the process is, \nhow do we best deal with States as a Federal entity, in this case, with \nhighway funding? This isn't the first kind of mandate that has been \napplied. Every time this comes up we have mandates, whether it be \nhighways, helmets, whether it be speed limits--which, by the way, were \nput on in a similar kind of process and were changed later because it \ndidn't work very well.\n  There is no one in this place or no one that I know of in the whole \ncountry who doesn't want to do more about preserving safety in \ndriving. There is no one here who cares more about the losses that we \nhave. That is not the issue here. The issue is process, procedure, and \nwhat is the proper role in doing it. I think we ought to consider \nincentives, and we have done that; $25 million of incentives here for \nthe States to do this. But instead we move towards penalties.\n\n  We have been through this a number of times, and we are back at it \nagain. I think we ought to give the leadership. And the President wants \nto give leadership on this issue. Why doesn't he do that as President? \nWe can do that. If this is the proper level, and I do not disagree with \nit, I would support it in my State, my State legislature. But the \nprocess is what we are talking about. Should this body say to the \nStates, ``Look, if you want the money that your people pay into the \nfund, if you want it back, then you have to do what the Congress \nprescribes\"? It is not as if the money came from somewhere else. This \nmoney came from the States.\n  So it is a difficult one and I, frankly, have misgivings about even \nrising to talk about it, but I do think the system is important. The \nprocess is important here, and we ought to really consider it over a \nperiod of time, as to how much of this sort of thing we do. We do it \neach time this arises.\n  So I think we ought to put on all the pressure that we can. I think \nwe ought to have all the incentives that are possible to move towards \nsafer driving, to move toward doing something about drunk driving \nlosses. But I think we also ought to ask ourselves about where do we \nstop in this idea of penalizing the States if they do not properly \nadhere to what this body proclaims they ought to do.\n  So I appreciate very much the opportunity for us to debate this. I \nam, of course, a great supporter of this bill, and hope we can move \nforward with it. I, frankly, hope we can do it without encumbering it \nwith mandates of any kind. I thought we were going to be able to do \nthat this year. The fact is the committee, I think it is fair to say, \nprobably wasn't in support of doing it and therefore it did not come \nout of the committee that way. But now, of course, we are continuing to \nwork on it. So I hope we can find additional ways, other ways, \nincentives to move towards .08. I have no objection to that. On the \ncontrary, I support it.\n  On the other hand, I do think it is necessary for us, over time, to \ntake a strong look at the kinds of processes and procedures that we \nimpose on the States. I am sorry I cannot make as light of States \nrights as has been made on the floor this morning, as if it does not \npertain. It does, in fact, pertain. And we have different kinds of \nconditions.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time, I thank the chairman for his \ntime, and I look forward to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I urge opponents, please come to the \nfloor. We have something like 25 minutes left on the opponents' time. \nHere is the opportunity that they have to speak. So I urge any \nopponents who wish to speak to come quickly to the floor. Now is the \nchance to voice their opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know the Senator from Ohio has been looking for \nsome time. I ask the Senator how much time he needs.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me inquire, if I could, how much time the proponents \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have a little over 10 minutes. \nThe opponents have a little over 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the chairman of the committee, the Senator from \nRhode Island, whether or not, if he does not have any opposition \nspeakers, he might help us out with a few minutes?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes; I will be glad to. If there is nobody here who \nwishes to speak against, and we have time left, I am certainly glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator from Ohio, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate some of the very eloquent \ncomments that have been made this morning on the Senate floor. I \nappreciate the comments about States rights. Let me say, though, that \nthere are very few times when we, as Members of the Senate, can come to \nthe floor and cast our votes when we will know that the vote we cast \nwill save lives. That is true in this case. There is absolutely no \ndoubt about it. Lives will be saved and families will be spared the \nheartache of losing a child or mother or father.\n  There are other things I think we clearly know and that are not in \ndispute. That is one. The second is that no one has come to the floor \nsuggesting that a person who tests .08 has any business being behind \nthe wheel of a car. That is not really in dispute at all. No doctor who \nhas looked at this, no emergency room doctor who has looked at it, no \npolice officer who is involved in testing people, pulling them over and \nseeing what they test and looking at their reflexes, looking at how \nthey act --everyone who has had that experience agrees--at .08, no one \nshould be behind the wheel. If anyone has a doubt about it, think of it \nthis way: If you were at a party and someone had four beers in an hour \nand you watched him drink those four beers in an hour, and you observed \nhe didn't have anything to eat, four beers in 1 hour, and he looked \nover after that time and said, ``Let me take your little 5-year-old \ndaughter''--my daughter, a 5-year-old, is named Anna--``Let me take her \nup to the Tastee-Freez and buy her an ice cream cone; I'll drive her \nup.'' How many of us would put her in that car? We would not do that. \nThere is no doubt about it. So it is absolutely a reasonable standard.\n  Does it include social drinkers? We are not talking about one or two \nbeers and a pizza. We are talking about people who have absolutely no \nbusiness behind the wheel of a car.\n  I think Ronald Reagan did say it best. I think he had it right in \n1984. He supported a similar type concept, and that concept was that \nthere should be a minimum standard across the country for the drinking \nage, and it should be 21 no matter where you were in the country. He \nsupported that. The great champion of States rights said in this case a \nnational uniform standard will save lives and makes common sense. This \nis what Ronald Reagan said in 1984 when he signed the bill:\n\n       This problem is much more than just a State problem. It's a \n     national tragedy. There are some special cases in which \n     overwhelming need can be dealt with by prudent and limited \n     Federal influence. In a case like this I have no misgivings \n     about a judicious use of Federal inducements to save precious \n     lives.\n\n  It is a minimum standard. It is a rational standard. Doesn't it make \nsense that when you get in your car and put your family in the car and \ngo on a trip--many of us cross two or three State lines every week; \nevery day, some of us--doesn't it make sense there should be some \nassurance that there is a minimum standard that exists, no matter where \nyou drive your car in this country? Doesn't that make sense? I think it \ndoes.\n  So, I think it is a question--yes, it is a question of rights. The \nrights of families, the right to live, the right to have a fair chance \non the highway not to have someone come at you who has been drinking \nand driving. That is what this is all about.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment in the vote\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\nthat will take place in 20 or 25 minutes. It is a rare opportunity \namong all the things we debate, all the rhetoric--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield another minute to the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It is a rare opportunity to save lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to take this rare opportunity and spare a family, spare \nhundreds of families, life's greatest tragedy, and that is the loss of \na loved one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator Lautenberg and Senator Dewine to implement \na nationwide .08 blood alcohol level requirement for DUI offenses.\n  Let me begin by saying that I agree with those who say alcohol \nconsumption--and how much is enough--should be a matter of personal \nresponsibility. Adults should have the common sense to know when enough \nis enough and when not to get behind the wheel.\n  Tragically, however, the statistics show common sense is not that \ncommon.\n  In California, we already have the .08 standard and still the \naccident rates are staggering. According the California Highway Patrol, \nthere were 91,654 DUI arrests and 37,622 DUI accidents in 1996. Also in \nthat year, there were 1,254 fatalities and 35,654 injuries due to DUI-\nrelated accidents. Let me remind you this is with the standard we are \npushing for in this bill.\n  To put these statistics in perspective, in California there were \n3,555 total traffic fatalities in 1996. Nearly 40 percent of the \ntraffic fatalities in California in 1996 were alcohol related. I \nunderstand this is consistent with the national average which show that \n41 percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol related.\n  According to a MADD survey, 68.8 Americans support lowering the legal \nblood alcohol limit to .08. That same survey showed that 53 percent of \nAmericans consider drunk drivers to be the nation's number one highway \nsafety problem.\n  However, when you cut through the numbers, this is really an issue \nabout saving lives and about personal safety. Every American--no matter \nwhere they live--has a right to feel safe on our highways. I believe \ntough DUI laws, including strict blood alcohol limits, do reduce drunk \ndriving and do make our roads safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, drunk drivers are a menace to all of us. \nLast September, a car driven by an alcohol-impaired teenager went off \nthe road near Montpelier, Vermont, killing teenagers Brian Redmond and \nRyan Kitchen. This was a rare enough tragedy in Vermont that it sent \nthe entire state into mourning. Nationwide, however, the story is far \ndifferent. More than 40 percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol-\nrelated--more than 17,000 in 1996 alone.\n  I am proud that Vermont is one of only 15 states that already has a \n.08 blood alcohol standard. Vermonters have a longstanding awareness of \nthe dangers of drunk driving, and I advocated adoption of the toughest \nstate drunk driving laws in the nation while serving as State's \nAttorney in Chittenden County. Today, Vermont has a state law which \nlowers the threshold for drivers under the age of 21 to .02 percent, \none of the toughest laws in the nation.\n  The amendment which we are considering will establish a .08 standard \nin all 50 states. If enacted, states will have three years to enact .08 \nlaws, or they will have a portion of their highway construction funds \nwithheld. With all due respect to the cosponsors of this amendment, I \nhave reservations about this approach. I have always been a senator who \nbelieves that, whenever possible, Congress should respect each state's \nright to govern itself. I am uncomfortable when we in Washington say \nthat we will penalize states financially when they do not behave as we \nsee fit. I think we in Congress use that threat too often. Instead of \npunishments, we should offer incentives for states to adopt tougher \ndrinking and driving laws. It would be better to offer supplemental \ntransportation resources to those states that meet a higher standard. \nThe rest of the states would follow soon enough once they see their \nneighbors benefitting from doing the right thing.\n  Nevertheless, I am convinced that Senator Lautenberg's amendment will \nsave lives, just as the .08 standard has saved lives in Vermont. \nAlthough this amendment will not directly affect Vermont, I will vote \nfor it. I am convinced that we can send a strong signal to all \nAmericans that there should be one standard for drinking and driving. \nThis nation has made some progress in the war on drinking and driving, \nand with this legislation we can save still more lives.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I share the concern of my colleagues from \nNew Jersey and Ohio, and all the cosponsors of this amendment.\n  I am in complete agreement with the view that there should be a no \ntolerance policy for drinking and driving. That kind of \nirresponsibility is inexcusable; the senseless human tragedy it \nproduces is unpardonable. Our laws should be severe enough to deter \nanyone who thinks he or she can abuse alcohol and drive without \nimpairment. Our law enforcement officials should have the tools they \nneed to locate and stop these accidents waiting to happen.\n  My state of Idaho is one of the states that has already adopted a \nblood alcohol content standard of .08 percent. They believed this was a \nreasonable standard, based on sound data, that would help save lives. \nOther states have come to the same conclusion and made the same choice.\n  And that brings me to my point.\n  While I would support a strong resolution from this Senate denouncing \ndrunk driving or even recommending the adoption of this particular \nblood alcohol content standard, I cannot endorse this amendment. The \nfederal government should leave this decision to the states, where it \nconstitutionally belongs in the first place.\n  I am confident if the facts truly support it, this standard will be \nadopted voluntarily by every state. However, I am not willing to say \ntoday that this is the one and only way to solve the terrible problem \nof drunk driving, nor that it is the best way. We've heard a lot on \nthis floor and from the administration about how our states are \n``laboratories of ideas.'' Instead of burdening them with new federal \nmandates, we should be ensuring they have the maximum freedom and \nflexibility to work out effective solutions for local problems, \nespecially problems of this magnitude.\n  In short, transportation dollars that are critical to public safety \nshould not be threatened in order to force states into compliance with \nthe ``solution of the day''--no matter how well intended.\n  While I strongly agree with the goal of stopping drunk driving in \nAmerica, I strongly disagree with the path this amendment would take to \nachieve that goal. For all of these reasons, I have no alternative but \nto vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bi-partisan \namendment introduced by Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. DeWine to set a national \nillegal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit of .08 for drivers over age \n21. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bill upon which this \namendment is based.\n  Mr. President, the drunk driving problem is a national disgrace. Its \nsevere emotional and financial costs to society are staggering. In \n1996, more than 17,000 Americans died in alcohol-related crashes. That \nmeans someone in America loses a loved one every 30 seconds to a driver \nwho is drunk. In 1996, more than 321,000 persons were injured in \ncrashes where police report that alcohol was present.\n  When you count up the health care costs, lost work, and other \neconomic impacts, alcohol-related crashes also add up to a monetary \nloss to society of more than $44 billion every year. It's not \nsurprising that a recent survey by Allstate identified drunk driving as \nthe #1 highway safety problem in the eyes of a majority of Americans.\n  We know that the physical and mental abilities of virtually all \ndrivers are impaired at .08. This impairment includes critical driving \ntasks such as vision, balance, reaction time and hearing, judgement, \nand the ability to concentrate. The heightened risk of a crash starts \nwith the first drink, but rises rapidly when BAC is as high as .08. For \nexample, the National Highway\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\nTraffic Safety Administration has concluded that, in single-vehicle \ncrashes, the relative risk for drivers with a BAC between .05 and .09 \nis more than 11 times greater than for drivers with no alcohol in their \nsystems.\n  Although setting a minimum BAC isn't the only answer to our national \ndrunk driving problem, it's a necessary part of the solution. Studies \nshow that .08 actually has saved lives where it is law by deterring \nunsafe drinking behavior. In fact, figures show that even heavy \ndrinkers, who account for a large number of drunk driving arrests, are \nless likely to get behind the wheel because of .08 laws. We also should \nremember that .08 makes it easier for police and courts to do their \njobs--they are less likely accept excuses when faced with offenders who \nhave BAC levels at or around .10.\n  A national strategy to require driver safety measures like this one \nhas worked before. We have seen, for example, how earlier national laws \nthat require seat belts and mandate zero tolerance for drinking and \ndriving under age 21 dramatically have reduced driving fatalities. More \nthan an estimated 16,000 lives have been saved since 1975 by the 21 \ndrink age law. It also is very important to remember that the concept \nof .08 is not new or radical. 15 States already have adopted .08. Many \nindustrialized nations have even lower legal limits ranging from .02 to \n.08.\n  Don't be misled by those who may argue that .08 laws prohibit \nreasonable alcohol consumption. Such is not the experience of States \nthat have adopted this law. To be legally drunk under a .08 standard, a \n170-pound male must consume four and a half drinks in an hour and on an \nempty stomach. That's not what I consider social drinking and that's \njust not the kind of behavior that most of us who drive would consider \nsafe.\n  Mr. President, we need .08 BAC as a national limit. Having one \nmandatory national standard doesn't permit confusion about what's safe \nand what's reasonable. Pedestrians, passengers, and safe drivers all \nneed protection from drunk drivers no matter where they live.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the Lautenberg amendment \nhave about 4\\1/2\\ minutes. Those opposed have about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself such time as \nwe have available, with the hope that when the Senator from Rhode \nIsland returns we will be able to--will the Senator from Rhode Island \nallow 5 minutes to me at this juncture if there is no one else?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. I think the Senator has a little time left. Why \ndoesn't he consume that and go into our time for the remainder?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. OK.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think we will have plenty of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself as much time as I have available.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent we add Senator Hollings as a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are getting to the point where we \nare going to wrap up this debate. I thank my friend and colleague from \nOhio, Senator Mike DeWine, for his support, his commitment, and his \nwork on this issue. He has fought tenaciously to reduce drunk driving. \nI hope he and I at the end of this debate will be able to shake hands \non behalf of the American people and say we have done something good \nthis morning.\n  I remind our colleagues, as I listen to the debate, about the issues \nthat I hear being discussed. Frankly, it bewilders me, because I stand \nnext to the picture of a child who was 9 when a drunk driver took her \nlife. I hear discussions of process, that the process is the issue. The \nprocess is not the issue. The issue is whether or not we want to say to \nevery American parent, ``We have done something more to save, perhaps, \nyour child or your grandchild or your sister or your brother.'' That is \nthe issue, and that is, I hope, what the American people are going to \nsay when they look at the vote count and say, ``My Senator stood up for \nlife.''\n  ``My Senator,'' on the other hand, they can brag, ``proudly, stood up \nfor process.''\n  Can you imagine in the homes across America, all the people who are \ngoing to be applauding because someone stood up for process? It is \noutrageous. It cannot be that way.\n  In the balcony sit people I have come to know, people I have come to \nknow very well: Brenda, Randy and Stephanie Frazier--mother, father and \nsister of Ashley.\n  I wish I could ask them to speak about their view of process, whether \nor not they think that process is the thing that we ought to be talking \nabout. Or should we be talking about the loss that they had, that they \ndo not want anyone else to experience.\n  Before Senators vote on this amendment, I ask them to think about \ntheir children and think about the pain that could come from the loss \nof a child they know and love. Today we can spare parents across this \ncountry, in all 50 States, the grief experienced by the Frazier family.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the happy hour is over for drunk drivers. \nEvery year in this country more people are killed in alcohol-related \ncrashes than were killed in our worst year of fighting in Vietnam. And \nthe country stood in national mourning at that time. By lowering to .08 \nthe blood alcohol level at which a person is considered legally drunk, \nwe can save more than 500 lives each year.\n  Mr. President, drunk driving is a crime, a crime like assault, like \nshooting at someone, like murder; and it should be treated with the \nsame severity as other crimes that bring harm or death to another \nperson. We can prevent many injuries and deaths that result from drunk \ndriving by making .08 the national alcohol limit, just like 21 is the \ndrinking age limit across the country. And if we do that, we could save \nlots of lives, like other westernized countries--like Canada, like \nIreland, like Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland. Poland has a .03 \nBAC, and Sweden .02.\n  We can make .08 work in America, if we pass this amendment and \ndeclare our opposition to violence on our highways. Because it is at \n.08 that a person's capacity to function is impaired. Their vision, \nbalance, reaction time, judgment, self-control--this is the level at \nwhich they are medically drunk. And if they are deemed medically drunk, \nwe ought to deem them legally drunk, in every State, no matter where \nthey live.\n  Mr. President, the alcohol lobby is trying to bottle up this bill. We \nare not targeting social drinkers. We are targeting drunk drivers. And \nwhen you get drunk, it is your business. But when you get drunk and \ndrive, it is our business. We are not asking people to stop drinking. \nWe are not running a temperance society here. We are asking them not to \ndrive if they are drunk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed all of the \nproponents' time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. About 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, 3 more minutes from the opponents' side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  By enacting this law, we can stand with our Nation's families and \nprevent the loss of life that tears a family apart. We can stand with \nthe public interest against the narrow opposition of special interests.\n  Mr. President, we should do the right thing and pass this amendment. \nThe Washington Post said it this morning in its editorial: The vote is \na vote to create ``a single, clear certified and effective standard \nacross the country as to what constitutes drunk driving.''\n  Let us vote to protect our children, our families--not drunk drivers. \nAnd I ask everybody to take one final look at this beautiful child's \nface before they cast a vote.\n  I will yield the floor, but before doing that, Mr. President, I say \nthank you to my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for his support \nfor this amendment, and also to the Senator from Montana who has been \nforthright and supportive of this amendment as well.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been asked for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned over the high \nincidence of highway fatalities in our country that involve alcohol.\n  In 1996, more than 17,000 lives were lost as a result of alcohol-\nrelated collisions out of the 40,000 deaths overall in our country. So \nthat is about nearly half. I believe that this measure will help reduce \nthat.\n  I understand the views of the opponents who think that it should be \nleft to the States. But when you have a small State such as mine where \nthere are people who are constantly going into the neighboring States, \nback and forth, it seems to me that in order to make our highways \nsafer, and which obviously involves out-of-Staters, a law such as this \nis necessary. So I support it, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, and from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in support \nof the amendment to strengthen drunk driving laws throughout the \nNation.\n  I am very concerned about the safety of our nation's highways. I am \nparticularly troubled by the high incidence of highway motor vehicle \ninjuries and fatalities involving alcohol. The statistics are truly \nalarming. In 1996, more than 17,000 lives were lost on our nation's \nhighways as a result of alcohol-related collisions. This represents \nnearly half of the 40,000 fatalities that occur on U.S. highways every \nyear. The real tragedy, however, is that drunk driving accidents are \ncompletely avoidable.\n  This amendment would strengthen drunk driving laws across the country \nand dramatically reduce the number of fatalities attributable to \ndriving while intoxicated. The amendment specifically targets those \nstates that have not enacted a .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) drunk \ndriving law.\n  In 1997, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration \n(NHTSA) issued a report entitled ``Setting Limits, Saving lives: The \nCase for .08 BAC Laws.'' The report cited studies which indicate that \nvirtually all drivers, regardless of skill, are significantly impaired \nat the .08 BAC level. At that level, basic driving skills such as \nbraking, steering and speed control, as well as judgment, reaction \ntime, and focused attention are adversely affected.\n  Contrary to the claims of those who oppose this amendment, the .08 \nstandard does not punish social drinking. To exceed the .08 limit, one \nwould need to consume an excessive amount of alcohol. The NHTSA report \nincludes an example. In order to exceed the .08 BAC level, a 170 pound \nmale would need to consume more than four drinks in an hour, while a \n137-pound woman would need to consume three drinks, the report \nindicates.\n  Despite these statistics, 35 states still maintain the higher .10 \nstandard before someone is considered legally drunk--and that puts many \nlives at risk. Drunk drivers not only risk their own lives, but the \nlives of every other motorist on the road. The .08 level is a sensible \napproach to preventing senseless tragedies on our nation's roadways. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma would like some time. \nAnd the opponents have 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 10 minutes remaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the situation \nsuch that we are going to vote either up or down on the amendment or a \nmotion to table the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table could be made.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand. Is the amendment amendable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the motion to table fails, it will then be \nsubject to amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is it subject to amendment prior to a motion to table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement prohibits that \nat the present time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons why I rise in opposition to the \namendment is, the penalty is too hard. I care just as much about the \nchild that Senator Lautenberg alluded to as anybody else. I care just \nas much about wanting to eliminate drunk driving as anybody in this \nChamber.\n  The penalty under this bill is too harsh. And 10 percent of the \nhighway funds is--looking at any State--the State of Texas is $1 \nbillion over 6 years. That is a pretty big penalty. The penalty in my \nState of Oklahoma is $200 million. That is a pretty big penalty.\n  The reason why I was asking or inquiring about is it amendable is \nthat maybe we should change the penalty from 5 percent and 10 percent \nto half a percent and 1 percent. You are still talking about real money \nthat would be a real incentive, but 10 percent is too high. In other \nwords, we want to encourage States.\n  I mention the Commerce Committee amendment has an incentive program. \nIt is not a lot. I think we found out from staff--I did not know when I \nmade my earlier comments--$25 million, not much of a carrot, a little \nbit of a carrot. So we encourage States to do it. Maybe that should be \nenhanced a little bit.\n  But I look at the draconian penalties in this thing. This thing is \nreally a dagger at the highway program to take 10 percent of the funds. \nIn the State of Michigan you are talking about $477 million. That is a \nlot of money. I mean, so the penalties, in my opinion, are too high.\n  The reason why I was inquiring about a second-degree amendment is \nmaybe we should change the penalty and make it 1 percent or 2 percent \ninstead of 10 percent. I think it is too much of a gun at the head of \nthe States and saying, ``You have to do this or you're going to lose \nhundreds of millions of dollars.''\n  The State of Texas would lose $1 billion over 6 years. The State of \nCalifornia over $1 billion. For the State of California it would be \n$1.3 billion over a 6-year period of time. That is a lot of money.\n  So I understand the desire that some people want to Federalize \nalcohol-content crimes. That, I believe, should be left in the State's \njurisdiction. I kind of wonder, if you have States that are not \ncomplying--maybe the States are going to change their law but do not \nreally enforce it. Are we going to have the Federal Government come in \nand say, ``Wait a minute. Now you're going to have to monitor the \namount of enforcement''?\n  We cannot have the State of Rhode Island say, well, they are going to \nchange the law but not really enforce it until you get over the .1. I \ndo not know that that would happen, but I question the wisdom of \nFederalizing blood alcohol content.\n  It has not been a Federal crime. It has not been a Federal incidence. \nNow we are saying the Federal Government is telling the States, you \nhave to do this or you will lose hundreds of millions of dollars--in \nsome States billions of dollars. I think it is overkill. I think it is \ntoo punitive. I think we should consider--and maybe we will not do it \nnow; I know the bill has a little ways to go; it still has the \nconference--but if this provision is going to be in, I think we should \nreduce the penalties.\n\n  I think it is far too harsh. It is too much of a dictate, too much of \na mandate, too much trampling on, I believe, of the Federal Government \nsaying, ``Before you get your money back, you must do the following: \nBefore you get your highway money back, we're going to put an \nadditional string on it, an additional penalty, up to 10 percent, which \nis hundreds of millions of dollars.'' I think it goes too far.\n  So, Mr. President, one other comment. My colleagues alluded to the \nfact that in 1984 we did something comparable, and we had a national \ndrinking age of 21. Now, it might surprise some of my colleagues on the \nother side. I supported that. And the reason is, I live very close to \nthe border in Oklahoma. And Oklahoma had a 21; Kansas had an 18. And we \nhad people running back and forth across the State line to take \nadvantage of that situation. Not a very safe situation. So I supported \nit.\n  I saw some differences in that provision, although the penalty was \nstill\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\nvery high. It was too high then, in my opinion. This, I think, is a \nlittle bit different. Now we are Federalizing blood alcohol content, \nand I seriously doubt the wisdom of doing that. And we are putting far \ntoo heavy of a burden on the States for noncompliance.\n  Again, for those of us that read the Constitution and say all of the \nrights and powers are reserved to States and the people, I think some \nof our colleagues and proponents, who have very good intentions, in the \nbill are saying, there is a problem and, therefore, we have to have a \nFederal solution. We are going to use the heavy hand of the Federal \nGovernment and withhold funds that come from the States, come from the \npeople, and say, you cannot have that money back unless you do as we \ndetermine what is proper. I think that is a mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have additional time for opponents. How \nmuch time is there for the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Four and a half minutes. So now is the time. Again, I \nurge any opponents to please come to the floor and use that time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island would yield for \na question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am a supporter of the amendment, but I am wondering if \nI might use one minute if no one else is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. Let us leave it this way: The Senator from South \nDakota can proceed. If somebody comes in on this side and wants to \nspeak in opposition, then I would appreciate it if the Senator would \nthen yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma was discussing the 21-year-old drinking \nage. That was established in legislation by Congress some long while \nago. In fact, I believe the provisions in that bill, with respect to \npenalties for those States that would not comply, are identical to the \nprovisions of the penalties in this bill.\n  We have decided, as a country, there are certain things that are \nnational in scope. Our road program is a national program, a program of \npriorities. And I think this amendment simply says, let us determine \nwhat represents drunk driving so that you are not driving in one State \nversus another, and come up to an intersection, when you cross the \nState line, and find someone driving down the road that is drunk but in \nfact is not legally drunk because that State has a different set of \nrules.\n  In fact, you can now--and I hope to change this--you can now drive \nand drink in five States. In five States you can put a whiskey bottle \nin one hand and a driver's wheel in the other and drive down the road \nand you are legal. In over 20 States someone else in the car can have a \nparty while the driver drives as long as the driver does not drink.\n  I also will propose, following this amendment at some point, that in \nevery State in this country we have a prohibition on open containers of \nalcohol in vehicles. So the point I wanted to make with respect to the \ncomments by the previous speaker was, we have tried incentive programs.\n  For example, a number of years ago we had an incentive program. \nIncentive grants were established, since the early 1990s, with respect \nto trying to persuade the States to pass legislation prohibiting open \ncontainers in vehicles. We have said, we want incentives to be \navailable to prevent open containers in vehicles and pass legislation \nto prevent open containers in vehicles. Despite that, in 1998, 22 \nStates still prohibit open containers in vehicles. Incentives do not \nwork. I do not think we ought to talk about incentives on this issue. \nAnd alcohol and vehicles do not mix.\n  No one in America should be able to drive and drink at the same time. \nYet in five States you can. Nowhere in America should a car be driven \ndown the road to meet anyone here, their families or anyone in America, \nand then at the next intersection have, if not the driver drinking, the \nrest of the people in the car with open containers of alcohol. If we \ndon't decide to have the will to at least require that in this country, \nthen we will not stop the carnage on American roads.\n  I appreciate the Senator offering the amendment. I intend to support \nit and I hope my colleagues will support it, as well.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. One minute for the opponents. I see no one prepared to \ntake that time. If somebody from the proponents wishes to use it, with \nthe understanding that as soon as an opponent appears they will yield--\n--\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. By the time we finish with the 1 minute--we could \nyield back all 37 seconds that remain.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Do you want to speak now?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The arguments have been made abundantly clear. We are talking about \nsomething that will save lives. We are talking, on the other hand, \nabout whether or not the process is appropriate or whether or not the \npenalties are too high.\n  I submit to Members that there is no penalty too high to permit a \nchild like this to live a full life. No penalty too severe. I think \nwhen Senators vote here, that is what they ought to be thinking about--\nthinking about the people back home and how they will react to a vote \nthey are making here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). All time has expired. \nThe question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN (when his name was called). Present.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on this vote I have a pair with the \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. If he were present and voting, he \nwould vote ``yea.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote ``nay.'' \nTherefore, I withhold my vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts) \nand the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  On this vote, the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) is paired with \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye).\n  If present and voting, the Senator from Hawaii would vote ``yea'' and \nthe Senator from Montana would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I just want to point out to the Members \nwhat the next order of business will be. We now will take up the \nfunding amendment that provided a good deal of additional money for a \nwhole series of States, every State, and we would like, obviously, to \nget a time agreement on that, but we are having some trouble doing it. \nWe are going to get started nonetheless.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1684 to Amendment No. 1676\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the distribution of additional funds for the \n                     Federal-aid highway program.)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n     Thomas, Mr. Bond, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1684 to Amendment No. 1676.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday, the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works held an important meeting on the pending business \nbefore the Senate; namely, the underlying legislation, S. 1173, the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997. During \nyesterday's business meeting, the committee agreed unanimously, the 18 \nmembers of the committee voted 18-0, to adopt an amendment to S. 1173, \nwhich will provide an additional $25.9 billion for the Nation's highway \nprograms over the next 5 years. The additional funds will bring the \ntotal authorization for highways in the bill to $171 billion.\n  As I mentioned last Thursday in my opening statement on ISTEA II, \nwhich is how we will refer to the underlying legislation, the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, and Senators Domenici, D'Amato, Byrd, Gramm, \nWarner, Baucus, and I have been working to try to resolve the difficult \nissue of how much additional funding should be directed to \ntransportation. We have participated in a challenging but ultimately \nproductive set of meetings. Although I am not an advocate of spending \nthe 4.3 cents gasoline tax on highways, I believe that the agreement we \nreached is a fair one that will allow the Senate to complete its work \non ISTEA in a timely fashion.\n  The principal question on everyone's mind is how this additional \nfunding will be allocated among the 50 States and various ISTEA \nprograms. I am pleased that the amendment before us distributes the new \nmoney in a manner that is responsible to all States and to all regions \nof the country. Moreover, the committee amendment does not affect the \nallocations or program structure in the underlying ISTEA II bill. The \nlion's share of the additional funds, $18.9 billion, goes to all 50 \nStates in the same proportion as the formulas under S. 1173.\n  Before we proceed, I want to outline the package adopted by the \ncommittee yesterday. To make the bill fairer, the committee amendment \nprovides additional funds for those States that did not fare as well as \nthe majority of the States in S. 1173.\n  First of all, this amendment does address the inequities of the so-\ncalled donor States, those States that contribute more money to the \nhighway trust fund than they receive from the Federal aid highway \nprogram. The underlying bill, S. 1173, as reported, guaranteed that \neach State would receive at least 90 cents in return for every dollar \nallocated to the States from the trust fund. The amendment before us \nincludes an additional $1.9 billion over the life of the bill to ensure \nthat each State receives at least 91 cents in return.\n  Now, the States that will benefit from this donor State bonus are the \nfollowing: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nIndiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and \nWisconsin. These States have complete flexibility to use the additional \nfunds for any purpose authorized under title 23, which is the Federal \naid highway title of the U.S. Code. That is the first thing we did.\n  Second, there are a number of densely populated States, such as \nCalifornia, Illinois, and New Jersey, where high volumes of traffic \nclog the roads and high repair costs impede routine maintenance. The \ncommittee amendment provides an additional $1.8 billion over the next 5 \nyears for these high-density States. The additional funds may be spent \nfor any purpose authorized under title 23 to relieve the terrible \ncongestion problems and address tremendous infrastructure needs.\n  Those States which are neither donor States nor high-density States \nalso may spend a percentage, 22 percent, of the additional funds they \nreceive pursuant to this amendment for any purpose authorized under \ntitle 23.\n  The committee amendment also provides additional funds for those \nISTEA programs directed to regions of the country with unique needs. \nFor instance, the Appalachian Development Highway System was first \nauthorized in law in 1965, but is not yet completed. The committee \namendment provides an additional $1.89 billion for the Appalachian \nHighway Program for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help complete the \n3,025 mile system.\n  Second, as a result of the implementation of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) and other key trade agreements, states along \nthe Mexican and Canadian borders have experienced a substantial \nincrease in truck traffic. The increased traffic and congestion along \nthese routes has put a heavy burden on the corridors that connect \nborder locations and other ports of entry. The committee amendment \nprovides $450 million over the next five years in contract authority \nfor the nation's border infrastructure and trade corridors.\n  Third, the roads that run through the nation's parks, Indian \nreservations, and other public lands are in great need of maintenance \nand repair. The committee amendment provides an additional $850 million \nover 5 years for the Federal Lands Highway Program.\n  This is in addition to the money that was included in the bill \noriginally as we submitted it.\n  Of the $850 million total, the committee amendment provides $50 \nmillion per year for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help address the \nmounting needs of the nation's 49,000 miles of Indian reservation \nroads. An additional $50 million per year for the next 5 years, is \nprovided for the Public Lands Highway Program, which funds Forest \nService roads and other public roads that run through federal lands.\n  The remaining $350 million in the Federal Lands portion of the \ncommittee amendment is directed to the Park Roads and Park Ways \nProgram. An integral part of our National Parks System is the 8,000 \nmiles of park roads and parkways that make the splendor of these \nnational treasures accessible to all Americans. Fifty million dollars \nof the $70 million annually for the Park Roads and Parkways Program is \ndirected to these roads that run through our national park system.\n  The remaining $20 million per year is set-aside to address the \nbacklog of needs for the roads in our National Wildlife Refuge System. \nI am delighted that the committee has agreed to include this additional \nfunding for the 4,250 miles of refuge roads within the system. Indeed, \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System, which is administered by the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, plays a pivotal role in the conservation of fish \nand wildlife resources throughout the country. The additional funds \nprovided in the committee amendment will allow the Service to better \nfocus its appropriations on the core mission of protecting fish and \nwildlife and their habitats.\n  Mr. President, before closing, I want to thank all of the members of \nthe committee for their diligence and cooperation in adopting the \namendment before us.\n  I see Senator Warner here, who has been a very valuable ally and \noriginator, actually, of much that is in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\n  I thank them all for their diligence and cooperation in adopting the \namendment before us. I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, who \npresided over the negotiations in which we arrived at this compromise; \nSenator Byrd, Senator Warner, whom I previously mentioned, Senator \nBaucus, the ranking member of the full committee, who has been so \nhelpful, Senator Gramm, and particularly Senator Domenici. All I thank \nfor their determination and resolve during our discussions.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment before us \nso we can proceed to the business at hand and enact an ISTEA II bill \nwhich will bring the Nation's transportation system into the next \ncentury.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to defer to the distinguishing \nranking member. Then I shall follow dutifully the seniority of our \ncommittee.\n  First, I thank the chairman, and I will include those remarks.\n  But we have on the floor here the distinguished senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina, the President pro tempore, who has counseled with me, \nand other members of the committee, on a regular basis concerning this. \nThe distinguished Senator represents South Carolina, which is in the \ncategory of a donor State, as is the State of Virginia. I wish to \nassure the senior Senator from South Carolina--and perhaps the chairman \ncan join me--that his State will receive an allocation of 91 percent \nunder the formulation that I and others have worked out. We, in the \ncourse of the recalculation, specifically asked the chairman and the \ndistinguished ranking member, as, over the weekend, we reworked the \nformula. It was my desire to raise the level from 90 to 91 percent with \nrespect to as many donor States as we could achieve. But according to \nmy calculations, I represent to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina that his State has achieved a 91 percent mark.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I say, as chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, that the answer is yes. In fact, currently \nthere are a good number of States--so-called ``donor'' States--which \ncontribute more to the highway trust fund than they receive in terms of \nhighway allocations. They receive actually less than 90 percent. There \nare some States down around the 80s. One, I think, is 76 percent. I am \nnot sure about South Carolina. But the bill that passed the committee \nmade sure that there is a floor of 90 percent--that donor States get at \nleast 90 percent. Through the able efforts of the Senator from \nVirginia, and others--Virginia is often a donor State--that was then \nraised to 91 percent.\n  This was one of the areas of concern that we on the committee had \nwhen we considered additional money under the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus \namendment; that is, there are some States that felt they needed \nadditional money because of high density, and others because they are \ndonor States. There are some Western States that felt because they are \npublic land States they should get some, too. And then the Appalachian \nRegional Commission felt that there was not enough money in the \nunderlying bill. So the amendment would give a little more to \nAppalachia.\n\n  But the long and short of it is that South Carolina, and all donor \nStates, will, under the amendment now pending, combined with the \nunderlying bill, receive at least 91 percent. Technically, it is 91 \npercent of the percentage of their contribution of the funds that are \nallocated, but for all intents and purposes, it is raised from 90 \npercent to 91 percent.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I would like to follow on the \npoints made by the very distinguished and able chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, very generally. Several of us--Senator \nChafee, myself, Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator \nDomenici, and, most particularly, the majority leader, Senator Trent \nLott, met many, many times over the last several weeks to find a fair \nway to distribute dollars that would be raised in the act transferring \n4.3 cents of the gasoline tax to the trust fund, and then back to the \nStates.\n  Essentially, we came up with a program dealing first with States that \nhad legitimate concerns as a consequence of the committee bill and then \ndistributing the rest back to the States according to the percentage \nshare that they were receiving under the bill so as not to give any \nfavoritism to anyone in place.\n  That is what we did. It is an agreement that was agreed to by all the \nmain parties. We, at the same time, talked with many other Senators who \nwere not part of this conversation in order to have a result that \nreflected fairness to regions in all parts of the country.\n  It is also an agreement agreed to by Senator Domenici, the very, very \nable chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He said he would find a \nway with these increases to come up with a balanced budget resolution \nthat does not exceed the caps in the budget resolution so that those \nwho are concerned that this additional money might ``bust the budget'' \nmay rest much more assured that is not the case. If anybody can find a \nway to not balance the budget and not bust the caps and get the rest of \nthe additional money because of this amendment, certainly Senator \nDomenici can do that.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that these issues are never easy. Every \nState feels that it should have a few more highway dollars, and every \nState feels that its share is not quite as fair as the share of other \nStates. There is no magic in this. It is just a matter of looking at \nall the claims, all the equities, and all the differences in different \nparts of the country. Some States are donor States and some States are \ndonee States. Others have completed their interstate highways later, \nrather than earlier. Some States have real bridge problems that need to \nbe addressed. Some States, like in ours, in the West, next to public \nlands, count on a lot of tourists who visit our States. For example, in \nthe State of Montana, there is tourism with tourists going to visit \nYellowstone or Glacier Parks. Some tourists pay a little bit of Montana \ntax to the degree that they travel in our State. But we in Montana have \nto pay a lot to maintain those highways. So it is adding all of those \nequities together as best we possibly can.\n  On the numbers again, just so everyone is clear, the underlying bill \nspends about $145 billion in contract authority over 6 years on the \nhighway program. The amendment that we are now addressing, that is \nbefore the body, adds $6 billion for a total $171 billion in contract \nauthority that would be spent allocated among the States.\n  I do not want to get too technical about this, but contract authority \nis not exactly the same as obligation limitations or outlays, which is \nto say that the Budget Committee will determine what those obligation \nlimitations are. The Appropriations Committee will then decide how much \nof the total it can spend. The Appropriations Committee will not be \nbound to spend the full $171 billion unless it wants to. The \nAppropriations Committee can spend a little less, if it decides in its \ndetermination that it is more appropriate because it will have to find \nsome offsets to spend this additional money. Obviously, there will be \nsome compelling needs with the Budget Committee with other ideas and \nother programs, but still with the contract authority set at $171 \nbillion over 6 years, there is a tremendous incentive for the Budget \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee to spend--allocate outlays--\nthe actual dollars going to the States to build highways at a level \nvery close to $171 billion--not entirely, but very, very close.\n  This underlying bill, Mr. President, I remind Senators, is much, much \nmore flexible than the current highway program. The current highway \nprogram has 11 separate categories that are pretty rigid; somewhat \ninflexible. They give State highway departments gray hairs sometimes, \nbecause one State's needs--say that were Arkansas--is a little bit \ndifferent from another State's needs--let's say Montana or Rhode Island \nor Virginia or South Carolina.\n\n  So we collapsed those 11 categories into 6. And the six are now much \nmore flexible, very flexible. For example, one of the main categories \nis called ``surface transportation account.'' You can\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\ntake money out of that for Amtrak, if you want. You can take money out \nof that for mass transit, if you want. You can spend more on \nenhancements, if you wish. There is a lot of flexibility here, \nflexibility that the States have, much more flexibility given to States \nthan is the case under the current highway bill. The departments of \ntransportation commissioners wanted this. It makes sense to the \ncommittee that much more delegation of flexibility be given to the \nStates.\n  For those who are concerned about the Congestion Mitigation Air \nQuality Program, CMAQ, actually there are more dollars in this bill \nthan the current CMAQ program. CMAQ is important because we want to \nmake sure that building more highways is consistent with improving air \nquality. We passed the Clean Air Act in 1991, telling States and cities \nthat are not in attainment to undertake certain actions to bring their \nair quality standards into compliance. Obviously, if you build a lot \nmore lanes, have a lot more traffic in the city, more cars, more auto \nemissions, sometimes it is inconsistent with the goals of air quality \nimprovement. So, basically, the CMAQ money is there to help deal with \nthat problem.\n  And, I might say, in the first category, called ``interstate \nmaintenance,'' called ``national highway system money,'' there is a \nrestriction: You cannot build additional lanes for single occupancy. \nYou can for HOV lanes, again to address congestion and air quality \nproblems, but you cannot build lanes just for single-occupancy cars. \nAgain, we are trying to merge two competing programs together.\n  I might say, this is particularly important, this amendment, to my \nState of Montana. We are a big State. We don't have a lot of people. In \nfact, we have more miles per capita of highways than any other State in \nthe Nation. Our State gasoline tax is the third highest in the Nation. \nWe are paying for our highways as best as we possibly can. We are not a \nbig industrial State. In fact, we are a relatively poor State. I am \nembarrassed to say this, but Montana, today, ranks 46th in the Nation \nfor per capita income. We were 35th, 36th, not too many years ago. We \nare now down to 46th.\n  It is tough. We don't have the money in Montana to pay for our roads, \nand this is going to go a long way. Mr. President, 90 percent of the \nhouseholds in Montana make multiple trips of over 100 miles each year, \nand that is compared with a national average of 80 percent. As I say, \ntourists come to Montana--actually it's 8 million visitors who come to \nvisit our State. It is beautiful. Glacier National Park in the \nsummertime--a lot of people come to fish and camp out and bring their \nfamilies from all over the country. In the winter, of course, there is \nskiing, whether it's downhill, cross-country, or snowmobiling, which is \nvery popular in our State.\n  I will just sum up by saying, as much as it sounds like we spend a \nlot of money on highways, in the larger context this really is not \nenough. Today, the United States spends, State, local and Federal \ncombined, about $34 billion a year on our highways. The Department of \nTransportation did a needs study, what is needed to be spent just to \nmaintain the current condition of our highways, recognizing winter and \nsummer things get beat up and so on and so forth. They concluded that \nabout $54 billion a year should be spent just to maintain the current \nlevel of maintenance of America's highway system. So if we want to do \nbetter, we should spend, according to the Department of Transportation, \nmaybe $70 billion a year, so as to improve our highway system, to keep \nup with the highway system in Germany, for example, and some other \ncountries that spend a lot of money on their highways.\n  Of course, their gasoline taxes are much higher than they are in the \nUnited States, but those dollars go to improve their highways. That is \na decision that those countries have made. We are spending $171 billion \nover 6 years. That is a far cry from $60, $70 billion over 1 year. It \nis just an example of what other countries are doing compared with what \nour needs are, to explain that the current bill, as important as it is, \nis probably not enough if we wanted to improve upon our current system.\n  I am going to yield the floor to whoever wants to speak here. Again, \nI thank all those who worked very hard on this and hope we can conclude \nthis bill very quickly, because we have to go to conference on the \nHouse-passed bill whenever they pass their bill. By May 1, the bill has \nto be signed by the President. By May 1, that's when the current \nprogram expires. We were a bit derelict last year in the Senate when we \ndid not pass the highway bill even though the program expired June 30 \nof last year. We got tied up on campaign finance reform, and we agreed \nto move the transportation bill up to one of the first orders of \nbusiness in 1998. That slipped a little, but fortunately here we are.\n  It is very important that we move expeditiously to meet our Nation's \nneeds and satisfy Americans who want to be assured that we have the \nhighway program in place, a solid 6-year program, so contractors can \nplan and State departments of transportation can plan ahead and we do \nnot have to worry about this on-again/off again problem that we are \ncurrently facing with our program. So I hope we do move very \nexpeditiously to pass not only this amendment but the full bill so we \ncan get on to work with the House in the conference and pass the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will engage in a \ncolloquy? As subcommittee chairman--fortunately, I have had as my \nranking member the distinguished Senator from Montana from the very \nfirst day of the consideration of this bill in the Environment \nCommittee, and of course we initiated the work in the subcommittee. The \nSenator from Montana and I decided that we were not going to seek \nretribution for some of the inequities in the 1991 ISTEA, but we were \ngoing to try to establish a formula and other provisions in the bill \nwhich brought about the greatest equity achievable, in a bipartisan \nway, in this piece of legislation. I feel that we have remained true to \nthat fundamental principle that the Senator from Montana and I laid \ndown on day 1.\n  Do you share that view?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I answer the point of the very distinguished Senator from \nVirginia that I very much do. I might remind the Senator of several \nfacts which substantiate his point.\n  No. 1, the current highway program is based on very dated data. It is \nbased on the 1980 census. We even have in here the 1916 postal road \nformula--that is in the current law. Of course, the bill we are passing \ntoday brings it up to date.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have even used the example, the pony \nexpress was still in here someplace.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Once we get this legislation passed, we are out of the \npony express era because we will have current data, data reflecting how \nmany miles people travel in their State, lane miles, vehicle miles, et \ncetera. That is a formula based on the actual usage and needs in the \nState, which is critical.\n  In addition to that, I might add to my distinguished friend that \nthere were earlier separate competing bills. There was a STEP 21 bill \nsponsored by the Senator from Virginia; there was a STARS 2000 bill, \nwhich had a little Western influence; there was ISTEA-Plus, I think the \nname of it was, or the ISTEA bill which was sponsored by the \nnortheastern Members of the Senate.\n  With the leadership of Senator Warner we were able to bring the three \nbills together. We didn't favor one region over another. On a very \nbipartisan basis, you on your side and I on my side, along with Senator \nChafee, had to come up with a bill which is fair to America, fairest to \nthe country.\n  We passed our bill out of committee. Even though we did the very best \nwe could, there were still some Senators who had some concerns. Some of \nthem were off the committee. We dealt with those concerns with this \namendment on a very bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague, because I felt as a trustee of \nthese funds--and when you and I, for example, joined on the first \namendment to try to add additional funding, we were going to win that \nwhen, obviously, leadership was able to persuade one or two colleagues \nand we came within one vote, to my recollection.\n  Then along came the distinguished senior Senator from Texas and our \ndistinguished former majority leader, the\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, and you and I joined in that \neffort, even though we were at odds with our distinguished chairman and \nother members of the committee. We felt it was imperative to add these \nfunds. With the add-on, I want to make clear, we left the basic formula \nintact, 90 percent intact, and simply superimposed this amendment on \ntop.\n  Again, under the guidance of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and yourself--and I had a voice in it, of course--we again \ntried to achieve equity. I specifically asked the chairman to make \ncertain that in the recalculation, over the weekend, we get as many \nStates as possible above the 90 to 91 percent. I think we have done \nthat. There may be some 90.8, some fraction. But in order to achieve \nthe fundamental equity, we did our very best in superimposing this add-\non, on the undisturbed basic bill, as the allocations were made up in \nthat bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is exactly right. In fact, in a nutshell, we believe \nit is only fair to the American people that a portion of the gasoline \ntax that goes to the trust fund be allocated to the States. We took \nthat amount, 3.45 cents, and essentially allocated it according to the \nprovisions of the underlying bill without changing the formulas, making \na couple of minor changes to accommodate some legitimate concerns of \nSenators. That is basically what we have done. Frankly, I cannot think \nof a fairer way to do it.\n  I am also reminded there is sort of a feeling in the room, and also \nthe feeling in the committee when we acted on this in the room where we \nput this together--you can tell when it's fair or not fair. Everybody \nwas happy and felt good. It felt good. Also, in the committee, when the \ncommittee reported out this amendment, you could tell, too, it passed \nunanimously with Senators all around, as the Senator well knows.\n  Mr. WARNER. That's owing to the leadership of Senator Chafee, in the \nfirst bill, and you--Senator Chafee and you as ranking. When we \nbrought, shall we say, the subcommittee bill, before the full \ncommittee, I was astonished we got a unanimous vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was, too.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now with Senator Chafee's leadership, we got another \nunanimous vote in our committee. But I have felt the will of the entire \nSenate was represented in various groups on our committee. We listened \ncarefully, took things into consideration, and did the best we could. I \nam urging Senators to support this amendment. But I caution those who \nwant to come and perhaps give their own proposal, be careful, because \nonce you take one part of this formula and move it, you will be \nsurprised how all the States begin to go up and down in other areas of \nthe calculations.\n  So, I think the Senate will have to repose a lot of trust in our \ncommittee. But that trust is predicated on the principle of fairness \nthat we started with when the first word of this bill was placed down \nby the subcommittee, and it has transcended--that concept of fairness \nis throughout our work.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I thank \nmy colleagues, each of those who are on the floor, and my dear \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who is not here, for their \nleadership in bringing us to the point at which we find ourselves \ntoday.\n  What I would like to do is to explain the problem we sought to deal \nwith, say a little bit about how we came to be at this point, and then \ntry to explain why every Member of the Senate should rejoice that we \nhave reached a point where we are going to take a very dramatic step in \nterms of improving the quality of America's highways and, in doing so, \nimprove their safety, their efficiency, and not only save the lives of \nthousands of our fellow citizens, but improve the lives of tens of \nmillions of Americans who use our highways.\n  I entered this debate over one simple issue, and I have always viewed \nit as an issue that has to do with honesty in Government and equity. \nThe issue that I entered the debate on, along with Senator Byrd and \njoined by Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, was an issue that boils \ndown to basic trust. And that is, people go to the filling station and, \nin a lot of States in the Union, that little clip that you used to put \non the nozzle where you could pump the gas and go on about your \nbusiness and do something else, many States have taken that clip off. \nSo you often find yourself standing there holding this nozzle, and \nevery once in a while, in desperation, somebody reads the gasoline \npump.\n  When you read the gasoline pump, it sort of gives the good news and \nthe bad news story. The bad news is a third of the cost of buying a \ngallon of gasoline in America is taxes. The good news is, at least, as \nit says it on the pump, that the gasoline tax is a user fee and that \nuser fee is used to build roads. So while you should be unhappy that a \nthird of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is going to pay taxes, you \nshould be happy with the fact that at least those taxes are going to \nbuild the very roads that you are going to ride on in burning up that \ngasoline that you are buying.\n  I entered this debate because the bad news is true, a third of the \ncost of a gallon of gasoline is, in fact, taxes, but today it is not \ntrue that all those taxes go to build roads. In fact, beginning in the \n1990s, the Federal Government started diverting highway trust funds to \nother use. So we collected gasoline taxes, those moneys were put into \nthe trust fund, but by not spending those moneys on highways, we were \nable to spend those moneys on other things.\n  Then, in 1993, the Congress adopted the first permanent gasoline tax \nin American history since we had the highway trust fund where the money \nwent to general revenues, and so the money was spent and none of it was \nspent on highways.\n  That produced a situation by this year where roughly 25 to 30 cents \nout of every dollar paid by every American in gasoline taxes goes not \nto build roads but to fund other expenditures of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Senator Byrd and I started this debate because we believed that that \nwas dishonest. We believed that the Government was deceiving the \nAmerican people, and we thought it was wrong. We thought it was wrong \nto take a dedicated tax and spend it on general Government rather than \nspending it for the purpose to which Americans had been led to believe \nthat they were paying the tax.\n  Our first victory in this roughly 2-year effort was on the tax bill \nlast year where we were able to take that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline away from general revenue and put it back into the highway \ntrust fund where it belonged. It was a big issue, because 4.3 cents per \ngallon collects roughly $7 billion a year in revenues.\n  We were successful in that effort. Then, last year, we started the \neffort to guarantee that the money was actually spent on highways. That \neffort, by Senator Byrd and myself, produced a coalition with Senator \nBaucus and Senator Warner, the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over the highway bill. That started a \nnegotiation which reached a successful conclusion the day before \nyesterday in a new highway bill, for all practical purposes, very \ndifferent than the bill that the President proposed, very different \nfrom the bill that came out of the committee, and I think different in \nbeing better.\n\n  The bill before us guarantees that over the next 6 years, we will \nmove from a situation where almost 30 cents out of every dollar of \ngasoline taxes today is diverted to some use other than building \nhighways and for transportation purposes to spend on general programs. \nWe will move from that situation today to a situation 6 years from now \nwhen this bill is fully in effect so that every penny of the 4.3-cents-\nper-gallon tax on gasoline, which is now diverted to other uses, will \nbe used for the purpose of improving the transportation system of \nAmerica and building roads.\n  That will mean that this bill will, over the next 6 years, spend $173 \nbillion on highways. The difference in the number that Senator Baucus \nused and this number is that about $2 billion of the expenditure is \nunder another title in the Commerce Committee, and I do not want people \nto be confused to think we have taken away $2 billion from the \nagreement that we announced the other day. The total is $173 billion.\n  What does that mean relative to the highway bill that has just ended? \nWhat it means nationwide is that by the economic growth we have \nexperienced, by\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nthe growth in the collection of gasoline taxes and by dedicating every \npenny of gasoline taxes to build roads, nationwide we are going to \nincrease the amount of money for highway construction over the next 6 \nyears, as compared to the last 6 years, by 45 percent. That is a \ndramatic change. As a result of this bill, Americans who would have \ndied on roads in West Virginia and Texas and all over America will not \ndie. As a result of this bill, people who would have waited in \ncongestion, taking time away from their work or their family, will find \nthat that congestion has been abated.\n  So we are not just talking about spending another $26 billion of \nmoney on highways, the purpose for which the money was collected. But \nwe are talking about improving the lives of Americans by the tens of \nmillions and saving the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens.\n  Secondly, by getting out of this absurd situation we were in under \nthe previous bill where we were using the 1980 census for no other \npurpose than to discriminate in favor of States that were losing \npopulation and against those that were gaining population, by going to \nthe current census, a State like my State, which has been growing very \nrapidly, will not only benefit from the fact that we are not allowing \n30 cents out of every dollar of money collected in gasoline taxes to be \nsiphoned off to pay for something else, but by using the current census \nand through other factors, the State of Texas will have an increase in \nhighway funding over the previous bill of 60 percent. Obviously, that \nis a big deal for my State. It is a big deal for every State in the \nUnion.\n  Some people will say, ``Well, but if you're spending the money on \nhighways, you're not spending the money on other things.'' When we \ndebated this bill for the first time at the end of the last session, \nour opposition came from people who basically said, ``Well, spending \nmoney on highways is great, but if you spend this money on highways, we \ncan't spend it on other things.''\n  Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, we do have a great \nneed in highways, but the real argument is not one of relative need. \nThe real argument is we collected the money for the purpose of building \nhighways. This is a dedicated tax. So those who find today a sad \noccasion because for the first time since the mid-eighties we are \nactually going to spend gasoline taxes on highways and they are unhappy \nbecause we are not going to spend the money on other things, let me \nsay, as I have said in the past, that they remind me of rustlers who \nhave been stealing our cattle. We finally catch them, we call the \nsheriff out, we don't hang them, we don't even make them give our old \ncattle back they stole. All we say to them is, ``You have to quit \nstealing our cattle.'' We will hear from a few of them today, and their \nbasic response will be, ``Well, that's great, but where do I get my \nbeef? If I can't rob the highway trust fund, where do I get this money \nto do all this good I want to do?''\n\n  I have two responses. One, that is not my problem. Two, we should \nhave never been spending highway trust fund money for other purposes. \nWe should have never let the Federal Government collect money in \ngasoline taxes and turn around and spend it for something other than \nthe purpose for which those taxes were collected.\n  So I believe this is a happy day. Is everybody satisfied? I have \ngreat appreciation of the situation of Senator Chafee and Senator \nBaucus and Senator Warner. You can't satisfy everybody. We have a \nhighway system that is a national system and, obviously, I have been \nunhappy about the fact that my State was getting 77 cents for every \ndollar we sent to Washington. I have complained vigorously, and partly \nas a result of that complaint, we have changed the bill. We have gotten \nrid of the 1980 census, and we are going to have a dramatic increase in \nfunding going to States like mine.\n  You can always say, ``We want more,'' but I think it is important, \nand Senator Chafee has made the point and I agree with it, we have a \nNational Highway System. When we were building roads across Texas in \nthe 1950s and 1960s, the Interstate Highway System, we were more of a \nbeneficiary State. But what good is it to have an Interstate Highway \nSystem that when it gets to Western States, you don't have the highway? \nIf it is an east-west or north-south system and you have a State that \nhas a low population and a low formula and, as a result, can't build \nits system, do you have a national system?\n  There are always going to be years, because of the ongoing building \nof the interstate system, where some States are going to get more than \na dollar back, some are going to get less. But thanks to Senator \nWarner--and I congratulate him and thank him personally--under this \nbill, for all practical purposes, no State will ever again get less \nthan 91 cents out of every dollar in formula money back that they send \nto Washington in terms of highway taxes.\n  What that means is, no matter what we are doing in terms of a \nnational system, at least that minimum will be available to every \nState. I think that is a dramatic improvement, and I think it is \nsomething of which people can be proud.\n  I think this is a major step forward. I thank everyone who has worked \non the bill. I have enjoyed having the opportunity to work with the \nsponsors, with Senator Chafee. I thank Senator Lott for his ability to \nbring everybody together. I think it has been a classic case of \ndemocracy at work. Someone once said that there are two things you \ndon't want to watch people do. One is making sausage and the other is \nmaking laws.\n  But I have to say that I think any civics class at any high school in \nAmerica that sat through the whole process on writing this highway \nbill, that sat in every meeting and every negotiation, and that watched \nthe give-and-take, that listened to the intellectual content of the \ndebate, both public and private debate, that watched the consensus \nform, would go away convinced that, while our system is not perfect, it \nis clearly the best system that has ever been devised by the mind of \nman.\n  So I am proud of this bill. I am happy for my State. I am happy for \nthe country. I believe that this is a dramatic improvement. And while I \ndo not agree with or support every single provision of the bill, you \nreach a point where you have to say, this is the best we are going to \ndo given that we have 100 Members of the Senate. There will be those \nwho will be offering amendments to try to tear this consensus apart. I \ndo not intend to support any of those amendments. I think we have put \ntogether a good bill. And I think it is time to get on with improving \nour highway system, with saving lives, with improving the quality of \nlife for hundreds of millions of people all over the country.\n  So I am for this amendment. I am for this bill. And I congratulate \nthose who have been the leaders of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Texas for his remarks, personal and otherwise, directed at those \nwho put together this amendment.\n  But now I say to all colleagues, we are entering into that phase \nwhich I have called in previous iterations of the highway bill, the \n``battle of the charts.'' And the charts are coming over the transom, \nunder the transom, and from all directions. And it comes down to \nwhether or not someone can put up a matrix which benefits their State a \nlittle bit more. But I assure you, it is at the detriment of someone \nelse. And you have to at some point, when the votes come, decide: Did \nthe committee or did not the committee try and do an equitable \ndistribution of the funds?\n  The basic bill reported out by the subcommittee, then by the full \ncommittee, is unchanged. But in working out the most equitable \ndistribution we could under the add-on, as a consequence of the Byrd-\nGramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, you could figure it several different \nways. And therein I presume the debate will focus in just such time as \nwe proceed to vote on this amendment. And there are means by which you \ncould calculate it in a different way.\n  I think Senators are perfectly entitled to fight. And they should. \nBut it all comes back to, will their formula be viewed as an equitable \ndistribution of the funds?\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n  And I say that when the final vote is taken it is my hope and it is \nmy expectation that the Senate will express its confidence in the \nability of the committee--under the guidance of the distinguished \nmajority leader, and, indeed, with the valued input of Senator Byrd, \nSenator Gramm of Texas--that we did the best we could to make equitable \ndistribution of the apple.\n  So let us now engage in the ``battle of the charts.'' I hope Senators \nwill come to the floor and express their views with respect to their \nindividual States and their own view as to whether or not equity was \nachieved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank our friends on the \ncommittee for their effort here. And we are trying to get information \nto help us decide exactly how we should respond to the committee \namendment. That information was requested as soon as the amendment was \nadopted. We are still awaiting for that information.\n  I think it is only fair to those States, States that have been \nparticularly put in a donor position decade after decade after decade, \nwhich is the case with many of our States, that we get the information \nthat we sought. We very well--I am speaking just for myself--we very \nwell may end up supporting this amendment. But it would seem to me, as \na matter of fundamental fairness, that when an amendment this complex \nand this important to our States is brought to the floor, that where \ninformation is sought from the Department of Transportation, that \ninformation be forthcoming before we are expected to vote on this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I know of no \nreason why the chairman, who is momentarily absent from the floor, or \nthe ranking member or myself is trying to push this to a conclusion \nprior to those who desire to have additional information get all that \ninformation and have free discussion on it.\n  So please do not send out the alarm that, in my judgment, we are \ntrying to roll this thing through before all States have an opportunity \nto examine the complexity of this and get such information and charts \nas they so desire.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much appreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator would yield for me to further make the \npoint of the Senator from Virginia, the Senator knows my office is also \ncalling the DOT to light a fire under them to get the information back \nso that the Senator from Michigan has all the information he wants in \norder to make an informed decision.\n  He is absolutely right. I mean, he represents his State and wants to \nrepresent it to the fullest. And he believes, correctly, that he would \nlike to have more information. And so we are doing our best to get the \ninformation for the Senator. Once he does have it, I am quite confident \nthings will work out. But it is more important, first, to get that \ninformation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friends from Montana and Virginia for their \nsupport in our effort to get this information and, indeed, for their \nlong, hard efforts to try to bring a conclusion to this effort to come \nup with a fair highway bill.\n  The problem is, as the Chair and others know, there are some States \nthat have not been treated equitably and fairly, at least in our eyes, \nover the decades.\n  First, the Senator from Texas correctly says we have a National \nHighway System. And that is true. I do not think it would be possible \nto build an interstate across Montana if Montana only got back the \namount of money in gas tax for the building of that interstate that was \nsent to Washington by folks buying gas in Montana. I have no doubt of \nthe truth of that comment.\n  I have been to Montana. I have been on those interstates. I \nunderstand that. I appreciate that. Indeed, I would support that if \nthis were coming up for funding in the 1950s. But that does not explain \nwhy a whole bunch of other States that are not in that situation get \nback a $1.20, $1.40, $1.60, $1.80, $2 for every dollar they send.\n  We can explain some of this to our constituents. And I have. I get up \nand use Montana as the example. And I say, it is only right, if you are \ngoing to have an Interstate System, that more money go to build an \ninterstate in Montana than is coming from Montana. That is the point \nthe Senator from Texas made.\n  But, again, let me emphasize, there are a whole bunch of States that \nthat is not applicable to, who have for decades gotten back a heck of a \nlot more than they have sent into this system and put into that trust \nfund. And those of us that have been in a donor position for decades, \nbecause of these formulas which were put in here many years ago, cannot \npossibly justify the huge amounts which many donee States have received \nwhich do not relate to the fact that they are sparsely populated and \nhave large distances to cross.\n  And while my friend from Texas may be correct in the case of some \nStates falling into the donor or donee situation, depending upon what \nyear you may be looking at, there are other States which have been in \nthe donor situation constantly throughout where you cannot justify \nthis. And there has been some effort in this bill to correct the \nunfairness. And I want to thank my friends from Rhode Island, Montana, \nVirginia, and to others, Texas, who participated in this effort to get \na little more fairness for the so-called donor States. I want to thank \nthem for that effort.\n\n  Does it come close to repairing the unfairness? I do not know. And we \nare not going to know until we get this data. There are a lot of \ncomplications in these formulas. My dear friend from Virginia is right, \nyou get all kinds of charts coming in. I mean, one chart which we \nalready have shows that two-thirds of the States actually get a smaller \npercentage under the committee amendment than they did under the \nunderlying bill.\n  If that is true--and some of those being donor States--if that is \ntrue, how do donor States then get a guarantee of 91 cents back instead \nof 90 cents, if some of those two-thirds of the States that get a \nsmaller percentage under the committee amendment are donor States?\n  My State gets a smaller percentage under the committee amendment than \nit does under the underlying bill. You can add all the money you want, \nwhich is what the committee did, but the problem still is going to \nremain in terms of the percentage of the contribution unless something \nelse happens here. We should be in a worse percentage situation under \nthe committee amendment than we were under the underlying bill. But \nthat is what we want to look at in terms of charts.\n  I have questions about the density group. How is that defined? I have \nhighly dense, congestive places in the State of Michigan, but I am not \none of those 10 States. How is it defined? And why? And why is it that \n10 States all get the same amount of money for density no matter where \nthey may fall on some density chart? No matter where they fall, they \nall get the same amount of money year after year, but States that do \nnot quite reach the level of density get nothing. I would like to at \nleast know why and how, how that is arrived at.\n  I have a number of questions which I would like to have answered. Are \nthose special categories--for instance, density. When you get a density \nbonus or a density amount in this bill, does that count in terms of the \ndonor State guarantee of 91 percent? Does that count towards that? We \ndo not know. Perhaps some of the sponsors of the amendment could answer \nthat question.\n  And to my friend from Texas, my understanding is it is not 91 cents \nback on the dollar; it is 91 percent of contribution. And that, as a \nmatter of fact, is not 91 percent of your contributions, because there \nis something taken off the top here. So it is 91 percent of the \ncontributions of the amount which is distributed to the States which is \nless than 100 percent.\n  I wish it were 91 cents on the dollar, I tell my good friend from \nTexas. I wish it were that every buck we are going to send to \nWashington, from here on in, we are assured we are going to get 91 \ncents back. That is not my understanding of what this bill does.\n  So I think here that there is an underlying feeling on the part of \nmany States two things: One, that we need a fairer treatment; and, two, \nthat we want to see some data. And, three, speaking now for myself, \nwhen we receive that data, it may answer a whole\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nlot of these questions so that indeed someone like me may end up voting \nfor an amendment such as this, as being an improvement over the status \nquo.\n  Now, there is another problem which none of us are going to solve \nhere. And that is that there are offsets for this increase. And we do \nnot know where those offsets are coming from. Because the budget is \ngoing to be adopted after we adopt this bill. And the Budget Committee \nis going to have to find, as I understand it for this upcoming year, $1 \nbillion-plus. We do not know where that $1 billion-plus is coming from.\n  Now, we are all in that boat. But it is a problem that we all ought \nto be concerned about. Is that $1 billion going to come from education? \nIs that $1 billion coming from veterans? It is going to come from \ndomestic discretionary spending. And even those who vote for this \namendment, it seems to me, have to be concerned with what lies down the \nroad in terms of paying for this committee add-on.\n  Again, that is nothing which data from the highway department is \ngoing to be able to answer. That is something which we are going to \nhave to fight out or debate in the weeks and months ahead. But it is a \nreal concern. It is an unanswered question. In this case it is a \nquestion which cannot be answered prior to the time when we will be \nvoting on this amendment. But, nonetheless, it should be raised as a \nflag, I think, for all of us. Even those of us who intensely support \nthis amendment, it seems to me, would have some concern about, how are \nwe going to pay for the offset, to pay for the amount of money which \nhas been added?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could interject. I thank the Senator. \nI rose for the purpose of a clarifying statement. You do not pose that \nin any way as a delay of a judgment by the Senate on the pending \namendment? It is just a realization that at some point in time the \nSenate, as a body, will have to consider where the offsets came from, \nbut not in the context of getting a definitive answer for the purposes \nof addressing a yea or nay on this amendment; am I not correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I said, that is a concern that I hope all of us have \nregardless of how we end up voting on this amendment as to how that \nmoney is going to be paid for, how that offset is going to be achieved.\n\n  Second is something I am very much concerned about. We keep hearing \nthoughts, rumors as to where this is coming from, but that will not be \nresolvable. I do believe the good chairman of the Budget Committee has \nindicated there will be no undue impact on any domestic discretionary \nprogram as a result, but I haven't seen those exact words--I have heard \nthat secondhand--that the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, has said something like no undue impact on any \ndiscretionary program. But I'm not going to quote him because I didn't \nactually see the quote itself.\n  So what it comes down to is that we have an amendment that is \npending. We have a request for information relative to a complicated \namendment, made yesterday to the highway department. We don't have that \ninformation.\n  If the managers of the bill and the sponsors of this amendment are \nwilling to get that information forthcoming before our vote, it seems \nto me we either ought to have a quorum, as I understand they are on \ntheir way, or we ought to set aside this amendment for an hour or two \nso those of us who are not decided on how to vote on this amendment \ncould be in a position where we could vote on it.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe, for purposes of this debate, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. \nAndrew Wheeler be granted floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ran a calculation for the Senator from \nMichigan and I will send it over to my good friend. He and I came to \nthe Senate together and sit on the Armed Services Committee together. \nWe have had many debates. The records are full. If the Senator would, \ntake a look at that and see whether or not my analysis of your State is \ncorrect. But as I listened carefully, the Senator made the \nrepresentation to the Senate in his remarks that there are some States \nthat will get less money than they would under the underlying bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is not correct. The Senator is not correct. I said \nabout two-thirds of the States get a smaller percentage under the \namendment than they do under the underlying bill. I will give the \nSenator some examples and have them printed in the Record.\n  I believe this chart comes from the Federal Highway Administration. I \nthink every State gets more money because there is a significant amount \nof money that is added to the pot. My statement is that about 38 States \nget a smaller percentage of a larger pot than they did.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's talk about the pot. You are addressing the \namendment that is pending before the Senate which we refer to as an \nadd-on to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. The pot I refer to is the total pot after \nthe add-on. I am saying under this chart of the highway administration, \nthis came in yesterday.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have a copy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If you look at the right-hand column, at the minuses, \nlooking at the 6-year percentages with the so-called ``option,'' which \nis the committee amendment, 38 of the States have a little minus in \nfront of them, meaning they usually get a slightly smaller percentage \nof the larger pot, which is represented by the amount of money totally \nthere after the committee amendment is adopted. That is the reference I \nmade.\n  Every State gets more money and every State--to put it very bluntly, \nsay that Michigan contributes an additional $110 million to the highway \nfund in this larger pot. That $110 million of the delta, the extra \nmoney going into this pot, to enlarge it, comes from Michigan, and we \nget back $100 million. These are hypothetical numbers. That means we \nare getting back more money, right? But we have put in, actually, a \nlarger share of money towards the amount that is going out.\n  My good friend from Texas, I am sure, would agree it is about time \nthat the money that goes to the highway fund is distributed to the \nStates. It is long overdue. We shouldn't be having surpluses built up \nfrom gas tax dollars which our people pay in order to build and \nmaintain highways. That is long overdue.\n\n  My point here, however, is that of the extra amount of that $26 \nbillion that the committee adds, say Michigan's share of that $26 \nbillion is $110 million--I am making up numbers here--and if we get \nback from that extra amount $100 million, the answer is, yes, we are \ngetting back more than we did under the underlying bill, but it still \ncould be a smaller percentage of the total than we would have gotten \nunder the underlying bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will yield momentarily.\n  Let's see if we can narrow the Senator's concern. The Senator's \nconcern is not with the underlying bill; it is the manner in which the \nfunds were allocated, roughly $6.9 billion to five programs, and that \n$6.9 billion coming off of the total $25.8 billion, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The answer is correct. The questions that I have are \nrelative to the amendment that we don't have the information on.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator expresses at the moment some disagreement as \nto how the committee took the total of $25.8 billion, then took a sum \nof $6.9 billion and allocated it to five programs; basically, is that \nthe area in which the Senator has disagreement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I have questions in that area. I don't have a \ndisagreement until I get the information, and then I may or may not \nhave a disagreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. And that hopefully is forthcoming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our dear colleague from Michigan reminds me \nof the drowning man that is on the verge of going down for the third \ntime and we have thrown him an inner tube and he is complaining that he \nhas to swim a little to get to it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will my friend yield for a quick comment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I never stop in the middle of an analogy.\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Texas has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator might yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind Senators to address each other \nthrough the third party. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will get to the point because I'm basically trying to \nanswer questions the Senator raised.\n  Let me go back to his made-up example. Currently, every taxpayer in \nAmerica who pays gasoline taxes is basically being cheated out of 25 \ncents on the dollar on average of what they pay in because it says \nright on the pump the money is going for highways and it's not. This \namendment, over a 6-year period, eliminates that problem.\n  The Senator from Michigan is saying if Michigan taxpayers now paying \n4.3 cents per gallon are currently paying $110 million in gasoline \ntaxes in that tax, what if this amendment only gives Michigan $100 \nmillion to build roads from this 4.3 cents per gallon. It seems to me \nyou don't have to have studied high mathematics to understand that \nMichigan is a lot better off getting $100 million of the $110 million \nthan they were getting zero from the $110 million.\n  When you look at the formula, because of the makeup of the National \nHighway System, there are many States that will not get every penny of \nit back to their State but they are going to be substantially better \noff than they are now and a tremendous amount of the underlying \ninequity will be fixed. That is the first point I wanted to make.\n  The second point I want to make is in terms of offsets, where we are \ngoing to cut other programs to pay for this, that we are going to \ndecide those offsets in the budget. Every Member of the Senate will \nhave an opportunity to vote on that.\n  Before we weep too much about the offsets, I go back to my example of \nthe rustler who has been stealing our cattle by taking 25 cents out of \nevery $1 in gasoline tax and spending it on something else. It may be \nthat in the process someone discovers that this rustler actually gave \nmoney to the First Baptist Church, but are we going to argue that we \ndon't want to stop rustling because a rustler contributed money when \nthe plate was passed at the First Baptist Church? The point is, we have \nto take the money away. That money should never have been there in the \nfirst place. This money should have been spent on roads from the \nbeginning.\n  Finally, before I yield to the Senator, and I will be happy to do it \nor yield the floor and let him have the floor, what I will try to do \nnot just for the Senator from Michigan but for all of our colleagues, I \nwill try to explain some of the logic of the underlying bill. I'm not \non the committee but I have studied the thing and understand it so that \nSenator Byrd and I could write our amendment with Senator Baucus and \nSenator Warner, so, in fact, I find myself in possession of information \nthat I never wanted to have to begin with but I think it is relevant to \nthis whole debate. I don't think people really understand how the \nhighway program works. Maybe as one who is a new possessor of this \nknowledge, I find it really reflects on this whole problem we are \ndealing with.\n  Let me try to very briefly deviate from my background as a \nschoolteacher, and be brief. Let me try to run through it and then \nexplain the games that people can play if they chose to. Since the \nbeginning of our highway program, we have had a general rule of thumb, \nand that has been a division of money from the highway trust fund. That \nportion that goes to highways has gone into two pots. One pot is money \nthat is available nationally under an account that is overseen by the \nSecretary of Transportation and the National Highway Administration, \nand that has normally been roughly 10 or 11 percent, total. That has \nfocused on individual priorities and a series of concerns that have not \ngenerally been dealt with by the allocation to the States. The other 90 \npercent has gone to the States. This is not a new invention with this \nbill. It has been true in every highway bill that we have had. It is \ntrue in this bill.\n  Now, I could personally go through this bill and take the 10 percent \nof items that will be funded under the national account and say there \nare a lot of these programs that I am not for. I don't want to create \nsadness by talking about what they are, but the point is, since they \ndeal with concerns for a big country, and Texas is one piece of it--the \nmost important piece, the largest piece--and shares more interest in \ncommon with the country because we have more diversity than anybody \nelse, it is true that we have money for building roads on public lands. \nWe are blessed in Texas in that we were a country first so we have \nvirtually no public lands. We never thought it made sense when we came \ninto the Union to have the United States own our State. So we will get \nvirtually no money out of the account that is available for building \nhighways on public lands. It is a little over $1 billion, if my memory \nserves me right.\n  Now, I could stand up here and say, ``Look, Texas has got no public \nlands to speak of. We are not going to get a penny out of that $1 \nbillion.'' The point being, like the distinguished Presiding Officer \nwho is from a Western State, he didn't choose to have the Federal \nGovernment own a huge chunk of his State. Probably over half the land \nin his State is owned by the Federal Government. I feel sorry for him. \nI don't think it is right. I would like to see some of that land back \nin private hands, I say to the Presiding Officer. The point is that is \npart of a national system. The Presiding Officer can't help it that the \nFederal Government owns over half of his State.\n  So, to adjust, in the 10 percent of the bill, we have a whooping $1 \nbillion that his State will benefit from, and my State won't benefit. \nWe won't get any of the money. Now, I could do a chart that says you \neliminate that program for funds to be spent on public lands and I \ncould show Texas gets more money. I can show that Virginia gets more \nmoney. We have money in here for roads on Indian reservations. We had \nthe most bitter part of the Indian wars in my State. We had Apaches and \nComanches raiding our capital in the 1870s. We have only a couple of \ntiny, little Indian reservations in Texas. Oklahoma has vast \nquantities, as does Arizona.\n\n  Now, I could stand up here and say, well, look, by building roads on \nIndian reservations, you are not doing anything for Texas. I could take \nthat billion dollars for roads on Indian reservations in the 10 percent \nnational account in the bill--I could strip it out and say, look, you \ndistribute it to all the States, and every State will gain. In fact, \nyou would probably get 40 of the 50 States in the Union that would gain \nif you did that. But is that how you write a national highway bill?\n  So the point I am making is that to single out parts of the 10 \npercent and say that if we eliminated them, we could have more to give \nthe States, look, if I were writing the highway bill by myself, I would \nnot even have the 10 percent. I would give all of it to the States. But \nI am not writing the highway bill by myself. What I am trying to \nexplain to people is that when you are singling out programs like the \nAppalachian Regional Highway Program, you are singling out a program \nthat has been in every highway bill since 1965. The money that is being \nprovided is actually a smaller percentage of the overall bill than \nPresident Clinton requested. The amount of money being provided is a \nsmaller percent than was spent under the last highway bill, when you \nadd up all the expenditures.\n  This is a program that became the law of the land in 1965. The \nprogram is on the verge of moving toward completion. You can single it \nout if you want to, but how is it less meritorious than building roads \non public lands? How is it less meritorious than building roads on \nIndian reservations? It's part of a series of national priorities.\n  Now, in case you don't know much about geography, Texas is not part \nof Appalachia. My State doesn't benefit one bit from that provision. \nBut the point is, it has been part of every program since 1965, and it \nis part of this 10 percent overhead to deal with specific programs. So \nif we could go back and reinvent the world, change the whole highway \nsystem, this logic would make sense. But I think singling out a couple \nof programs when there are many others that are more vulnerable--and we \ncan all play this game--in the end you don't have a highway bill.\n  Let me say, in terms of density, that I don't have to read very well \nto see\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nthat Texas, which has 3 of the 10 largest cities in the country, does \nnot benefit a nickel--not a penny--from this density thing. Where did \nthis density thing come from? First of all, I am not accepting any \nresponsibility. I am not on the committee. I would love to take it out. \nBut what is it trying to do?\n  Well, the old highway bill was written under the 1980 census, which \nwas outrageous. It happened because the House has been, until the last \nreapportionment, dominated by the East and Midwest. All of our formulas \nare rigged to take money away from the South and the West and give it \nto the East and the Midwest. We all know it. We are beginning to fix it \nwith this highway bill. But as a result of getting rid of the 1980 \ncensus, which is only 18 years old, by doing that we are going to have \nsome States that are substantial losers, and our colleagues are going \nto have to go back to their States and say that in the highway bill we \nreally got a dramatic change relative to the old bill, basically \nbecause people voted with their feet to move off to California, Texas, \nVirginia and Georgia.\n  What this whole density provision is about is trying to cushion the \nblow to those States. So I could offer an amendment--as apparently is \nbeing contemplated by others--to say, strike this density provision. \nLet me look here before I say that. Virginia gets nothing out of the \ndensity provision. I will mention one more. Rhode Island gets nothing \nfrom the density provision. So we could offer an amendment to strike \nthe density provision and give that money to other States, and we could \nshow that 40 States of the Union benefit and only 10 or 15 lose. But \nthe purpose was to write a bill that every State in the Union can live \nwith, and where people, in good conscience, can go home and say that \ngiven where we are, given the growth pattern of the country, we did as \nwell as we could expect to have done, given what has happened to the \npopulation in the country and the movement of population.\n  So I want to urge my colleagues to understand that we have always had \na division of roughly 90-10 in the funds for national priorities and to \nthe States. I wish we had no 10 percent, but we do, and we always have. \nSingling out specific programs is simply not fair when we look at the \nother programs, whether it's building roads on Indian lands or public \nlands, simply because we have no Indian lands in our State, or we have \nno public lands to speak of in our State. We need to understand what a \nnational highway bill is about is dealing with those things.\n  I want to conclude by going back to ARC. I know more about ARC than I \never started out wanting to know, given that I am not from there. But I \nhave had the privilege, in the last year, of working with a man who is \nvery much committed to Appalachia. When Senator Byrd was born in \nAppalachia, it was a big red letter banner day for Appalachia and for \nWest Virginia. He cares about this program intensely. So people look at \nthis and say that is a good and ready target. There are only 13 States \nin Appalachia, and that means there are 26 Senators. Again, when you \ntake 100 and subtract 26, you get more than a majority.\n  I want to be sure that everybody understands the following points:\n  No. 1. Appalachia has been part of the national section of this bill, \nin one form or another, since 1965. I guess Senator Byrd was the only \nperson who was here in 1965 and who voted for it, but it passed and \nit's the law of the land.\n  No. 2. We have a smaller percentage of the amount of money we are \nspending in this bill going to Appalachia than the President asked for. \nWe have a smaller percentage of this bill going to Appalachia than was \nactually funded over the last 6 years as a result of the appropriations \nprocess and the old bill, and so anybody who thinks that this is some \nnew program that has been put into this bill, that is providing money \nthat was not there over the last 30 years, or that somehow it is \nproviding more money as a percentage of the bill than we had in the \npast, is simply wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you are going to single out one little \nprogram, remember that everybody can play this game, whether it's \nIndian land roadbuilding or public land roadbuilding, or 25 other \ncategories; we can each pick some part of the bill that does not \nbenefit our State and we can try to take that part away to add money to \nthe formula. But the truth is that this roughly 90-10 formula has been \nin place throughout the whole history of the highway bill, and, in \nfact, if you knocked out this program and didn't change the makeup of \nthe highway bill, the Secretary of Transportation would decide where \nthe money is spent and would probably spend it on exactly the same \nthing.\n\n  So I wanted our colleagues to understand how the bill is made up, and \nI think that, other than the handful of people on the committee, people \ndon't know. So it looks like some giant conspiracy against them when, \nin fact, if you look at the totality of it, it makes sense. Since we \nall resent deals we are not part of--I certainly do--these deals they \nput together in committee look mysterious. But I think if you \nunderstand how the bill has evolved over the last 30 years and how it \nis made up, it is pretty reasonable, again, for the kind of work we are \ndoing.\n  I wasn't trying to get into a debate with the Senator from Michigan. \nI am from a big-time donor State. My State, under the old highway bill, \ngot back 77 cents out of every dollar. We are going to get back 91 \ncents out of every dollar in this bill, and I rejoice. It is progress. \nIn the future, when we build a vast North-South interstate system to go \nwith our East-West system, maybe in the next highway bill, people will \nbe standing here saying that Texas is getting back $2.12 for every \ndollar, because now you are building these interstates from Lubbock to \nTexarkana.\n  The point is, that is what a National Highway System is about. When \nit works in our favor, we are all quiet about it, hoping nobody \nnotices. When it works against us, we scream to the heavens. That is \nhow the system works.\n  I would be happy to yield the floor and let the Senator from Michigan \nspeak, or answer a question. I didn't want to stop in the middle of my \nanalogy, knowing how clever the Senator from Michigan was, knowing he \nwould destroy it outright.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. It has \nbeen interesting. I may have made a mistake. Perhaps I should have \ntaken the block of money that was to correct the inequity of the donor \nStates and put it up there above the line as one of those programs. But \nit was a program. While not clearly identified above, it was a program. \nLet me give you some examples.\n  In the 1991 ISTEA I bill--I was a conferee and I was in the second \nrow and was told to be quiet while the dominating chairmen, \npredominantly from the Northeast, controlled it. That bill came out, \nand Massachusetts got $2.45; Connecticut, $1.92; New York, $1.25; \nMaine, $1.23; New Jersey, $1.09; Pennsylvania, $1.16. The donor States: \nSouth Carolina got 72 cents; Missouri, 85 cents; Michigan, 80 cents; \nMississippi, 83 cents; Virginia, 79 cents; Florida, 82 cents.\n  You bet I took a block of money and I straightened it out, together \nwith the support of my distinguished ranking member, the senior Senator \nfrom Montana. We straightened it out. We took a chunk of money and \nbalanced that thing out so that now, with the underlying bill, they get \n90 cents--not these egregious disproportionate sums, but 90 cents.\n  With the amendment before us, we tried to allocate the dollars so the \ndonor States came up--as many as we could--to 91 cents. Maybe one or \ntwo were a fraction under, about 90.8 cents. But that's what we tried \nto do under this bill. There it is.\n  I am going to put into the Record at this point a chart, in the \nbattle of the charts now, to show all of the States and how they fared \nunder the 1991 bill compared to the underlying bill at 90 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\n\n\n    COMPARISON OF AVERAGE ANNUAL APPORTIONMENTS FOR VARIOUS SURFACE TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION PROPOSALS*   \n                                            [In

                                      \n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Listening to the Senator talk about eliminating the \ntremendous inequity in the 1991 bill, I think it would behoove every \nMember of the Senate, when they are looking at how well off they are \nunder your bill with our amendment, to look at how they did in 1991 and \nsee that each of the inequities that we chafe under are far diminished \nunder your bill and, of course, knowing you represent Virginia, and \nlistening to the fact that on the old highway bill you were sitting in \nthe back room in obscurity and silence, and now you speak with such \ngreat clarity, it reminds me of the old saying in the part of the \ncountry we are from, which is, ``Save your Confederate money, boys, the \nSouth will rise again.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Before we invoke too much history here, it wasn't just \nthe South; it was Michigan and some other States that were in the donor \ncategory. But I am going to put this on the table. So, when the call up \nyonder is taken here shortly on this amendment, you can see exactly \nwhere you fared under the 1991 bill compared to where you fare under \nthis bill. And it is absolutely striking.\n  Again, I am back to try to be helpful among the several States. There \nstands 90 like a stone wall. We tried to get above 90 as best we could \nfor as many donor States. And I think when the final charts come out, I \ncan show you exactly where the donor States went under the \nrecalculations that we get under the amendment.\n  But I thank the Senator from Texas. It was very interesting to listen \nto his rendition, which was accurate, or I would have interjected. It \nwas accurate as to how these bills have been put through, through the \nyears. And you can fault the ARC. My State happens to be a beneficiary. \nTherefore, when I speak in support of ARC, I do so think that Virginia \nis a beneficiary. It is proudly in the Appalachian corridor. But that \nprogram has been there since 1965. It was enacted by the U.S. Senate in \nconjunction with the House. As a matter of fact, I think it was William \nJennings Randolph who was then chairman of the committee on which I am \nproudly serving, and now under the leadership of Senator Chafee and \nSenator Baucus. But that was at that time. And it is a program that is \nunfinished, as Senator Byrd pointed out, and hopefully this will take \nit almost to completion under this bill.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, if there are other Senators desiring to speak, I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  First, let me assure my good friend from Texas that I agree with most \nof what he said, including the reference to Senator Byrd, as not only a \nred letter day for West Virginia when Senator Byrd came to the Senate, \nbut it was a red letter day for the Nation and for the Senate when \nSenator Byrd came to the Senate. And his effort on behalf of the \nAppalachian Regional Commission is one that I think is a justified \neffort.\n  This is a national bill. I happen to agree with that. The Senator \nfrom Texas made reference to the fact that this is a national bill. \nThis is also a complicated amendment. Those of us who have been in the \ndonor status for decades want to understand. There are other Senators \nwho would like to get the data that hopefully now the Transportation \nDepartment is providing us.\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\n But for those of us who have given tens of millions, totaling hundreds \nof millions of dollars, as donor States, based on formulas which cannot \nbe justified in our eyes, we surely want to understand what these new \nformulas provide, and why.\n  I asked a question about the new density program. It is a new \nprogram. This is not one that has been in the law for some time like \nthe ARC or the public lands. This is a new program based on density. \nHow are those rules divided? For those of us who have dense areas in \nour States, why is it that we are not on the list while some others \nStates are on the list? It may be a very good formula. It may be a fair \nformula, taken in context. But it is a new formula and one I surely \nwant to understand since we have some dense areas in my State.\n  We have asked for some information. I think it is only fair that we \nget this information. It is going to affect how at least some of us may \nvote on this amendment. Speaking for myself, it is going to affect how \nI vote on this amendment. In some sense, we are better off. There is a \n91 percent assurance, we are told, that is built into the law. That is \nan improvement over the past.\n  However, there are some disadvantages to the approach as well. One of \nthe disadvantages is that we now are creating a very large uncertainty \nas to how these added funds are going to be paid for with other \nprograms. We cannot solve that here. But we all have to understand that \nwe are taking that risk. For those of us who are still in a significant \ndonor position, even though it has improved over the last ISTEA, we \nhave to weigh the risk of losing important discretionary programs \nagainst the improvements that we seek.\n  My good friend from Texas talked about throwing a lifeline to \nsomebody who is drowning. Is this a 10-foot lifeline to somebody who is \ndrowning 20 feet offshore? That is the question we have to analyze. \nDoes someone in the position of representing a donor State vote for \nthis because it is an improvement, with all the risks that are there? \nOr do we vote no on this because it still embodies for 6 more years an \nunfairness that we perceive?\n  All I am urging upon my colleagues is this: that surely fairness \ndictates, if not the outcome of formulas, we be given information upon \nwhich we wish to rely in voting on an amendment in a bill. As I said, I \nmay vote for this amendment, I may vote for the bill, but we want \ninformation to help us make that judgment. For those of us who have \nbeen in a donor State position for decades, it seems to me that this is \na fair thing for us to ask and a fair thing for us to expect.\n  I have no need to talk longer on this. I do have a need to get the \ninformation which will permit me to make that assessment, which I have \nreferred to.\n  I will suggest the absence of a quorum, unless there is somebody else \nwho wishes to speak, in order that we can now visit with the \ntransportation people and obtain that information that we have been \nwaiting for.\n  Mr. President, unless there is somebody else who wishes to address \nthe body at this point, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chart that \nI referred to of the Federal Highway Administration be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take the floor because we are presently in \na quorum call and I thought it might be a good time for me not to \noverly impose on the Senate, since the Senate is not having any debate \nat the moment anyway.\n  Mr. President, Sir Francis Bacon, who was the Lord Chancellor and who \nultimately went to the Tower--he wasn't executed, but he went to the \nTower. In 1621, he was impeached and he was sent to the Tower for \naccepting bribes, which he admitted. He said there are three things \nthat make a nation great and prosperous: a fertile soil, busy \nworkshops, and easy conveyance for men and goods from place to place.\n  The Persians knew the importance of good roads, and had a network of \nroads that connected Susa and Ecbatana and Sardis and Babylon and \nNinevah and Carchemish. Cyrus the Great was the king of Anshan in 559 \nB.C., and he became the king of all Persia when he defeated the Medes \nin 550. From 550 B.C. until 529 B.C. Cyrus ruled. Cyrus was killed in a \nbattle with the Massagetai, whose ruling queen was named Tomyris--\nTomyris. It's a very interesting story.\n  Herodotus, the author of history, tells us about it. I won't repeat \nthat part today. Cyrus was killed in 529 B.C. and Cambyses, his son--\nCambyses II--ruled from 529 to 522 B.C. Then Darius the Great ruled \nfrom 522 B.C. to 485 B.C.\n  Darius the Great--and Herodotus tells us this--Darius became king \nupon the neigh of a horse. He and some others joined in a conspiracy \nand assassinated an imposter to the throne. Upon the death of the \nimposter, these seven conspirators, of which Darius was one, decided \nthey had to make a decision as to who would rule. They had a very \ninteresting discussion about democracy and aristocracy and monarchy. \nHerodotus tells us all about it. It would be interesting for Senators \nto read that, or to reread it in the event they have already done so.\n  In any event, they decided at sunrise they would go out into the \nsuburbs, these several conspirators, and that the first horse that \nneighed, the rider of that horse would be king of Persia. Darius \nsubsequently told his groom, Oebares, about this and said, ``This is \nwhat we have agreed upon. Do you have any ideas?'' Oebares said, ``Yes, \ndon't you be concerned about it. Your horse will be the first to \nneigh.''\n  That evening, Oebares took the favorite mare of Darius' horse into \nthe suburbs and tied her to a tree. He then took Darius' horse to where \nthe mare was tethered, and, after a little while, returned with \nDarius's horse into the city for the night. The next morning, Darius \nand the other conspirators rode out into the suburbs with their horses. \nAs they came near to the area where the mare was still tethered, \nDarius' horse neighed. The other conspirators immediately fell down \nupon the ground and proclaimed Darius to be the new king of all Persia. \nThis is according to Herodotus.\n  Darius the Great built great roads. The Egyptians knew how to build \ngood roads, the Etruscans, the Carthaginians, but the Romans were the \ntruly great roadbuilders. Some of the roads and bridges that the Romans \nbuilt hundreds of years ago are still in use. Many Senators who have \nvisited Rome and have gone out to Tivoli--a few hours drive--have \ntraveled the Old Appian Way, which was built by Appius Claudius Caecus, \nbeginning in 312 B.C. and extending from Rome to Capua and on to \nBrundisium. The Romans knew how to build roads. They understood that in \nthe center of the road there had to be a crown so that the water would \ndrain off on each side and that on each side there had to be a ditch \nfor the runoff water. These roads enabled the Roman legions to reach \nany part of the vast Roman empire. The Romans were great roadbuilders. \nAnd they built bridges, some of which are still in use today.\n  Now, roads in our time are very important and we have heard the \nexpression that America is a country on wheels. People are on wheels. \nThey are going hither, thither and yon at all times.\n  The Department of Transportation has indicated that the highways in \nall of the national system have deteriorated and that only 39 percent \nof the highways in the national system are in ``good'' condition.\n  We now have this highway bill that has come to the floor and we have \nalready discussed the amendment, how it came about, and the meetings \nthat took place in the majority leader's office. I said before and I \nsay again, the majority leader performed a tremendous service in \ninviting those who were participants in the discussions, inviting them \nto his office and sitting with us each day, assisting us in reaching an \nagreement which now takes the form of an amendment to the ISTEA II \nbill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.\n  I came into these meetings, in a way, as someone out of the highways \nand hedges. I am not on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I \nam not on the Budget Committee. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has jurisdiction over this legislation. I am not on that \ncommittee. Mr. Baucus is the ranking member of that committee. Mr. \nChafee is the chairman. Mr. Warner is a member of that committee and is \nchairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of that committee. Mr. \nDomenici is chairman of the Budget Committee, and Mr. Gramm of Texas is \na member of the Budget Committee. Those were the participants. I \nbelieve Mr. D'Amato sat in on one or two meetings. He is chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the mass transit \nmoneys. That was not part of our amendment.\n\n  So, as I say, I was a stranger, in effect, to these meetings, not \nbeing a member of the committees that were directly involved. But I got \ninto this thing because of Appalachia and because the moneys that were \nbeing deposited into the highway trust fund were not being spent for \nhighways. And I talked with various Senators, upon one occasion with \nthe Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus. I said, ``We need help on \nAppalachian highways.'' He said, ``Well, we need more money, we need \nmore money.'' I said, ``OK, let's spend the money that is going into \nthe highway trust fund. That is what the people think it is being \ncollected for; let's spend it.''\n  Mr. Gramm of Texas had offered an amendment last year in the Finance \nCommittee to transfer the 4.3-cent gas tax, of which 3.45 cents is for \nhighways and 0.85 cent, or a little less than 1 penny per gallon, is \nfor mass transit.\n  Mr. Gramm had taken the bull by the horns and had, in the Finance \nCommittee, offered an amendment, which was adopted, to transfer the 4.3 \ncents gas tax into the trust fund.\n  Senator Gramm's amendment was later adopted by the Congress in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act. Congress adopted that proposal, and that money has \nbeen going into the highway trust fund but not being spent.\n  For those two reasons, I invited myself to the ``party.'' I came up \nwith this fine team of Gramm, Baucus, and Warner, and we all said, \n``Let's spend that money on highways and bridges,'' and we accordingly \njoined in sponsoring the amendment to do so.\n  That is how the Romans would have spent it. That is how the Etruscans \nwould have spent it. I think that if Darius and the Persians were here \ntoday, they would say spend it on roads.\n  The four of us worked hard over a period of several weeks and months \nto get other cosponsors on the amendment. In the final analysis, we got \n54 cosponsors in all. The day we reached an agreement on the amendment, \nmay I say to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, I received a call \nfrom a 55th Senator saying, ``I want to get on that amendment.''\n  So it is never too late--never too late, never too late--to go to the \naltar, never too late to get religion, never too late to join in a good \ncause.\n  There were several Senators who said they did not want to cosponsor \nthe amendment for various reasons, but if it came to a vote, they would \nsupport the amendment. I hope that will be the case.\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\n  This bill does not please everybody. I have not talked about \nAppalachia because I sense that there is a tendency for some people to \nthink that I am only interested in Appalachia. However, I listened to \nSenator Gramm just a little while ago make an excellent case for \nAppalachia.\n  Many times I have read Daniel Webster's reply to Senator Hayne of \nSouth Carolina on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 26 and 27, 1830. It \nwas on January 26 and 27 that Webster took the floor in the old Chamber \njust down the hall and made his magnificent reply to Senator Hayne of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Many of the schoolboys in this country years ago memorized those \nspeeches by Webster. We used to do those things. Webster spoke from \nabout 12 pages of notes, one of the great, great speeches of all time, \nperhaps not the greatest. Demosthenes in his oration on the Crown \nprobably delivered the greatest oration of all time. Cicero was once \nasked which of Demosthenes' speeches he liked best, and he said, ``The \nlongest.''\n  Webster, in his debate with Hayne, made my case concerning ``a road \nover the Alleghanies.'' I have quoted him a number of times over the \nyears. I will not do that today. The record has been made.\n  But I could not have said it better than did Senator Gramm earlier \ntoday.\n  So much for Appalachia at this point. I came here today to speak on \nthe overall amendment. The adoption of this amendment signals a \ncritical milestone in restoring integrity to our highway trust fund and \nthe trust of the traveling public--the trust of the traveling public in \ntheir Federal Government. You drive up to the gas tank and you buy \ngasoline; you pay 18.3 cents on every gallon of gasoline in Federal \ntax--18.3 cents.\n  The ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who \nknows a lot about these things--I am not supposed to know a lot about \nthis subject; don't know a lot about anything probably, not as much as \nI used to know on many subjects.\n  The Senator from Montana will correct me if I make a misstep here. \nThe American people when they drive up to that gas pump see the little \ncylinder running round and round and round, and they know that the gas \nis flowing out of that nozzle into the tank of their car. As that \ncylinder rolls, the gas is pouring out of the nozzle. In their mind's \neye, they should also see that as that cylinder rolls and the gas flows \ninto the tank, there is also money flowing from their purchase into the \nhighway trust fund. Just as the cylinder rolls, that money is flowing \nright into the highway trust fund.\n  So, there is 18.3 cents on the gallon that they pay in Federal tax. \nAs Senator Gramm has put it a number of times--the only part we are \ntalking about here is the last 4.3 cents permanent gas tax that was \nadded by the Congress--we are not talking about the cattle that were \nrustled before the 4.3 cents tax was enacted, we just want you to stop \nrustling the cattle.\n  In any event, we are talking about the 4.3 cents. Actually, in our \namendment, we are talking about the 3.45 cents of that 4.3 cents, and \nwe say that the people believe that that money is going into the \nconstruction and repair and maintenance of the highway system.\n  That trust fund was created in 1956. I am probably the only Member of \nthe Senate who was in Congress at the time that trust fund was created. \nThat was during the Eisenhower administration, when the interstate \nsystem of highways was created, all of which has been completed. That \ntrust fund is what we are talking about. The 4.3 cents gas tax is going \ninto the trust fund, and it should be spent on highways.\n  My colleagues and I who cosponsor this amendment are simply saying \nlet's keep faith with the American people.\n  Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner and I have toiled mightily over these \nlast several months to boost the resources available over the next 6 \nyears to better meet the needs of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure and better spend the resources that are collected from \nthe public and deposited in the highway trust fund.\n  Over the last several years, spending on our Nation's highways has \nbeen restricted so severely that the highway account of the highway \ntrust fund now shows an unspent balance of more than $12 billion, money \nthat sits idle in the trust fund, serving only the purpose of \noffsetting the Federal deficit at a time when our roadways and bridges \nare deteriorating at a rapid rate and our constituents are required to \nsit in ever-worsening traffic jams.\n  This past summer, the Senate adopted the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nwhich, through the efforts of my colleague Senator Gramm, took the 4.3 \ncents gas tax initially levied for deficit reduction and moved that \nrevenue into the Highway Trust Fund. As I indicated earlier, of that \n4.3 cents, 3.45 cents was newly-deposited into the highway account of \nthe highway trust fund. However, the ISTEA II bill reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, S. 1173, did not authorize one \npenny--one penny--of that additional revenue to be spent on our \nNation's highways and bridges. It was at this time--part of this is a \nrepetition of what I have said earlier--it was at this time that \nSenator Gramm and I joined forces to mount a campaign to amend the \ncommittee bill so as to allow the spending of the resources of the 4.3 \ncents--spend it.\n  We were very pleased to be joined in our efforts by Senators Baucus \nand Warner, respectively, the ranking member and chairman of the \nSurface Transportation Subcommittee.\n  It has been a vigorous battle that we have waged here over the past \nseveral weeks trying to gain the minds and the hearts of other \nSenators. Up to one week ago we had 54 cosponsors, and then we got a \n55th one. But we were faced with very able adversaries in these \nmeetings in Senator Lott's office--very able adversaries in Senator \nDomenici and Senator Chafee.\n  One week ago, the majority leader, Mr. Lott, invited us to his \nchambers in an effort to negotiate a compromise on this issue. And I \nhave commended and will commend again the fair-minded manner in which \nthe majority leader presided over those negotiations.\n  Senators Baucus and Gramm and Warner and I were not inclined to \nnegotiate a solution that in any way abandoned our principle of \nauthorizing the spending of the revenue in the highway account of the \nhighway trust fund. And we made that point very clear. Even so, there \nwere other factors that appropriately were brought into the discussion \nand merited the attention of all participants.\n  Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office has reestimated the \nrevenue stream of the 4.3 cents coming into the trust fund, as well as \nthe overall cost of the committee-reported ISTEA bill. It also \nreestimated the total amount of new revenue coming into the trust fund \nover the life of the next highway bill, 1998-2003. The changes \nreflected in this amendment, in comparison to the original Byrd-Gramm-\nBaucus-Warner amendment, largely reflect the appropriate differences in \nCBO's estimates.\n  The original Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment authorized $30.9 \nbillion, an amount equivalent to CBO's original estimate of the revenue \nto the highway account of the trust fund for the period, fiscal years \n1999-2003. CBO reestimated this revenue stream to be a level of $27.4 \nbillion. This amendment that we are cosponsoring, that we are presently \nconsidering today, totals $25.9 billion of the $27.4 billion that we \nhad asked for. So we came down from $27.4 billion to $25.9 billion. \nAnd, as such, this amendment covers 94 percent of our initial goal.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have been in several high-level negotiations in \nmy public career of 52 years. It is rare that I am offered 94 percent \nof my original position and, as such, I, along with Senators Gramm, \nBaucus and Warner, embraced this final compromise. And as was true \nunder the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, every State--every State; \nevery State; every State--will see substantially increased highway \nfunding authorized in this bill.\n  Now, we brought money to the table. And I can understand how \neverybody now wants a chunk of that money that we brought to the table. \nAnd they should have a chunk. I came to the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives when there were 48 States in the Union. And when I was \nsworn in on January 3, 1959, the two Alaska Senators were sworn in with \nme. There were 96 Senators, and those two Alaska Senators that were \nsworn in with me\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nmade 98 Senators. Later that year, the two new Hawaii Senators came in \nto make a total of 100 Senators.\n  Well, 50 States in the United States are benefiting under this \namendment. I wanted to see the tide rise for every State--the tide \nwould rise and lift the boats for all the States. I wanted to see that \nmoney taken out of the trust fund and spent for highways and bridges in \nall 50 States.\n  And I wanted the people of Appalachia, who have waited 32 years, to \nsee their boats rise. I wanted to see a consistent, secure source of \nfunding for those Appalachian highways. Appalachia consists of 13 \nStates, 200,000 square miles, 22 million people in Appalachia. We are \nall concerned about helping the disadvantaged and minorities.\n  Well, here is a whole region of people, stretching from southwest New \nYork down the spine of the Appalachians into northern Mississippi and \nAlabama, people who have been disadvantaged. Yes. We are also a \nminority in some ways, a minority of people for whom the general \nprosperity of the Nation has not been fully enjoyed.\n  I was here when Congress passed the legislation authorizing the \nAppalachian Development highway system in 1965. For the entire \nAppalachian region, 78 percent of the highways have been completed--78 \npercent. In West Virginia, only 74 percent of the Appalachian highways \nhave been completed. West Virginia is the only State among the 13 \nStates that is wholly within Appalachia.\n  The people of Appalachia have been promised this a long time. It, \ntoo, is a part of the Nation.\n  So, out of the roughly $26 billion in our amendment, yes, $2.5 \nbillion is for Appalachia. Not just for West Virginia, but the 13 \nStates of Appalachia. I am proud of Appalachia, proud to be a West \nVirginian. I asked for only a small portion, $2.5 billion, for the 13 \nAppalachian States, and all the rest of the money that I helped to \nbring to the table can be spread throughout the 50 States.\n  Every State--every State--will see substantially increased dollars as \na result of this amendment. Moreover, Senator Domenici's participation \nin these negotiations has given rise to an understanding that \nadditional outlays will be found through the budget resolution to \nenable the Appropriations Committee to fund these additional \nauthorizations.\n\n  I thank Senator Domenici, who brought his considerable expertise on \nbudgetary matters to the negotiating table. Here is a little bit more \nabout Appalachia. I have already spoken about Appalachia, but I will \nread it. It won't take long.\n  Regarding the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), I have \nworked long and hard to secure contract authority authorizations for \nthe program in the new highway bill.\n  Let the States in Appalachia draw down contract authority from a \nreliable source of funds and complete their system, and in doing so, \nthey, too, will lift all the books of the Nation.\n  In January of 1997, over a year ago, I visited the President in the \nOval Office and urged him to include contract authority authorizations \nfor the Appalachian Highway System in his ISTEA II proposal. He \nexpressed his support for my position and, subsequently, did include \n$2.19 billion in contract authority in his ISTEA II proposal.\n  Under the agreement that has been reached, authorizations of contract \nauthority for the Appalachian Highway System will result in a total of \n$2.19 billion in authorized contract authority over the six years, \n1998-2003. This is the same amount as requested by the President, a \ncompromise which I am willing to accept.\n  Let me emphasize that these funds will not be earmarked in any way. \nThey will be allocated to the states on the basis of the mileage yet to \nbe completed and on the cost to complete that mileage.\n  At markup the day before yesterday, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee utilized the new resources that were agreed to in the \nnegotiations to satisfy the concerns of several other members from \nseveral other regions of the country. The amendment includes additional \nauthorizations for the donor states, for parks and refuge roads, and \nfor a new ``density'' program.\n  As I say, each of us would like to have more in this bill. I don't \nwatch TV very much. I am very selective about what I watch on that \nmagnificent medium, but I do watch these presentations that come along \nfrom time to time that show us what is happening out in animal country. \nI see a group of animals chasing another animal. I see the powerful \nlion, a herd of lions, and they are stalking, stalking, stalking a poor \ngazelle, a zebra, or some other animal. Finally the lion--ah, the king \nof beasts!\n  I remember the old fable in which a fox and a lion were having a \ndiscussion, and the fox said, ``Look, I have many whelps, and you have \nonly one.'' The lion answered and said, ``Yes I have only one, but that \nis a lion.''\n  The lion closes in for the kill. The lion attacks the victim, and \nthen all the other lions rush in and seize a share of the kill. They \nwant in on the kill. That is like it is sometimes in politics.\n  I hope that with the adoption of this amendment the Senate will move \nrapidly to debate the remaining amendments to the bill so we can ensure \nthe earliest possible opportunity to send a comprehensive 6-year \ntransportation bill to the President. I remind my colleagues that, \nincluding today, there are 33 sessions remaining through May 1. Come \nthe stroke of that clock, 12 o'clock midnight on May 1, no State can \nobligate an additional dollar for highways. We have to move rapidly to \nadopt a highway program. We must remember that our colleagues in the \nother body have yet to act on a 6-year highway bill. With the breaking \nof this logjam, I hope our colleagues in the other body will move \nexpeditiously to pass a robust multiyear highway bill that meets or \nexceeds the levels authorized here today so that the authorizing \ncommittees can get to conference and send a bill to the President prior \nto May 1.\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to thank sincerely our minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, who carefully monitored our progress and \nsupported our efforts. Again, I thank my principal cosponsors, Senators \nGramm, Baucus and Warner. We did not allow ourselves to be divided in \nthis effort, and the level of funding in this amendment reflects the \nsuccess we enjoy by remaining united.\n  Finally, let me thank Senators Domenici and Chafee, two fine \ncommittee chairmen, who are equally able today as allies as they were \nas adversaries at an earlier time. This is an important bill to you who \nare listening and watching via television and radio. This is for you \nand it is for your children--your children.\n\n     An old man traveling a lone highway\n     Came at evening, cold and gray\n     To a chasm vast and wide and steep,\n     With waters rolling cold and deep.\n     The old man crossed in the twilight dim;\n     The sullen stream held no fears for him.\n     But he turned, when he reached the other side,\n     And he built a bridge to span the tide.\n\n     ``Old man,'' said a fellow pilgrim standing near,\n     ``You are wasting your strength in building here.\n     Your journey will end with the passing day,\n     And you never again will travel this way.\n     You have crossed the chasm deep and wide;\n     Why build you a bridge at eventide?``\n\n     The builder lifted his old gray head.\n     ``Good friend, in the path I have come,'' he said,\n     ``There followeth after me today\n     A youth whose feet must pass this way.\n     This chasm, which was but naught to me,\n     To that fair youth might a pitfall be.\n     He, too, must cross in the twilight dim.\n     Good friend, I am building this bridge for him.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know the time is running out on the \ndebate on this major amendment, the amendment that is in the nature of \na substitute. But I wanted to take about 5 minutes and express my views \nabout it.\n  Frankly, it is common knowledge around here that I was not in favor \nof moving quickly with the ISTEA bill. But clearly, we are ready now. \nWe have\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\nhad ample opportunity to discuss how much money is coming into the \ntrust fund from the 4.3 cents, how much contract authority ought to be \nobligated to use it up during the next 5 years. Part of that would be \nin 1998. So it is a 6-year cycle. We arrived at a conclusion that is \npretty clear and pretty close to fair, in my opinion. In fact, I think \nit is about as well as we can do.\n  America needs highways. The U.S. Government has a lot of programs it \nis involved in that are not its responsibility. But there is no \nquestion that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to \nappropriately handle the gasoline tax money and to let our States build \nroads with it. So, in a very real sense, it is a very high priority, \nbecause for many things that we spend money on, we are not, in a sense, \nas trustees, obligated to spend money for those things. And there are \nscores of them.\n  So I have come to the conclusion that the dollar number of $173 \nbillion as the total expenditure over the next 5 years is a right \nnumber, consisting of the gasoline tax of 4.3 cents which used to be in \nthe general fund and is now in the trust fund. I believe it is going to \nhelp our States in many ways, and I think in many parts of the United \nStates it is going to provide some very, very healthy employment where \nit is needed.\n  In addition, it seems to me that the chairman of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, with the able assistance of Senator \nBaucus as its ranking member, and the entire committee, all of whom \nhave voted in favor of this amendment, have put together a very good \ncross section of the kinds of things we need in these changing times to \ncarry out our responsibility with reference to this gasoline money and \nget some national programs that are necessary and put as much of it as \nwe can--91 percent minimum--to every State, as I understand it, in \nreturn for their dollars so that they can begin this process of gearing \nup to build more roads. And they will take a little while for that. \nThis is a very big increase. They are not going to be able to start \nnext month with a maximum effort in this program. It will take the rest \nof this year and part of next year before it is actually built up to \nthe maximum.\n  But I think the American people, probably on more than anything else \nwe are going to be voting on around here--a broad cross section, not a \nlittle special interest or a sliver of our society, but a very broad \ncross section--want more roads, if we have gasoline tax money to pay \nfor them. And many States have put their own gasoline tax on it and are \neven doing more.\n  There is nothing more frustrating for the people in my home State in \na growing city to find out--already when we are not even 1 million in \npopulation--that their roads are clogged, the freeways are not working, \nand nothing causes them to wonder more what is going on in terms of \nplanning and appropriate expenditure of resources. We are about to say \nto them that I think this is about as good as we can do, with all of \nthe competing interests. This is about as fair a program for all of the \nsovereign States and for the kind of special highway research and the \nlike that is necessary.\n  So from my standpoint, I am on the amendment. I wasn't on the \noriginal Byrd-Gramm amendment. We had some very lengthy debates trying \nto arrive at the right dollar number--we did-- that permit me in good \nconscience to say that we have a good bill. There are some very \nlegitimate questions. And, if there were Senators here, they could \nprobably ask me, with some degree of difficulty--and I would have some \ndegree of difficulty answering them--that is, since every year we put \nin an appropriated amount for these highways that comes within the \nannual cap that we must live with, the annual total domestic program \nspending, how are we going to add this to the entourage of American \nprograms that exist and still meet that cap when we didn't contemplate \nthis program?\n  Let me repeat, I see no difficulty doing that for the next year. We \nhave to find just a little over $1 billion to accomplish that purpose \nin the first year. It grows a little bit, because contract authority is \nslow to spend, and it will get bigger. In the fourth and fifth year, it \nwill be bigger, and then well beyond the caps that will be spent. But \ncaps won't be around in the last year of this expenditure. Nonetheless, \nI believe that since this is so vitally important, that we will find \nthe wherewithal to meet our caps--that is, meet our total domestic \nexpenditures--and, yet, be able to fund this program.\n  If some Senator, insisting on knowing precisely what program would be \nconstrained, cut back or eliminated in order to pay for it, I wouldn't \nbe prepared to tell you that. But I am prepared to tell you that the \nBudget Committee will have to do that. It will make some \nrecommendations on how we pay for this program and maintain the \nauthenticity and variety of our caps where we believe that our balanced \nbudget will be a balanced budget. I think we can get there.\n  I thank everybody who participated, and all who have joined today in \nthis amendment can say they were part of the original amendment which \npushed this forward. And I have no quibble with them. There were a lot \nof Senators on that--not quite as many as the proponents would have \nliked. I had a little bit to do with that. I asked some not to go on so \nthat we could make an agreement. I hope they are not feeling put upon, \nhaving waited and now to be able to vote for this bill and be on it. I \ndon't like to do that, but I sort of thought it would be better for \neveryone if we slowed up a little bit. And it turned out well.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we spent a good deal of time this \nafternoon without any action on the floor, in quorum calls. We want \nvery much to get on with this bill. People ought to bring over their \namendments. If they have problems--as you know, we are just dealing \nsolely with the so-called Chafee amendment, which is the major \namendment dealing with the increased financing for a whole series of \nprograms. I see no reason why we should not go to a vote. No one has \nbrought over any amendments. Nobody is proposing anything here on the \nfloor. We have worked out the ones who have. We have worked them out. \nOthers say they are going to get together. They may be along. It is all \nvery indefinite. I see no reason why at a quarter of 3 we should not \nhave a vote.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the tilt I have, because I want to get on \nwith this bill. There are other lengthy amendments after this. This is \nnot the last amendment by a long shot. There are other amendments that \nwe have to consider. We have one involving disadvantaged business \nenterprises and a whole series of others. There are some 100-plus \namendments out there. Clearly, hopefully, they are not all going to be \nbrought up, but we ought to get on with this. If people have problems, \ncome on over here.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I chime in with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator, chairman of our committee, Senator Chafee, and \nencourage Senators who do have amendments on this underlying amendment \nto come on over. I am going to encourage the chairman to go to a final \nvote on this amendment in the next 25 minutes, by a quarter of 3. \nSenators have had more than ample notice all day long, certainly this \nafternoon, and having heard from the chairman and from myself, all the \noffices around, they have about 25 minutes to get here. That is more \nthan fair. I think it is, frankly, in fairness to other Senators who \nwant to get on with this bill, move on with it--it's in fairness to \nthem that we vote by a quarter to 3 on this final amendment. Unless \nSenators come to the floor with their amendments where we can work out \nsome kind of time agreement in some expeditious manner, I really \nstrongly encourage the chairman to vote at quarter to 3 if there are no \npending amendments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I share the frustration of the chairman and ranking \nmember. I advise them I have an amendment which is at the desk. \nEverything has been worked out with the minority, majority, EPA. In a \nvery few minutes I would like to set aside any business to take that \nup. It should be a very short amendment and should be voice voted.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma. He has worked \nwith us, starting last night. I just finished a conversation with the \nAdministrator of EPA. The Senator and the Administrator have worked out \ntheir problems. Certainly it is something I can accept, and I will have \nan opportunity to discuss it with the ranking member, and I am \nconfident he will find it acceptable, too. That's what we want to do. \nLet's get on with these things. The Senator from Oklahoma has been over \nhere.\n  I just want to say to the Senator from Oklahoma, as soon as we get \nhis worked out then we will move to set aside this and see if we can't \ndispose of his amendment quickly.\n  The Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. MACK. I just want to address myself to comments that were made by \nSenator Levin a little earlier with respect to, frankly, those of us \nwho are considered donor States. We are still looking for more \ninformation. I understand from your point of view we have all the \ninformation that there is to have, and we ought to have sufficient data \nto make decisions about where we are on this amendment.\n  I would say to the distinguished Senator that last evening several of \nus met with our staffs, going over, asking questions about what the \nimpact of the amendment would be to our individual States. There was no \nclarity last night. We called and asked for a meeting this morning with \nindividuals from the highway department, to come down and go over the \ndata with us. They did so this morning. We asked for additional \ninformation. They are working on getting that information back to us. \nWe hope sometime this afternoon that information would be available to \nus. We will then be in a better position to evaluate just exactly where \nwe are.\n  I must say, maybe it is because I am dealing from a position of real \nextreme frustration, representing a State that we believe under the old \nproposal had about 77 cents back for what we had contributed in the \npast, in the last year. I remember the debates and the discussions that \nwe had 5 years ago, kind of saying, ``This is never going to happen to \nus again,'' that is being a donor State to the extent that we have \nbeen.\n  So we are concerned and we do not feel that we have enough data to \nmake a decision. We think it is unfair to say, let's just go ahead and \nmove this amendment at this time. We do not have, and have not had, the \ntime that you all have had over these last several months to be working \non this bill. We have this opportunity now to try to evaluate what the \namendment does. We are making a reasonable request. We are not trying \nto delay the bill. So, I ask the amendment be set aside until we have \nan opportunity to get this information and we can then discuss how we \nproceed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I say to the distinguished Senator from Florida, I would \nbe very reluctant to set this aside. It has been my experience in this \nplace, once you set it aside, if we had 10 problems now, we will have \n30 problems by tomorrow as everybody's staff gins up more problems in \nresponse to the legislation before us.\n  I don't know----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe one solution here--there is no perfect solution. \nMaybe one solution might be to vote on this amendment, and Senators who \nhave concerns about this amendment can state them, that is, they are \nvoting for it kind of on reservation or something like that, pending \ninformation that they get, and reserve the opportunity to offer \namendments at a later time. I say that because this amendment, I \nsuspect, is going to pass. Therefore, that will have passed and we will \nbe done with it. Then we can still address the concerns that the \nSenator from Florida may or may not have, and having passed this \namendment doesn't put him in a disadvantageous position.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think in our discussions you intended a voice vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. A voice vote would be more helpful to the Senators who do \nnot know.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the senior managers of the bill would be willing \nto accept that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. You guessed it right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then the bill is open for amendments throughout the \ncourse of further deliberations.\n  Mr. MACK. Again, I appreciate the response. I understand. Each of us \nhas had the opportunity to manage a bill. We know how we want to keep \nthat bill moving. The longer it lays out there, the more difficulties \nit attracts. So I understand the concerns of the managers.\n  Give us a few moments, those of us who are the donor States, an \nopportunity to take a look at this and see how we might proceed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the distinguished Senator from Florida is talking \nabout a few moments, he is stirring my heart.\n  Mr. MACK. We might have a several-hour debate on what the definition \nof ``moment'' is.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We all know what ``moment'' means. If you want several \nmoments, you go to it. As of now, I'm saying everybody come on over \nhere with their amendments, all individuals come with their amendments, \nand hopefully we would like to have a vote by a quarter of 3. But \nbecause of the urging of the Senator from Florida, a few moments will \nget us along for a while.\n  Please, all I would say to the Senator from Florida, a few moments \nreally doesn't mean a meeting at 6 o'clock tonight.\n  Mr. MACK. I understand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think what the Senator from Florida is saying--I \nconcur--is we would be able in a few moments to know whether the \nsuggestion of the Senator from Montana would be acceptable to us, and \nthat could literally be in a few moments, and then we could have a \nvoice vote promptly, and then, with the understanding set forth and the \nsuggestions set forth by the Senator from Montana, be able to consider \nthe data which we expect later on today at a later time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. You have a few moments. Come on back and see us in a few \nmoments. Let's all agree that a few moments isn't very long.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to, if I could, quantify a little bit what a \nfew moments means. Can the Senators tell us that a few moments means no \nmore than 15 minutes?\n  Mr. MACK. We might debate this issue for an hour or two----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At least let us know in 15 minutes whether you can \naccept.\n  Mr. MACK. It was indicated a little earlier that there would be maybe \n25 minutes. I think our definition of ``moment'' would fit within that \nrange.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We have used up about 10 minutes of it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. OK; 25. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I previously announced, we want to get \non with this legislation. It is my intention that at 3 o'clock, I will \nask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1684 be agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and the amendment be considered \nas original text for the purpose of further amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Wyden and Sessions be added as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is the intention to seek a voice vote; \nwe want to make that clear.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, it will be my intention, as I say, at 3 o'clock to \nproceed with a voice vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. In the interim, if Senators wish to talk on this subject \nor others, I will reserve the time at 3\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\no'clock to proceed with this unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to say to the Senator that this is acceptable to \nthis Senator as a way of proceeding, so we can preserve our rights \nafter we get the material we have been waiting for to determine whether \nor not we wish at that time to offer amendments relating to the subject \nwe discussed this morning. I thank my good friend from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We, obviously, hope the Senator will not have an \namendment, but should he have one, we shall be delighted to receive it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might, Senator Mack wishes to \nassociate himself with the remarks of the Senator from Michigan. He was \nvery active in the discussions on this, as was the Senator from \nMichigan. So we thank them as a group speaking on behalf of the donor \nStates. I have been one of the major spokesmen for donor States, and I \nam glad to have the assistance of my colleagues.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senators on the floor who are \nconcerned about protecting their rights, and I thank them for being so \naccommodating. We have worked out an arrangement where we can move \nforward with this bill and, yet, they can still protect their rights \nand offer amendments if they so choose. I thank them.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan \nwould like to have a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to have a colloquy, if my good \nfriend from Montana is able to do it at this time.\n  Is it the intent of this bill, assuming this amendment is adopted, to \nreturn to the States 91 percent of their share of contributions to the \ntrust fund or 91 cents of each gas tax dollar sent to the highway trust \nfund?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my friend, of the amounts apportioned to the \nStates, the goal is to give States 91 percent of their percent share of \ncontributions to the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So, it is not true, then, because of various \nadministrative, research and special funds set aside and not \ndistributed to all the States, that the total dollars returned to each \nState would be less than 91 percent of its contributions to the highway \ntrust fund highway account?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. However, let me make an important \npoint. In the underlying bill, 10 percent of the money is used for \nthings such as research, emergency relief for natural disasters and \nadministrative costs. That 10 percent is not counted in the calculation \nof the State's share. But this is not a new concept. These are national \nprograms. It is the approach that has been taken in the previous ISTEA \nprogram as well. It is not new. In the amendment, I say to the Senator, \nwe have given Michigan actually a better deal.\n  In this amendment, we calculate the dollars needed to give you a 91-\npercent share. This calculation, for the first time, includes other \nprograms. Included in the calculation under the amendment are the \nadditional amounts apportioned to the States, that is $18.9 billion, \nplus the $1.8 billion in the new density program and the $1.89 billion \nin the Appalachian highway program. The result is that 91 percent is \nnow calculated on a larger universe of funds than in the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend. Just to be clear, the 91-percent share \ndoes not assure a minimum 91 cents back on each dollar sent to the \ntrust fund; in terms of cents on the dollar guaranteed, a 91-percent \nshare is going to be less for each State, as it always has been, than \n91 cents on the dollar.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment No. 1684 be laid aside until 4:10, at which time it would \nthen come up under the prior arrangement that we had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma has an \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1687\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that the States have the necessary flexibility to \n     implement the new standards for ozone and particulate matter)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:.\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), for himself and Mr. \n     Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 1687.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n            TITLE  .--OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS\n\n\n                         Findings and Purposes\n\n       Section 1. (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) There is a lack of air quality monitoring data for fine \n     particle levels, measured as PM2.5, in the United \n     States and the States should receive full funding for the \n     monitoring efforts;\n       (2) Such data would provide a basis for designating areas \n     as attainment or nonattainment for any PM2.5 \n     national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the \n     standards promulgated in July 1997;\n       (3) The President of the United States directed the \n     Administrator in a memorandum dated July 16, 1997, to \n     complete the next periodic review of the particulate matter \n     national ambient air quality standards by July 2002 in order \n     to determine ``whether to revise or maintain the standards'';\n       (4) The Administrator has stated that three years of air \n     quality monitoring data for fine particle levels, measured as \n     PM2.5 and performed in accordance with any \n     applicable federal reference methods, is appropriate for \n     designating areas as attainment or nonattainment pursuant to \n     the July 1997 promulgated standards; and\n       (5) The Administrator has acknowledged that in drawing \n     boundaries for attainment and nonattainment areas for the \n     July 1997 ozone national air quality standards, Governors \n     would benefit from considering implementation guidance from \n     EPA on drawing area boundaries;\n       (b) The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) To ensure that three years of air quality monitoring \n     data regarding fine particle levels are gathered for use in \n     the determination of area attainment or nonattainment \n     designations respecting any PM2.5 national ambient \n     air quality standards;\n       (2) To ensure that the Governors have adequate time to \n     consider implementation guidance from EPA on drawing area \n     boundaries prior to submitting area designations respecting \n     the July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards;\n       (3) To ensure that implementation of the July 1997 \n     revisions of the ambient air quality standards are consistent \n     with the purposes of the President's Implementation \n     Memorandum dated July 16, 1997.\n\n\n                 particulate matter monitoring program\n\n       Sec. 2. (a) Through grants under section 103 of the Clean \n     Air Act the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency shall use appropriated funds no later than fiscal 2000 \n     to fund one hundred percent of the cost of the establishment, \n     purchase, operation and maintenance of a PM2.5 \n     monitoring network necessary to implement the national \n     ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 under \n     section 109 of the Clean Air Act. This implementation shall \n     not result in a diversion or reprogramming of funds from \n     other Federal, State or local Clean Air Act activities. Any \n     funds previously diverted or reprogrammed from section 105 \n     Clean Air Act grants for PM2.5 monitors must be \n     restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) EPA and the States shall ensure that the national \n     network (designated in section 2(a)) which consists of the \n     PM2.5 monitors necessary to implement the national \n     ambient air quality standards is established by December 31, \n     1999.\n       (c) The Governors shall be required to submit designations \n     for each area following promulgation of the July 1997 \n     PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard within \n     one year after receipt of three years of air quality \n     monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable \n     federal reference methods for the relevant areas. Only data \n     from the monitoring network designated in section 2(a) and \n     other federal reference method PM2.5 monitors \n     shall be considered for such designations. In reviewing the \n     State Implementation Plans the Administrator shall\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\n     consider all relevant monitoring data regarding transport of \n     PM2.5.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate designations of \n     nonattainment areas no later than one year after the initial \n     designations required under paragraph 2(c) are required to be \n     submitted. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the \n     Administrator shall promulgate such designations not later \n     than Dec. 31, 2005.\n       (e) The Administrator shall conduct a field study of the \n     ability of the PM2.5 Federal Reference Method to \n     differentiate those particles that are larger than 2.5 \n     micrograms in diameter. This study shall be completed and \n     provided to Congress no later than two years from the date of \n     enactment of this legislation.\n\n\n                     Ozone Designation Requirements\n\n       Sec. 3. (a) the Governors shall be required to submit \n     designations of nonattainment areas within two years \n     following the promulgation of the July 1997 ozone national \n     ambient air quality standards.\n       (b) The Administrator shall promulgate final designations \n     no later than one year after the designations required under \n     paragraph 3(a) are required to be submitted.\n\n\n                         additional provisions\n\n       Sec. 4. Nothing in sections 1-3 above shall be construed by \n     the Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency or any \n     court, State, or person to affect any pending litigation or \n     to be a ratification of the ozone or PM2.5 \n     standards.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have had an amendment and actually \nhave had a bill to address a problem that many of us are concerned with \nhaving to do with a change that was proposed by the Administrator of \nthe EPA in November 2 years ago. This made dramatic changes in the \nstandards for particulate matter and for ozone.\n  We held extensive hearings. As chairman of the Clean Air \nSubcommittee, we had seven hearings on this bill. It has become very \ncontroversial. The Administrator of the EPA has set the standards. \nAfter having gone through the process of the hearings and the process \nof the comment periods, it is now set. However, in the memorandum of \nimplementation by the President, we have a time guideline for the \nimplementation of these standards. Let me repeat that. The standards \nare set in both particulate matter and in ozone but not yet \nimplemented. The implementation period provides for certain periods of \ntime for establishing a PM monitoring network for collecting data for \nGovernors to recommend areas of designation for the EPA to designate \nnew nonattainment areas, and then for the States to submit State \nimplementation plans. That would be true on both ozone and particulate \nmatter.\n  What we are attempting to do with this bill is to take these \nguidelines to make sure that they are in order and that everyone has \nample time to carry out what has to be done in order to implement these \nstandards. That would require a period of time.\n  So what I have done with this amendment is take the memorandum of \nimplementation from President Clinton and put that down into periods of \ntime as he recommends, and we are adding that as an amendment. \nObviously, this is germane to this bill because if we are to find \nourselves out of attainment, it would dramatically affect the ability \nof the States to be able to have their transportation funds.\n  So with the following three exceptions, this amendment only puts into \nthe bill the time guidelines that we have all agreed to. It has been \nsigned off on by the minority and the majority and the EPA.\n  The first one is an area that does not affect time lines. It has to \ndo with fully funding. This is a conscientious concern. However, the \nStates have talked to us through the Governors associations, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the counties, and the rest of them saying that \nwhat they don't want to have is an unfunded mandate whereby they would \nhave all of these obligations to monitor the PM and go through all of \nthis and not have it funded. This portion of the amendment, section \n(2)(a), requires that the EPA absorb all of these costs.\n  The next area is one that meets a problem that mostly concerns the \nagricultural community throughout America; that is, their concern with \nhow they will be treated. Section 2(e) says that this study would take \nplace that would address the concerns of farmers who believe that they \nwill be targeted for PM 2.5. And we talked about PM 2.5. We are talking \nabout 2.5 micrograms as opposed to the current 10 and emissions larger \nthan 2.5.\n  This is their concern. Everyone has agreed that this is a legitimate \nconcern that the farmers of America have, and we are accommodating \nthem.\n  The last section that does not affect just the timeline is section 4 \nwhere it says:\n\n       Nothing in section 1-3 above shall be construed by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or any \n     court, State, or person to affect any pending legislation.\n\n  There is some pending legislation.\n  I would like to add that I had a conversation with Administrator \nBrowner, and we have had many nice conversations. While we have \noccasionally disagreed philosophically on some things, I did agree with \nher that if this amendment passes and survives the conference, passes \nand then is signed into law, I have no intention of bringing up any \nother legislation or amendments affecting the national ambient air \nquality standards; that is, barring anything totally unforeseen. I \ncan't imagine what that would be.\n  Mr. President, my amendment today addresses the EPA's revised \nParticulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. As \nyou know, I have been a vocal critic of the EPA's revised Particulate \nMatter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. My \nsubcommittee has held extensive hearings on both standards, and I am \nconvinced, based on the record developed in those hearings, that those \nstandards are not needed to protect the health of our citizens, or our \nenvironment, and that the implementation of these standards will impose \nhuge costs on the country, that are completely unjustified. For these \nreasons, I have sponsored legislation that would require EPA to \nreconsider these standards, before they are implemented.\n  I rise today to pursue a narrower objective. The administration has \nannounced an implementation plan for both standards. However, a number \nof concerns have been raised about EPA's ability to implement this plan \nunder the Clean Air Act. One key concern has been whether EPA can hold \noff on designation areas as not meeting the new standards--i.e., as \nnonattainment areas.\n  With regard to PM 2.5 (the new Particulate Matter standard), three \nyears of federal reference method monitoring data are necessary to \ndesignate areas, and a monitoring network--funded by EPA, not the \nstates--needs to be put in place to generate these data.\n  With regard to the ozone standard, EPA needs to develop guidance on \nnonattainment boundaries, before the designation process can even \nbegin. EPA says that this guidance will be available in 1999, but, the \nstates still must submit their recommended designations to EPA this \nJuly unless something is done.\n  The amendment I have offered is designed to address these concerns by \ngiving the Agency clear authority to proceed with the schedule \nannounced by the President last July. I am offering it because I \nbelieve it would be unacceptable for the Congress to allow a situation \nto develop where uncertainty about EPA's legal authority could result \nin confusion and chaos.\n  I caution, however, that this legislation does not affirm the \nstandards. Whether those standards are lawful, appropriate, and \nnecessary is still an open question that is being considered by the \nCourts. We can't realistically expect this question to be answered in a \nyear or more. This legislation is designed to assure that the agency \nhas clear authority to proceed with its implementation schedule, while \nthe very important questions about the legitimacy of these standards \nare still debated.\n  This legislation addresses only the timing of attainment designation \nunder the President's implementation plan for these standards. EPA \nrecently proposed to order the states to develop plans, that, among \nother things, would require reductions in inter-state emissions that \nmight be contributing to exceedances of the 8-hour ozone standard. A \nnumber of legal and factual objections to this proposal have been \nraised by states, industry, and others. Since this is only a proposal, \nI have not addressed in this legislation EPA's authority under the Act \nto require any reductions before state plans are developed after areas \nhave been designated.\n  I thank very much Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, and Administrator\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nBrowner, as well as some of the staff: Chris Hessler, Jimmie Powell, \nwith whom I worked closely, Barbara Roberts, and Tom Sliter. They have \nbeen very cooperative and very helpful in bringing this to the point \nwhere we are today.\n  At this point I yield for questions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nhas been offered by my colleague who is the chairman of the Clean Air \nSubcommittee of the Environment Committee. He has identified some \nimportant concerns about the implementation of the recently revised so-\ncalled National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\n  This is a very complicated area. The Senator from Oklahoma has \ninvested a good deal of time and energy studying this and educating our \ncommittee about it. His subcommittee, as he mentioned, held seven \nhearings on the subject here in Washington and another in Oklahoma. He \nand his staff led the sometimes difficult negotiations on this \namendment to, as he noted, a successful conclusion.\n  I want to applaud the Senator from Oklahoma for his efforts both on \nthis amendment and on the larger issue of the NAAQs rule. He has \ninvested a great deal of energy and time in studying this complicated \nmatter and educating the Environment and Public Works Committee about \nit. His subcommittee held seven hearings on the issue here in \nWashington, and another in Oklahoma. He and his staff led the sometimes \ndifficult negotiations on this amendment to a successful conclusion. \nHis efforts and patience have served us all well because the amendment \nbefore us will improve the implementation of the NAAQs.\n  This amendment seeks to ensure that commitments made last year about \nhow the standards would be implemented are upheld. The Environmental \nProtection Agency said it would cover 100 percent of the costs \nassociated with installing and operating the new monitors needed to \nmeasure fine particulate matter. Having made the promise, the federal \ngovernment must ensure that it is kept. This amendment would do that.\n  The amendment would also require three years of data collection \nbefore planning starts for additional pollution controls. The EPA has \ndecided that it needs three years of data to ensure that chronic \nsources of particulate matter are accurately identified. Complete data \nwill enable states to develop appropriate control strategies. Reducing \nPM 2.5 is important to the public health but we must be sure that new \ncontrols are used where they are needed. Without sufficient monitoring \ndata, we will not be certain the right sources are targeted for \ncontrols, and we may not achieve the improved air quality or the health \nbenefits that we are seeking.\n  Along the same lines, we need to be sure we can chemically \ndistinguish one type of particulate from another. That is the only way \nState air officials will know if they need to reduce pollution from \nwood stoves or power plants. This amendment requires a field study of \nthe monitors to ensure that they are serving this purpose effectively.\n  The EPA promised the States that they would have both the resources \nand the information necessary to implement the NAAQs rule. Through this \namendment, the Senator from Oklahoma is attempting to enforce those \ncommitments.\n  All of the goals of this amendment are worthy and reasonable and I \nurge everyone to support it.\n  Essentially what the amendment does is the following: There have to \nbe monitors set up to measure particulate matter and ozone levels and \nother matter. The question is, Who is going to pay for these monitors? \nIs it going to be the Federal Government? The Administrator indicated \nit would be the Federal Government, but there seems to be some backing \noff from that.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma says that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would cover 100 percent of the costs of \ninstallation. You have to install these things and operate them. You \nhave to go out and check these new monitors to measure the fine \nparticulate matter.\n  That is the first thing the Senator has accomplished in this \namendment. That is a very welcome provision because the State budgets \nare having trouble keeping up with the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  The other part of his amendment would codify the requirement under \nthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards. That calls for 3 years of \ndata collection before there can be a designation of nonattainment for \nthis particular part of so-called particulate matter. So, the EPA has \ndecided that 3 years of data are necessary to ensure that chronic \nsources of particulate matter are accurately identified. As I \nunderstand the amendment of the Senator, it requires 3 years. Am I \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So, this is a difficult area. The assurance that the \nSenator from Oklahoma has put in, dealing with both the period and also \nwho is going to pay for these monitors, is a good one. We are glad to \naccept it on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a happy day, because it was not \ntoo long ago here that, after the EPA announced new standards for ozone \nand small particulates, there was going to be a huge uproar in the \nSenate and there would be a big battle over whether or not the EPA \nshould be allowed to go ahead with these new standards.\n  Frankly, however, as Senators have looked at this issue--and I take \nmy hat off to the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, who has come \nup with this amendment--the effect of this amendment is not to delay \nthose standards and not to in any way impede those standards, but \nrather set up a procedure which helps, frankly, assure the process will \ncontinue on a fair basis; namely, that the monitoring costs--and they \nwill be quite extensive; that is monitoring the air in various parts of \nthe country, particularly nonattainment areas--will be paid for by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. That is not by States. The States will \nbe fully reimbursed for their monitoring costs. So that helps establish \na solid program because we know where the money is going to come from \nand it will be fully paid for.\n  A second major change here, at least a clarification, is that States \nwill not be faced with new nonattainment designations under the Clean \nAir Act for PM 2.5--that is the small particulates--without 3 years of \nmonitoring data. That at least makes sense, that we have 3 years of \nmonitoring data. In fact, the EPA-proposed standard was based on a 3-\nyear average anyway. So as a practical matter, this is a measure which \nwill help assure that the standards will be addressed fairly, \ncomprehensively, and also in a timely manner. So this version of this \namendment, unlike earlier versions that had been filed, does not delay \nimplementation of the new air quality standards.\n  This version also has no language in it which revokes the standards. \nThere was some concern that these standards might be revoked. That is \nnot in here. Also, there is no provision that proposes a moratorium on \nEPA.\n  In short, the new standards will go forward as envisioned. I might \nsay to Senators, this is a long, involved process. It could take 10, 12 \nyears before some of these standards actually ever go into effect, if \nthey ever do. If they do go into effect, they are at the behest of and \ndesignation of States. That is, States, under what is called State \nimplementation plans, would designate what actions various entities, \nwhether they are powerplants or automobiles or what not, would have to \ndo in order to qualify. And that would take a long time.\n  So I finish where I began. This is a happy day. This is a resolution. \nIt is a compromise. And I think it is going to help people be more \nassured, on a more solid, fair basis, that our air will be cleaner in \nthose parts of the country where it needs to be cleaned up. I think it \nis a good amendment, and I thank the Senator very much for his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to extend the thanks of all of us to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, because he was willing to \ncompromise. He talked with the Administrator of EPA, Ms. Browner, \nseveral times. I did, too. He was willing to give. He did not demand it \nonly be his way. It was a successful compromise. I congratulate the \nSenator.\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I further ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Jeff Sessions be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to briefly \ninquire with my colleague how his amendment will affect areas of my \nstate.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment will not in any way \ninterfere with or delay efforts currently underway by EPA and various \nstates to address the issue of pollution transported across state \nlines. Is that correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that is correct. The amendment is simply designed to \nprovide greater certainty for states, small businesses and consumers \nregarding control strategies for the new ozone and particulate matter \nstandards.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment codifies a time line for \nthe Administrator to promulgate final designations under the new ozone \nand PM standards. Is it the Senator's intention that areas in violation \nbecause they are heavily impacted by dirty air from other states should \nbe ``held harmless'' in the interim period or not be penalized with \nmore air-pollution controls by being ``bumped up'' to a higher \nnonattainment status?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is my intention. Should this not be the case, we \nwould have to revisit this issue legislatively.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  The Senator's amendment will ensure that federal funding is available \nto construct and operate a nationwide monitoring system for fine \nparticles, and it will allow future designation decisions to be based \non three complete years of monitoring data. The amendment would also \nprovide Governors with two years to consider regional transport issues \nprior to submitting new ozone redesignations.\n  This amendment will not, as some opponents may contend, roll back or \ndelay the new standards. On the contrary, the amendment does not change \nthe new standards and adheres to the President's own time table for \nachieving them. In fact, this amendment may actually strengthen the new \nstandards by establishing a legally certain schedule for putting them \ninto place. Moreover, this amendment is critically important because it \nwill make sure that future Clean Air Act designations will be based on \nactual air quality data rather than guesswork and extrapolation. In \nview of the anticipated costs associated with meeting the new \nstandards, we must take this very simple step.\n  Last summer, when the President announced new air quality standards \nfor soot and smog, he also promised that the Federal Government would \nwork closely with states and local communities to implement these \nstandards in a fair, flexible and cost-effective manner. For many \ncommunities in Pennsylvania, the imposition of new standards has been a \nvery bitter pill to swallow, but the promised implementation plan has \noffered a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. While the \nPresident's pledge has been appreciated, it is my view that this \namendment is necessary in order to give states and communities \nreassurance that the promised implementation plan will be followed. \nThank you, and I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment, and I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, \nfor his efforts in this regard. These new rules, which modify the \nambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, would \nseverely impact West Virginia. Up to ten counties in my home state \nmight be thrown into nonattainment under these rules, and a large \nnumber of industries might be adversely affected, including chemicals, \nconstruction, steel production, glass manufacturing, coal-fired utility \npower plants, pulp and paper mills, and commercial trucking.\n  On a national level, the impact of these rules is even greater, with \nearly estimates from the President's Council of Economic Advisors that \nthese rules might cost $60 billion annually. Many major urban areas \nhave not yet complied with the current ozone standard, and are not even \nclose to being able to do so. These urban areas have not even completed \ntheir plans on how they will comply with the current standard. Basic \nlogic would dictate that these states should first finish these plans, \nand enforce the current standard, before moving on to even more \nambitious proposals. Instead, these states must constantly revise their \nair plans, even while never completing those plans. As I stated in an \nearlier letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), these \nstates are trapped in the clean air version of the perpetual motion \nregulatory machine, where replanning becomes as important as actual \nimplementation and enforcement.\n  In the area of particulates, there is almost no national monitoring \ndata, and there is weak scientific and technical support for the rule. \nThe EPA and the environmental community refer to a small number of \nstudies that support the rule, but there is room for serious debate \nabout whether a clear connection between PM 2.5 and health-related \nproblems has been established.\n  The amendment before us is actually quite modest in its goals, and \nunfortunately does not address many of these broader problems with this \nair rule. The amendment codifies promises made by the Administration \nwith regard to the time schedule to implement the new rules, and also \ncodifies provisions for funding a nationwide network of monitoring \nstations for particulate matter. The Administration's proposed time \nschedule is not legally binding, and this amendment will ensure that \nthe EPA cannot later alter the terms of the implementation package that \nit has offered to state governments.\n  Despite these modest goals, this amendment holds the EPA's feet to \nthe fire, and will ensure that promises made to the states will be \nhonored. I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment offered by Senator \nInhofe, and ensure that promises made to West Virginia are promises \nkept by the EPA.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might beg the indulgence of the chairman of the \ncommittee, I understand the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, \nmight want to speak on this amendment. She is looking at it at the \nmoment. I suggest if procedurally we can do that, we ask consent this \nbe temporarily laid aside so Senator Reid can speak. He may have an \namendment here, too. I do not expect a problem, but I, in good faith, \nmust tell the Senator I am informed Senator Boxer would like to have \nthe opportunity to perhaps speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is her privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Would it be a good idea to go \nahead, rather than set it aside, and recognize the Senator from Nevada? \nIt may be ready at that time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That's probably a better alternative, that we keep \ntalking on the amendment and Senator Reid can keep talking, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the two managers of the bill, I do have an \namendment. I understand it has been reviewed thoroughly over the last \nseveral days by the staff and it is acceptable. If there is adequate \ntime, I would be happy to speak on the bill also now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might suggest you speak on the bill and/or your \namendment. Once this amendment is disposed of, then we can vote on your \namendment. Either way.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment. I will send it to the \ndesk. Is there an amendment pending that needs to be set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an amendment pending.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask consent the Senator speak on his amendment. The \nSenator from Oklahoma--speak on your own amendment. We will dispose of \nthe Inhofe amendment, and then----\n  Mr. REID. If we set aside the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma \nmy statement on my amendment will only take a minute.\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator from Nevada yield? Is it the Senator's \nintention to have an amendment on my amendment or speak on my \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. I want to speak on my amendment. Your amendment is \nacceptable. I have nothing to say about your very fine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1688 To Amendment No. 1676\n\n (Purpose: To provide support for Federal, State, and local efforts to \n carry out transportation planning for the Tahoe National Forest, the \n Toiyabe National Forest, the Eldorado National Forest, and the areas \n  owned by States and local governments that surround Lake Tahoe and \n           protect the environment and serve transportation)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. Bryan, \n     Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1688 to amendment No. 1676.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 253, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Lake tahoe region.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall--\n       ``(i) establish with the Federal land management agencies \n     that have jurisdiction over land in the Lake Tahoe region (as \n     defined in the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Compact) a \n     transportation planning process for the region; and\n       ``(ii) coordinate the transportation planning process with \n     the planning process required of State and local governments \n     under this section, section 135, and chapter 53 of title 49.\n       ``(B) Interstate compact.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), notwithstanding \n     subsection (b), to carry out the transportation planning \n     process required by this section, the consent of Congress is \n     granted to the States of California and Nevada to designate a \n     metropolitan planning organization for the Lake Tahoe region, \n     by agreement between the Governors of the States of \n     California and Nevada and units of general purpose local \n     government that together represent at least 75 percent of the \n     affected population (including the central city or cities (as \n     defined by the Bureau of the Census)), or in accordance with \n     procedures established by applicable State or local law.\n       ``(ii) Involvement of federal land management agencies.--\n\n       ``(I) Representation.--The policy board of a metropolitan \n     planning organization designated under subparagraph (A) shall \n     include a representative of each Federal land management \n     agency that has jurisdiction over land in the Lake Tahoe \n     region.\n       ``(II) Funding.--In addition to funds made available to the \n     metropolitan planning organization under other provisions of \n     this title and under chapter 53 of title 49, not more than 1 \n     percent of the funds allocated under section 202 may be used \n     to carry out the transportation planning process for the Lake \n     Tahoe region under this subparagraph.\n\n       ``(C) Activities.--\n       ``(i) Highway projects.--Highway projects included in \n     transportation plans developed under this paragraph--\n\n       ``(I) shall be selected for funding in a manner that \n     facilitates the participation of the Federal land management \n     agencies that have jurisdiction over land in the Lake Tahoe \n     region; and\n       ``(II) may, in accordance with chapter 2, be funded using \n     funds allocated under section 202.\n\n       ``(ii) Transit projects.--Transit projects included in \n     transportation plans developed under this paragraph may, in \n     accordance with chapter 53 of title 49, be funded using \n     amounts apportioned under that title for--\n\n       ``(I) capital project funding, in order to accelerate \n     completion of the transit projects; and\n       ``(II) operating assistance, in order to pay the operating \n     costs of the transit projects, including operating costs \n     associated with unique circumstances in the Lake Tahoe \n     region, such as seasonal fluctuations in passenger loadings, \n     adverse weather conditions, and increasing intermodal needs.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on my behalf and \nthat of Senators Bryan, Boxer and Feinstein. It has the support of the \nState governments of both California and Nevada, and it is an amendment \nthat is very simple. It grants Metropolitan Planning Organization \nstatus for the Lake Tahoe basin on the border between California and \nNevada.\n  Not only is Lake Tahoe the most beautiful place on the Earth, and it \nhas been deemed to be such since the time Mark Twain first looked at it \nand said it was the ``fairest place on all the Earth,'' locals within \nthe basin, the Washoe Indian Tribe, and the State governments of Nevada \nand California, have long recognized the unique status of Lake Tahoe. \nBut, in addition to its beauty, it is certainly one of the most fragile \nenvironments anyplace in the world. For many years the competing \ninterests in the basin have found ways to work together to protect the \nfamed water quality of the lake. These partnerships have been developed \nand are unique and have proved the notion that it is not necessary to \nharm the economy to improve the environment.\n  Mr. President, last summer President Clinton convened a Summit. He \nand Vice President Gore and five Cabinet officers came to Lake Tahoe \nand spent 2 days. They addressed the related transportation, forest \nhealth and water quality concerns that face the Basin. Transportation \nwas identified as one of the key areas where improvements in \ninfrastructure could also yield key environmental benefits. MPO status \nrecognizes the unique bi-State nature of the Tahoe basin and enhances \nthe ability of local residents to compete for transportation planning \nfunding.\n  I appreciate very much the consideration of both sides and would ask \nthat this amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this amendment is satisfactory to this \nside. It is my understanding--I have talked with the distinguished \nranking member--the amendment is acceptable to the minority side \nlikewise.\n  We are prepared to accept it, and I congratulate the Senator from \nNevada for his amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1688) to amendment No. 1676 was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the permission of the manager of the \nbill--if the manager of the bill would rather I speak at a later time, \nI will be happy to do that. I just wanted to speak on the bill if there \nis nothing going on in here on the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, we are waiting for the Senator from California.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as she shows----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We want to be sure she is going to show. The Senator from \nOklahoma has been very patient.\n  Mr. REID. Whenever you learn she is not going to come or she does \ncome, I will be happy, with a wave of the hand, to sit down.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Why don't we say you go ahead for 10 minutes and let's \nsee what happens, with the understanding you will yield if she comes \nover so she can say her piece.\n  Mr. REID. Or if for any other reason the manager of the bill wants to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor and very \nstrong supporter of S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act. Both S. 1173 and the amendment adding an additional $26 \nbillion to the bill passed unanimously out of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, a committee I have served on very proudly \nfor my years in the U.S. Senate.\n  I want to also say, and spread across the Record of this Senate, what \na tremendously fine job has been done by the chairman of this committee \nand the ranking member of this committee to allow this bill to be where \nit is today. It has been very hard work. Frankly, it would have been \nnice if we had done it last year, but we didn't. The reason we are \nwhere we are today is because of the work of the chairman of the full \ncommittee and the work of the ranking member of the committee. The \nStates of Rhode Island and Montana have many reasons to be proud of the \ntwo Senators who are managing this bill, but for no reason should they \nbe more proud of their Senators than the work they have done on this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\n Their committee work has been outstanding and is certainly something \nthat everybody in this country, not only the people from the States of \nRhode Island and Montana, should feel very good about, what is \nhappening on this floor.\n  Every person who is a Member of the U.S. Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives has a stake in a national transportation system that is \nsecond to none, one that meets the present and future needs of the \nAmerican people. This bill is not perfect, but it is a tremendously \nstrong bill. Moving people and goods quickly and efficiently throughout \nthe Nation is one of the most important things we can do to maintain a \nstrong economy. Far too much time and productivity is lost waiting in \ntraffic.\n  I give an example to all. People in southern California are connected \nwith the people of southern Nevada by I-15. I-15 is a tremendously \nburdened road. The chairman of the committee came to Nevada and heard \ntestimony regarding the importance of this legislation. He heard \nfirsthand about the tremendous difficulty we have moving people to and \nfrom southern Nevada and southern California.\n  Mr. President, it is no longer a question of having people come to \nLas Vegas for purposes of tourism. The problem is that the road is \nclogging interstate commerce. Vehicles, trucks moving produce, cannot \nmove on this road. It is too crowded. This is only an example of what \nis happening in other parts of the country, although the problem of I-\n15 is magnified because of how old it is and how much repair needs to \nbe done on it.\n  The original ISTEA legislation in 1991 was really the brain child of \nthe committee chair at that time, Senator Pat Moynihan from the State \nof New York. He did very good work. He was visionary in this bill. It \nchanged the thrust of legislation dealing with surface transportation \nthat had been in effect since the Second World War. The legislation in \n1991 was one of the most far-reaching and innovative pieces of \nlegislation ever produced by Congress. It laid out a road map for \ntransportation for the entire 21st century.\n  Rather than focusing upon the completion of the Interstate System, \nISTEA focused on connecting different modes of transportation to meet \nthe needs of the future. I enjoyed very much working on that \nlegislation as a Member of this committee, and I think it is some of \nthe most rewarding work that I have done since I have been a Member of \nCongress.\n  With the exception of the Department of Defense authorization bill, \nISTEA is going to be the largest money bill that Congress will take up \nthis year. I also say, although I do not see him on the floor of the \nSenate today, the subcommittee chair of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Senator John Warner, is a fine Senator.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with him when I was chairman of a \nsubcommittee and he was ranking member. Coincidentally, I was talking \nwith someone this morning who is a friend of Senator Warner. We talked \nwith some affection about the work that the Senator from Virginia does \ngenerally, but especially in this committee and this subcommittee. I \ncommend and applaud the work of Senator Warner in this legislation.\n  We have to recognize, with the exception of the defense authorization \nbill this year, ISTEA II is going to be the largest money bill Congress \nwill take up this year. As such, we have a tremendous responsibility to \nget it right. Our economy is utterly dependent upon having a strong and \nvital system of transportation. The creation of this intermodal system \nwill require all the innovative and creative thinking we can muster at \nthe Federal, State, regional and, yes, local levels. The State of \nNevada has a tremendous need for adequate highways, I say second to \nnone.\n  The State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union, \nexcept for the State of Alaska. We have 314 mountain ranges. We have 32 \nmountains that are over 11,000 feet high. We have tremendous growth in \nthe State of Nevada. Just to give you one illustration, in Clark \nCounty, where Las Vegas is located, we need to build more than one \nelementary school each month to keep up with the growth of students in \nthat area. So we have real problems.\n  Also, we have a State that is extremely large. Within its borders, \nyou could place the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, \nRhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware, and then still have \nsome left over. None of these States would touch one another, and there \nwould still be, as I have indicated, plenty of room to cut up Virginia \nand use it to fill in the gaps joining all these States.\n  We have the additional problem that 87 percent of the State of Nevada \nis owned by the Federal Government. We lead the Nation in Federal \nownership of land.\n  Nevada is also a bridge State. Hundreds of thousands of tons of goods \ntravel across Nevada through Utah, Arizona, and to and from California. \nThe CANAMEX route, one of the NAFTA corridors, traverses Nevada, \ncrossing over the top of the Hoover Dam bridge. When I say the Hoover \nDam bridge, that is really a misnomer. You cross right over Hoover Dam. \nOne of the greatest bottlenecks in the country is over Hoover Dam. \nTraffic is lined up sometimes 5 to 10 miles trying to get over that \ndam, and to think of the safety involved in not having adequate \ntransportation moving over that dam--it is unsafe. If there were an \naccident of some kind, it would really do extreme damage to the water \nsupplies of southern California and the small areas below Hoover Dam. \nWe have to do something about that also.\n  In southern Nevada, thousands and thousands of new people move in \neach month. In fact, almost 300 people a day move into Las Vegas alone. \nSo we have rapid growth. In 1970, there were fewer than 500,000 \nresidents in the whole State of Nevada. By the year 2000, there will be \n2 million. That is the growth that is taking place in Nevada.\n  In 1970, there were 2.2 billion vehicle miles traveled in Nevada. By \nthe year 2000, there will be over 12.5 billion vehicle miles traveled \nin Nevada. Accommodation of such growth requires innovative thinking \nand creative planning on the part of the State and local transportation \npeople.\n  Again, talking about the State of Nevada and all that growth, I have \nindicated that it takes a lot of innovative thinking on the part of the \nState to make sure that this all works out well. It also necessitates \nimposing one of the stiffest State and local taxes in the Nation. We \nhave done that. We have done it willingly, because we recognize that if \nwe are going to meet the demands of the traffic problems in Nevada, we \ncannot depend only on the Federal Government. We have done our share \nand more.\n  In spite of that, Nevada needs a strong, effective Federal level of \neffort, and that is what this bill does. As written, ISTEA II provides \na total of $173 billion for highways, highway safety, and other surface \ntransportation programs over the next 5 1/2 years.\n  I hope that as soon as this bill passes out of this Chamber, the \nHouse of Representatives will take it up and get a bill back to us, so \nwe can go to conference and get this very important bill worked out so \nthat the departments of transportation in the 50 States know what is \nahead of them. They can do their bidding, they can let their contracts \nprior to the bad weather happening, and go ahead and have a smooth \ntransition. We badly need to do that.\n  Overall, this bill represents a 40-percent increase in funding over \nthe original ISTEA bill some 6 years ago. With the completion of the \nInterstate Highway System, it is vital we turn our attention to \ndeveloping multimodal transportation policies that will allow us to not \nonly maintain the excellent infrastructure we have, but also to move \nforward to meet the demands of a new century.\n  In many ways, transportation issues of the future will be vastly more \ndifficult than the ones of yesterday. We live in an increasingly \ndiverse Nation, one that is no longer able to be solely dependent upon \nthe automobile. Even in a State as vast as Nevada, a bridge State, \nwhere we desperately need more roads, we are also seriously looking at \nthe role monorails, magnetic levitation, and other high-speed rail \nsystems can play in our future transportation infrastructure.\n  I think one of the finest parts of this bill is something that \nSenator Moynihan and I have worked on, and that is the part of the bill \nthat deals with magnetic levitation. Yesterday, Senator Moynihan \nbrought a box that contained a model of a maglev train to the\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\ncommittee. In his statement, he made a plea for funding to design and \nimplement a magnetic levitation system. We need to do that.\n  Mr. President, our airports are clogged all over the country; our \nhighways are clogged all over the country. We need a way of moving \npeople for relatively short distances, up to 300 miles. The only way we \ncan do that rapidly and efficiently with the technology we now have is \nwith magnetic levitation.\n  In the 1960s, two scientists were stuck in traffic in New York. They \nwere MIT professors. They said, ``This is ridiculous that we are stuck \nin traffic; let's do something about it.'' They went back to the \nlaboratories and invented magnetic levitation.\n  We, as a country, helped at the Federal level. We provided moneys for \nresearch and development of this very unique mode of transportation. We \ndid it for a few years and dropped it. As soon as we dropped it, \nGermany and Japan picked it up, and they are now way ahead of us with \nthis. It is too bad. We are the ones who should be in the forefront of \ndeveloping this mode of transportation. We need to get on board.\n  This bill contains an authorization of $1 billion for magnetic \nlevitation, and it actually provides funds, up to $30 million, for some \ngrants that will get this program going. This is very, very important, \nand I express my appreciation to Senator Moynihan for his good work in \nthis area.\n  The money that is in the bill is a modest amount to move this project \nforward, but it is an amount; it is more than we have ever done. There \nis tremendous funding in the bill for all our individual States and \nother areas, and I am happy we do have some for magnetic levitation. As \nI indicated before, this bill is not perfect. But I am proud of the \nprogress we have made. The bill is good for all States. It is \ntremendously important. It is a great product for the country.\n\n  The bill before us does a fine job of balancing many of our Nation's \ncompeting priorities for transportation while giving the States the \nflexibility they need to expend dollars in ways that make sense, given \nthe many regional differences we have in our country. I am supportive \nof the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program and \nthe transportation enhancement program. The additional money and \nincreased flexibility are very positive developments. A national \ntransportation system that does not address environmental issues is one \nthat would not be living up to the expectations of the American people.\n  Other important programs, such as the intelligent transportation \nsystem program, have both a positive impact on the environment and also \nimprove the efficiency of the highways. It is a dual track. I held, as \nI indicated earlier, a field hearing in Las Vegas last year focused on \nintelligent transportation systems, and the response was tremendous. \nLocal governments around Las Vegas and Reno have all begun to put \ninnovative high-tech transportation programs into place, and they are \nvery pleased with the initial results.\n  I am also supportive of a strong Federal Lands Highway Program. As a \nSenator from a Western State--and remember, I said earlier 87 percent \nof the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government--so as a \nSenator from a Western State with a huge amount of public land, it is \nimpossible to overstate how important is the vital lifeline that these \nroad and highway funds provide to rural Americans.\n  I want to say a few words on safety. I support the efforts of my \nfriend, Senator McCain from Arizona, to develop a safety title for \ninclusion in the overall authorization. I have a strong record on \nsafety, and in this legislation, I am very happy to support this title.\n  I want to spend a couple minutes discussing a safety issue that we \nare not addressing in nearly enough detail in this reauthorization. As \nthe chairman and ranking member know, I have opposed triple-trailer \ntrucks. I believe they are both intimidating and unsafe. I have, since \noffering my amendment on this issue--talking about moving forward on \nthis--I have received scores and scores of letters from all over the \ncountry from people who are afraid of these trucks. I believe they are \nincompatible with our obligation to provide a safe network of roads and \nhighways.\n  I do appreciate the input that I have received from the trucking \nindustry. But my fear of these triple-trailer trucks is not something \nthat I bear alone. I recognize that for a variety of reasons, though, \nthis is not a majority view. I have been in the Congress long enough, I \nhave served in legislative bodies long enough, to know when I have \nenough votes. I do not have enough votes to have my amendment \nadopted. I am not going to go forward with my amendment because, I \nrepeat, I do not have the votes to pass it.\n\n  Many of my colleagues argue there is just not enough accurate data \navailable to make an educated decision on this issue. Although I would \ncounter that mere common sense should dictate that triple-trailer \ntrucks do not belong on the same roads as a passenger car, I agree that \nthere is an appalling lack of data available on this subject. \nInformation given out by the trucking industry is unreliable and people \ncannot underscore the validity of it because it is put out by the \ntrucking industry. What we need is the Department of Transportation to \ndo some work on this and get some real facts to determine the accident \nrate and what these big trucks do to our roads and make a decision as \nto: Is the length of the truck an important element or is it how much \nthese trucks weigh? We have to get more information on this. There is a \nlack of data available on this subject.\n  Mr. President, in an attempt to remedy this deficiency, I have been \nworking with many, including the American Trucking Association, for \nmonths to try to forge an agreement that would allow us to better study \nthe safety, environmental, and infrastructure impacts of all classes of \nlonger-combination vehicles. I have been doing this since last fall \nwhen we first introduced this legislation.\n  Obviously, the American Trucking Association disagrees with me that \ntriples and others of these long vehicles are unsafe, but they \nacknowledge that there is a public perception problem, and they have \nbeen willing to work with me, which I appreciate. Unfortunately, \nthough, I found that there is little common ground between the safety \ncommunity and the American Trucking Association on what are the \nacceptable bounds for a comprehensive study of size, weight, and other \ntrucking issues. No matter what model we came up with, various parties \ncertainly would not agree with what we should do. As a result, I am \nunable to come up with a compromise on this subject right now. I would \nask the Secretary of Transportation to take a look at this issue. It is \na very important issue in the 16 States where we have these triple-\ntrailer trucks.\n  It is extremely frustrating to me and is a situation we, as a body, \nshould not allow to continue. There is an overwhelming lack of useful \ndata available to the U.S. Senate concerning longer-combination \nvehicles. So I call upon the trucking industry, all of the safety \ngroups, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, to work it out, not \nin a combative fashion, but to sit down and work together to come up \nwith valid information, which we do not have. It is not acceptable for \nthe mistrust that exists between these groups to continue to stand in \nthe way of a comprehensive, complete, and objective study of these \nlonger-combination vehicles. As I have indicated, I am not offering my \namendment today, but the Senate dialogue on the subject is just \nbeginning.\n  I want to also say, as I see in the Chamber today the ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee, the former majority and minority \nleader of the Senate, that we are to the point on this bill where we \nare as a result of the work done by the Senator from West Virginia. \nOthers of us joined in the original amendment, but I think everyone \nrecognizes it has been the tenacious nature of the Senator from West \nVirginia to move forward on this legislation that has us at a point \nwhere we are today with a bill with $26 billion more actual real \ndollars in it than we would have had. We have a bill that we are going \nto get out of this Senate within the next week or 10 days, and it is \nall, I believe, as a result of the work done by the Senator from West \nVirginia, which the Senator from Nevada very much appreciates.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Finally, although we are not yet discussing the transit \ntitle, let me say a few words about public transportation.\n  Las Vegas is the fastest growing city in the Nation. There is some \ndebate as to whether it is Las Vegas or the suburb of Henderson, where \nI graduated from high school. But that area of the country is growing \nextremely rapidly, as I have already explained. Yet before 1992, it \nhad, at best, a very weak mass transit system. In 1992, the Citizens \nArea Transit--we call it CAT--owned by the Regional Transportation \nCommission, and operated on a contract basis, began a fixed-route bus \nsystem for Las Vegas.\n\n  The response has been tremendous. The Las Vegas community has truly \nembraced CAT. In less than 5 years, ridership on CAT has grown from \n14.9 million annual riders to over 35 million in 1996, a total \nridership growth of 134 percent, and going up each day.\n  The fare box recovery ratio is high. Most of the system's costs are \nrecovered without requiring a huge subsidy. The bus fleet is 100-\npercent compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  So impressive has been CAT's ability to grow efficiently and \neffectively, that the American Public Transit Association last year \nawarded its Outstanding Achievement Award to CAT in the hardest-to-win \nmidsized system category. This is a tremendous feat for such a young \nsystem. After all, Mr. President, this system does not rely on much in \nthe way of Federal funds. The dollars that the Federal Transit \nAdministration has provided has been very timely and useful to this bus \nsystem. For that reason, I would oppose efforts to change transit \nformulas to provide a minimum allocation to States without or with only \nminimal transportation systems.\n  Let me conclude today, Mr. President, by saying that I join with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in saying that the fuels taxes \npaid into the highway trust fund each year will support significantly \nhigher spending on transportation, and I am very happy that Congress is \nnow moving in that direction.\n  These are trust fund moneys. Every time you go buy a tank of gas at \nthe service station, the money that is collected there, a portion of \nit, goes into the highway trust fund. Those moneys should be used for \nthat purpose, and that purpose only. To do otherwise would be a \nviolation of the enormous trust the American people have sent us to \nWashington to uphold.\n  Our Nation's infrastructure represents the lifeline that fuels our \neconomy. When we neglect to adequately provide for the health of this \nlifeline, all of us suffer. Whether it is unsafe and degraded roads or \npollution caused from overcongestion, all of us are affected. The price \nis not only the inconvenience of traversing a dilapidated \ninfrastructure. Indeed, the real price is the increased costs all of us \npay for goods and services because of the burdens placed on a steady \nflow of the stream of commerce. It is similar to a cholesterol buildup, \nI guess, in the arteries, Mr. President. Eventually there is a steep \nprice to pay.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues, Senators Chafee, Baucus, Warner, \nand Byrd, on a job well done. I look forward to working with all my \nfellow Senators in passing this strong, vital 6-year bill as quickly as \npossible, and then urging the House to move forward just as quickly so \nwe can get the bill to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada for his kind comments. He has been a very valuable member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I guess, ever since he came \nhere to the Senate. We have worked closely together on a whole series \nof matters. He has particularly been involved with the Endangered \nSpecies Act, revisions of which I hope we can bring to a conclusion \npretty soon. So I thank the Senator for all his very constructive work \nin our committee and on this legislation likewise.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1687\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from California has no \nobjection. So let us proceed with the approval on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1687.\n  The amendment (No. 1687) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record letters of support from the National Governors Association, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and two other letters.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.\n     Senator James Inhofe,\n     SROB, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the nation's Governors we \n     are writing in support of a requirement that EPA pay one \n     hundred percent of the cost of monitoring for the new fine \n     particle air quality standard. We also urge Congress to \n     codify the time frames in the President's directive for \n     implementing the new federal standards for ozone and \n     particulate matter.\n       As you realize, state face a heavy burden of performance \n     under the federal air quality standards. The costs of new \n     monitoring networks will be substantial. Moreover, while many \n     states regard the EPA's implementing timeframe as \n     unrealistic, we are concerned that we may be given even less \n     time than promised to monitor and submit data to the EPA. It \n     would be self-defeating if states were shortchanged on the \n     resources for monitoring and the time allowed for \n     implementation of the new air quality standards. If states \n     were not provided with adequate time and resources to carry \n     out their responsibilities, the underlying purpose and \n     objective of the federal requirements might not be realized. \n     For that reason, it is important to codify the President's \n     schedule for implementing the new air quality standards, and \n     to ensure that EPA pays for all costs associated with the new \n     monitoring requirements.\n       If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact \n     us or Mr. Tom Curtis of NGA at 624-5389.\n           Sincerely,\n     George V. Voinovich,\n       Chairman.\n     Tom Carper,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NFIB,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.\n     James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the 600,000 small \n     business members of the National Federation of Independent \n     Business (NFIB), I am writing to urge you to support the \n     Inhofe Amendment to the Senate Highway bill (ISTEA).\n       Members of the Administration have stated that a nationwide \n     monitoring system for PM2.5 is necessary to classify \n     nonattainment areas under the new clean air standards. As \n     states seek ways to comply with the new standards, it is \n     critical that these decisions be based on sound data provided \n     by this type of monitoring network.\n       By ensuring the construction and operation of a new \n     nationwide PM2.5 monitoring system, the Inhofe Amendment \n     provides a framework of reliable data and sound science to \n     assist states with control strategies.\n       In a recent NFIB survey, a strong majority of small \n     business owners favored requiring agencies to use sound \n     science and valid evidence before issuing new rules.\n       The new stringent standards for ozone and particulate \n     matter will undoubtedly result in expanded emissions controls \n     on small businesses in areas of the country that have not \n     been subject to prior regulation. Designation of \n     nonattainment areas will bear heavily on those least able to \n     shoulder the burden--small businesses. It is imperative that \n     designations for the new standards be supported by sound, \n     accurate data.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our request and your \n     support for small business.\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.\n     To Members of the United States Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges your support for the \n     amendment to be offered by Senator Inhofe to S. 1173, the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business \n     federation, representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region.\n       From an economic standpoint, immediate implementation of \n     the new standards would triple the number of communities out \n     of compliance, at a time when continuing improvements are \n     being made to the nation's air quality. The amendment will \n     provide states, businesses and consumers greater certainty \n     that control strategies for attaining compliance with both \n     the new ozone and fine\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n     particulate matter standards are based on reliable data. The \n     amendment will provide the necessary funding to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for establishing a \n     nationwide monitoring network for PM2.5 and allows \n     for the collection of three full years of monitoring data \n     before EPA decides which areas of the country do not meet the \n     new standard. The amendment is consistent with the timelines \n     set froth in President Clinton's Memorandum on Implementation \n     of the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for \n     ozone and PM2.5.\n       Accordingly, we urge your support for the Inhofe amendment \n     to ensure that the new NAAQS are based on the best data \n     possible. The U.S. Chamber will consider including the vote \n     on this amendment to S. 1173 in its annual How They Voted \n     ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              American Legislative\n\n\n                                             Exchange Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.\n     Senator James Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: It has come to my attention that you \n     are considering an amendment to the Senate Highway bill, \n     known as ISTEA, dealing with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards for \n     particulate matter. I commend you on addressing this \n     important issue.\n       ALEC's members comprise over 3,000 state legislators in all \n     fifty states. These new standards will seriously impact our \n     state economies and divert scarce funds from other health and \n     environment priorities. Thus, it is crucial that these \n     standards not be imposed prematurely.\n       ALEC has adopted the Resolution on Ozone and particulate \n     Matter NAAQS Revisions, (enclosed), a model resolution \n     opposing the rapid implementation of these changes. In the \n     resolution, ALEC notes that little monitoring information has \n     been developed as to the beneficial health effects of new \n     standards. ALEC believes more study is needed to ascertain if \n     a casual link exists between particles of 2.5 microns and \n     possible adverse health effects. Also, ALEC supports further \n     study to determine the actual benefits and costs involved.\n       ALEC's model legislation has been considered by many state \n     legislatures, and has already passed in seven states. I hope \n     this information is helpful as you continue your \n     deliberations on this issue. If you have any questions, I \n     encourage you to call Scott Spendlove, Acting Director of \n     ALEC's Energy, Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture \n     Task Force, at (202) 466-3800.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                      Duane Parde,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Moseley-Braun pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 1705 are located in today's Record under ``Introduction of Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I also would like to thank the Presiding \nOfficer. This is actually my time to be in the Chair, and I appreciate \nhis giving me the opportunity to speak on the ISTEA legislation before \nus. I will try to be brief in light of his willingness to stay a little \nextra today.\n  I just thought I would take a few minutes to review as I see it the \nprogress that has been made really going all the way back to last year \nin the effort to try to address the problems of infrastructure and \ntransportation in our country. Let me do that though, first, from my \nperspective as a Senator from the State of Michigan.\n  For quite a long time--in fact, longer than anybody around seems to \nbe able to remember--our State has been one of the States which was \nreferred to as a donor State. That means that when gas tax moneys are \nsent to Washington, more moneys get sent from Michigan than ever come \nback in the form of support for the highway system. We understand and I \nthink have shown over the years a great deal of patience with the \nformulas that have been used and the return on investment that has \ntaken place.\n  We understood, for example, when the Interstate Highway System was \nbeing built that a lot of States needed to have additional dollars \nbeyond that which they could generate from their own gas tax revenues \nin order to build the system so that we could transport Michigan cars \nto the South or to the West and to the east coast, or Michigan \nagriculture products and take advantage of receiving in exchange the \ngoods and services that other States were exporting. However, because \nwe are sending more dollars to Washington than we have received back, \nit has meant that our State has not been able to do all that we would \nlike to in order to prepare our own infrastructure for the 21st \ncentury.\n  We are especially beset by specific problems in Michigan. One is the \nfact that the weather in our State tends to be quite a bit colder than \nthe average for the entire country. Particularly in the northern parts \nof Michigan we encounter winters that are very severe. And that has an \neffect on the road system.\n  We also, of course, confront problems that relate to the age of our \nsystem. The Interstate System in our State of Michigan on average is \napproximately 7 years older than the national average, which means that \nsome of our roads are more in need of service and repair than might be \nthe case in other parts of the country.\n  For this variety of reasons, it has been my view from the beginning \nof the discussion of transportation legislation, which really was \ninitiated last year, that it is indispensable that Michigan receive \nmore money back, more dollars back, than we have been receiving in \nprevious years. To that end, our State legislature and our Governor \naddressed this issue very clearly in 1997. The Governor came forth with \na very bold plan aimed at trying to provide adequate revenues and \nresources to put Michigan's roads on a path to being in good shape for \nthe next century. Half of the plan essentially was a plan that \nbasically relied on Michigan to assume a greater responsibility.\n  So the State legislature and the Governor signed into law legislation \nwhich increased our States' gas tax by a little over 4 cents to \ngenerate approximately $200 million more per year to be available for \nour State department of transportation. The Governor also charged all \nof us who are Federal legislators with the job of bringing back more \ndollars to Michigan as part of the reauthorization of the ISTEA \nlegislation. The target he set for us was $200 million as well, and it \nwas his view that, if the State could increase by $200 million what it \ninvested in roads and if the Federal Government's share could be \nincreased by $200 million, that $400 million amount would give Michigan \nan excellent chance to address its repair needs, new roads needs, and a \nvariety of other transportation needs.\n  We have been working on this, obviously, now for quite a long time. I \nthink the progress to date has been good. The strategy that I have \ntaken or tried to work on here as a Member of the Senate has really \nbeen a three-part strategy. Earlier this week, on Monday, we learned \nthat the second of the three parts had been successfully completed. The \nfirst part was successfully completed in 1997, and we will soon work on \nthe balance. But let me talk about that strategy briefly and why, at \nleast from Michigan's point of view, things are much more positive \ntoday than they were just a few days ago.\n  The first part of the strategy was simple. It was to shift into the \nnational highway transportation trust fund all the gas tax revenues \nbeing sent to Washington from Michigan and other States. As you know, \nin 1993, when we increased the Federal gas taxes by 4.3 cents, it was \nthe first time those dollars didn't go into the highway trust fund; \nthey went into the general fund. For a lot of us that didn't make \nsense. Several of us tried to have that 4.3 cents repealed. We didn't \nhave enough\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nvotes to get that job done. But what we did have was support this past \nyear during the deliberations on the tax bill in the summer of 1997 to \nshift those tax dollars from the general fund to the transportation \nfund, to make those dollars now available, if we authorized it, to be \nspent on transportation. That was step one. It was a big victory for \ndonor States.\n\n  Step two took place earlier this week. After a lengthy behind-the-\nscenes and public set of discussions and debates and negotiations, the \ndecision was made to spend a considerably greater amount of money on \ntransportation over the pendency of the ISTEA legislation than had been \nexpected to be spent when the legislation was first brought to the \nSenate last year. Essentially, that amount will be approximately $25 \nbillion additional over this timeframe. This is good news. It means \nthat the 4.3 cents we are transferring into to the trust fund will not \nbe allowed to increase the trust fund surplus but instead be available \nto be spent on transportation so the donor States will have the \nopportunity to see more of their gas tax moneys coming back.\n  It has been estimated that the combination of the underlying \nlegislation which was introduced here and the new dollars that are \ngoing to be made available will for Michigan put us at least at the \n$200 million mark and perhaps considerably beyond that. That, of \ncourse, is the final step in the process.\n  What I wanted to do in my brief remarks today was to thank the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the ranking \nmember and others who have been here working and will continue, I am \nsure, for the next several days to be working for the progress that has \nbeen made; to also thank those who were involved in these budget \ndiscussions, particularly Senator Domenici, with whom I had numerous \nmeetings and discussions on this over the course of the last several \nmonths, for his willingness to work on the new budget resolution in \nsuch a way as to accommodate the additional spending on transportation. \nI think we are making progress in the right direction.\n  The final step, obviously, is to determine how the new dollars and \nall the money will be allocated. As a donor State, I have made it very \nclear to the ranking member, to the chairman, and others that we in \nMichigan would like to see donor States get as much equity as possible. \nWe recognize in this Chamber that we are not the majority of States. We \nalso recognize that there are unique needs in various regions of the \ncountry, which we will try to address.\n  For my part, I want to be as helpful to the process as possible, and \nat the same time I want to make it clear that as a Senator from \nMichigan I am going to do everything I can to try to make sure that our \nvoice is heard and that we address to the degree we possibly can in \nthis Chamber the need for States that are donor States to get their \nfair share. I hope we can finish this process in a way, as I said, that \nallows us to not only hit but exceed the $200 million per year increase \nthat the Governor has set for us. I am more definitely on course for \ndoing that, and I appreciate the progress that has taken place so far.\n  I look forward to working with everybody. I will keep my constituents \napprised as further developments occur. But to those from Michigan who \nare tuned in or who will be following this debate, I do want to make it \nclear that we have succeeded, first, in shifting the gas tax revenues \ninto the trust fund; second, we have now succeeded in making sure that \nthose revenues coming into the trust fund will be spent. When you add \nthose together you definitely see Michigan on the road to receiving a \nmuch greater number of dollars back from Washington than has been the \ncase. That is the kind of direction I hope we can continue right \nthrough to the end of this legislation both here in the Senate and \nultimately when we work with the House to finish this up later this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, which is the Chafee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have a series of amendments that have \nbeen agreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1690 To Amendment No. 1676\n\n  (Purpose: To modify State infrastructure bank matching requirements)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Murkowski and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 1690 to amendment \n     No. 1676.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 191, line 12, strike the semicolon at the end and \n     insert ``, except that if the State has a higher Federal \n     share payable under section 120(b) of title 23, United States \n     Code, the State shall be required to contribute only an \n     amount commensurate with the higher Federal share;''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. This amendment by the junior Senator from Alaska is in \nconnection with State infrastructure banks. This amendment restores the \nso-called sliding scale matching rate for States having large amounts \nof federally owned land.

Mr. President, I think perhaps this might be a time when \nwe might do the best we could to alert our colleagues as to what is \ntaking place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The major amendment we have been on since 10:30 this \nmorning, what you might call the so-called Chafee amendment, has been \ntied up with some difficulties. We have not been able to move to a vote \non that. We have set it aside to take up other matters. At this time, I \nwould like very much if we could take up the Dorgan amendment, if that \nis possible. If that is not possible, and that will take an hour, we \nwould soon be able to alert people whether we will be able to do that \nor not.\n  Absent that, and even in addition to that, there would be an \namendment of about a half an hour by the junior Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman. If the Dorgan amendment is not available to \ntake up, then it would be my suggestion we go directly to the Bingaman \namendment, which would take a half hour.\n  So it is possible that we would have some votes--a vote at somewhere \naround 6 o'clock. As you can note from my statement here, there are \nsome ``ifs'' involved in all this. I am doing the best I can to keep \nour fellow Senators alerted to what the situation is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are making every effort to locate both those Senators \nand we are urging them to come to the floor as quickly as possible. I \nam unable to report at this time whether they will be able to come to \nthe floor, but we will certainly try.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I say further, what we would like to do is to dispose of \nthe underlying amendment, that is the amendment before us, the so-\ncalled Chafee amendment. If we cannot do it tonight--and I see problems \nwith that--certainly do it the first thing in the morning. Then we \nwould go to the McConnell amendment on disadvantaged business \nenterprises. He has indicated he would be ready. Actually, I told him \nwe were going to do that this afternoon, so my predictions are not \ntotally accurate on what we are taking up and what we might take up.\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n  But we are doing the best we can. That is a major amendment and will \ntake some time. We would certainly like to get to that amendment as \nsoon as we can. The key thing is to dispose of the so-called Chafee \namendment as soon as we can.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I fully concur with the agenda laid out by \nthe distinguished chairman, and hope we accomplish it. Meanwhile, I ask \nunanimous consent Senator Carol Moseley-Braun be added as a cosponsor \nof the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I am authorized to announce on behalf of \nthe majority leader there will be no more votes this evening. We will \nannounce shortly the schedule for tomorrow, what time we will be coming \nin, what votes will be coming up and when they will be coming up. We \nwill be ready to announce that very, very shortly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be added as a cosponsor \nto the Chafee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, we are waiting for the final \narrangements for the schedule for early tomorrow, and pending that, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, before we start, I once again say to \nanybody who hasn't yet got the message, I have been authorized by the \nmajority leader to announce that there will be no further rollcall \nvotes this evening.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. on Thursday, \nimmediately following the resumption of the highway bill, Senator \nBingaman be recognized in order to offer an amendment regarding liquor \ndrive-throughs. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 30 \nminutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on that \namendment. I further ask consent that immediately following that \ndebate, the amendment be set aside and Senator Dorgan be recognized to \noffer an amendment regarding open containers. I ask consent that there \nbe 60 minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on that \namendment. Finally, I ask consent that at the expiration of that time, \nat approximately 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, the Senate proceed to a vote \non or in relation, first, to the Dorgan amendment, to be followed by a \nvote on or in relation to the Bingaman amendment. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that no amendments be in order to the above-mentioned \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, shortly, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--that is the official professional staff that has been in \nexistence for many years that helps the Congress with budgeting--is \ngoing to issue--it is already prepared, it is ready for a formal \nissuance--an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals for the \nyear 1999.\n  Before I tell the Senate what they are going to conclude, let me \nhearken back to when the President issued his budget. There were many \nSenators who asked me, ``How can the President have so many new \ndomestic programs when we have an agreed-upon limit for the year 1999 \nand the year 2000 and the year 2001, all the way to the year 2003, that \ndoesn't permit any growth in the Federal domestic program?'' As a \nmatter of fact, to be accurate, it permits .5 percent growth, which the \nCongressional Budget Office has said, doing the arithmetic, it is even \nhigh; you cannot grow that much.\n\n  So I was being asked: Where can the President find money for his \neducation initiative--whether you are for it or against it--for his \nchild care proposal--whether you are for it or against it --and a long \nshopping list of programs? And I believe I said then, and said on the \nfloor of the Senate, I do not believe he can. I believe he has tried to \nfind a way to spend more than the agreement says we can spend, but says \nhe isn't by transferring revenues and receipts to the Appropriations \nCommittee so they can spend the money and take credit for the revenues \nand receipts and other matters like that.\n  Well, as a matter of fact, the Congressional Budget Office says that \nthe President is $68 billion in excess of the agreed-upon amounts we \ncan spend for each of these 5 years--$68 billion over the budget \nagreement caps on the domestic discretionary programs, on the domestic \nprogram part of the appropriations process.\n  Now, that is very important, because to the extent that that is \ncorrect, then obviously, unless Senators want to go back and restrain \nand cut and eliminate domestic programs, they are clearly not going to \nbe able to fund very much of the President's new domestic initiative \nlist that was forthcoming and stated in his State of the Union address.\n  Now, frankly, I did not believe, as one who has worked on this for \nsome time, that the President could exchange matters in that way, and \nwhat I said has now been vindicated by the professionals who do the \nwork for the Congress. If you could do it that way, then obviously \nthese agreed-upon caps would be meaningless, for all you would have to \ndo is find revenues and receipts, and the Government could grow and \ngrow in terms of the amount that we spend and still say that we are \nwithin the agreed-upon caps because you offset the receipts against the \nexpenditures.\n  Apparently, the Congressional Budget Office said that is not possible \nand then found that some of the expenditures are going to spend out \nmore than the President says. Now, that is interesting, because if you \nwonder where we are on surpluses, you know the President said we had a \n$220 billion surplus over 5 years. The Congressional Budget Office, in \nits report, says the surplus for the 5 years, Mr. President, will be \nless than half of that, it will be $108 billion--slightly less than \none-half of what he predicted.\n  In addition to that fact, which should sober us up a bit, this \nprofessional evaluation done for us by an independent entity--not the \neconomists who work for the President, and not the President's Office \nof Management and Budget, but an independent group--they also say that \nthe budget, the way the President is spending it, goes out of kilter \nand that in the year 2000 we are in deficit again. In other words, we \ncome out, have a little surplus--a little surplus--and then in 2000 we \nare in deficit again. We come out of it shortly afterwards. But it does \nput us in a very awkward position, as we speak of the accumulation of \nsurpluses over time, to find that the numbers we are going to be forced \nto use are going to say there is no surplus in the year 2000.\n  Now, I wish that the President was right in his $220 billion surplus \nover 5 years. I wondered about it, especially with all the new \nspending. But I was today to some extent--some sober language enters \nour discussions now, a little sobering-up with reference to where we \nare. And, I will insert in the Record the Congressional Budget Office's \nanalysis in toto for everyone to read.\n  One last comment. The Congressional Budget Office has modified the \nannual surpluses also substantially so that there are no significant \nsurpluses in the early years--maybe 4, 5, 6, 7 billion dollars, but \nnothing significant.\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n  Now, that means that our job around here is a lot more difficult, \nbecause whenever anybody thinks it does not matter whether we \noverspend, we are going to be confronted with the sobering fact that we \nhad better not be looking to the President's budget for guidance or \nadvice because it will just make matters worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1333-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The information required under \nthese sections is in the report that accompanies this certification. \nThe supplemental appropriations request required under these sections \nis being forwarded under separate cover.\n  America has major national interests in peace in Bosnia. We have \nlearned from hard experience in this turbulent century that America's \nsecurity and Europe's stability are intimately linked. The Bosnian war \nsaw the worst fighting--and the most profound humanitarian disaster--on \nthat continent since the end of the Second World War. The conflict \ncould easily have spread through the region, endangering old Allies and \nnew democracies alike. A larger conflict would have cast doubt on the \nviability of the NATO alliance itself and crippled prospects for our \nlarger goal of a democratic, undivided, and peaceful Europe.\n  The Dayton framework is the key to changing the conditions that made \nBosnia a fuse in a regional powder keg. It is decisively in American \ninterests to see Dayton implemented as rapidly as feasible, so that \npeace becomes self-sustaining. U.S. leadership is as essential to \nsustaining progress as it has been to ending the war and laying the \nfoundation for peace.\n  I expect the size of the overall NATO force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nwill remain similar to that of the current SFOR. However, the U.S. \ncontribution would decline by about 20 percent, as our Allies and \npartners continue to shoulder an increasing share of the burden.\n  Although I do not propose a fixed end-date for this presence, it is \nby no means open-ended. Instead, the goal of the military presence is \nto establish the conditions under which Dayton implementation can \ncontinue without the support of a major NATO-led military force. To \nachieve this goal, we have established concrete and achievable \nbenchmarks, such as the reform of police and media, the elimination of \nillegal pre-Dayton institutions, the conduct of elections according to \ndemocratic norms, elimination of cross-entity barriers to commerce, and \na framework for the phased and orderly return of refugees. NATO and \nU.S. forces will be reduced progressively as achievement of these \nbenchmarks improves conditions, enabling the international community to \nrely largely on traditional diplomacy, international civil personnel, \neconomic incentives and disincentives, confidence-building measures, \nand negotiation to continue implementing the Dayton Accords over the \nlonger term.\n  In fact, great strides already have been made towards fulfilling \nthese aims, especially in the last ten months since the United States \nre-energized the Dayton process. Since Dayton, a stable military \nenvironment has been created; over 300,000 troops returned to civilian \nlife and 6,600 heavy weapons have been destroyed. Public security is \nimproving through the restructuring, retraining, and reintegration of \nlocal police. Democratic elections have been held at all levels of \ngovernment and hard-line nationalists--especially the Republika \nSrpska--are increasingly marginalized. Independent media and political \npluralism are expanding. Over 400,000 refugees and displaced persons \nhave returned home--110,000 in 1997. One third of the publicly-indicted \nwar criminals have been taken into custody.\n\n  Progress has been particularly dramatic since the installation of a \npro-Dayton, pro-democracy Government in Republika Srpska in December. \nAlready, the capital of Republika Srpska has been moved from Pale to \nBanja Luka; media are being restructured along democratic lines; civil \npolice are generally cooperating with the reform process; war criminals \nare surrendering; and Republika Srpska is working directly with \ncounterparts in the Federation to prepare key cities in both entities \nfor major returns of refugees and displaced persons.\n  At the same time, long-standing obstacles to inter-entity cooperation \nalso are being broken down: a common flag now flies over Bosnian \ninstitutions, a common currency is being printed, a common automobile \nlicense plate is being manufactured, and mail is being delivered and \ntrains are running across the inter-entity boundary line.\n  Although progress has been tangible, many of these achievements still \nare reversible and a robust international military presence still is \nrequired at the present time to sustain the progress. I am convinced \nthat the NATO-led force--and U.S. participation in it--can be \nprogressively reduced as conditions continue to improve, until the \nimplementation process is capable of sustaining itself without a major \ninternational military presence.\n                                                  William J.

The CDA \nstates that licenses may be issued for full or partial settlement of \ntelecommunications services with Cuba, but may not require any \nwithdrawal from a blocked account. Following enactment of the CDA on \nOctober 23, 1992, a number of U.S. telecommunications companies \nsuccessfully negotiated agreements to provide telecommunications \nservices between the United States and Cuba consistent with policy \nguidelines developed by the Department of State and the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  Subsequent to enactment of the CDA, the Department of the Treasury's \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) amended the Cuban Assets \nControl Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the national emergency declared with \nrespect to Iran on March 15, 1995, pursuant to the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) is to continue in \neffect beyond March 15, 1998, to the Federal Register for publication. \nThis emergency is separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, in \nconnection with the Iranian hostage crisis and therefore requires \nseparate renewal of emergency authorities.\n  The factors that led me to declare a national emergency with respect \nto Iran on March 15, 1995, have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and \nits acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem, continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill and ask \nfor its appropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, \nalong with a number of my colleagues, the Public School Modernization \nAct of 1998. This legislation addresses one of the most fundamental \nproblems with public education in America, and that is that many of our \nelementary and secondary schools are literally falling down around our \nchildren.\n  The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 will help States and \nschool districts finance their school improvement priorities. It will \nhelp them modernize classrooms so that no child misses out on the \ninformation age. It will help them ease overcrowding so that no child \nis forced to learn the principles of geometry in a gymnasium. It will \nhelp them patch leaky roofs, fix broken plumbing, and strengthen the \nfacilities that provide the foundation for our children's education. \nWithout this support, schools will continue to crumble under the weight \nof deferred maintenance and neglect, and our children's education, and \ntheir future, and our Nation's future, will suffer as a result.\n  Education in America correlates with opportunity for individuals, but \nalso for our country as a whole. The rungs of the ladder of opportunity \nin America are crafted in the classroom. Consider that high school \ngraduates earn 46 percent more each year than those who don't graduate \nfrom high school. College graduates earn 155 percent more every year \nthan those who do not graduate from high school. Over the course of a \nlifetime, the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as \nthe least educated Americans. So education is clearly related to \nindividual prosperity and the ability of people to function in this new \neconomy.\n  Education also correlates to almost all indicia of economic and \nsocial well-being. Educational attainment can directly be tied to \nincome, to health, to the likelihood of being on welfare, to the \nlikelihood of being incarcerated in a prison, and to the likelihood of \nvoting and participating in our democracy.\n  However, education is more than a tool simply to lift people out of \npoverty or to provide a better standard of living for individuals. It \nis also the engine that will drive America's economy in the 21st \ncentury. In a Wall Street Journal survey last year of leading U.S. \neconomists, 43 percent of them said that the single most important \nthing that we could do to increase our long-term economic growth would \nbe to invest more in education and research and development. Nothing \nelse came close to education in that survey. One economist said, ``One \nof the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that \neconomic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.''\n  A recent study by the Manufacturing Institute concluded that \nincreasing the education level of workers by 1 year raises the \nproductivity level by 8.5 percent in manufacturing. Imagine, Mr. \nPresident, if you will, that in this global economy, the only way we \nwill be able to hold on to our position as the country in the world \nwith the highest standard of living is if we prepare our work force--as \na whole, all of our workers--to compete at the highest level of \ncompetition and to produce at the highest level of productivity.\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n  The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 represents the kind of \ninvestment that will result in better futures for our children and a \nbetter future for our country. The bill strengthens the fundamental \ntenet of American education--local control. By helping schools finance \ntheir capital improvement priorities, the Federal Government can free \nlocal resources for educational activities and can help give \ncommunities the kind of buildings that they need before they can \nimplement the kinds of school reforms that parents and educators are \ndemanding.\n  The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 creates a \nsimple, effective, and easy-to-administer means of helping communities \nmodernize their schools. The bill creates a new category of zero coupon \nbonds for States and school districts to issue to finance capital \nimprovements. It allocates $21.8 billion worth of bonding authority to \nStates and large school districts over the next 2 years.\n\n  Over 5 years, the bill will cost our National Government only $3.3 \nbillion, but $21.8 billion worth of new construction and modernization \nwill be made available by that $3.3 billion, which means for every \nFederal dollar that we invest over the next 5-year period, there will \nbe an additional 6.6 in State and local dollars. That is a pretty good \nleverage capacity from this kind of investment.\n  Perhaps most important, though, Mr. President, is that this bill is \nbureaucracy-free, or as close to bureaucracy-free as we can manage. \nStates and school districts need only to comply with two main \nrequirements before issuing these new school modernization bonds. \nFirst, they must conduct a survey of their school facility needs, which \nyou would think that every school district would have already, but the \ntruth is they don't, yet. Second, they must describe how they intend to \nallocate the bonding authority to assure that schools with the greatest \nneeds and the least resources benefit. That is it. Those are the only \nstrings. There is no reapplying for funds, no continuous oversight, no \ngetting individual projects approved by some Federal agency. The plan \nis simple. It will work. And it will strengthen local schools.\n  Mr. President, the magnitude of the school facilities problem is so \ngreat today that many districts cannot maintain the kind of educational \nenvironment necessary to teach all of our children the kinds of skills \nthey will need to compete in the 21st century, global economy.\n  We commissioned a study by the GAO a couple years ago. What they \nconcluded was that every day some 14 million children in this country--\n14 million children--attend schools in need of major renovations or \noutright replacement, 7 million children every day attend schools with \nlife-threatening safety code violations, and it will cost $112 billion \nto bring the schools up to code. This is not bells and whistles, this \nis not equipping them with computers and fancy new cosmetics, but just \nto address the toll that decades of deferred maintenance have taken on \nour school facilities across this country.\n  In my State of Illinois, school modernization and construction needs \ntop $13 billion. Many of our school districts have a difficult time \nenough just buying textbooks, pencils, and teacher salaries, let alone \nfinancing capital improvements. This would free local resources for \neducation by providing Federal support for bricks and mortar.\n  By the way, the national school repair price tag, as enormous as it \nsounds, does not include the cost of wiring our schools for modern \ntechnology. One of the greatest barriers to the incorporation of modern \ncomputers into classrooms is the physical condition of many school \nbuildings. You can't very well use a computer if you don't have an \nelectrical system working in the wall to plug it into. According to the \nGAO study, almost half of all schools--half of all schools--lack enough \nelectrical power for the full-scale use of computers, 60 percent lack \nthe conduits to connect classroom computers to a network, and more than \n60 percent of the schools lack enough phone lines for instructional \nuse.\n  Last year, principal Rita Melius from Waukegan, IL, came to \nWashington and told of her experience with computer technology at her \nschool. She thought she was doing the right thing by equipping her \nschools with modern school technology, but when she deployed the \ncomputers around the schools, fires started in the building because the \nwiring was so old. Her experience is being replicated all over this \ncountry as communities try to bring their schools into the information \nage. This legislation will give Ms. Melius, and others like her, the \nresources to modernize their classrooms.\n\n  Mr. President, it will also give communities the power to relieve \novercrowding. According to the U.S. Department of Education, just to \nkeep up with growing enrollment, we will need to build some 6,000 new \nschools over the next 10 years.\n  I have visited schools in Illinois where study halls are being held \nin the hallways, literally, because there is no other space. I have \nseen stairway landings converted into computer labs. I have seen \ncardboard partitions used to turn one classroom into two. I point out, \nMr. President, that particular school was in what could be called a \nbasement. It wasn't exactly a basement, it was at ground level, but \nthey had cardboard separating two classes from each other. There is a \nschool, frankly, where the lunchroom has been converted into two \nclassrooms, where students eat in the gymnasium. And instead of having \ngym, they have ``adaptive physical education'' while they stand next to \ntheir desks, because the gyms are being used for lunchrooms. It is \nreally shameful, Mr. President, and it is the situation that we find in \nalmost a third of the schools in this country.\n  Again, I point out that this phenomenon is not just an inner-city \nproblem. It exists in rural communities and suburban communities as \nwell--just about one-third in each type of community across the United \nStates.\n  Teachers and parents know full well that these conditions directly \naffect the ability of their children to learn, and research backs up \nthat intuition. Two separate studies found a 10 to 11 percent \nachievement gap between those students in good buildings and those in \nshabby or poor buildings, after controlling for all other factors.\n  Other studies have found that when buildings are in poor condition, \nstudents are more likely to misbehave. Three leading researchers \nrecently concluded, ``. . .there's no doubt that building condition \naffects academic performance.''\n  This morning, in a press conference in which a student from a local \nschool talked about overcrowded conditions, he mentioned that they were \nhaving discipline problems from fights breaking out from what he called \n``hall rage,'' because the overcrowding situation in the school was so \nperverse and extreme that students were literally bumping into each \nother trying to move from class to class. So we have a situation here \nin which academic performance is affected.\n  I think it is time to mention something at this point. We just saw, \nthis week, the grades come in on an international math and science \ntest. The results were profoundly disturbing. American students scored \nclose to the bottom, or at the bottom, on every math and physics test \noffered.\n  Now, here we are. A new study of high school seniors in 23 countries \nshows U.S. students scored significantly lower than students in other \ncountries. This is in math, nations with scores above the international \nlevel: Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway. \nNations with scores close to the international average: Italy, Russia, \nLithuania, Czech Republic, and the United States. Nations lower than \nthe international level: Cyprus and South Africa. We are in the \ncategory of nations with scores lower than the international level, \nwhich includes: France, Russia, Switzerland, Denmark, Cyprus, \nLithuania, Australia, Greece, Sweden, Canada, Slovenia, Italy, Czech \nRepublic, Germany, and the United States is next to last in advanced \nmathematics. In physics: Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Slovenia, \nGermany, Australia, Cyprus, Latvia, Greece, Switzerland, Canada, \nFrance, Czech Republic, Austria, and the United States. We are last. \nFrom the President down to the local township officials, this should be \na clarion call that we have to work to improve the quality of our \nschools.\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n  Our school facilities problems directly result, Mr. President, from \nour archaic school funding formula and system. The current system, the \nway we fund schools, was established a century ago when the Nation's \nwealth was measured in terms of property wealth, in terms of \nlandholdings. Wealth is no longer accumulated just in land, and the \nfunding mechanism that ties funding of our education to the local \nproperty tax is no longer appropriate, nor is it adequate.\n\n  Again, according to the GAO, poor and middle-class school districts \ntry the hardest to raise revenue from the property tax, but the system \nworks against them. In some 35 States, poor districts--that is, \ndistricts with smaller property tax bases--have higher tax rates than \nwealthy districts, but they raise less revenue because there is less \nproperty wealth to tax.\n  This local funding model, this model of depending on the local \nproperty tax to fund education, does not work for school \ninfrastructure, just as it would not work for our highways or any other \ninfrastructure.\n  It is ironic that we are here talking about the highway bill. Imagine \nwhat would happen if we based our system of roads on the same funding \nmodel we use for education. Imagine if every community was responsible \nfor the construction and maintenance of the roads within its borders. \nIn all likelihood, we would see smooth, good roads in the wealthy \ntowns, a patchwork of mediocre roads in middle-income towns, and very \nfew roads at all in poor communities. Transportation would be hostage \nto the vagaries of wealth and geography. Commerce and travel would be \ndifficult, and navigation of such a system would not serve the best \ninterests of our whole country. That hypothetical, unfortunately, \nprecisely describes the way that we fund our public education system.\n  I believe we need a new approach. We need a partnership among all \nlevels of government and the private sector that preserves local \ncontrol in education but creates a financing balance that better serves \nlocal property taxpayers, children, schools, and indeed our entire \ncountry. This new act I am introducing today represents such a new \npartnership. It is a simple and effective means of leveraging limited \nFederal resources, strengthening local control of education, and \nimproving the educational opportunity for every child.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the needs of the schools \nin their own States and decide what they stand for: higher property \ntaxes and crumbling schools, or lower property taxes and a new \npartnership to improve our schools for the 21st century. I believe that \nwe have some opportunities here.\n  Again, I have visited a lot of schools and I have seen what happens \nwhen we engage the resources sufficient to provide an environment and \nsupport needed for our children to learn. American kids are no dumber \nthan kids anywhere else in the world. There is no reason for us to be \nat the bottom of this international testing. It is not their fault. It \nis our fault for failing to engage appropriately, to give public \neducation the kind of support that it needs to have.\n  Now, there is some good news I would like to call to your attention. \nA group of some 20 Illinois school districts, led by Superintendent \nPaul Kimmelman, banded together to form a group called the First in the \nWorld Consortium. Their goal was to score first in the world on the \ninternational math and science test. At the same time that these \nresults came out, Mr. President, the results from the First in the \nWorld Consortium came out also. They succeeded. The students in that \nconsortium placed first in the world when compared with other \ncountries, which is far above the dismal performance of our country as \na whole.\n  What does this consortium have that the schools in our country lack? \nIt is not the makeup of students. The kids are as capable anywhere in \nthe country, whether they come from rich families or poor families. We \nhave some of the brightest students in the world, who need only the \nopportunity to learn. The difference, however, is what supports we, as \na community, a national community, can provide for them--schools with \nfirst-rate facilities, small classes, modern technology, and supportive \ncommunities.\n  So I hope that we will all take a look at the importance of this \nlegislation. This is a way that we can engage the support of the \nNational Government, our national community, acting in our national \ninterest to serve our most important resource, which is our children. \nIf we don't invest in them and if we don't build up these schools, many \nof which were built--I am making an assumption about age, but when you \nand I were in grammar school, Mr. President, these schools were built \nalmost a generation ago and, in many instances, more than a generation \nago. That generation saw fit to provide facilities that were suitable \nfor learning. That we have not, I believe, speaks volumes for us.\n  I think our generation has an absolute obligation and duty to provide \nfor this generation, the next generation of Americans, no less an \nopportunity than we inherited from the last generation of Americans. We \nhave a duty to see to it that they have the ability to get educated and \nto take their talent as far as those talents will take them, to \nmaximize the ability of every person to rise to the absolute best level \nthat he or she can, based on his or her natural talents.\n  Those natural talents, though, Mr. President, have to be nurtured in \nan environment and in facilities that are suitable for learning. This \nlegislation will begin, hopefully, to create the kind of partnership \nthat will allow the National, State, and local governments to stop the \nfinger-pointing, stop the blame game, stop pushing the buck, and say it \nis somebody else's duty, or responsibility, or fault, and allow us to \ncome together on behalf of what is clearly in our interest as citizens \nnot only of cities and States and local communities, but as citizens of \nthis great country.\n  This is why we have to come together. This is why we have to put the \nold, tired arguments behind us. This is why I think we should take a \nvariety of ideas and put them out so that we can reach a consensus on \ngetting some results, getting results that will serve our children's \ninterests.\n  The public certainly wants us to do it. According to a bipartisan \npoll released earlier this year, some 76 percent of registered voters \nwould support a $30 billion, 10-year Federal commitment to rebuild and \nmodernize our schools. This legislation provides for that kind of a \npartnership. I certainly hope, Mr. President, that the Members of this \nbody will review the GAO reports regarding their own States, because \nthis is not just an Illinois problem, this is not just a North Carolina \nproblem, or a Wyoming problem; this is a problem for America, and every \nState in this country has the same problem in the same ways. I urge \nthem to examine the reports by the General Accounting Office regarding \nthe condition of schools in their States, I ask them to examine the \nreport of the General Accounting Office regarding the property tax \ndependence in their States, and I urge them to sign on and cosponsor \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill \n     includes two major provisions.\n\n\n                  Qualified school modernization bonds\n\n       The bill allows state and local governments to issue \n     ``qualified school modernization bonds'' to fund the \n     construction, modernization, and rehabilitation of public \n     schools. Bondholders, instead of receiving interest, would \n     receive annual Federal income tax credits. The maximum term \n     of the bonds would be 15 years.\n       A total of $9.7 billion of authority to issue qualified \n     school modernization bonds would be allowed in each of 1999 \n     and 2000, half to States and half to the 100 school districts \n     with the largest numbers of poor children (The District of \n     Columbia is considered a State.) The authority allocated to \n     the 100 large districts would be based on the amounts of \n     Federal assistance received under Title I, Basic Grants. In \n     addition, the Secretary of Education would have the authority \n     to designate 25 additional districts to receive bond \n     authority directly from the Federal government. The authority \n     allocated to States would also be based on the State's share \n     of Title I, Basic Grants, excluding the 100 large districts \n     and any others designated by the Secretary to receive bond \n     authority directly from the Federal government. A small \n     portion of the total amount of bond authority would be set \n     aside for each U.S. possession (other than Puerto Rico, which \n     is considered a State) based on its share of the total U.S. \n     poverty population. A State, possession, or eligible school \n     district would be permitted to carry forward any unused \n     portion of its allocation until September 30, 2003.\n       Under the proposal, a bond would be treated as a qualified \n     school modernization bond if three requirements are met. \n     First, the Department of Education must approve a school \n     construction plan of the State, territory, or school district \n     that: (1) demonstrates that a survey has been undertaken of \n     the construction and renovation needs in the jurisdiction, \n     (2) describes how the jurisdiction will assure that bond \n     proceeds are used for the purposes of this proposal, and (3) \n     explains how it will use its allocation to assist localities \n     that lack the fiscal capacity to issue bonds on their own. \n     Second, the issuing government must receive an allocation for \n     the bond from the State, territory, or eligible district. \n     Third, 95 percent or more of the bond proceeds must be used \n     to construct or rehabilitate public school facilities.\n\n\n                      Qualified Zone Academy Bonds\n\n       The bill makes three changes to the existing qualified zone \n     academy bonds (created in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997). \n     First, the bill increases the 1999 bond cap from $400 million \n     to $1.4 billion and adds an additional $1.4 billion of bond \n     cap in 2000. Second, the bill expands the list of permissible \n     uses of proceeds to include new school construction. Third, \n     the bill sets the maximum term of qualified zone academy \n     bonds at 15 years.\n       Qualified zone academy bonds can be used by school \n     districts, starting this year, for school improvement \n     purposes. The subsidy mechanism is the same as with the new \n     school modernization bonds--Federal tax credits to \n     bondholders in lieu of interest--but there are several \n     requirements associated with zone academy bonds. First, \n     schools must secure 10% of the funding for the school \n     improvement project from the private sector before issuing \n     the zone academy bonds. Second, the school must work with the \n     private sector to enhance the curriculum and increase \n     graduation rates and employment rates. Finally, in order to \n     be eligible, the school must either have 35% of students \n     eligible for the free- and reduced-price lunch program, or be \n     located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community.\n\n\n                                  cost\n\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the total cost of \n     this proposal is $3.3 billion/5 years and $9 billion/10 \n     years. The Department of Treasury estimates the cost is $5 \n     billion/5 years.\n       The proposal is fully paid for within President Clinton's \n     balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to be a sponsor of the \nPublic School Modernization Act of 1998, introduced today by Senator \nMoseley-Braun to help communities across the country in their struggle \nto modernize, repair, and rebuild their school facilities.\n  Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding. \nAntiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not \nequipped to handle the needs of modern education.\n  Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's \nschools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over \n$100 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state \nreport that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be \nreplaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as \nplumbing or heating defects. 80% have at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental factor.\n  In Boston, many schools cannot keep their heating systems functioning \nproperly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools complain that their heat is \nnot working.\n  The leaking roof at Revere High School is so serious that the new \nfire system is threatened. School Committee members estimate that \nfixing the roof will cost an additional $1 million, and they don't know \nwhere to get the money.\n  It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. \nBut now, because of escalating enrollments, those classrooms are \nincreasingly overcrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the \nnext few years, just to maintain current class sizes.\n  State governments and local communities are working hard to meet \nthese challenges. In Massachusetts, under the School Building \nAssistance Act, the state will pay 50-90% of the most severe needs. 124 \nschools now have approved projects, and are on a waiting list for \nfunding. The state share should be $91 million this year, but only $35 \nmillion is available. More than 50 other projects are awaiting \napproval. With that kind of deficit at the state and local level, it is \nclear that the federal government has a responsibility to act.\n  I am pleased that President Clinton has made this issue one of his \nhighest priorities. The legislation we are introducing will allow \nstates and local governments to issue $22 billion in bonds over the \nnext five years for school repairs and construction. Half of the amount \nwill go to state governments, and the other half will go to the 100 \ncities across the nation with the largest numbers of low-income \nchildren, including Boston and Springfield. The bonds will be interest-\nfree for the states and cities--Uncle Sam will pay the interest.\n  Under this plan, the state government in Massachusetts can issue $230 \nmillion in bonds for construction and renovation of school buildings. \nThe City of Boston can issue an additional $90 million, and the City of \nSpringfield can issue an additional $36 million, so that a total of \n$356 million in bonds will be available to help Massachusetts schools \nunder this legislation.\n  Good teaching and good schools are threatened if school buildings are \nunsafe and need repairs. President Clinton has made it a top priority \nto see that America has the best public schools in the world. And my \nDemocratic colleagues and I intend to do all we can to see that we \nreach that goal.\n  Investing in schools is one of the best investments America can \npossibly make. For schools across America, help is truly on the way--\nand it can't come a minute too soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1706. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to encourage \nStates to enact laws that ban the sale of alcohol through a drive-up or \ndrive-through sales window; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n           the drunk driving casualty prevention act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to discuss a very \nimportant matter relating to the safety of our Nation's streets and \nhighways, DWI-related injuries and fatalities. This is a problem that \nin spite of many prevention efforts, remains a serious concern.\n  The statistics are compelling. For example, on Thanksgiving, \nChristmas, New Years Eve, and New Years Day\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\n1996, there were 576 DWI-related fatalities on our Nation's highways. \nIn that same year, nearly 1.1 million people were injured in alcohol-\nrelated crashes. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death \nfor 15- to 20-year-olds. About 3 in 10 Americans will be involved in an \nalcohol-related crash at some time in their lives. Alcohol-related \ncrashes cost society $45 billion annually. To make matters worse, the \nloss of quality of life and pain and suffering costs total over $134 \nbillion annually.\n  My home state of New Mexico is not exempt. In fact, the National \nTraffic Safety Administration reports that New Mexico leads the country \nin DWI-related deaths per capita, a rate of 11.79 deaths per 100,000 \npeople. This rate is 19 percent higher than the No. 2 state, \nMississippi, and is more than twice the national rate of 5.05 deaths \nper 100,000.\n  Indeed, these statistics paint a very grim picture. What makes this \npicture even more tragic, Mr. President, is that DWI-related injuries \nand fatalities are preventable. It clearly is within our national \ninterest to do everything we can to reverse this course. One obvious \nway to prevent further deaths on our highways is to ensure the sobriety \nof drivers. That is why I proudly am co-sponsoring Senator Lautenberg's \nand Senator DeWine's bill to establish a national blood-alcohol content \nstandard of .08. Additionally, I am cosponsoring Senator Dorgan's bill \nto prohibit open containers of alcohol in automobiles. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to help pass these bills this year.\n  Another contributing factor to the problem that I believe would make \na significant difference if eliminated is the practice of selling \nalcohol beverages through drive-up sales windows. This practice only \nmakes it more easy for a drunk driver to purchase alcohol, and it \ncontributes heavily to the DWI-fatality rate in New Mexico. Eliminating \nthese drive-up liquor windows is essential to reducing these injuries \nand fatalities.\n  When I was in New Mexico 2 weeks ago, I held a series of seminars \nwith high school students from throughout the state, and I listened to \ntheir concerns about the problems in the state and in the country. One \nyoung man, Simon Goldfine, who is a student at Del Norte High School in \nAlbuquerque, agreed that the DWI rate in New Mexico is much too high, \nand one reason he explained is these drive-in liquor windows. Simon \nexplained that if a drunk person has to walk into a liquor store, it \nwill be easier to determine if he is drunk than if he simply sat in his \nvehicle. And Simon asked if something could be done to eliminate the \nwindows. Today I would like to tell Simon that we will do something \nabout it.\n  Today, at Simon's urging, I am introducing legislation, the Drunk \nDriving Casualty Prevention Act of 1998 to prohibit the sale of alcohol \nthrough drive-up sales windows.\n  Mr. President, I believe no one in America will disagree with Simon \nthat this ban will make a difference. According to one study, there are \n26 states that do not permit drive-up windows. In 1996, these states \nhad a 15 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the 24 \nstates that permit these windows. In the states with the ban, the \naverage rate was 4.6 per 100,000 people, as opposed to 5.46 in all \nother states. On a percentage basis, states with a ban had a 14.5 \npercent lower drunk driving fatality rate than states that permit sales \nwindows.\n\n  In 1996, comparing 19 western states in particular, the nine states \nwith a ban had a 31 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate \nthan the ten states that permit the windows.\n  In 1995, there were 231 drunk driving fatalities in New Mexico. Based \non the 14-percent lower drunk driving fatality rate, it is estimated \nthat closing drive-up liquor windows could save between 32 and 35 lives \nannually in New Mexico. Nowhere is it more true that if we can save one \nlife by closing these windows, we should do it.\n  The differences can be explained because there are three main \nbenefits to closing drive-up liquor windows: first, it is easier and \nmore accurate to check IDs over the sales counter. Minors have \ntestified that it is very easy to illegally purchase alcohol at a \ndrive-up window where it is difficult to determine their age. Second, \nit is easier to visually observe a customer for clues that they are \nimpaired by alcohol or other substance if they have to walk into a \nwell-lit establishment to make their purchase. Moreover, in one \nmunicipal court in New Mexico, 33 percent of DWI offenders reported \nhaving purchased their liquor at drive up windows. Some members of \nAlcoholics Anonymous say they now realize they could have known each \nother years earlier if they had only looked in their rear view mirror \nwhile in line at a drive-up window. And third, it sends a clear message \nto the population that drinking and driving will not be tolerated.\n  The Behavior Health Research Center of the Southwest conducted a \nstudy, the purpose of which was to determine the characteristics and \narrest circumstances of DWI offenders who bought alcohol at a drive-up \nliquor window compared to those who obtained alcohol elsewhere. Nearly \n70 percent of offenders studied reported having purchased the alcohol \nthey drank prior to arrest. Of those offenders, 42 percent bought \npackage liquor, and of those offenders, the drive-up window was the \npreferred place of purchase. Additionally, the study showed that drive-\nup window users were 68 percent more likely to have a serious alcohol \nproblem than other offenders. Drive-up window users also are 67 percent \nmore likely to be drinking in their vehicle prior to arrest than other \noffenders. This study showed that drive-up windows facilitate alcohol \nmisuse in vulnerable populations. The persons most affected are the \nhigh-risk problem drinkers, and when liquor availability is restricted, \nit is among those offenders that use, and consequently alcohol-related \noffenses, declines the most.\n  There are some that may contend that closing these windows is going \nto hurt small businesses. To the contrary. Closing these drive-up \nliquor windows will actually help increase profits, and it is very easy \nto explain. When a customer has to walk into an establishment, he or \nshe is very likely to purchase more than the original item. The \ncustomer is likely to pick up, for example, potato chips, sodas, and \nmagazines. This is not as likely to happen at the drive-up window \nsimply because the customers cannot see the items from their vehicle. \nIn McKinley County, New Mexico, which is the only county in New Mexico \nto ban these windows, businesses actually saw a jump in profits. Most \nimportantly, because of its DWI prevention strategy, McKinley County's \nalcohol-related injury and fatality rate dropped from 272 per 100,000 \nin 1989 to 183 per 100,000 in 1997.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a great opportunity here to reduce \nDWI injuries and fatalities. Therefore, I plan to offer this bill as an \namendment to the ISTEA legislation, and I urge my Senate colleagues to \njoin me.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for improved safety of imported foods; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                the safety of imported food act of 1998\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Safety \nof Imported Food Act of 1998.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this \nimportant legislation to provide the American people with safer \nimported foods. This legislation is part of President Clinton's food \nsafety initiative. Its purpose is to provide for improved safety of \nimported food consistent with U.S. food safety requirements.\n  The bill expands FDA authority to ensure the safety of imported foods \nin two very important ways. It authorizes the Secretary to deny entry \nof imported food products if it is determined that the products do not \nmeet the U.S. food safety requirements. It also authorizes the \nsecretary to consider, in determining whether imported food products \nmeet U.S. food safety requirements, a refusal to allow necessary \ninspections or testing.\n  Our nation's food supply has gone global. Once our imported food \nconsisted mainly of bulk staples. Now we import growing quantities of \nfresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and many other foods. Thirty-\neight percent of all fruit and 12% of all vegetables consumed in the \nU.S. are imported. Imported food entries doubled in the last 7 years \nand a 30% increase is expected by 2002.\n  We have been put on alert by recent cases of food borne illness. \nMichigan school children were sickened by imported strawberries \ncontaminated by Hepatitis A. There have been widespread reports of \ncyclospora from imported raspberries. Soft cheese from Europe has been \nfound to be contaminated with listeria and salmonella. And radish seed \nsprouts from the Far East have been found infected with Ecoli 0157:H7.\n  The impact of unsafe food is staggering. As many as 33 million people \nbecome ill each year from contaminated meat, poultry and produce. Over \n$3 billion are spent in hospitalization due to food related illness. \nAdded to that are the losses in productivity.\n  Now that our food supply has gone global, our food safety measures \nmust go global as well. Current authority requires FDA to rely on \ninspection and testing at the border to ensure that safety standards \nare met. With the ever increasing quantities of imported foods, it is \nimpossible for FDA to inspect more than a small percentage of \nshipments. Additionally, such inspections are often impractical, given \nthe perishable nature of many of the imported foods. The FDA may also \nplace more general restrictions on imports, but only after a problem \nhas surfaced, often after a major outbreak of illness has occurred. \nBoth of these types of measures address the problem of unsafe food \nreactively.\n  The ``Safety of Imported Food Act'' places the emphasis on the \nunderlying food system of control at the food source, a more preventive \nmeans of addressing food safety. It focuses on the conditions that \ncause problems rather than the problem once it has occurred. By \nallowing FDA to consider the food safety system in place, the bill \nprovides the means by which FDA can use its limited resources more \nefficiently.\n  There are several things this bill does not do. It does not shut our \nborders or immediately deny entry of imported food upon enactment. It \ndoes not require inspections or access without consent. In fact, it \ndoes not create any new inspection authority, either foreign or \ndomestic.\n  The bill is short, but what it will achieve is significant. It will \nprovide FDA with authority to ensure that all imported foods meet the \nU.S. level of protection, consistent with rights and obligations under \ninternational trade agreements. It provides FDA with a more effective \nenforcement tool and the ability to use its resources more effectively. \nUnder the bill, foreign producers may have an incentive to upgrade \ntheir food safety systems. Most importantly, the bill will provide the \nAmerican public with greater assurance that imported foods meet the \nsame safety standards as do foods produced in the U.S.\n  I wish to commend President Clinton and Vice President Gore in making \nfood safety a top priority. By strengthening the food supply both here \nand abroad, I believe we make the world a safer place to live. I look \nforward to the Senate's support of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Robb, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Reed and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1708. A bill to improve education; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n  the revitalize and empower public school communities to upgrade for \n                         long-term success act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of my \ncolleagues, Senators Murray, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Dodd, Boxer, \nBreaux, Robb, Levin, Lautenberg, Glenn, Kerry, Feinstein, Reid, Reed, \nBryan and myself, legislation that puts the spotlight directly on our \nefforts to strengthen and modernize our nation's public schools.\n  We recognize that a strong public education system is the key to \nAmerica's future. Our economic prosperity, our position as a world \nleader, our system of law, and our very democracy require that all of \nour children have access to the best possible education.\n  We have heard a lot over the last 20 years about the things that are \nwrong with education in this country, and there's no question that we \nneed to do some things better. We just learned the other day, for \nexample, that our 12th graders are behind the rest of the world in math \nand science achievement. That is unacceptable and must be corrected. \nBut there are signs that we have been able to make some progress. Our \nfourth-graders are well above the average in mathematics and near the \ntop in science. And there are innovative programs springing up around \nthe country that are taking advantage of federal funds to make \nremarkable changes in the way public schools are run. The City of \nChicago, for example, has taken dramatic steps including ending social \npromotions, raising their standards, and providing extra help to make \nsure that children can achieve those standards. Parents and community \nmembers are more involved , and, while it's too early to see results in \nterms of test scores, there are dramatic improvements in attendance. \nThose who are involved are amazed at their progress.\n  Despite many local improvements, our schools still face many \nchallenges. Student enrollments are at record high levels and are \nexpected to increase over\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nthe next decade. This growth, combined with aging buildings and the \ndemand of technology, is straining many school facilities. Growing \nenrollments and teacher retirements also mean that more than 2 million \nnew teachers will be needed over the next decade. The quality of those \nteachers will have a significant impact on student achievement levels. \nRecent advancements require better integration of technology in our \npublic schools and better training for instructors in using technology \neffectively in the classroom. While many schools have implemented \nreforms and student performance is improving in some communities, too \nmany children, particularly those from low-income families, are still \nnot learning up to their potential.\n  The legislation we are introducing today--the RESULTS Act--will \naddresses these issues in 5 ways:\n  (1) We create a new tax credit to help communities offset the cost of \nschool construction and modernization;\n  (2) We provide funds to help communities reduce class sizes in grades \n1 through 3 by hiring and training 100,000 new teachers;\n  (3) We help communities establish additional after-school programs \nfor school-aged children;\n  (4) We advance the federal commitment to integrate technology into \nthe classroom and provide resources to train teachers to use that \ntechnology effectively; and\n  (5) We include the President's initiative to provide grants to high-\npoverty urban and rural school districts that are serious about \ncarrying out standards-based reforms, such as those occurring in \nChicago, to improve student achievement.\n  Mr. President, Democrats recognize that the federal government has an \nimportant role to play in encouraging all Americans--including parents, \nteachers, business and community leaders, and elected officials at all \nlevels of government--to work in partnership to strengthen and \nrevitalize our public schools. Our nation's commitment to a strong \nsystem of public education has made our country great. We renew that \ncommitment today with this plan to prepare our students to lead this \ncountry into the 21st Century. I thank my colleagues who have worked \nwith me to demonstrate our resolve to modernize and strengthen our \npublic schools and invite our colleagues across the aisle to make the \nsame commitment and join us to enact the important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a title-by-title explanation of the \nbill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            S. 1708--Summary\n\n        TITLE I--HELPING COMMUNITIES RENOVATE AMERICA'S SCHOOLS\n\n       The General Accounting Office has found severe school \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States. More than 14 \n     million children attend schools in need of extensive repair \n     or replacement. The repair backlog totals at least $112 \n     billion, and this does not include expansions needed to \n     accommodate enrollment increases, class size reductions, and \n     integration of technology in the classroom. The problem \n     transcends demographic and geographic boundaries. For 38 \n     percent of urban schools, 30 percent of rural schools, and 29 \n     percent of suburban schools, at least 1 building is in need \n     of extensive repair or should be completely replaced.\n       The condition of school facilities has a direct effect on \n     the safety of students and teachers, and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Researchers at Georgetown University found \n     the performance of students assigned to schools in poor \n     condition falls 10.9 percentage points below those attending \n     classes in buildings in excellent condition. Other studies \n     have demonstrated up to a 20 percent improvement in test \n     scores when students were moved from a dilapidated facility \n     to a new facility.\n       This Title includes 2 initiatives to expand tax incentives \n     to help states and school districts address the school \n     construction backlog.\n\n\n                  Qualified School Modernization Bonds\n\n       State and local governments will issue qualified school \n     modernization bonds to fund the construction, modernization, \n     and rehabilitation of public schools. Bondholders will \n     receive annual Federal income tax credits in lieu of \n     interest. The maximum term of the bonds will be 15 years.\n       A total of $9.7 billion of authority to issue qualified \n     school modernization bonds is allocated in 1999 and 2000--50 \n     percent to states and 50 percent to the 100 largest school \n     districts. The authority allocated to the 100 largest \n     districts will be based on the amounts of Federal assistance \n     received under Title I, Basic Grants. In addition, the \n     Secretary of Education will have the authority to designate \n     25 additional districts to receive bond authority directly \n     from the Federal government. The authority allocated to \n     States will also be based on the State's share of Title I, \n     Basic Grants, excluding the 100 large districts and any \n     others designated by the Secretary to receive bond authority \n     directly from the Federal government.\n       I should note that I would prefer to provide more funds to \n     the states to make sure that rural areas, many of which are \n     severely limited financially, have access to the funds they \n     need to modernize their schools as well. However, this bill \n     reflects a joint House and Senate Democrats and White House \n     initiative, so I have not made that change in this bill.\n       To be treated as a qualified school modernization bond \n     program, 3 requirements must be met. First, the Department of \n     Education must approve a school construction plan of the \n     state, territory, or school district that: (1) demonstrates a \n     survey of the construction and renovation needs in the \n     jurisdiction has been undertaken; (2) describes how the \n     jurisdiction will assure that bond proceeds are used for the \n     purposes of this proposal; and (3) explains how it will use \n     its allocation to assist localities that lack the fiscal \n     capacity to issue bonds on their own. Second, the issuing \n     government must receive an allocation for the bond from the \n     State, territory, or eligible district. Third, 95 percent \n     or more of the bond proceeds must be used to construct or \n     rehabilitate public school facilities.\n\n\n                      qualified zone academy bonds\n\n       The bill makes 3 changes to the existing qualified zone \n     academy bonds (created in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997). \n     First, the bill increases the 1999 bond cap from $400 million \n     to $1.4 billion and adds an additional $1.4 billion of bond \n     cap in 2000. Second, the bill expands the list of permissible \n     uses of proceeds to include new school construction. Third, \n     the bill sets the maximum term of qualified zone academy \n     bonds at 15 years. The subsidy mechanism is the same as with \n     the new school modernization bonds--Federal tax credits to \n     bondholders in lieu of interest--but there are several \n     requirements associated with zone academy bonds. First, \n     schools must secure 10 percent of the funding for the school \n     improvement project from the private sector before issuing \n     the zone academy bonds. Second, the school must work with the \n     private sector to enhance the curriculum and increase \n     graduation and employment rates. Finally, in order to be \n     eligible, the school must either have 35 percent of students \n     eligible for the free- and reduced-price lunch program, or be \n     located in an Empowerment zone or enterprise community.\n\n                     TITLE II--REDUCING CLASS-SIZE\n\n       Qualified teachers in small classes can provide students \n     with more individualized attention, spend more time on \n     instruction and less on other administrative tasks, cover \n     more material more effectively, and work more closely with \n     parents. Research has shown that students attending small \n     classes in the early grades make better progress than \n     students in larger classes, and that those achievement gains \n     persist through at least the eighth grade. The benefits are \n     greatest for low-achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city \n     children. Smaller classes also allow teachers to identify and \n     work earlier with students who have learning disabilities, \n     potentially reducing those students' need for special \n     education in later grades.\n       Efforts to reduce class sizes are likely to be successful \n     only if well-qualified teachers are hired to fill additional \n     classroom positions, and if teachers receive intensive, \n     ongoing training in teaching effectively in smaller classroom \n     settings. Currently, 1 in 4 high school teachers do not have \n     a major or minor in the main subject they teach. This is true \n     for more than 30 percent of math teachers. In schools with \n     the highest minority enrollments, students have less than a \n     50 percent chance of getting a science or math teacher who \n     holds a degree in that field.\n       Over the next decade, we will need to hire over 2 million \n     teachers to meet increasing student enrollments and teacher \n     retirements. Comprehensive improvements in teacher \n     preparation and development are needed to ensure students' \n     academic success. Too many teachers graduating today have \n     insufficient experience in the classroom or are unprepared to \n     integrate technology into their lessons. The federal \n     government can assist in this effort by providing resources \n     to help communities reduce class sizes and improve the \n     quality of teacher training.\n       This program is designed to help states and local \n     educational agencies recruit, train, and hire 100,000 \n     additional qualified teachers in order to reduce class sizes \n     nationally, in grades 1 to 3 to an average of 18 students per \n     classroom. In addition, the program provides resources to \n     improve small classroom teaching in the early grades so that \n     all students can learn to read well and independently by the \n     end of the third grade. Funding of $1.1 billion will be \n     appropriated in the first year and $7.3 billion over 5 years.\n       I want to emphasize that our proposal is aimed at improving \n     the quality of teaching, not just the quantity of teachers. \n     This is critical if we expect to see improvements in student \n     achievement.\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\n                 TITLE III--EXPANDING AFTER-SCHOOL CARE\n\n       Many children spend more of their waking hours without \n     supervision and constructive activity than they do in school. \n     As many as 5 million children are home alone after school \n     each week. Too many of these children are tempted during this \n     time to try cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and engage in \n     other dangerous activities. The law enforcement community, \n     which has been very active in their efforts to focus our \n     attention on this problem, reports that most juvenile \n     involvement in crime--either committing them or becoming \n     victims themselves--occurs between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children \n     who attend quality after-school programs, on the other hand, \n     tend to do better in school, get along better with their \n     peers, and are less likely to engage in delinquent behaviors. \n     Unfortunately, only one-third of the schools in low-income \n     neighborhoods and half of the schools in affluent areas \n     currently offer after-school programs. Expansion of both \n     school-based and community-based after-school programs is key \n     to providing safe, constructive environments for children and \n     helping communities reduce the incidence of juvenile \n     delinquency and crime.\n       This bill expands the 21st Century Learning Centers Act and \n     provides $200 million each fiscal year to help communities \n     develop after-school care programs. Grantees will be required \n     to offer expanded learning opportunities for children and \n     youth in the community. Funds could be used to provide:\n       (1) literacy programs;\n       (2) integrated education, health, social service, \n     recreational or cultural programs;\n       (3) summer and weekend school programs;\n       (4) nutrition and health programs;\n       (5) expanded library services;\n       (6) telecommunications and technology education programs;\n       (7) services for individuals with disabilities;\n       (8) job skills assistance;\n       (9) mentoring;\n       (10) academic assistance; and\n       (11) drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities.\n       While expanding after-school programs in public schools \n     will help hundreds of thousands of children. It is important \n     to note that many other community-based organizations, \n     including YMCAs, and Campfire Boys and Girls, provide high \n     quality programs for children as well. These programs also \n     need and deserve federal assistance, since it is unlikely \n     that schools will be able to meet the needs of all children. \n     While school-based care is the focus of this legislation, \n     many Democratic senators and I also strongly support \n     providing additional resources for after-school care through \n     other programs, and we would also like to see greater \n     coordination among all federal, state, and local programs in \n     order to maximize the effective use of public resources and \n     encourage more collaborative efforts at the local level.\n\n    TITLE IV--PROMOTING EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM\n\n       Americans agree that integrating technology effectively in \n     the classroom must be a central component of preparing \n     students for the 21st Century. Fully 74 percent of Americans \n     believe that computers improve the quality of education and \n     half believe their public schools offer too little access to \n     adequate computers.\n       The importance of strengthening students' technology skills \n     cannot be underestimated. Nearly one quarter of the jobs \n     added to our economy in the past year were in technology-\n     based occupations. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all jobs \n     in the nation will require skills in computer and network \n     use. Just 22 percent of all workers have those skills today.\n       Incorporating technology effectively in the classroom has \n     been proven to improve students' mastery of basic skills, \n     test scores, writing, and engagement in school. With these \n     gains comes a decrease in dropout rates, as well as fewer \n     attendance and discipline problems.\n       We are making progress. While only 35 percent of schools \n     had access to the internet in 1996, now 78 percent are on-\n     line. The Schools and Libraries Universal Service Fund, or \n     ``E-rate,'' will provide up to $2.25 billion annually in \n     discounts to assure every American school and library access \n     to telecommunications services, internal connection, and \n     Internet access. More than 20,000 schools and libraries have \n     already applied to participate in this program. The National \n     Governors' Association has urged Congress to maintain the \n     integrity of the E-rate, and provide adequate funding for \n     this important program now.\n       Many states and localities are taking good advantage of \n     other Federal programs such as the Technology Literacy \n     Challenge Fund, Technology Innovation Challenge Grants, Star \n     Schools and other programs to obtain equipment and wire \n     schools. Additional resources are needed to continue this \n     effort as well as help train teachers in the effective use of \n     technology in the classroom.\n       This legislation states that it is in the Nation's interest \n     to invest at least $4 billion in funding for Department of \n     Education technology programs between fiscal years 1999 and \n     2003.\n       We also require schools and libraries participating in the \n     E-rate to establish policies to limit access to inappropriate \n     material. Our bill also includes several measures to increase \n     Federal resources to improve professional development and \n     help teachers integrate technology into the classroom. Under \n     our proposal, 30 percent of National Challenge Grant for \n     Technology grants will be directed to partnerships that are \n     focused on developing effective teaching strategies. To \n     improve training and preparation of teaching candidates and \n     new teachers, the Secretary will be authorized to award \n     grants to partnerships that train candidates and education \n     school faculty in the effective use and integration of \n     technology in teaching academic subjects.\n       The bill establishes $75 million in grants to be managed \n     jointly by the Office of Education Research and Innovation \n     and the National Science Foundation to support innovative \n     research in education technology, development of research \n     results in partnerships with the private sector, and \n     evaluation that identifies the most effective approaches to \n     implementing education technology.\n\n                  TITLE V--EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES\n\n       Students in schools where a high proportion of children \n     come from lower-income families begin school behind their \n     peers academically and, too often, never catch up with their \n     peers. Later on, they are less likely to go to college and \n     more likely to experience unemployment. High levels of \n     poverty and the lack of resources has resulted in watered \n     down curricula, lowered expectations for their students, and \n     fewer qualified teachers. These challenges are compounded in \n     high-poverty rural schools because of their isolation and \n     small size.\n       Some high-poverty schools have shown, however, that \n     students can achieve more if the schools adopt high standards \n     for students, teachers and administrators, provide extra help \n     to students, adopt proven systemic reforms, and hold schools, \n     staff, and students accountable for the results.\n       This program will provide $200 million in FY1999 and $1.5 \n     billion over 5 years to high-poverty urban and rural school \n     districts that are serious about carrying out standards-based \n     reform plans to improve the academic achievement. Grants will \n     be awarded to approximately 50 districts that:\n       (1) agree to adopt high standards, test student \n     achievement, and provide help to students, teachers and \n     schools who need it;\n       (2) ensure quality teaching, challenging curricula, and \n     extended learning time; and\n       (3) end social promotion and take steps to turn around \n     failing schools.\n       Lessons learned from these districts will be shared with \n     schools across the country. Schools will be encouraged to \n     provide students and parents with school report cards and \n     expanded choices with public education.\n       Awards will be made according to a competitive, peer review \n     process. Consortia of large and small urban areas, and rural \n     school districts will be selected to participate.\n       Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are also \n     eligible.\n       Successful applicants will have broad-based partnerships to \n     support their reforms, including parents, teachers, local \n     government, business, civic groups, institutions of higher \n     education and other members of the community.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Clinton and Democrats in \nCongress have made it a top priority to see that America has the best \npublic schools in the world--and we intend to do all we can to see that \nwe reach that goal.\n  The nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class \nteachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many \ncommunities across the country fail to achieve that standard. The \nlatest international survey of math and science achievement confirms \nthe urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, \nteachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's twelfth \ngraders ranked among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this \ninternational survey of math and science.\n  The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and \nlearning for all students across the nation. That means:\n  We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards.\n  We must test students early, so that we know where they need help in \ntime to make that help effective.\n  We must provide better training for current and new teachers, so that \nthey are well-prepared to teach to high standards.\n  We must reduce class size, to help students obtain the individual \nattention they need.\n  We must provide after-school programs to make constructive \nalternatives available to students and keep them off the streets, away \nfrom drugs, and out of trouble.\n  We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the \nnation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-\nto-date facilities.\n  I will do all I can to see that the ``RESULTS! Act''--``An Act to \nRevitalize and Empower Schools to Upgrade\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nfor Long-Term Success''--is approved by Congress. The bill will help \nmodernize and expand the nation's schools, reduce class size, expand \nafter-school care, improve education technology in schools, and create \neducation opportunity zones in communities across the country.\n  A necessary foundation for a successful school is a qualified teacher \nin every classroom to make sure young children receive the individual \nattention they need. That's why a pillar of the Democratic agenda is to \nhelp bring 100,000 new teachers to schools and reduce class size in the \nelementary grades.\n  Research has shown that students attending small classes in the early \ngrades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The \nbenefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income \nchildren. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work \neffectively with students who have learning disabilities, and reduce \nthe need for special education in later grades.\n  Many states are also considering proposals to reduce class size--but \nyou can't reduce class size without the ability to hire additional \nqualified teachers to fill the additional classrooms.\n  Too many schools are already understaffed. During the next decade, \nrising student enrollments and massive teacher retirements mean that \nthe nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. Between 1995 and \n1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 students, \ncausing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including teacher \nretirements.\n  The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire \nuncertified teachers, and ask certified teachers to teach outside their \narea of expertise. Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers \nenter the classroom. One in four new teachers does not fully meet state \ncertification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no \nteacher training at all. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% \nchance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In \nMassachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have \na minor degree in their field.\n  Our proposal will reduce class size in grades K-3 to a nationwide \naverage of 18 by hiring more teachers. Under our proposal, states and \nschool districts will be able to recruit, train and hire 100,000 \nadditional qualified teachers in order to reduce class size and improve \nteaching and learning in these early grades. In the first year, \nMassachusetts will receive $22 million to support these efforts. We \nwill also be working through the Higher Education Act to improve \nteacher training at colleges and universities.\n  Our proposal will also help schools meet their urgent needs for \nconstruction, modernization, and renovation. Schools across the nation \nface serious problems. Many are overcrowded. Many others have \nantiquated facilities suffering from physical decay, with no ability to \nhandle the needs of modern education. Across the country, 14 million \nchildren in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard \nbuildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental condition.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state \nreport that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be \nreplaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as \nplumbing or heating defects. Eighty percent have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental factor.\n\n  It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. \nBut now, because of escalating enrollments, those classrooms are \nincreasingly overcrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the \nnext few years, just to maintain current class sizes.\n  It will take over $100 billion just to repair existing facilities. \nObviously, the federal government cannot do the whole job. But states \nand communities across the country are working hard to meet these \nneeds, and the federal government should do more to help.\n  This year, Revere, Massachusetts passed a $2.2 million bond issue to \nrenovate the roofs on three of its seven schools. After these \nrenovations were completed, a fourth school's roof started to leak. The \nleak is so serious that the school's new fire system is threatened. \nSchool Committee members estimate that fixing the roof will cost an \nadditional $1 million, and they don't know where to get the money.\n  Last year, half of Worcester's schools were not equipped with the \nwiring and infrastructure to handle modern technology.\n  Enrollment in Springfield schools has increased by over 1,500 \nstudents, or 6 percent, in the last two years, forcing teachers to hold \nclasses in storage rooms, large closets, and in basements.\n  Our proposal will authorize states and local governments to issue $22 \nbillion in bonds for school repairs and construction. Part of the \namount will go to state governments and part will go to the 100 cities \nacross the nation with the largest numbers of low-income children, \nincluding Boston and Springfield. The bonds will be interest-free for \nthe states and cities--Uncle Sam will pay the interest.\n  Our legislation also addresses the urgent need to provide effective \nactivities for children of all ages during the many hours each week \nwhen they are not in school.\n  Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are \nleft home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the \nhours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children unsupervised are more likely \nto be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of \nbehavior.\n  Our goal in this legislation is to encourage communities to develop \nactivities that will engage children and keep them out of trouble. \nCrime survivors, law enforcement representatives, prosecutors, and \neducators have all joined together in calling for a substantial federal \ninvestment in after-school programs.\n  Clearly, such financial assistance is needed in states across the \ncountry. Too often, parents cannot afford the thousands of dollars a \nyear required to pay for after-school care, if it exists at all. In \nMassachusetts, 4,000 eligible children are on waiting lists for after-\nschool care, and tens of thousands more have parents who have given up \non getting help. Nationwide, half a million eligible children are on \nwaiting lists for federal child care subsidies. The need for increased \nopportunities is obvious and this legislation attempts to meet it.\n  Our bill will provide $1 billion over the next 5 years for after-\nschool programs, to enable public school districts in partnership with \ncommunity-based organizations to bring millions more children, \nincluding disabled children, into such programs, and make schools into \ncommunity learning centers as well.\n  This proposal will help communities to increase the availability of \nafter-school programs. It will support efforts in Boston to make after-\nschool services available to as many children as possible. Boston's 2-\nto-6 Initiative will serve an additional 3,000 young people over the \nnext four years, keep school buildings open for city programs and non-\nprofit programs, and challenge private sector leaders to double the \nnumber of available after-school jobs to 1,000 over the next two years.\n  The proposed expansion of the 21st Century Community Learning Center \nprogram will enable schools and communities to create programs that \nmeet their after-school needs--and obtain the extra resources required \nto make it happen.\n  Our bill also proposes to help failing schools implement the reforms \nthat they know will turn them around. Too many schools now struggle \nwith watered-down curricula, low expectations, fewer qualified \nteachers, and fewer resources than other schools.\n  Under the Education Opportunity Zones proposal, these school \ndistricts will get the extra resources they need in order to increase \nachievement, raise standards, end social promotion, upgrade teacher \nskills, and strengthen ties between the schools, the parents, and the \ncommunity as a whole.\n  The bill also calls for continued investment in education technology, \nso that cutting-edge technology will be available to as many students \nas possible. That means we must continue to invest more in computers, \nsoftware, and high-tech training for teachers, so that every child has \nthe opportunity to use technology as an effective learning tool.\n  Investing in students and teachers and schools is one of the best \ninvestments America can make. For schools\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nacross America, help can't come a minute too soon, and I urge Congress \nto enact this legislation as expeditiously as possible. The message to \nschools across the country today is clear--help is finally on the way.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, for assembling this important legislation, and \nI want to thank President Clinton for articulating a vision for America \nthat includes a significant federal commitment toward improving the \nquality and accessibility of education for all Americans. The RESULTS \nAct is designed to help fulfill that commitment, and represents the \ntype of action this Congress should take to prepare America for the \n21st century.\n  I visited a number of schools in Illinois over the past several \nmonths, and talked with parents, teachers, children, and school \nofficials at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. I \nfound that without exception, education is at the top of their minds. \nIllinoisans, like most Americans, support policies designed to help \nensure that America remains preeminent in the intensely competitive, \nglobal economy of the 21st century.\n  Last year, this Congress took historic measures to improve the \naccessibility of quality higher education, with the enactment of \nPresident Clinton's HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits. \nWe also restored the student loan interest deduction, so that graduates \nnow receive a Federal income tax deduction when they make interest \npayments on their student loans. I intend to work this year to broaden \nthe deduction we created last year, so that more former students, \nstruggling under a burden of debt that has grown enormously in recent \nyears, can make ends meet.\n  Now, this Congress must act to improve the quality of elementary and \nsecondary education available to our children. We must act to ensure \nthat as we approach the 21st century, no child is left behind. We must \nact to ensure that no child is forced to try to learn in an overcrowded \nclassroom or a crumbling school, and that every child has access to the \nkinds of technologies he or she will need to understand to compete in \nthe next millennium.\n  The RESULTS Act will help States and school districts improve their \nschools for the 21st century, and includes a number of very important \nprovisions, including a plan to create a new partnership between the \nFederal government and State and local governments to rebuild and \nmodernize our school buildings. Under this new proposal, States and \nschool districts would be able to issue new, zero-interest bonds to \nmodernize and build schools. Bondholders would receive Federal income \ntax credits in lieu of interest payments. Using this mechanism, the \nFederal government can leverage almost $22 billion worth of school \nimprovements, at a cost of only $3.3 billion over the next five years, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost $112 \nbillion to bring existing school buildings up to code--to patch the \nleaky roofs, replace the broken windows, fix the plumbing, and make \nother needed repairs. That price tag, as enormous as it sounds, does \nnot include the cost of building new schools to accommodate the record \nnumbers of children who are crowding our schools, nor the cost of \nupgrading classrooms for modern computers.\n  This problem has overwhelmed the fiscal capacities of state and local \nauthorities. It is a problem affecting all areas of the country, \nbecause it is a direct result of the antiquated way we pay for public \neducation in this country. The local property tax, which made sense as \na funding mechanism when wealth was accumulated in the form of land, no \nlonger works as a means of funding major capital investments. In urban, \nrural, and suburban schools all across the country, the magnitude of \nthe crumbling schools problem has dwarfed local financing capabilities. \nIt is a problem that directly affects the ability of students to learn, \nteachers to teach, and schools to implement the kinds of educational \nreform efforts that parents are demanding to improve the quality of \neducation in this country.\n  According to academic data correlating building conditions and \nstudent achievement, children in these decrepit classrooms have less of \na chance. Their education is at risk. They will be less able to compete \nin the 21st century job market. Ultimately, we will all come out on the \nlosing end. America can't compete if its students can't learn, and our \nstudents can't learn if their schools are falling down.\n  The legislation being introduced today gives Congress a historic \nopportunity to jump start the process of rebuilding, renovating, \nmodernizing, and constructing new schools to meet the needs of all our \nchildren into the 21st century. The RESULTS Act engages the federal \ngovernment in the support of elementary and secondary education in a \nway that preserves local control of education. In the same way the \nfederal government helps finance highways, but the state and local \ngovernments decide where the roads go, the federal government can help \nstate and local authorities rebuild our schools. America has a $112 \nbillion infrastructure problem that makes it increasingly difficult for \nour students to learn the skills they will need to keep America \ncompetitive in the 21st century. Now is the time for Congress to act.\n  I want to congratulate the Democratic leader again for his work on \nthis bill, as well as President Clinton and Secretary Riley, who helped \nshape many of its provisions. I hope the 105th Congress will approve \nthis legislation quickly, and renew the promise embodied in the words \nof the 19th century American poet James Russell Lowell, who wrote: ``. \n. . [I]t was in making education not only common to all, but in some \nsense compulsory on all, that the destiny of the free republics of \nAmerica was practically settled.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1709. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Labor to provide \nassistance to States for the implementation of enhanced pre-vocational \ntraining programs, in order to improve the likelihood of enabling \nwelfare recipients to make transitions from public assistance to \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n         the job preparation and retention training act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nvocational training legislation, entitled the ``Job Preparation and \nRetention Training Act of 1998,'' which is designed to respond to the \nneed for pre-vocational training assistance to enable welfare \nrecipients to make the transition from public assistance to work.\n  I believe that the historic 1996 welfare reform law will serve the \nAmerican people well by ending systemic dependence and creating a \nprogram that emphasizes employment--gainful and permanent employment--\nby giving the States greater flexibility in administering their \nprograms. We are already hearing about the rise in employment rates and \nthe substantial drops in State welfare rolls.\n  While many Americans have effectively made the transition from \nwelfare to work, a need exists for skills training to enable many of \nthe individuals who have been long-term welfare recipients to make \ntransitions into unsubsidized employment that provides career potential \nand enables the individuals to achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe that it \nwould be worthwhile to recognize the need for pre-vocational training, \na type of training that is not formally offered by the U.S. Department \nof Labor.\n  Current Federal law does not adequately address the tremendously \nnegative effect of unfavorable environmental and cultural factors on \nthe ability of such individuals to obtain and retain gainful \nemployment.\n  I believe that a Federal commitment to the development of pre-\nvocational training programs should focus on: improving the job \nreadiness of individuals who are welfare recipients and preparing the \nindividual psychologically and attitudinally for employment.\n  The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding for States to \nenroll chronic welfare dependents into a training program which would \nprovide the necessary skills to locate and maintain employment. The \nSecretary of Labor would award States grants on\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\na competitive basis for use in teaching individuals to fulfill \nworkplace responsibilities such as punctuality, literacy, \ncommunication, and other survival skills. Once an adult has completed \nthis short period of training, he or she would be prepared to get the \nmost out of their job training and unsubsidized employment \nopportunities. The $50 million authorization would be provided for each \nof the next two years. The sunset will provide a chance to determine \nthe program's efficacy. Further, training funds would be limited to no \nmore than $1,200 per individual, which I am advised is a realistic cost \nof skills training and job placement programs.\n  Many community-based organizations across the country have already \nrecognized this need and are providing pre-vocational training. In this \nlimited context, we have found that prevocational trainees have fared \nmuch better in the economy. I am advised that one such community-based \norganization, the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America, \nInc., has found that the average hourly wage of trainees prior to pre-\nvocational training was $3.70, not even a minimum wage. After receiving \npre-vocational training, these same participants started earning an \naverage of $8.00 an hour. Further, pre-vocational training resulted in \nan 85% placement rate into better-paying jobs.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation. \nThis bill is intended to enhance welfare reform and it does not tamper \nwith the positive changes in existing law, such as the five-year time \nlimit. Simply, I am asking for continued federal involvement in ending \ngenerational welfare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Robb, Mr. Warner, Mr. Sarbanes, and Ms. Mikulski) (by \n        request):\n  S. 1710. A bill to provide for the correction of retirement coverage \nerrors under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States Code; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n          the retirement coverage error correction act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, at the request of \nthe Administration, a bill to provide for the correction of retirement \ncoverage errors under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode--specifically, current and former federal employees who should \nhave been placed in the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), but \nwere misclassified as Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or CSRS \nOffset.\n  The federal government's transition from CSRS to FERS began in 1984. \nAs government agencies carried out the complex job of applying two sets \nof transition rules, mistakes were made, and thousands of employees \nwere placed in the wrong retirement system--many learning that their \npensions would be less than expected. The Administration's proposal, \n``The Federal Retirement Coverage Corrections Act,'' would provide \nemployees with a choice between corrected retirement coverage and the \ncoverage the employee expected to receive, without disturbing Social \nSecurity coverage law.\n  I think this bill deserves the careful consideration of the Senate. \nAs Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover the subject, I will try to ensure a thorough review of all the \noptions for dealing with this issue.\n  Among the provisions of the bill, are the following:\n  (1) Generally, errors of less than 3 years would not be eligible for \ncorrective action.\n  (2) Social Security-covered employees who were erroneously CSRS \ncovered or CSRS Offset covered, may elect to be retroactively under \neither CSRS Offset or Social Security-only coverage.\n  (3) CSRS covered, CSRS Offset covered or Social Security-only covered \nemployees who were erroneously FERS covered will be deemed to have \nelected FERS coverage and will remain covered by FERS, unless the \nemployee declines it.\n  (3) Generally, FERS covered employees, former employees, and \nannuitants who were erroneously CSRS covered or CSRS Offset covered, \nmay elect retroactive coverage under either CSRS Offset or FERS \ncoverage. However, this election may not be available or may be subject \nto adjustment under certain very limited circumstances.\n  (5) A Thrift Plan make-whole provision to provide the earnings that \nare now disallowed on the employee's make-up contributions.\n  (6) Provisions are included to deal with the retroactive application \nof Social Security upon the correction of a retirement coverage error \nin which an employee was erroneously covered by CSRS.\n  (7) The Director of OPM is given discretionary authority to waive \ntime limits, reimburse necessary and reasonable expenses and compensate \nlosses, and waive specified repayments; and finally\n  (8) Costs of the ``Retirement Coverage Error Correction Act'' would \nbe paid from the Civil Service Retirement Fund, and OPM would be \nauthorized to spend money from that Fund to administer the Act.\n  I invite Senators to join in this effort to address a serious problem \naffecting many federal employees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Retirement Coverage Error \n     Correction Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress finds that a number of Government employees \n     have been placed under erroneous retirement coverage during \n     the transition from the Civil Service Retirement System to \n     the Federal Employees Retirement System. When these errors \n     are of significant duration, they adversely affect an \n     employee's ability to plan for retirement. It is the purpose \n     of this Act to provide a remedy that treats all such \n     individuals fairly and reasonably, and demonstrates the \n     Government's concern for its employees who have been \n     disadvantaged by a Government error in their retirement \n     coverage. Affected employees should have a choice between \n     corrected retirement coverage and the benefit the employee \n     would have received under the erroneous coverage, without \n     disturbing Social Security coverage law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Such amount shall represent \n     earnings, on such retroactive contributions, during the \n     period of the retirement coverage error and continuing up to \n     the date on which the amount is paid by the Director (and \n     based on distributions from the employee's Thrift Savings \n     Plan account).

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided herein, this Act shall be \n     effective on the date of enactment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Retirement Coverage Error Correction Act of 1998--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       The first section provides a title for the bill, the \n     ``Retirement Coverage Error Correction Act of 1998''.\n       Section 2 explains the Congressional findings and purpose \n     of the Act.\n       Section 3 defines the terms used in the Act. Among the \n     definitions, ``retirement coverage error'' means erroneous \n     coverage that was in effect for at least 3 years of service \n     after December 31, 1986.\n       Section 4 provides that, except as otherwise provided in \n     this Act, errors of less than 3 years are excluded from \n     eligibility for corrective action under the Act. The primary \n     exception to the three-year rule is in Section 7, concerning \n     FERS covered employees who should have been, but were not, \n     given the opportunity to elect whether to be covered by FERS.\n       Section 5 deals with cases of retirement coverage errors in \n     which a Social Security-only covered employee was erroneously \n     CSRS covered or CSRS Offset covered. Under this provision, \n     OPM will promulgate regulations giving such individuals the \n     option to elect to be retroactively under either CSRS Offset \n     or Social Security-only coverage. If erroneously under CSRS \n     coverage, the employee will be placed under interim CSRS \n     Offset coverage as soon as practicable, and will have the \n     right to make the coverage election under the regulations.\n       There will be an 18-month election period applicable to \n     cases where there was a correction of the coverage error \n     prior to the effective date of the regulations. In such \n     cases, if the individual does not make a timely election, \n     then the corrective action previously taken shall remain in \n     effect.\n       In cases where the coverage error was not corrected prior \n     to the effective date of the regulations (other than interim \n     conversion from CSRS to CSRS Offset), the individual will \n     have 6 months after notification of the error in which to \n     make an election. In such cases, if the individual does not \n     make a timely election, then the individual will remain under \n     CSRS Offset.\n       Section 6 deals with cases of retirement coverage errors in \n     which a Social Security-only covered employee who was not \n     entitled to elect FERS was erroneously FERS covered. Under \n     this provision, OPM will promulgate regulations giving such \n     individuals the option to elect to be retroactively under \n     either FERS coverage or Social Security-only coverage.\n       There will be an 18-month election period applicable to \n     cases where there was a correction of the coverage error \n     prior to the effective date of the regulations. In such \n     cases, if the individual does not make a timely election, \n     then the corrective action previously taken shall remain in \n     effect.\n       In cases where the coverage error was not corrected prior \n     to the regulations, the individual will have 6 months after \n     notification of the error in which to make an election. In \n     such cases, if the individual does not make a timely \n     election, then the individual will remain under FERS \n     coverage.\n       Section 7 provides that in the case of an erroneous \n     retirement coverage determination in which a CSRS covered, \n     CSRS Offset covered or FERS-eligible Social Security-only \n     covered employee was erroneously FERS covered, the employee \n     is deemed to have elected FERS coverage and will remain \n     covered by FERS, unless the employee declines, under \n     regulations promulgated by OPM, to be FERS covered. This form \n     of corrective action is appropriate, regardless of whether \n     the error lasted 3 years, when the individual was prevented \n     from electing FERS during the statutory election period \n     provided by title III of the FERS Act of 1986. Individuals \n     who previously had the right to make such an election under \n     OPM regulations will not be given an additional opportunity \n     to make an election. This section ratifies OPM's authority to \n     issue regulatory provisions to provide appropriate treatment \n     in this situation, in accordance with court decisions. This \n     section will be effective retroactive to January 1, 1987.\n       Section 8 applies to employees and former employees (but \n     not annuitants) in cases in which a FERS covered employee was \n     erroneously CSRS covered or CSRS Offset covered. Under this \n     provision, OPM will promulgate regulations giving such \n     individuals the option to elect to be retroactively under \n     either CSRS Offset or FERS coverage. CSRS covered employees \n     will be immediately and retroactively converted to CSRS \n     Offset coverage, since Social Security coverage is automatic \n     by action of law, with the right to make the coverage \n     election under the regulations.\n       There will be an 18-month election period applicable to \n     cases where there was a correction of the coverage error \n     prior to the effective date of the regulations. In such \n     cases, if the individual does not make a timely election, \n     then the corrective action previously taken shall remain in \n     effect.\n       In cases where the coverage error has not been corrected \n     prior to the effective date of the regulations (other than \n     interim conversion from CSRS to CSRS Offset), the individual \n     will have 6 months after notification of the error in which \n     to make an election. In such cases, if the individual does \n     not make a timely election, then the individual will remain \n     under CSRS Offset.\n       In two situation, individuals will not be permitted to make \n     an election. When an individual elects to receive a refund of \n     FERS employee contributions or a Thrift Savings Plan payout, \n     the individual waives the right to benefits based on the \n     service. Accordingly, if, subsequent to correction of the \n     error and placement under FERS, the individual takes either \n     of those actions, there is no justification to reinstate the \n     rights to retirement benefits which were given up knowingly \n     and voluntarily.\n       In addition, individuals who previously received a payment \n     ordered by a Court or provided as a settlement of claim for \n     losses resulting from a retirement coverage error will not be \n     entitled to make an election unless repayment is made, or is \n     waived by the Director of OPM.\n       Section 9 deals with the same types of errors as section 8, \n     but in cases where the employee has retired or died. The \n     basic provisions are essentially the same, but there are \n     provisions for actuarial adjustments to prospective annuity \n     payments when a retroactive election divests the right to \n     payments which have already been made.\n       Section 10 deals with the retroactive application of Social \n     Security upon the correction of a retirement coverage error \n     in which an employee was erroneously covered by CSRS. \n     Subsection (a) provides discretionary authority for the \n     Commissioner of Social Security to request wage and other \n     relevant information directly from the employing agencies, in \n     a form and manner prescribed by the Commissioner. Such \n     information is necessary to correctly compute the employee's \n     Social Security benefit as if the employee had not been \n     erroneously classified. Exercise of this authority would \n     provide for a more efficient provision of such information \n     than current law and procedures, particularly for years \n     prior to the 3-year limitation on assessment of taxes. \n     Information for years prior to the 3-year period open to \n     assessment of taxes would otherwise have to be provided by \n     each individual employee or be provided at the discretion \n     of the employing agency. The authority contained in this \n     subsection would enable the Commissioner of Social \n     Security to prescribe specific procedures, if those \n     procedures are determined to be necessary, to receive \n     directly the information for these employees to ensure \n     that their wage records properly reflect their earnings \n     history.\n       Subsection (b) provides that any amounts which may be \n     transferred to the Social Security Trust Funds as a result of \n     the reports which may be required under subsection (a) shall \n     be reduced by certain amounts previously and erroneously \n     deducted for CSRS, and that these amounts shall be \n     transferred from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability \n     Fund to the Social Security Trust Funds in order to correct \n     the retirement and Social Security coverage error. Subsection \n     (c) provides that the OASDI employee tax and OASDI employer \n     tax are deemed to have been paid for the entire period of the \n     erroneous CSRS coverage.\n       Section 11 requires agencies, before placing any employee \n     in CSRS coverage, to obtain written agreement from OPM that \n     CSRS coverage is correct, unless the individual has been \n     employed with CSRS coverage within the preceding 365 days, \n     the generally applicable statutory period for exclusion from \n     Social Security. It is intended to prevent future coverage \n     errors.\n       Section 12 gives the Director of OPM specific discretionary \n     authority to waive time limits, reimburse necessary and \n     reasonable expenses and compensate losses, and waive \n     specified repayments. The authority to compensate an \n     individual for losses does not extend to claims relating to \n     forgone Thrift Savings Plan contributions and earnings or \n     other investment opportunities. In view of the judgmental \n     nature of such relief, the provision bars administrative or \n     judicial review of these actions. The provisions requires OPM \n     to report to Congress on the use of the authority under this \n     section within six months after enactment, and annually \n     thereafter, if the authority is used.\n       Section 13 provides for costs of the Act to be paid from \n     the Civil Service Retirement Fund. It also authorizes OPM to \n     spend money from that Fund to administer the Act.\n       Section 14 deals with service credit deposits which can be \n     affected by actions under the Act. Subsection (a) provides \n     for payment of interest on partial refunds of service credit \n     deposits required as a result of corrective actions. \n     Subsection (b) provides for collection by actuarial annuity \n     reduction of certain additional service credit deposits \n     required as a result of corrective actions.\n       Section 15 provides that the Office may prescribe \n     regulations necessary for the administration of the Act. In \n     addition, it requires that OPM's regulations protect the \n     rights of a former spouse with entitlement to an \n     apportionment of benefits or to survivor\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\n     benefits based on the service of the employee.\n       Section 16 provides that except as otherwise provided, the \n     Act shall be effective upon enactment.\n\n

FORMER MEMBERS OF THE 364TH FIGHTER GROUP\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Durbin, \nand Mr. Santorum) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 79\n\n         \n       Whereas on August 2, 1944, a squadron of P-51s from the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group strafed a German munitions \n     train in Remy, France;\n       Whereas the resulting explosion killed Lieutenant Houston \n     Braly, one of the attacking pilots, and destroyed much of the \n     village of Remy, including 7 stained glass windows in the \n     13th century church;\n       Whereas, despite threats of reprisals from the occupying \n     German authorities, the citizens of Remy recovered Lieutenant \n     Braly's body from the wreckage, buried his body with dignity \n     and honor in the church's cemetery, and decorated the grave \n     site daily with fresh flowers;\n       Whereas on Armistice Day, 1995, the village of Remy renamed \n     the crossroads near the site of Lieutenant Braly's death in \n     his honor;\n       Whereas the surviving members of the 364th Fighter Group \n     desire to express their gratitude to the brave citizens of \n     Remy; and\n       Whereas, to express their gratitude, the surviving members \n     of the 364th Fighter Group have organized a nonprofit \n     corporation to raise funds, through its project ``Windows for \n     Remy'', to restore the church's stained glass windows: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the bravery and honor of the citizens of Remy, \n     France, for their actions with respect to the American \n     fighter pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly during and after \n     August 1944; and\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of the surviving members of the \n     United States 364th Fighter Group to raise funds to restore \n     the stained glass windows of Remy's 13th century church.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Boxer, Senator Hutchison, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Santorum, to commemorate the acts of kindness of the residents \nof Remy, France afforded World War II Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant \nHouston Braly. While these deeds occurred more than fifty years ago, \nthe story of this young pilot is carried on in the hearts and minds of \nthe people of Remy. Now the friends and comrades of Lt. Braly have \njoined together to show their appreciation in a most sincere gesture of \ngoodwill.\n  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in \nnorthern France encountered a German munitions train. The squadron made \nthree unsuccessful attack runs at the train, which was almost \nimpossible to see because of camouflage. On the fourth run, however, \nLt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous \nexplosion.\n  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel \nfrom the train. Haystacks in fields some distance away were seen \nburning, and nearly all buildings in the small French town were \ndemolished. The 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped \ndestruction, but the historic stained-glass windows were destroyed.\n  The explosion also claimed the life of Lt. Braly, who was only \ntwenty-two years old on that tragic day.\n  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents \nof Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled \nBraly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the \nnylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. \nHundreds of villagers showered the site with flowers, stunning the \nGerman authorities. Threats of reprisals were made if the tributes \ncontinued, but eventually the authorities agreed that a small, private \nburial could be performed in the church's cemetery.\n  The next morning it was discovered that despite the potentially \nsevere consequences, villagers had once again paid tribute to the young \npilot. The covert placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued \nuntil American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople. \nAmerican soldiers were led to Lt. Braly's grave, which was marked by \nthe bent propeller of his P-51 fighter.\n  Nearly 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, came \nacross this story during the course of research he was doing at the Air \nForce Archives in Alabama. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that \nhe visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of \nthe magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the \nexplosion had not been replaced. Mr. Lea Vell contacted various members \nof the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. These \nveterans had heard the stories of how the residents of Remy had honored \ntheir fallen friend. They joined together to form Windows for Remy, a \nnon-profit organization working to raise $200,000 to replace the \nstained glass windows to repay the town for their distinguished actions \ntoward Lt. Braly.\n  Mr. President, the residents of Remy have not forgotten the story of \nthat young American pilot. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty \nyears after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to \nLt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to \n``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.''\n  I am confident that my fellow senators will join me in commending the \npeople of Remy, France for their kindness and recognize the friends and \nformer comrades of Lt. Braly for their efforts to pay back this debt of \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1353-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION--191--MAKING MAJORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for Mr. Lott) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

(a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) There is a lack of air quality monitoring data for fine \n     particle levels, measured as PM2.5, in the United \n     States and States should receive full funding for the \n     monitoring efforts;\n       (2) Such data would provide a basis for designating areas \n     as attainment or nonattainment for any PM2.5 \n     national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the \n     standards promulgated in July 1997;\n       (3) The President of the United States directed the \n     Administrator in a memorandum dated July 16, 1997, to \n     complete the next periodic review of the particulate matter \n     national ambient air quality standards by July 2002 in order \n     to determine ``whether to revise or maintain the standards;''\n       (4) The Administrator has stated that three years of air \n     quality monitoring data for fine particle levels, measured as \n     PM2.5 and performed in accordance with any \n     applicable federal reference methods, is appropriate for \n     designating areas as attainment or nonattainment pursuant to \n     the July 1997 promulgated standards; and\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\n       (5) The Administrator has acknowledged that in drawing \n     boundaries for attainment and nonattainment areas for the \n     July 1997 ozone national air quality standards, Governors \n     would benefit from considering implementation guidance from \n     EPA on drawing area boundaries;\n       (b) The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) To ensure that three years of air quality monitoring \n     data regarding fine particle levels are gathered for use in \n     the determination of area attainment or nonattainment \n     designations respecting any PM2.5 national ambient \n     air quality standards;\n       (2) To ensure that the Governors have adequate time to \n     consider implementation guidance from EPA on drawing area \n     boundaries prior to submitting area designations respecting \n     the July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards;\n       (3) To ensure that implementation of the July 1997 \n     revisions of the ambient air quality standards are consistent \n     with the purposes of the President's Implementation \n     Memorandum dated July 16, 1997.\n\n\n                 particulate matter monitoring program\n\n       Sec. 2.

This implementation shall \n     not result in a diversion or reprogramming of funds from \n     other Federal, State or local Clean Air Act activities. Any \n     funds previously diverted or reprogrammed from section 105 \n     Clean Air Act grants for PM2.5 monitors must be \n     restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) EPA and the State shall ensure that the national \n     network (designated in section 2(a)) which consists of the \n     PM2.5 monitors necessary to implement the national \n     ambient air quality standards is established by December 31, \n     1999.\n       (c) The Governors shall be required to submit designations \n     for each areas following promulgation of the July 1997 \n     PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard within \n     one year after receipt of three years of air quality \n     monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable \n     federal reference methods for the relevant areas. Only data \n     from the monitoring network designated in section 2(a) and \n     other federal reference method PM2.5 monitors \n     shall be considered for such designations. In review in the \n     State Implementation Plans the Administration shall consider \n     all relevant monitoring data regarding transport of \n     PM2.5.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate designations of \n     nonattainment areas no later than one year after the initial \n     designations required under paragraph 2(c) are required to be \n     submitted. Not withstanding the previous sentence, the \n     Administrator shall promulgate such designations not later \n     than Dec. 31, 2005.\n       (e) The Administrator shall conduct a field study of the \n     ability of the PM2.5 Federal Reference Method to \n     differentiate those particles that are larger than 2.5 \n     micrograms in diameter.

Mr. President, investors place their trust as \nwell as their funds in our capital and financial markets. It is clear \nthat one of the reasons for this trust is the knowledge that financial \nstatements are reliable, relevant, consistent, comparable and prepared \naccording to well-understood and carefully considered standards, known \nas generally accepted accounting standards. These financial reporting \nstandards are an essential component of the attraction of our capital \nmarkets--to borrowers who are looking for the most capital at the \nlowest cost and to suppliers of capital who want to invest with \nconfidence and earn a high return.\n  This openness and transparency is the result of the useful and highly \nsuccessful mechanism used in the United States for over 60 years to \ndevelop financial reporting and accounting standards. Although Congress \nempowered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set \naccounting standards in 1934, for over sixty years the Commission has \ndelegated this responsibility to the private sector. The Financial \nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) has exercised the delegated authority \nto develop accounting standards, subject to SEC review, since 1972. In \nthat year, a blue ribbon commission, created by the SEC, recommended \nthe creation of the FASB in order to insulate its deliberative process \nfrom the influence of special interests and politics. The FASB's task \nis to establish and improve financial standards in an inclusive, public \nand deliberative manner.\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n  Mr. President, while I have not always agreed with the FASB's \npronouncements and activities over the years, I believe strongly in an \nindependent standard setting body and I believe the FASB has worked \nwell. It has earned praise for its evenhanded, principled and well-\nreasoned decisions from professionals in the accounting profession, \nfrom the SEC and the financial media, and investors.\n  Mr. President, at times, the FASB's activities have generated \ncontroversy and opposition from those affected by and opposed to its \npronouncements. At this particular moment, the FASB is encountering \nstiff criticism as a result of its attempt to require institutions who \nhold derivatives to provide some type of fair market value financial \nreporting.\n  As my colleagues are aware, derivatives are highly complex financial \ninstruments that can and do perform an important role in effective risk \nmanagement by enabling commercial corporations, governments and \nfinancial firms and others, in the U.S. and worldwide, to reduce their \nexposure to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, \nand the prices of equities and commodities. Derivatives also enable \nusers to reduce funding costs and speculate on changes in market rates \nand prices. But Congress is also well aware that the use and misuse of \nderivatives can cause severe financial shocks. Hearings held by the \nBanking Committee in recent years demonstrated that derivatives \nimproperly used, and inadequately regulated, can expose an institution \nor company to potential ruin with serious consequences for depositors, \ninvestors, taxpayers and, potentially, the stability of the financial \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, regulatory agencies and Congress have studied the \nnumerous regulatory, policy and disclosure issues raised by \nderivatives. Among the more serious findings is that derivatives \ngenerally do not need to be accounted for in financial statements. In \nother words, there are billions of dollars worth of derivatives \noutstanding that are not reflected adequately in the financial \nstatements of major industrial companies, banks and other large \nderivative users.\n  In 1994 a GAO study, (Financial Derivatives: Actions Needed to \nProtect the Financial System), recommended that the FASB:\n  Proceed expeditiously to issue its existing exposure draft on \ndisclosures of derivatives and fair value of financial instruments.\n  Proceed expeditiously to develop and issue an exposure draft that \nprovides comprehensive, consistent accounting rules for derivative \nproducts, including expanded disclosure requirements that provide \nadditional needed information about derivatives activities.\n  Consider adopting a market value accounting model for all financial \ninstruments, including derivative products.\n  Mr. President, the FASB is earnestly pursuing this complicated \nobjective with the support of the SEC, the accounting profession and \nmost investment professionals. The critics and opponents of the \nproposed derivative accounting standards are now taking the \nextraordinary step of asking Congress to intervene in the FASB's \nstandard setting procedures. This not only threatens the FASB's ability \nto determine appropriate standards for disclosure of derivatives-\nrelated information, it seriously jeopardizes its independence. This \ncourse of action is extremely unwise and provides continuing \njustification for having an independent, professional entity to set \naccounting and financial reporting requirements, like the FASB, rather \nthan the Congress or a government agency.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that Congress lacks the technical \nexpertise and resources to develop accounting standards, as does the \nSEC. In addition, federal bank regulators lack the impartiality to \nadminister disclosure standards dedicated to investor protection and \npublic disclosure since the banking laws are geared to maintaining \npublic confidence in financial institutions rather than requiring the \nfull and complete disclosure of a financial institution's real \nfinancial condition.\n  Mr. President, Congress should resist the suggestion of removing \nstandard setting from the public sector and transferring it to a \ngovernment agency. If history is any guide, this step would create more \nproblems than it would solve. Every recent effort by a government \nagency, including the Congress, to set accounting standards has been a \ntotal failure. For example, during the early days of the savings and \nloan crisis, the FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Corporation--the \nformer S regulator) created ``supervisory goodwill'' as a mechanism \nby which healthy thrifts could acquire or invest in fledgling ones. \nRegulators permitted supervisory goodwill to qualify as regulatory \ncapital. Then, in 1989, Congress enacted stricter capital standards \nunder the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act \n(FIRREA) and mandated that all supervisory goodwill was to be charged-\noff over an accelerated period ending in 1994, causing severe capital \nconstraints, even pushing some S to liquidate assets at a severe \ndiscount. Between the actions of the regulators and the Congress, the \nS crisis lasted longer than necessary, the recovery took longer than \nnecessary and eventually ended in a $130 billion dollar taxpayer-\nfinanced bailout. In fact, the final costs to the federal government of \nthe S bailout may increase as a result of the ongoing ``supervisory \ngoodwill litigation.''\n  Mr. President, the FASB started working on derivatives and hedging in \n1991. It has had an extensive and open process that has involved ample \nopportunity for public comment, debate and participation by all \nconstituents. This open and deliberative process is still ongoing and \nwill, in the end, produce thoughtful and comprehensive accounting \nstandards that will better inform investors and the financial markets \nas a whole and contribute to their effective functioning.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to dwell on the S crisis or on the \nbenefits and risks of derivatives. Instead, I simply want to underscore \nthat Congress should not disrupt the FASB's independence and \nprofessionalism in setting accounting standards, for derivatives or for \nany other project. The SEC has jurisdiction over the FASB and the \nCongress already conducts oversight of the SEC and the FASB. In fact, \nthe Subcommittee on Securities has held two hearings on the derivatives \nissue. I would oppose authorizing the SEC, or any other federal agency, \nto set accounting standards. We should leave to the private sector the \nresponsibility to develop accounting and financial reporting standards \nthat are at the heart of the success of our process of capital \nformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1363-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1364-S1365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, March 3rd was the eighth annual \ncelebration of National Sportsmanship Day in over 10,000 schools in all \nfifty states and more than 100 countries throughout the world.\n  Recognized by the President's Council on Physical Fitness, National \nSportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International \nSport, located in my home state of Rhode Island. As the President's \nCouncil Co-Chairs Tom McMillen and Florence Griffith Joyner have \nstated, ``this event will serve as a highly visible, one-day effort to \nstress the importance of ethics and sportsmanship, not just on the \nathletic field but in all aspects of life. . . having a powerful and \npositive effect on the youth of the United States and the world.''\n  Heeding President Clinton's challenge to begin a serious dialogue on \nrace relations in the United States, the centerpiece of this year's \nNational Sportsmanship Day was a seminar and town meeting at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island discussing race issues in sport. This day \nlong event included panels composed of athletes, coaches, and \njournalists who discussed the many different aspects of these issues.\n  In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports \nEthics Fellows, including Mills Lane, a Reno, Nevada district judge and \ninternationally known professional boxing referee, Billy Packer, CBS \nsports commentator, and Ken Dryden, the president and general manager \nof the Toronto Maple Leafs. These men and women are wonderful role \nmodels who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. \nThey have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the \nprinciples of honesty and integrity in sport and society.\n  These Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important \nlessons of\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nNational Sportsmanship Day by developing programs for National \nSportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that \nwhile winning is a worthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are \nmore important. Indeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of \neveryday life.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island Congressional \ndelegation in recognizing this day and the principles it \nembodies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1364-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THOM HINDLE: DOVER'S CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Thom Hindle, a distinguished individual, for being named \nthe 1998 Dover Citizen of the Year. I commend his passion for American \nhistory and his inexhaustible dedication to keeping it alive.\n  Thom, a Dover native, became very concerned that the history of Dover \nwas not given the appreciation nor the recognition it deserved. As a \nresult, Thom set out to remind and educate the community about the \nimportant facts and contributions Dover's history has to offer.\n  Thom became the trustee for the Woodman Institute, an organization \nthat focuses on preserving and documenting the past. Thom felt that he \nwas preserving Dover's ``hidden treasures'' and sought to give everyone \nthe chance to experience them. To keep it alive, he wrote a historical \nbook on Dover which included written and pictorial information for \nfuture generations.\n  Thom is also the president of the Northam Colonists, Dover's \nhistorical society, as well as a member of the Heritage group, a \ncommittee that is part of the historical society. The committee centers \non historical areas of the town and also provides guided tours during \nthe fall, which focus on historic homes and other noteworthy sights. He \nis also a trustee to Dover's oldest elderly care facility, The \nWentworth Home. As a trustee, he raises money for a number of city \nprojects that improve the visual aesthetics of the community. His work \nnot only recognizes the important tributes of the past but also those \nthat enrich the present.\n  As a former history teacher, I appreciate Thom's commitment to \nhistory. It is imperative to remember our country's past, to see where \nwe have been as a nation, and to see where we are going as a people. \nNot honoring American history is not honoring those who have fought, \ndied, and sacrificed for the great nation we have today.\n  Therefore, we as a generation should carry on the tradition our \nforefathers started: to continue to fight and strive to improve the \nlives of generations to come and to never give up the aggressive \ncrusade for greatness and consistent drive for virtue. Like Thom, we \nshould continue to defend the past and augment the future. Mr. \nPresident, I want to congratulate Thom for his outstanding work and I \nam proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1365-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  37TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, March 3, was designated by \nthe President as the day to pay public tribute to the 37th anniversary \nof the Peace Corps. Although the official anniversary technically \noccurred on Sunday, March 1, a day during the week for events to be \nsponsored in honor of the Peace Corps' anniversary proved to be more \npractical.\n  It was nearly four decades ago that President Kennedy signed \nlegislation into law to create the Peace Corps in 1961 and sent the \nfirst class of volunteers to Ghana. Since its founding, more than \n150,000 Americans have served in the Peace Corps.\n  The public recognition of the Peace Corps' anniversary has special \nsignificance for me personally, as I was fortunate enough to serve as a \nPeace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic some years ago. Like \nother Americans who have had the honor of serving as Peace Corps \nvolunteers, my service in the Dominican Republic will remain one of the \nmost important periods of my life.\n  Currently there are 6,500 volunteers, serving in 84 countries around \nthe globe. These people dedicate two years of their lives to addressing \nthe critical development needs of impoverished communities. They help \npeople gain access to clean water, grow more food, help prevent the \nspread of AIDS, teach English, math and science, aid entrepreneurs in \nthe development of new business, and work with non-governmental \norganizations to protect the environment.\n  The Peace Corps has been marked by much success thanks to current and \nreturned Peace Corps volunteers. Based on the Peace Corps' high level \nof achievement since its creation, and taking into account the unmet \nneeds of the developing world, I support the proposed increase in the \nPeace Corps Fiscal Year 1999 budget.\n  The value of the Peace Corps is not limited solely to its overseas \nvolunteer service. There is a ``domestic dividend'' as well--the \nexperience and value that is brought back to the communities where \nvolunteers return once their two year tour is over. Experience has \nshown that Returned Peace Corps volunteers participate in their \ncommunities across the nation more than most other Americans.\n  This week, as the nation celebrates the 37th anniversary of the Peace \nCorps, more than 350,000 students in all 50 states will learn more \nabout life in the developing world by talking with and listening to \n5,000 current and returned volunteers, in person, via satellite and by \nphone. In my home state of Connecticut, one of six states and 23 cities \nthat declared March 3 as Peace Corps Day, students in New London talked \nto current Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama and students at Balboa High \nSchool in Panama via a live CU-SeeMe video conference. With advancing \ntechnology, it is exciting to have students in the United States learn \nmore about people in different corners of the world, without even \nleaving their classroom.\n  Finally, I commend all of those volunteers, both past and present who \nhave contributed to the success of the Peace Corps. Every anniversary \nis an important one. This one has been made special by being officially \nrecognized as Peace Corps Day--something that will hopefully become an \nannual occurrence. It serves as an opportunity for Americans to learn \nabout other cultures of the World and to pay tribute to the more than \n150,000 Americans who have dedicated part of their lives to making this \na better World to live in. I am confident that we in the Senate are \nproud of each and every one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1365-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1365-S1366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE EAGLE SCOUTS OF TROOP 358\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very \nspecial group of young men from one of the oldest African American Boy \nScout units in the nation. On February 7, 1998, eleven members of Troop \n358 were officially honored as Eagle Scouts.\n  Troop 358, sponsored by Grace Baptist Church of Germantown, \nPennsylvania, has a proud tradition of achievement. In 45 years, Troop \n358 has produced a total of 33 Eagle Scouts--including this year's \nclass. To put this in perspective, consider that only 2.5 percent of \nthe nation's 4.5 million scouts ever become Eagle Scouts. Moreover, \nonly about 1 percent of African American scouts reach this goal.\n  Eagle Scouts learn valuable lessons in leadership, honor, and pride \nin their communities. In fact, the community service projects that the \nScouts completed to earn their badges are as extraordinary as the young \nmen themselves. For instance, one new Scout set up a workshop for inner \ncity kids who wanted to prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. \nAnother young man wrapped up his Eagle service project painting a \nschool. Still another ploughed through months of paperwork to complete \n8 of his 29 merit badges in one week.\n  Mr. President, these 11 new Eagle Scouts--Jarrett Coger, Jerece \nBarnes, Askia Fluellen, Bruce Frazier, Andre Kydd, Jared LeVere, Sean \nLong, Kyle McIntosh, Robert Redding, Ernest Stanton and Anwar White--\nare a credit to their families and to their scoutmasters, A. Bruce \nFrazier and Charles M. Whiting. They are also living tributes to the \nlate Earl Grayson, who led Troop 358 through both good and bad times \nfor 36 years.\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's \nbest wishes for continued success to the new Eagle Scouts and to all \nthose who have sustained Troop 358 over its 45 year history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1365-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1366-S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BEN MEED, THE AMERICAN GATHERING OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS, AND GERMAN \n                              COMPENSATION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly comment on \nthe program of German reparations being paid to Holocaust survivors. \nOver the past two years, we have looked extensively at the role Swiss \nbanks played during the Holocaust. What we found was shocking. Clearly \nwe discovered that in addition to carrying out the mass murder of \nmillions of people, Jews and non-Jews, the Nazis carried off the \ngreatest robbery in history.\n  After the war, the new government of Germany began a program of \nrestitution for the survivors of the Holocaust. Over the past half-\ncentury, Germany has paid billions of dollars to survivors, but can we \nreally say that this is enough? Can we say that it is fair that someone \nwho survived, for example, five months in a concentration camp, but not \nthe six required to obtain compensation, is fair? Can we say that it is \nfair that someone who survived a Gestapo prison should be denied \ncompensation for their suffering? The answer to these questions is an \nemphatic NO!\n  It is time that Germany drop their reservations to paying \ncompensation to all those who deserve it, regardless of income levels, \nregardless of the time spent enduring Nazi torture. All limitations \nshould be dropped and each and every survivor, everywhere, regardless \nof their situation, should be provided with compensation.\n  Mr. President, Ben Meed, the President of the American Gathering of \nJewish Holocaust Survivors, makes these same points in a speech he gave \nat the National Leadership Conference in Washington on February 15, \n1998. His speech is poignant and succinct. Holocaust survivors have \nlittle time left and they need help. I could not agree more with this \nwise man's conclusions. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of his remarks be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read Ben Meed's words and to \nhelp ease the suffering of these survivors of mankind's greatest \ninhumanity to man. I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n     Remarks by Benjamin Meed at the National Leadership Conference\n\n       Distinguished guests, Fellow survivors, my younger \n     colleagues and dear friends\n       Though many issues of importance will be raised during the \n     day, I want to take this opportunity to convey the dismay and \n     anger felt by survivors toward the reparations program \n     established by Germany and to express the survivors' goal to \n     challenge those programs.\n       German compensation has become an extremely important--\n     perhaps the most important--issue to survivors. Many \n     survivors need the compensation. And most survivors, even \n     those who would not accept German money before today demand \n     rights for the payment. But time is Germany's ally; time is \n     the enemy for survivors. As nature takes its course, we learn \n     daily of the deaths of more survivors. That unfortunate fact \n     only serves to emphasize the urgency of this matter.\n       We attend funerals almost daily. Let me also add that since \n     the reparation program started over forty years ago, more \n     than 50% of survivors receiving German pensions have passed \n     away. Germany is not paying to the deceased or to their heir.\n       After the Holocaust, we survivors were in no position to \n     negotiate directly--also many of us wanted nothing to do--\n     with Germany. Though German money does go to some survivors, \n     the amounts and the conditions attached to the funds \n     humiliate us personally and collectively.\n       In 1951, Chancellor Adenauer announced that compensation \n     for survivors was Germany's moral responsibility. And, since \n     the 1950's, the Claims Conference has negotiated with Germany \n     on behalf of the survivors. It has served as trustee for \n     their collective interest, and we survivors are grateful for \n     any help extended to us. But whatever was done, was not \n     enough. Much more can be done and must be done quickly.\n       Until recently, survivors played virtually no role in \n     Holocaust-related compensation matters. We did not negotiate \n     with Germany; we did not decide how the German money would be \n     used; and we did not distribute the money. All of these \n     things were done without our participation.\n       Yes, the Claims Conference and their leaders deserve our \n     appreciation for the work they did when we were unable to do \n     it. The negotiations with Germany resulted in various \n     compensation programs for survivors. There is the Federal \n     Indemnification Law, the Hardship Fund and the Article 2 \n     Fund. We all know that no amount of compensation can truly \n     ``pay'' for the damage Germany did to our people. Yet the \n     amount Germany has provided is shameful, and the conditions \n     for eligibility are outrageous and humiliating; they are \n     unacceptable today.\n       First, the amount Germany has paid is barely a start in \n     repairing the destruction and human misery it caused. Our \n     homes . . . our culture . . . our faith in our fellow man \n     were destroyed. Who will give us back our families, our \n     youth, our health. So much of our minds are still--and will \n     always be--there. Any yet whenever some survivors receive \n     payments, we are told, ``look, see how much Germany pays to \n     the survivors!'' How can anyone talk about German \n     ``generosity'' in the context of the Holocaust. It sounds big \n     when you say Germany paid more than fifty billion dollars \n     over forty years to Israel and to other countries in \n     reparations. But think about it, how much did Germany's \n     robbery amount to in four years of the Holocaust? Some \n     historians today are estimating that the robbery was more \n     than three hundred billion dollars worth of land, homes, \n     gold, jewelry and personal belongings--beside murdering our \n     six-million people.\n       Second, the individual payments Germany has made, though \n     needed by many survivors, are typically small; they do not \n     furnish a dignified life with modest security that Germany \n     has a duty to provide.\n       Third, only survivors who were in a camp for a minimum of \n     six months, or a ghetto for eighteen months, are entitled to \n     German compensation; and you must prove it with documentation \n     which is difficult if not impossible to obtain. Can you \n     imagine the fear and anguish which lingers from a single day \n     in the Warsaw or Lodz Ghetto, Auschwitz, Buchenwald, or in \n     hiding? Can the people who imposed these insensitive \n     limitations have any idea of what one day in those places \n     felt like? It didn't take a month or two--or certainly six \n     months--to be abused, or to be plagued by nightmares, \n     forever.\n       Finally, survivors must show virtual poverty--\n     notbeduerftigt--to qualify for payments. This turns the \n     payments into welfare. Thus, the very people targeted by the \n     Nazis for murder are now treated as beggars or, at best, as \n     charity cases. This is disgraceful and insulting to us. \n     Compensation should be paid for what Germany did during the \n     Holocaust; it should have absolutely nothing to do with the \n     circumstances of our lives after the war struggling to \n     rebuild our lives.\n       As a general matter, the selections the programs make--\n     based on income, previous payments and other restrictive \n     rules are upsetting reminders to survivors of the infamous \n     selections made during the Holocaust. This, to us, is \n     intolerable and cannot remain the same; it must be \n     eliminated.\n       In sum, too many survivors have been excluded from German \n     payments; too many who have gotten something have been paid \n     too little; too many improper conditions--selections--have \n     been imposed; and too many in immediate need of help will not \n     receive compensation quickly enough to do any good. All this, \n     in the name of humanity and justice, must be changed.\n       Germany has treated Holocaust reparations like any other \n     business--get the best deal possible; pay as little as \n     possible; and be done with it. Holocaust survivors deserve \n     better. It may be that the claims of survivors are \n     unprecedented; but that is because the Holocaust was \n     unprecedented.\n       But as we are in the last stages of our lives, there are \n     many needy and lonely survivors who live in distressing \n     circumstances. With an average age exceeding 75, they feel \n     forsaken, afflicted by illness and, in addition to the usual \n     complications of growing old. They still carry the nightmares \n     of the Holocaust.\n       Now we know that circumstances could have been very \n     different had survivors played a larger role in the \n     compensation negotiations with Germany. Germany would not \n     have dared to take the adamant negotiating positions it \n     regularly took with the Claims Conference had survivors who \n     still bore the numbers of the camps tattooed on their arms \n     been present. And if Germany had played ``hard-ball'', \n     survivors--from the United States and elsewhere around the \n     world--would or should have walked away from the negotiating \n     table, and taken their case public, or to their own \n     governments for support. For the last few years, we proved \n     the importance of the survivors at the negotiating table. \n     Yes, without survivors, we would not achieve these gains.\n       Survivors have dedicated themselves to not permitting the \n     world to forget the Holocaust. They played a leading role in \n     establishing museums, memorials and other Holocaust \n     remembrance-related projects in Israel, the United States and \n     elsewhere. We did this not for ourselves--we know what \n     happened--but for the rest of the world, which had to be \n     educated and reminded.\n       We now are equally determined to do what is necessary to \n     make certain, in the little time we have left, that fellow \n     survivors live out their years in dignity; not full of fear \n     and frustration.\n       Germany's war against the Jews was more brutal and \n     relentless than the war it waged even against the Allied \n     soldiers. To fulfill its moral obligation, Germany should \n     have a\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n     compensation program which gives to every victim, even at \n     this late date, the fullest possible coverage; enough \n     compensation to establish a foundation upon which survivors \n     can live out their lives in dignity, and with security. \n     Germany not only can do it; it is the right thing for Germany \n     to do.\n       The gross injustices done to Jewish Holocaust survivors \n     should be the concern of everyone. Now it is clear what needs \n     to be done: We want the removal of all restrictions in the \n     German compensation programs; we want German compensation to \n     be inclusive--to cover every remaining survivor; and \n     survivors should be involved in every facet of German \n     compensation; the negotiations and decisions about how the \n     money is used.\n       My dear fellow survivors, I focus my comments today on \n     Germany but we all know too well that other countries \n     participated in the world's greatest robbery from our Jewish \n     people in Europe. We commend those who are exposing these \n     matters on every level. But we survivors know better that \n     nothing, no nation could be compared to the greatest murder \n     machine of Germany.\n       We should never forget this. Let us also not forget that we \n     spent a lifetime after the Holocaust educating, documenting \n     and commemorating the Holocaust. We must continue to stand on \n     guard of Remembrance. We should never be blinded with the \n     glitter of gold. The memory of our kedoshim should never be \n     tarnished.\n       Let us work together, together let us demand what is \n     right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1366-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS FOR ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE RED RIVER \n                   VALLEY FLOOD RELIEF EFFORT IN 1997\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of ``American \nRed Cross Month'' to pay tribute to one of the most exemplary \nhumanitarian organizations the world has ever known, and to \nspecifically recognize how the Red Cross touched the lives of thousands \nof Minnesotans during the 1997 spring floods.\n  Each year, the Red Cross comes to the aid of victims of 66,000 \ndisasters nationally. When disaster strikes, the Red Cross responds \nswiftly to the call to relieve human suffering and restore a sense of \ncomfort and normalcy in the face of tragedy--a response honed over its \n135 years of service.\n  This surely was the case when tragedy hit Minnesota in the form of \nsevere flooding in the spring of 1997. When the Minnesota and Red \nRivers overflowed their banks, it brought forth a flood of destruction \nand human misery unseen in this normally peaceful part of the country.\n  The Red Cross response to this catastrophe was swift and effective. \nWith operations in three states--Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota--the Red Cross provided over 6,994 volunteers to aid in the \nflood relief effort. In addition, the Red Cross contributed direct \nassistance to approximately 11,867 families.\n  In Red Cross service centers, victims were provided with basic \nnecessities which were made scarce or unattainable due to the floods. \nThe extensive damage to private homes displaced thousands, prompting \nthe Red Cross to open 19 shelters which served 6,001 people. In all, \nthe Red Cross served 1,179,950 meals at its 43 feeding sites and with \nits 64 mobile feeding units. The Red Cross was also able to provide \nfresh water, clothing, and blankets.\n  After the water had returned within its banks and it was time for \npeople to return to their homes to begin to clean up the residue left \nby the flood waters, the Red Cross provided 12,754 clean-up kits to aid \nin this long process.\n  In a relatively short period of time, the river took away from some \nwhat it had taken a lifetime to build. In order to aid people in \ndealing with the mental strain brought by such a traumatic experience, \nthe Red Cross made mental health professionals available, who attended \nto the needs of 15,498 individuals.\n  During the many weeks of flood recovery work, there were two \ninstances where individuals generously gave significant monetary \ncontributions to the victims of the flood. These anonymous donors were \nproperly referred to as ``Angels.'' While this label is indeed \nappropriate, it seems that it should also accurately be used to \ndescribe the thousands of Red Cross volunteers who came from all over \nthis country and generously gave their time and labor to people known \nonly to them by their need for assistance.\n  Mr. President, while this was indeed a dark time for Minnesotans in \nthe flood areas, the uncompromising compassion of Red Cross volunteers \nprovided a bright display of kindness, a light that shone in the hearts \nof the many who so generously gave their time and labor in the face of \nthis great tragedy. On behalf of the people of Minnesota, I wish to \noffer my sincerest thanks to the men and women of the Red Cross and \ncommend this fine organization for its relief efforts throughout the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1367-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S.

Madam President, I want to take a few moments to speak \nabout the important developments that have taken place over the last \nseveral days relating to Iraq.\n  On Monday afternoon I met for about an hour with Unscom Executive \nChairman Richard Butler. Yesterday, General Tony Zinni, the Commander-\nin-Chief, U.S. Central Command, who would lead any strike that the \nUnited States might carry out against Iraq, testified before the Armed \nServices Committee. I believe that the remarks of Chairman Butler and \nthe testimony of General Zinni would be of interest to my colleagues \nand to the American people.\n  I met with Chairman Butler in his office at United Nations \nHeadquarters in New York. Senator Warner and I had traveled to the \nPersian Gulf region with Secretary of Defense William Cohen, at the \nSecretary's invitation, last month and, while Senator Warner was unable \nto travel to New York on Monday, a member of his staff, Judy Ansley, \nwas able to attend my meeting with Chairman Butler.\n  During the course of this meeting, we covered a host of issues \nconcerning Unscom inspections relating to Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. I will not attempt to cover \nall those issues today but I did want to recap some of the major points \nthat he made.\n  One of the most important points that Chairman Butler made was that \npeople should not get bogged down in debating the detailed procedures \nthat are being worked out at UN headquarters for Unscom to inspect the \nso-called presidential sites. Instead, the international community \nshould focus on Iraq's clear commitment in the Memorandum of \nUnderstanding to finally implement the UN Security Council resolutions \nto give Unscom and the IAEA immediate, unconditional and unrestricted \naccess to any site in Iraq.\n  Chairman Butler noted a fundamental historic reality that from day 1 \nIraq has sought to limit, mitigate, reduce and, in some cases, defeat \nthe law (i.e. UN Security Council's resolutions) by a variety of \ndevices.\n  I want to just spend one more moment to restate that point. The \ndetails are obviously important. But the more you focus on the details \nthat need to be worked out, the more that let's Saddam Hussein off the \nhook. And the hook here, which he is on and must be kept on, is his \ncommitment and the U.N. resolution requiring that UNSCOM and the IAEA \nbe given immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any sites \nin Iraq.\n  That is the goal. That is the commitment. That is the requirement. \nThat is what Iraq is bound by. That is undisputed.\n  While, again, details are important, we should not be focusing on the \ndetails because the more we do the more Saddam Hussein is going to say, \n``Oh, all those are details subject to negotiation.'' We don't want \nthis to get bogged down in negotiations over details. We want to hold \nSaddam Hussein's feet to the fire. And the fire here is an unqualified \ncommitment to immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any \nsite in Iraq, including the Presidential sites.\n  Saddam is the one who is going to try to raise and create ambiguity.\n  Again, while, of course, there are details to be worked out, we \nshould be the ones who are focusing on the clear, unambiguous \nrequirement to open these sites to access.\n  Chairman Butler confirmed that after Unscom became aware, despite \nearlier denials, that Iraq had possessed 2,100 gallons of anthrax and \n3.9 tons of VX, Iraq claimed that it had destroyed those substances. He \nnoted first of all, that was a violation of the UN resolutions, since \ndestruction of such substances is to be carried out by Unscom, and \nsecond, that Unscom was unable to verify that Iraq had destroyed them.\n  Chairman Butler made the point that since 1995, Unscom had found \nimportant indicators of weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq \nhas sought to conceal and about which they have lied to Unscom. He \nnoted, moreover, that Unscom has evidence of a connection of \nsignificant biological substances to Iraq's special security \norganization, thus demonstrating that Saddam Hussein uses the same \napparatus to seek or manufacture weapons of mass destruction that he \nuses to keep himself in power.\n  Chairman Butler stated that Unscom only goes looking for things in \ntwo circumstances: one, when they have evidence that supports a search, \nsuch as documentation of the possession of growth media which could be \nused for biological weapons; and two, when Iraq lies to Unscom. In the \nlatter case, a broad forensic investigation has to be undertaken. He \nwas quick to add that just because a specific inspection doesn't ``hit \npay dirt,'' doesn't mean that the search is over, particularly in view \nof Iraq's track record of lies and deception.\n  Chairman Butler described the Memorandum of Understanding that UN \nSecretary General Kofi Annan negotiated with Iraq as a ``high-level \npolitical commitment'' that he ``hopes to heavens the Iraqis observe.'' \nHe noted that he has talked to the Secretary General and has received \nthe clarification that when a site, presidential or not, is inspected \nby Unscom, it will be his decision as to when and where the inspection \ntakes place, how it is inspected, and who the members of the \nprofessional, technical part of the team are who will actually carry \nout the inspection. He also said that those decisions will be made by \nthe Director General of IAEA with respect to nuclear matters. He added \nthat this is consistent with the Secretary General's intention, that \nthe details were being formalized within the United Nations, and that \nhe would let me know if there were any changes to those details.\n\n  Chairman Butler added that the diplomats who will accompany Unscom \ninspectors as observers to the eight presidential sites will be there \nto ensure not only that the Unscom inspectors comport themselves with \ndignity, but also that the Iraqis behave properly as well.\n  Finally, Chairman Butler noted with concern that there has been a \nthree and one-half month hiatus in some of Unscom's work in Iraq, but \nthat he is very pleased that this agreement was worked out that should \npermit Unscom to resume the full spectrum of its activities and that \nthey will shortly test the agreement.\n  Madam President, Senator Warner and I have written to the Majority \nLeader and the Democratic Leader urging them to invite Chairman Butler \nto come to Washington to meet with all Senators. Senator Warner and I \ncertainly hope that an invitation will be extended and that Mr. Butler \nwould respond favorably to such an invitation, as we believe that all \nSenators should have an opportunity to hear directly from this \ndedicated international public servant.\n  Madam President, during his appearance before the Armed Services \nCommittee, General Zinni testified that our friends in the Persian Gulf \nregion congratulated the United States when Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan negotiated the MOU with Iraq and they felt it was a victory for \nUnited States strength and resolve. He added, in response to my \nquestion, that he shared that view. He also testified that he agreed \nwith Chairman Butler that the negotiation of the MOU leaves us in a \nbetter position to obtain Iraqi compliance with Security Council \nresolutions.\n  I commend all of General Zinni's testimony to our colleagues.\n  I again thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/04/senate-section/article/S1368-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
