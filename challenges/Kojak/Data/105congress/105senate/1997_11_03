Mr. President, I wish to speak this morning on the subject: \nthe ``fairy tales of fast track: the myth of trade negotiations \nparalysis.''\n  It has been said that if one wants a lie to stick, just keep \nrepeating it, keep shouting it, until it just seems to become a \nreality. On the matter of fast-track procedures for congressional \nhandling of trade agreements, we have a whopper being shouted from the \nhousetops in congressional testimony and on the op-ed pages of our \nleading newspapers by people who surely ought to know better. An \nexample of what I am talking about appears in the Washington Post \ntoday, authored by our esteemed former colleague and former Senate \nRepublican leader, Mr. Bob Dole, who engages in vacuous, vapid\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\nvaporings in insisting that other nations will not play ball with us on \ntrade if they think Congress is going to take a close look at what is \nnegotiated, and, Heaven forbid, even have an opportunity to consider \namendments to trade agreements negotiated by the administration.\n  Here is what Mr. Dole says, in part:\n\n       The fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine \n     whether the President ever will negotiate another trade \n     agreement.\n\n  Let us take a look again at that profound statement by Mr. Dole:\n\n       The fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine \n     whether the President ever will negotiate another trade \n     agreement.\n\n  Now, there is an assertion. One might get the idea that fast-track \nconsideration of trade agreements is normal practice, and that it is \nthe normal practice in considering trade agreements, Mr. President. \nBut, fast-track consideration of trade agreements is as rare as hen's \nteeth. It has been done all of only five times since the first very \nlimited fast-track authority was granted by the Congress in 1974. So, \nin nearly a quarter of a century, we have used fast-track consideration \nall of five times on this floor.\n  Can anyone guess how many trade agreements have been negotiated in \nthat quarter of a century? The answer is, of course, hundreds--\nhundreds. We have had fast track on this Senate floor five times in a \nlittle over 23 years, but in the meantime, hundreds of trade agreements \nhave been negotiated. And the Clinton administration, as a matter of \nfact, is quite fond of boasting of its record of entering into some 200 \ntrade agreements, none of them subject to fast track except the GATT \nand NAFTA trade pacts.\n  The other clarion call that we hear repeatedly from the \nadministration, repeated by Mr. Dole again this morning, is the issue \nof American leadership. The United States must lead in the global \neconomy and if Congress wants to review and possibly amend trade \nagreements, that's the end of that.\n  Here is what Mr. Dole says:\n\n       Global trade is inevitable, and Presidential fast-track \n     authority is indispensable if America is to lead the \n     community of nations into the next century.\n\n  Another quite profound statement; and mind-boggling, indeed. I would \nsuspect that we are going to be talking about American leadership a lot \nthis week, as the Senate reviews the need for fast-track authority that \nhas been requested by the administration.\n  If a trade agreement is soundly negotiated and if it would be clearly \nbeneficial to America, I think it is a pretty fair guess that the \nSenate will approve it without any amendment; without even the threat \nof an amendment. But the threat of amendments should prove valuable as \nadditional leverage for administration negotiators on trade matters. \nSome of these negotiations are pretty tough, and I should think that \nthe Senate's careful role in reviewing the product can be used to \nadvantage. I do not think it hurts American leadership for our trading \npartners--some of whom are trading adversaries when they do not \nimplement in good faith the agreements they sign with us and continue \nto restrict access to their markets for American goods--to know that \nthe U.S. Senate is looking over their shoulders. It could be useful \nbargaining leverage, and if I were negotiating an agreement I certainly \nthink it would be advantageous to have the weight of future Senate \nscrutiny to dangle over the head of a tough bargainer on the other side \nof the table.\n  The third point that our good friend Mr. Dole makes is that somehow \nour trade negotiators are cooling their heels and waiting for the \nSenate to give assured protection to their products before beginning \ntheir negotiations. Mr. Dole says:\n\n       Some may ask why it matters whether other countries beat us \n     in securing trade pacts with developing nations. What are we \n     waiting for?\n\n  Now, there is a profound question: What are we waiting for? Mr. Dole \nsuggests that the Senate is holding up negotiations. And nothing could \nbe further from the truth. The administration already has authority \ngiven to it in law to negotiate trade pacts. This negotiating authority \nwas most recently provided by the Congress in the 1994 GATT agreement, \nor Uruguay round, and it is good into the next century.\n  I do not notice any crippling of the administration's negotiating \nauthority or of its ability to successfully conclude trade agreements \nwithout the use of fast track. At the moment, the United States has \nbeen negotiating a so-called multilateral agreement on investment, MAI, \nfor 2 years, which is now 90 percent or more complete, with strong \nAmerican leadership and without the assurance of fast-track \nlegislation. It is unclear whether the administration intends to try to \nget this agreement approved by the Congress under new fast-track \napproval legislation. Nevertheless, this immensely complicated and very \nimportant multilateral agreement has been negotiated without the \nbenefit--without the benefit of a promise of the Senate's pulling a \nblack bag of no amendment guarantees over its head.\n  I think we need an analysis of all the trade agreements concluded by \nthe administration. Let's take a look at the scorecard. Let's see if \nMr. Dole is right that without the Senate's passing the new Export \nExpansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1997, all is lost--all \nis lost. Let's try to determine if the Founding Fathers were completely \noff the mark when they gave to the Congress authority over the \nregulation of commerce with foreign nations in article I, section 8--\narticle I, section 8, of the Constitution, dealing with the powers of \nthe Congress. The Founding Fathers did not want the President to have \nthis authority, because our Founding Fathers' memories were not short \nindeed and the Founding Fathers were not at all enamored with the idea \nof a President of the United States gathering authority unto himself \nlike they had experienced with King George III of England. So this \nexclusive power was not centered on the legislative branch by whim or \nby fancy. There were weighty considerations of a system founded on \ncarefully balanced powers.\n\n  Therefore, let's not get stampeded by all the alarm bells, all of the \nRoman candles, all of the fire crackers of lost American leadership, of \npreposterous assertions about the behavior of our trading partners if \nwe don't steer our constitutional system further in the direction of \nexecutive power. The scaremongers say that the Sun rises in the west. I \ndon't believe it. I don't believe the Sun rises at the western end of \nConstitution Avenue. If it does, that's a very recent phenomenon.\n  If our trading partners truly want to make market arrangements for \nnew flows of goods and services with the United States, we certainly \nhave learned that they will do so, even in the reality of scrutiny of \nthe Congress over those deals. That has not stopped any country or \ngroup of countries from negotiating with us to date. So why should it \nhappen now? Let us not shortchange ourselves. Don't belittle ourselves. \nLet's not lose confidence in ourselves. This is America, the engine of \nworld growth; the largest market, the most coveted market in the world! \nIt is embarrassing and it is wrong to say that the role of the Congress \nis standing in the way of success, damaging to our world leadership, or \nan obstacle to getting good agreements. And it is absolutely \npreposterous to maintain that other nations will not negotiate with us \nif we follow our constitutional system.\n  If trade agreements are in the national interests of other nations, \nthey will be at the table. They will be at the table, in my judgment, \nCongress or no Congress. Now, when was the last time that Congress \nrejected a trade agreement or emasculated it beyond further \ninternational consideration? These arguments put forth by the \nadministration, and dutifully repeated--dutifully repeated by our \ndistinguished former Republican leader, are just a pretext for not \ngoing through the rigors of defending such agreements, and all parts \nthereof, before the elected representatives of the people who are going \nto be subjected to them, certainly affected by them, and who will \nperhaps pay for them.\n  I hope that the Senate will have an informed, lengthy, robust debate \non trade this week. It is high time that the Senate talked about such \nagreements; high time that the Senate talked about the trade deficits \nthat we are experiencing.\n  My distinguished and informed and most learned colleague, Byron \nDorgan, has been talking about this from time to time over the long \nweeks and\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\nmonths. I have seen him bring charts into the Chamber. I have heard him \ndiscuss the shortsightedness of our negotiators and how we continually \nlet ourselves be taken to the cleaners in trade negotiations.\n  So I hope that we will have a good debate on trade this week because, \nas I say, it's high time that the Senate talked about the trade \ndeficits we are experiencing, about the barriers that exist for access \nto foreign markets and about the real advantages and disadvantages of \ntrade for our economy.\n  Mr. President, so much for the vacuous, vapid vaporings of those who \nwould have us steer away from the constitutional authority of the \nCongress and go down that road that we have been traveling on for so \nlong--of taking a beating in trade negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by former \nSenator Bob Dole be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, this article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1997]\n\n                  Get Back to the Fast Track on Trade\n\n                             (By Bob Dole)\n\n       As Congress rushes to complete its work and adjourn this \n     week, I have found myself in the unusual position of urging \n     my former colleagues to stay--at least until they pass \n     legislation giving fast-track trade negotiating authority to \n     President Clinton.\n       During my tenure in the Senate, I often made the point that \n     we could do more good by going home and listening to our \n     constituents than by staying in Washington. But the decision \n     to give the president fast-track authority is urgent and must \n     be made now. The initial steps already have been taken in \n     both Houses. Now it is up to the president, his \n     administration and congressional leaders to make the case for \n     passage.\n       Very simply, passing fast track is the right thing to do. \n     Our nation's future prosperity--the good jobs that will \n     provide a living for our children and grandchildren--will be \n     created through international trade. Members have recognized \n     this reality, on a bipartisan basis, for more than 20 years, \n     giving fast-track authority to every president from Gerald \n     Ford to George Bush.\n       Today it is more apparent than ever that the debate between \n     advocates of free trade and protectionism is over. Global \n     trade is a fact of life rather than a policy position. That \n     is why we cannot cede leadership in developing markets to our \n     competitors through inaction, thereby endangering America's \n     economic future and abandoning our responsibility to lead as \n     the sole remaining superpower.\n       During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit, it has been \n     instructive to look at China's efforts to expand its export \n     markets and international influence, not just in Asia but in \n     our own back yard. China has targeted Argentina, Brazil, \n     Chile, Mexico and Venezuela as ``strategic priorities'' to \n     develop bilateral trade. While our elected leaders continue \n     to ponder whether we will be fully engaged in the global \n     economy, China is moving forward to reach free-trade \n     agreements giving Chinese goods and services a significant \n     tariff advantage that will eliminate the U.S. edge in \n     productivity and proximity. The European Union also is \n     working with the Mercosur trading block (Argentina, Brazil, \n     Paraguay, Uruguay and associate members Chile and Bolivia) to \n     create a partnership that will exclude the United States and \n     favor European products.\n       Latin American countries are negotiating bilateral and \n     multilateral agreements at a rate that will make it \n     unnecessary for them to wait for the United States. In a \n     region that is projected to be the United States' largest \n     market in just a few years, exceeding $200 billion in trade \n     by 2002, we are allowing competitors to eliminate our natural \n     advantage. If this trend continues without any action on our \n     part, we will soon need Latin America as a trading partner \n     more than it needs us.\n       Emboldened by our inaction, French President Jacques Chirac \n     recently declared, ``Latin America's essential economic \n     interests . . . lie not with the United States but with \n     Europe.'' His comments are indicative of the growing belief \n     that the United States lacks the political will to seize the \n     lead in trade with developing nations. We must prove Chirac \n     and other of like mind wrong.\n       Some may ask why it matters whether other countries beat us \n     in securing trade pacts with developing nations. A better \n     question, however, is: What are we waiting for?\n       Global leadership has enormous benefits--it increases our \n     security and creates a multiplier effect for our exports. \n     When we lead, the world accepts our way of doing business and \n     our industrial standards, which, in turn, increases U.S. \n     sales abroad. If China or the European Union beat us into \n     developing markets, they will set the rules by which trade is \n     conducted and influence the evolution of industry in fast-\n     growing countries to their benefit.\n       Given that 96 percent of the world's consumers live outside \n     the United States and that the global economy will grow at \n     three times the rate of the U.S. economy, it is a certainty \n     that many of tomorrow's high-paying American jobs will be \n     created through exports. Every $1 billion in new American \n     exports creates 15,000 to 20,000 American jobs. And, already, \n     more than a quarter of our economic growth and more than 10 \n     million jobs are the direct result of overseas trade.\n       In order to honestly and thoroughly consider fast track, \n     each member of Congress must recognize that the president \n     still must consult with Congress in negotiating trade deals \n     and that no agreement will go into effect without being \n     passed by a majority in both houses of Congress. Fast track \n     is a vote on process, not on substance. It would be a \n     travesty for the leader of the greatest nation on earth not \n     to be free to negotiate with his counterparts as an equal.\n       The president also needs to lead on this issue. As the \n     leader of his party, as well as our nation, President Clinton \n     must step up his efforts to persuade fellow Democrats to \n     support this initiative. Fast track will not pass the House \n     with a few dozen votes from the minority: We need an all-out \n     presidential push. The fate of fast track legislation this \n     fall may determine whether the president ever will negotiate \n     another trade agreement.\n       The private sector--the companies that will create new jobs \n     based on exports--also must make more forcefully the case to \n     the American public and Congress that passing fast-track \n     legislation is vital to America's continued economic growth.\n       If Congress fails to pass fast-track legislation before \n     adjourning for the year, the danger is that, because of \n     election-year politics in 1998, it will not pass until the \n     106th Congress in 1999--or even 2001, after the next \n     presidential election. By then, the working people of America \n     will have lost unnecessarily.\n       Global trade is inevitable, and presidential fast-track \n     authority is indispensable if America is to lead the \n     community of nations into the next century.\n       Now is the time for the president and Congress to work \n     together and pass fast-track legislation.\n       (The writer is former Senate majority leader and the \n     Republican nominee for president in 1996.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11577-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, farmers face a great deal of uncertainty. \nThe uncontrollable forces of nature or a volatile market can destroy a \nfarmer's livelihood without warning. When the crops are planted, \ngrowers worry about whether they'll be enough rain--or too much; \nwhether supply will be too great or demand too small; whether prices \nwill be too low, or production costs too high. For tobacco growers, \nthese unavoidable concerns were compounded when the tobacco industry \nand the 40 states' attorneys general unveiled their global settlement \nof tobacco issues on June 20 of this year. The parties did not address \nhow the settlement would affect America's tobacco growers and their \ncommunities.\n  Much has happened since that time. Congressional hearings have been \nheld, legislation has been drafted, and the President has reviewed the \nglobal settlement. A common theme runs through these separate actions, \nand that theme is that tobacco farmers and the families and communities \nthat depend on them should not be punished by comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation. I believe the President said it best when he remarked \nduring his discussion of the tobacco settlement in September that:\n\n       We have a responsibility to [tobacco growers]. They haven't \n     done anything wrong. They haven't done anything illegal. \n     They're good, hardworking, tax-paying citizens, and they have \n     not caused this problem. And we cannot let them, their \n     families, or their communities just be crippled and broken by \n     this. And, I don't think of the public health community wants \n     to do that * * * We're trying to change America and make \n     everybody whole. And they deserve a chance to have\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\n     their lives, and be made whole, and to go on with the future \n     as well.\n\n  My staff and I have been working for a number of months on a proposal \nI believe may offer a means of making tobacco growers whole and \nproviding the resources necessary to expand economic opportunities in \ntobacco-dependent regions. While we have discussed these concepts with \nvarious people, I would like to describe it more fully now so I can get \nbroader feedback from interested parties. In putting together this \nproposal, we have talked to tobacco growers, local government officials \ninterested in economic development, agricultural economists and members \nof the public health community.\n  To reduce youth smoking, health advocates seek an immediate and \nsubstantial increase in the price of tobacco products. If Congress \nadopts this strategy, it will have a substantial effect throughout the \ntobacco-growing regions, and I believe we have an obligation to provide \na soft landing for the people who would be affected.\n  The plan we developed contains several components. First, it would \ncompensate quota owners for the value of their quota, which is likely \nto be eroded over time by this government action. Second, it would \ndismantle the existing Federal tobacco program, which has been under \nannual assault, and reinstitute a privatized supply-limiting program. \nThird, it would target economic development funds to tobacco-dependent \ncommunities, to be used to attract quality jobs and train individuals \nfor them. The effect of these changes, which I will describe in more \ndetail, would be to give quota holders the value of their asset, \nguarantee that producers retain a program stabilizing the supply and \nprice of tobacco, reduce operating costs to the grower by eliminating \nthe expenses associated with buying or leasing quota, make domestic \ntobacco more competitive, and provide long-term economic development.\n  Buy-out of quota asset.--Tobacco quota refers to the amount of \ntobacco that can be produced domestically. Last year, there were 1.5 \nbillion pounds of tobacco quota. Today, quota owned by an individual, \nwhich represents the proportion of the total amount of domestic quota \nan owner has the right to produce, is an asset which can be bought or \nsold or leased. Its value has accrued over time, and for many in \ntobacco-producing regions it is the major asset used to pay for \nretirement. Farmers acquire quota throughout their lives so they can \ngrow tobacco to sustain their families, and then in retirement sell or \nlease it to others for income. A substantial and immediate increase in \nthe price of tobacco products will decrease demand and will reduce the \namount of quota. This erodes the value accrued by quota-holders, as \ntheir proportionate share declines with demand. Since so many have \ninvested in this asset, many of whom rely on it for retirement, it is \nappropriate to compensate for the decline in value caused by a radical \nchange in government policy.\n  I propose giving quota owners $8/pound for their quota. The funds \nwould be paid out in five annual installments of $1.60/pound based on \nthe 3-year average--1995-1997--of their basic quota. To avoid serious \ntax consequences, which would be the government giving with one hand \nand taking away with the other, the funds could be placed in a tax-\ndeferred 401(k)-type plan, or used tax-free to reduce debt associated \nwith acquiring the quota. This program would convert existing quota \ninto cash, it would terminate the existing tobacco quota system, and a \nnew program would be instituted to give growers the right to grow \ntobacco through the issuance of licenses.\n  New Tobacco Program.--It is crucial that we reconstitute some form of \nsupply-limiting tobacco program. Without one, production shifts to \nlarge agribusinesses that are encouraged to grow as much tobacco as \npossible. The price for tobacco would plummet, and many communities \nwhere tobacco is now grown would be immediately devastated. A supply-\nlimiting program stabilizes the price of tobacco, so that wild swings \ndon't put small growers out of business, and limits production. While \nmany agricultural commodity programs have moved away from the supply-\nlimiting approach, I believe it is still appropriate in the unique case \nof tobacco. There is no other farm product where the ultimate goal is \nto increase the cost to consumers, not decrease it. In addition, the \nfree market isn't so free in the tobacco industry, because there are \nessentially only four buyers who have unparalleled control over the \nmarket. To require farmers to contract individually with the few large \nbuyers is to put the farmers at a gross competitive disadvantage.\n  The new tobacco program should be privatized to the extent possible. \nNo one enjoys the annual uncertainty that follows from constant \nattempts to end the tobacco program. Growers, who benefit from the \nprogram, should be willing to take on the obligation of running it. \nOnce all the quota has been bought out, the new system would grant \nlicenses to actual tobacco producers. These licenses would go to all \nproducers, whether they were quota holders, tenant farmers or quota \nleasees. There would be no significant cost associated with acquiring \nthe licenses. These licenses would give the farmer the right to \ncontinue growing tobacco, but unlike the previous system that right \ncould not be bought or sold or leased. In other words, that license, \nunlike quota, would not be a liquid asset. If the grower decided to \nstop exercising the right to produce granted by the license, the \nlicense would be surrendered to the issuing authority, which could then \nreissue the license to another grower. By wringing the value out of \nquota through the buy-out, producers will no longer face the expense of \nleasing or buying quota. Once that cost of operation is eliminated--\nwhich represents about 40 cents of the price of a pound of flue-cured \ntobacco--the producer can be more competitive, both here and overseas. \nAnd by being more competitive, the decline in quota will not be as \nsteep, and growers will not suffer the severe dislocation that a sudden \ndrop in quota would create, whether that drop is caused by decreased \ndemand or increased costs of production.\n\n  I would like to see the creation of a privatized authority that would \ngovern the production, marketing, importation, exportation, and \nconsumer quality assurance of U.S. farm produced tobacco. This \nauthority, which I'll call the Tobacco Production Control Corporation, \ncould have a varied membership, and one option would be to have an \nauthority with 21 members. The members would include the Secretary of \nAgriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nAdministrator of EPA, the U.S. Trade Representative, nine \nrepresentatives of Tobacco Loan Associations, four rotating \nrepresentatives of the public health community, one representative from \ndomestic cigarette manufacturers, one representative form the domestic \nexport leaf dealers, one representative from tobacco marketing \nfacilities, one representative from the Tobacco Marketing and Quality \nAssurance Corporation, and one representative from the agriculture \ndepartment of a tobacco state university.\n  The Tobacco Loan Associations would be comprised of all licensees of \neach respective type of tobacco. Initially, licenses would be issued to \nall tobacco growers based on the 3-year average--1995-1997--of tobacco \nthey produced. The Tobacco Loan Associations would issue licenses to \ncontrol the quantity of tobacco production, and would assure compliance \nby levying fines. Additionally, they would arrange for financing and \nadministration of price supports, including the right to receive, \nprocess, store, and sell any U.S. produced tobacco received as \ncollateral for private price support loans.\n  The Tobacco Marketing and Quality Assurance Corporation would be \ncreated to determine and describe the physical characteristics of U.S. \nfarm-produced tobacco and unmanufactured imported tobacco, operate a \ncrop insurance program, and assure the physical and chemical integrity \nof U.S. produced and imported unmanufactured tobacco. This would insure \nthat the tobacco being used in domestically manufactured tobacco \nproducts is of the highest quality and is free from prohibited physical \nand chemical agents. The Quality Assurance Corporation would consist of \na CEO hired by the Tobacco Production Control Corporation and a staff \nexperience in the sampling and analysis of unmanufactured tobacco and \ncapable of collecting data and monitoring tobacco production and \nconsumption information.\n\n[[Page S11581]]\n\n  These are the elements that could constitute a new tobacco program. \nUnder this proposed program, once the quota holder has received the \nvalue of the asset, a new system of regulating the production of \ntobacco would be created. This approach honors the value of quota, \nretains the price stabilizing benefits of the tobacco program but \neliminates the current costs associated with acquiring quota, making \ndomestic tobacco more competitive in the future. I'd like to \nacknowledge the insightful contribution of Henry Maxey, a tobacco \ngrower from Pittsylvania County, who first presented this idea to a \nmember of my staff in a meeting a few months ago in the Halifax office \nof Delegate Ted Bennett. While I've gotten input from an number of \npeople since then, Mr. Maxey should be credited with getting the ball \nrolling.\n  Economic Development.--I would like to devote $250 million annually \nfor economic diversification in tobacco-dependent communities. \nUnfortunately, the biggest export in many of the tobacco-growing \nregions is the children. They leave the area because there aren't \nenough high quality jobs in the community. Tobacco legislation provides \nus a unique opportunity to address this situation. The economic \ndevelopment funds should be used for two purposes: attracting quality \njobs and training people to fill them.\n  I believe that economic development activities are best generated \nfrom those most familiar with a community's needs. Generally speaking, \nI believe that economic development funds should go to counties to \ncarry out those activities that best suit their needs. I would envision \nthat the funds would be distributed to localities based on their \nproportionate share of the amount of tobacco produced annually, which \nis a rough approximation of how dependent each community is on tobacco \nincome. In order to foster long-range thinking and coordination in the \nregion, the communities should develop and submit economic development \nplans. In the case where an independent city is surrounded by a \ntobacco-dependent county, but doesn't itself produce tobacco, \nrepresentatives from the city should have a voice in the development of \nthe county's economic development plan, due to the economic \ninterdependence of the two independent governments.\n  In some circumstances, counties have banded together to form regional \neconomic development commissions, like the A.L. Philpott Southside \nEconomic Development Commission in Virginia. In that case, the \ncommission should be given the authority to coordinate the economic \ndevelopment funds, allowing the various counties to benefit from a \nregional approach. Such an approach would avoid duplicative efforts to \nprovide the same services or attract the same industries as a neighbor \nin the region, making the funds more effective. When coordinating the \neconomic development investments, the commission will be required to \ntarget a certain percentage of the funds to the most tobacco-dependent \ncounties as determined by their proportionate share of the amount of \ntobacco produced annually. This approach combines regional planning \nwith local investment.\n  The funds can only be used for specific purposes, such as improving \nthe quality of all levels of education in the region, promoting tourism \nthrough natural resource protection, constructing advanced \nmanufacturing centers, industrial parks, water and sewer facilities and \ntransportation improvements, establishing small business incubators, \nand installing high technology infrastructure improvements. We will \nneed to insure, however, that these funds are not used to reduce the \namount of funding that would otherwise be provided by the local, State \nor Federal governments.\n  Whenever there is a major shift in a program like the one this \nproposal contemplates, we need to be concerned about providing a smooth \ntransition. In fact, the uncertainty created by the mere possibility of \nmajor tobacco legislation will undoubtedly affect tobacco growers next \nyear, who expect a serious decline in quota because these issues remain \nunresolved. To make sure that current producers can survive until this \nnew system is implemented over the 5-year buy-out period, we should \nconsider giving a minimum of income protection during this period. One \noption would be to add protections in the event tobacco quota falls by \nmore than 10 percent from 1997 levels. If that occurs, tobacco \nproducers would be eligible for a $1/pound payment for lost quota from \ntheir 1997 level. This is especially important to farmers operating \nwithout much margin, as we make the transition to a more competitive \nmarketplace.\n  I hope that these ideas generate some discussion and ultimately I \nintend to introduce legislation incorporating these ideas. My purpose \nis to find a mechanism that recognizes the changes facing the tobacco \nindustry, and provides some degree of certainty to tobacco growers and \ntheir communities so they are not faced with cataclysmic upheaval as a \nresult of those changes.\n  I look forward to working toward this particular goal with colleagues \nwho are interested in this particular challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11579-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11581-S11583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      52ND ANNUAL AL SMITH DINNER\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for half of our century--52 years--one \nof the notable events in the life of New York City has been the annual \ndinner of the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation, sponsored by the \nArchdiocese of New York, and presided over by the cardinal archbishop, \nmost recently by His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor. The foundation \nsupports the hospitals of the archdiocese.\n  The centerpiece, if you will, of the evening is the dinner speaker. \nOver the years, truly great men and women of our age have appeared in \nthe ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Kings, prime ministers--\nWinston S. Churchill was the 1947 speaker, in the company of James V. \nForrestall--and Presidents or Presidential candidates by the score. It \nfell to me to write the first draft of Averell Harriman's address when \nhe was Governor of New York; it was, I do believe, a distinction he \ntreasured ever after. And now we have had Buffalo's gift to the Nation, \nTimothy J. Russert.\n  This year the speaker was Timothy J. Russert, Moderator of ``Meet The \nPress,'' which, come to think, is celebrating its 50th anniversary just \nnow. Mr. Russert was by turns irreverent and riotous. But his purpose \nwas profoundly serious and, if you will, reverent. It is something Al \nSmith would very much wish to have had said. We are just now in a phase \nof considerable self-congratulation about American society. A world \naway from the slums and factories that Smith, with his Tammany \ncolleagues Robert F. Wagner and James A. Foley, along with Frances \nPerkins and, of course, Franklin D. Roosevelt helped transform. A world \nat once vastly improved, and grossly degraded. For in the course of \nresolving so many difficulties in our public life, we have seen a near-\nto-incomprehensible collapse in our family lives. As Mr. Russert \nstates:\n\n       At the turn of this century, just three short years from \n     now, there will be seventy million children under the age of \n     eighteen living in the United States. More than a third of \n     them, one in three, nearly twenty-five million, will have \n     been born into single parent households.\n\n  This is the central challenge to American institutions in the \ngeneration to come. Doubly so in that Congress and the President have \nchosen to eliminate the Social Security Act provision for dependent \nchildren, a drop-dead date not 4 years away.\n  Can anyone imagine Al Smith or his Industrial Commissioner Frances \nPerkins doing such a thing! One suspects that neither can Mr. Russert, \nbut this is an unnecessary speculation. What is necessary is that his \nurgent and cogent words be read and absorbed as widely as possible.\n  To this end, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of this year's address to the Al Smith dinner be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Address by Timothy J. Russert\n\n       What an honor to be here. The roster of previous speakers \n     is filled with luminaries. They are from a world I report \n     on--the world of Washington politics.\n       But for some curious reason, a strange fate seems to befall \n     those who have spoken from this podium. For example, in 1991, \n     your speaker was former White House Chief of Staff, John \n     Sununu. I should note, six weeks after appearing here, he was \n     forced to resign. As he was contemplating his future, legend \n     has it, he approached the revered First Lady, Barbara Bush, \n     poured out his heart. ``Why is\n\n[[Page S11582]]\n\n     it,'' he asked, ``that people seems to take such an instant \n     dislike to me?'' The First Lady looked at him solemnly and \n     said, ``Because it saves time John.''\n       In 1993, Bob Dole addressed the Al Smith dinner. Months \n     later, he attended a White House function for former \n     Presidents. He observed a remarkable scene. Three of your \n     former speakers, engaged in private conversation. Jimmy \n     Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon. That's right. Jimmy \n     Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon actually talking to one \n     another. In his customary stage whisper, Senator Dole blurted \n     out, ``Look at those three. See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and \n     Evil.''\n       In 1950, the year I was born, your speaker was Vice \n     President Alben Barkley. Five short years later, he was the \n     keynote speaker at Washington and Lee University's mock \n     political convention, where he concluded his inspirational \n     address by bellowing, ``I would rather be a servant of the \n     Lord than sit in the seat of the mighty.'' Which was a \n     prudent thing to say, because he promptly dropped dead of a \n     heart attack. But nothing can equal your stellar line up in \n     1972. Your guest speakers, Kurt Waldheim and Spiro Agnew. Who \n     booked that one? What were you thinking of?\n       A quick news update. I can report tonight that President \n     Clinton is feeling a little better about Chelsea going off to \n     college. He just figured out it freed up another bedroom for \n     fund raising. It's not fair just to poke fun at politicians. \n     We in television news certainly have our shortcomings. It \n     seems we reduce everything to sound bites, devoid of content \n     or nuance. David Brinkley recently observed, the way \n     television news would report the unveiling of the Ten \n     Commandments in 1997, would be as follows:\n       ``Moses came down from the mountain top today with the Ten \n     Commandments. Here's Sam Donaldson with the three most \n     important.''\n       Yogi Berra said it best after flunking his English exam for \n     the third time. I guess he wanted to go to journalism school. \n     The teacher ran down the aisle, shook him and said, Yogi, \n     don't you know anything? He looked up and said, ``I don't \n     even suspect anything.'' I've had a few of my own humbling \n     experiences. I am a recovering Buffalo Bills fan. For four \n     years I took Meet the Press to the site of the Super Bowl. At \n     the last game, in the Georgia Dome, the studio director was \n     saying in my ear piece, ``You have thirty seconds, fill.'' So \n     I looked into the camera and I said, ``Well, now it's in \n     God's hands. And God is good and God is just. Please God, one \n     time, go Bills!''\n       As I walked off the set, my colleague Tom Brokaw said, \n     ``You Irish Catholics are shameless. You can't pray on the \n     air.'' I said, I just did, Tom, and you'll see. Well, the \n     Dallas Cowboys snuck by the Bills, 52 to 17. As I moped back \n     to the hotel, Tom looked up and said, ``Hey Russert, I guess \n     God's a Southern Baptist.'' But by far, the most \n     extraordinary event in my life was when I first joined NBC in \n     1984 as the executive in charge of the Today program. I had \n     grown up in Buffalo, watching a flickering black and white TV \n     set with then Today cast of Dave Garroway and J. Fred Muggs.\n       I was determined to reinvigorate the Today Show--to travel \n     the program around the world, to bring people to places they \n     couldn't afford to go, or never see in their lifetime. Steve \n     Friedman, the Executive Producer at that time said, you're \n     right. Where should we go? I said, in the Spring, nothing \n     better than Italy. The vibrancy, the fashion, the music, the \n     art. And if we time it right, perhaps we could bring our \n     viewers behind the walls of the Vatican--where Catholics and \n     non-Catholics would have an opportunity to see the mysteries \n     of that remarkable institution.\n       Friedman said, ``You're right. Get the Pope.'' I said, \n     ``Get the Pope? Friedman, that's a big booking. I used to be \n     an alter boy, but there are a few steps in between.'' So I \n     wrote a letter to the Pope, and heard nothing back. I then \n     faxed it to our bureau in Warsaw and had it translated into \n     Polish. I journeyed to Philadelphia and met with the late \n     Joseph Cardinal Krol, God bless him. A close friend of the \n     Pope who is also of Polish descent. He read my letter, was \n     very taken that it was written in vernacular Polish and said, \n     ``Are you Polish?''\n       I realized it would be inappropriate to respond with \n     anything but the truth. And I said, ``No, but I'm from \n     Buffalo, some of my best friends are!'' Suddenly the phone \n     rang and Cardinal Krol said, ``Would you like to come to the \n     Cathedral? The young Diocesan Boy's Choir is preparing for \n     Christmas.'' I said, ``There's nothing I'd rather do than \n     listen to those little cherubs lift the rafters of the \n     Cathedral.'' We went and they were magnificent. After about \n     fifteen minutes, Cardinal Krol turned to me and said, ``You \n     know, Mr. Russert, my dream is to one day have these young \n     men sing for the Holy Father.'' And I said, ``This is a \n     Cardinal!''\n       And having been trained by the Jesuits and the Sisters of \n     Mercy, I quickly amended my letter to say, if His Holiness \n     accepts our invitation, NBC will of course be accompanied by \n     the Arch Diocesan Boy's Choir of Philadelphia. Who else? Two \n     weeks later the phone rang. It was Cardinal Krol. He asked me \n     to come to Rome and to meet with the Pope's advisors. And it \n     was an extraordinary week as we went from meeting to meeting \n     and ultimately I was lead into a room about this size. It was \n     empty, but for myself. And suddenly the door opened, and \n     there stood, dressed on white, the Holy Father, in my church, \n     the Vicar of Christ.\n       And as he approached me, my mind quickly turned from NBC's \n     ratings and Bryant Gumbel's career to the prospect of \n     salvation. And you heard this tough, hard-hitting, no-\n     nonsense moderator of Meet the Press begin by saying, ``Bless \n     me Father.'' He approached me, took me by the arm and said, \n     ``You are the man called Timothy from NBC.''\n       I said, ``Your Holiness, please don't ever forget this \n     face.''\n       He said, ``They tell me you're an important man.''\n       I said, ``Your Holiness, with all due and deep respect, \n     there are only two of us in this room--and I'm a most distant \n     second.''\n       He put his hand on my shoulders, looked me in the eyes and \n     said, ``Right.''\n       His Holiness agreed to greet the Today Show on live \n     American television, a first. And I told Bryant Gumbel and \n     Jane Pauley that this would be different. That they had met \n     Presidents and Kings and Queens and Senators and Governors, \n     but never the Pope. Bryant, who happened to be Catholic said, \n     ``Don't worry, I can handle it.''\n       Suddenly the Pope appeared on television. It was Bryant's \n     chance to ask him a question--direct to the people of \n     America. And Bryant said, ``Your Holiness, these are pictures \n     of my children. Would you please bless them?''\n       And Jane Pauley jumping in said, ``I have twins!''\n       An extraordinary week from the Vatican for NBC. I was \n     accompanied by my wife who was pregnant. The Holy Father \n     blessed her womb and said, ``Please bring your baby back to \n     Rome next year.'' We did just that, and as we stood in the \n     first row of the Papal audience, we proudly held our son \n     Luke, who was wearing a white T-shirt with red letters, Totus \n     Tuus. All Yours. That is the Pope's personal motto, which he \n     uttered to the blessed Virgin after being shot. ``Blessed \n     Mother,'' He said, ``if I live, I will rededicate my life to \n     you. Totus Tuus.'' All Yours.\n       The Pope spotted Luke, rushed towards him, took him in his \n     arms, held him high, admiring his face, his shirt. Exclaimed \n     over and over again, very nice, very nice. I of course, had \n     an NBC crew standing by, taping the entire event. I dubbed it \n     into slow motion and shipped it to my Italian mother in law. \n     After sharing it with her friends for several hours, even she \n     is willing now to admit, there is some value in having an \n     Irish son in law. But my wish that day in Rome is the same I \n     have tonight. That all our children in New York will be as \n     blessed and loved as my own, as your own.\n       Tonight you have taken an important first step. Your dinner \n     tickets will fund pre and post natal care for teenage moms \n     and their babies. But this must only be the beginning of our \n     efforts. At the turn of this century, just three short years \n     from now, there will be seventy million children under the \n     age of eighteen living in the United States. More than a \n     third of them, one in three, nearly twenty-five million, will \n     have been born into single parent households. Many of them \n     kids having kids. And we all know what that means for most of \n     them. Your Senator Pat Moynihan warned about this thirty-five \n     years ago, but the nation did not listen.\n       And now we have a generation of children who will not have \n     a life of love and discipline and values, but an existence of \n     drugs and gangs and sickness, and too often, death. Fifteen \n     children a day are shot dead in the United States of America. \n     The health care facilities of this nation, of this diocese, \n     are going to be overwhelmed by these children. Oh how I wish \n     we could change behavior, and try we must. For these children \n     will either be our future work force who respect people and \n     property and get to work on time, or they will be our future \n     crime statistics.\n       Hopefully someday our society will proclaim its central \n     mission is to convince our young people to finish school, \n     learn a skill, get a job, get married and then have a baby. \n     In that order. This, I believe, is the most important \n     economic, national security and moral issue facing our \n     nation. But in the meantime, we cannot just ignore the \n     children in need. That is what Al Smith told us. It's what \n     John Cardinal O'Connor has shown us. You won't read about it \n     in the tabloids or see it on TV. He has refused to publicize \n     his compassion, but your Cardinal has personally cared for \n     more than one thousand people with AIDS.\n       Going alone at night, he holds their hands, empties their \n     bed pans, combs their hair. Simply sitting with them in the \n     final days of their life. It is called living the gospel. \n     Helping the poorest of the poor, the sickest of the sick. \n     That's what Al Smith did, and it's what John O'Connor does. \n     And so must we all. I was hungry and you gave me food. I was \n     thirsty and you gave me drink. I was sick and you took care \n     of me. Words to reflect on as we return tonight to the \n     comfort of the Upper East Side, Westchester, Long Island or \n     wherever. Let us count our blessings but let us share our \n     blessings with vigor and new urgency.\n       Tutoring, mentoring, being even more generous to the Al \n     Smith Foundation. Catholic charities, the inner city \n     scholarship fund. Together we can redirect lives and probably \n     even save a few souls. Embrace the spirit of the happy \n     warrior, Al Smith, and the holy warrior, John O'Connor. Two \n     men it will always be said, who fought the good fight and who \n     kept the faith. By the quiet eloquence of their example, they \n     have defined our mission here tonight. To nurture and protect \n     the uniqueness, the dignity, and the preciousness of life \n     from beginning to end.\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\n       To care and to share. That is our charge. That is our \n     challenge. As we leave the 52nd Annual Al Smith dinner, we \n     remember the words of your speaker from 1960. ``Let us go \n     forth asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here \n     on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.''

Mr. President, I feel very strongly that we should \ngive the President fast-track authority before we adjourn. He needs \nfast-track authority. We are not saying what is going to be in the \ntrade bill that comes after the fast-track authority.\n  It is extremely important to remember that fast-track authority is \nsomething every President has had since 1974. There is absolutely \nnothing new in it. The idea that we would withhold from the President \nfast-track authority on the notion that only the Congress can negotiate \ntrade agreements--Lord help us when it comes to the point where the \nCongress has to negotiate trade agreements. There are some trade \nagreements where we can put our imprimatur on that trade agreement, for \nexample: NAFTA, which I voted against; GATT, which I voted for; Chile, \nwhich would be upcoming; or others.\n  But let's understand that in virtually all cases the President could \ngo ahead and negotiate, his people at the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice could go ahead and negotiate trade agreements, and what the \nCongress thinks or does not think does not really apply. We would, \nobviously, watch that, and in the Finance Committee we watch trade very \nclosely.\n  The whole notion of withholding from the President of the United \nStates, in a highly visible action, withholding fast-track authority \nfrom the President of the United States, doing that in the Senate or in \nthe House or both, is absolutely unthinkable in terms of good judgment, \nas far as I'm concerned.\n  I can tell you in my own State of West Virginia which is not exactly \nlocated on either the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, that trade and exports \nare a tremendous part of our economy. We have tens of thousands of \npeople who are working exclusively because of international trade. We \nneed to be increasing that. We need to be opening up new markets not \nonly as the State of West Virginia but also as a nation. There are \nabout 11.5 million jobs in this country right now which are exclusively \nrelated to international trade. We ought to be pursuing that.\n  One of the people that I work with was talking with somebody from the \nU.S. Trade Representative's office the other day and that person had \njust come back from a certain part of the world--I think, South \nAmerica--and said that other countries are going ahead and making \nagreements and cutting deals on trade and that they are bypassing the \nUnited States because we are withholding fast-track authority. It is \nexpired. It doesn't exist. We have to reauthorize it. We need to \nreauthorize it.\n  Somehow, also, the idea that the United States exists all by \nourselves in this world doesn't make sense anymore, much less the U.S. \nSenate being able to sit and determine what will happen in the world. I \nthink the history of the last week and what has happened with the stock \nmarkets has shown that transactions are international, they are \ninstantaneous, they are electronic, they depend enormously upon each \ncountry taking the maximum advantage of the comparative advantage which \nit has in terms of goods which it produces. The United States has an \nenormous comparative advantage. Not to take full advantage of that \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  Actually, it might interest some people to know that West Virginia, \nwhich is not thought of as an internationally related State, in fact, \nis. In terms of the proportion of the jobs in our State which are \nrelated to products which are exported internationally, only three or, \nmaximum, four other States export more of what they produce \nproportionately than does the State of West Virginia. So here is a \nState in the middle of the Appalachian mountains--not just because of \ncoal, not just because of steel, but because of many things--we are \nhighly dependent on the international trade environment.\n  Mr. President, I remember several years ago when fast track was still \nin existence. We had two votes. One was on something called NAFTA; the \nother was on something called GATT. We could have done neither of those \nunless we had first made sure that the President had fast-track \nauthority, which he did. I happen to think NAFTA was a bad deal for the \nState of West Virginia and I think I have been proved correct. I would \ndefinitely vote again as I did then, which was to vote negatively.\n  On the other hand, GATT was tremendously important to the State of \nWest Virginia. As somebody who is interested in trade, I went to Geneva \nto work with some of the international trade folks where the GATT, the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade, was being negotiated. I worked \non antidumping. That is central to West Virginia's steel industry. I \nworked on countervailing duties. That is central to America's trading \ninterests. Also, circumvention. Most people don't know what \ncircumvention is. Here is a good example. Sony television used to make \nall of its television sets in Japan, and then export them to Mexico \nwith everything done but the front piece glass--not the tube that \nactually radiates the pictures but the front piece of glass. That would \nbe added on in Mexico and then would be exported into the United States \nfrom Mexico, counting as a Mexican import. That is circumvention for \nthe purposes of trade law. In the GATT we were able to stop that. So \nSony had to build a plant in America, hiring 1,000 American workers, to \ndo what they had previously done in an entirely different fashion.\n  Trade law is important. Section 337 has everything to do with \nintellectual property protection. It is the future of our information \ntechnology that is at stake. So we could not even have negotiated the \nGATT agreement without fast track. I'm saying that the President of the \nUnited States and his team of negotiators ought to have the right to \nnegotiate a critical trade agreement as they choose, but then we would \nhave the right to either approve it or disapprove it according to how \nwe felt. I think that is a perfectly reasonable relationship.\n  The Congress, in a sense, we up or down the trade agreement, but we \ndon't down the process through which the administration can get into \nthe trade agreement. We don't simply say, ``fast track you are not \ngoing to have,'' so you can't begin to negotiate a trade agreement.\n  I think that is totally counter to the purposes of international \ntrade and frankly to the interests of my own State. So I hope that in \nthe Senate and these coming days as we debate this issue that we would \ngive the President of the United States the fast-track authority which \nPresident Reagan had, which President Ford had, which President Carter \nhad, which President Bush had, and which President Bill Clinton ought \nto be able to have.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11583-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11584-S11588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CHARLES ROSSOTTI, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, TO BE \n                    COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2:45 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now go into executive session and \nproceed to the nomination of Charles  Rossotti, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Charles Rossotti, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for debate on the nomination shall be \nlimited to 3 hours, with 60 minutes under the control of the Democratic \nleader or his designee, 90 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. Moynihan], and 30 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Delaware [Mr. Roth].\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we consider the nomination of Charles O. \nRossotti to become the new Commissioner of the IRS, it's appropriate \nthat we pause to take a good look at that agency as a whole. Let me say \nfrom the beginning, that Mr. Rossotti--who came before the Finance \nCommittee just a little over 1 week ago--is uniquely suited to this \nconfirmation. I am impressed by him and his background. Mr. Rossotti is \na successful businessman--in touch with the needs, concerns, and risk-\ntaking mindset of entrepreneurs. He has made his mark as a management \nconsultant and expert on computer systems--a vital background at a time \nwhen one of the agency's major setbacks is its dysfunctional \ninformation system. I intend to vote for Mr. Rossotti's confirmation, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Having said this, I also want to say something about the Internal \nRevenue Service and its current condition. September 23 to 25, the \nFinance Committee held what will be the first in a series of hearings \nto probe an agency that is cloaked in more secrecy than the FBI and the \nCIA. What we learned in our initial hearings was so disturbing that the \nIRS--its stories of abuses, mismanagement, lack of accountability and \nperverse incentives--continues to captivate the attention of taxpayers \neverywhere.\n  As last month ended, the House Ways and Means Committee, with the \nsupport of the White House, moved legislation to restructure the IRS. \nChairman Archer is to be commended for his work. I compliment him on \nthe job he has done in reversing the White House's position on the \nissue.\n  The growing effort to restructure and reform the IRS reflects the \ngrowing concern about the agency. Congressional switchboards have been \ninundated with calls from Americans who have their own tales of IRS-\ninduced woe. Likewise, we have received thousands of letters, faxes, e-\nmails and notes--some of them hand delivered--each detailing another \nstory of power run amok. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll \nshows that 21 percent of Americans report to have had some dealings \nwith the IRS, in addition to simply filing their taxes. Of these \nAmericans, a full 42 percent felt they were treated unfairly. Forty-two \npercent. And as if these statistics aren't compelling enough, the poll \nfound that 70 percent of Americans believe that the incidents of abuse \nand mistreatment by the IRS that we uncovered in our hearings occur on \na regular basis.\n  Mr. President, our hearings, these statistics--and the growing \nconsensus we're witnessing in Washington--make it clear that something \nmust be done to rechart the course of this powerful agency. On the \nTuesday following our hearings, the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nActing Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service held a joint press \nconference to introduce what has been called a list of mini-\ninitiatives. These included: keeping offices and telephone lines open \none Saturday a month to address taxpayer grievances; giving taxpayers \n``customer feedback surveys''; and, rewriting taxpayer notices in plain \nlanguage.\n  Beyond these reforms, the agency, itself, has suspended four IRS \nmanagers, demonstrating an increased awareness of the abuses disclosed \nin our three-day hearings.\n  Each of these measures is a welcomed change. As Acting Commissioner \nMichael Dolan told the committee--that the IRS has made mistakes, \nhandled taxpayer cases very badly, and caused Americans to suffer in \nways they should not have. Acting Commissioner Dolan testified that the \nInternal Revenue Service has disrupted . . . lives without excuse.\n  My concern, Mr. President, is that these initiatives--though \nwelcomed--may still be insufficient to meet all the problems that \naffect the IRS. To understand how the Government can collect the \nnecessary and proper amount of taxes in a way that does not harass, \nabuse or overly burden the American taxpayer will take a thorough \nexamination--one that engages not only Congress, but the agency and the \nadministration.\n  Such a thorough examination will require 6103 authority--the \nauthority granted to only two Members of Congress. Only by \nappropriately using that authority can we have a complete understanding \nof what must be done to properly restructure and reform the IRS.\n  The hearings we held a few weeks ago were intended as a solid \nbeginning in a process that must be comprehensive. It is likely that we \nwill get only one shot at restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. \nWe must make certain that reform legislation addresses all the problems \nthat we are in the process of discovering.\n  The problems--administratively and culturally--within the agency are \nthe culmination of a history where power has been left unchecked, where \nobjectives have been misapplied and priorities misplaced. They exist \ndespite past reform efforts. And unless they are appropriately \naddressed this time around, they will continue to plague the agency.\n  Despite past efforts at reform, Lord Acton's phrase about absolute \npower is still given frightening clarity in an agency that--as we have \nshown--resorts to unethical or illegal tactics in dealing with \ntaxpayers. Our hearings showed how IRS employees use pseudonyms, \ndespite the fact that they are prohibited according to the agency's \nmanual. We showed how blue sky assessments are made against Americans--\nassessments that have no basis in fact or tax law. We showed how they \nare used to hurt the taxpayer, or simply to raise the individual \nstatistics of an IRS employee. We showed how statistics and quotas are \nused to rate employees, despite the fact that such usage is strictly \nprohibited, and how levies and seizures are used to measure employee \nperformance.\n  We listened to heartbreaking testimony by courageous witnesses--\nprivate citizens whose lives have been torn apart by the IRS, as well \nas current employees of the agency who speak of horrific tactics and \npractices within the agency. One witness has disclosed how IRS abuse \nled to suicides, the break up of families, the destruction of \nbusinesses, and loss of financial credit and personal reputation.\n  Employees testified concerning a culture of secrecy, vindictiveness, \nabuse, and retribution that exists within the agency, itself--often \ntargeted against employees, themselves. And let me say here, Mr. \nPresident, the vast number of IRS employees are good, hard-working, \nhonest men and women. Without the help of the employees themselves, our \nhearings would have been impossible. We discovered that IRS employees \nwant change. They understand that change is necessary. They are \nperforming an extremely difficult duty--an important duty--under \nextremely difficult circumstances.\n  We heard of false allegations of wrongdoing against targeted \nemployees. We learned about one senior agent who discovered an \nelectronic listening device in the IRS employee break room, the area \nwhere agency employees are supposed to be able to relax and hold \ninformal conversations. The room, Mr. President, had been bugged. \nButtons were found under the desks of several IRS managers who were \nlistening to their employees--violating their privacy. And as if this \ndiscovery wasn't bad enough, the senior agent who had discovered and \nreported the bugging devices was the one who was investigated. Our \nhearings, Mr. President, struck a chord with the American people. They \nstruck a chord because Americans fear the IRS. It touches the life\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n\nof every family--of every business. And our hearings struck a chord \nbecause Americans believe Congress is serious about reforming the \nagency--reform that must be thorough enough to address the problems \nthat we are continuing to uncover.\n  As I said when I opened the hearings, Congress has given the IRS \nawesome power in an effort to help the agency carry out its tremendous \nresponsibility. In that Congress has given such power, it is also \nCongress' responsibility to ensure that it is being used prudently, \nconstructively, and with regard for the taxpayer and employees of the \nagency. Working together, we must help the IRS get back to its mission \nstatement--to collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the least \ncost; serve the public by continually improving the quality of our \nproducts and services; and perform in a manner warranting the highest \ndegree of public confidence in [the IRS's] integrity, efficiency, and \nfairness.''\n  Toward achieving this, we must answer three fundamental questions \nthat I posed during the Committee hearings:\n  First, does the IRS have too much power?\n  Second, if Congress were to limit that power, what expectations do we \nhave that the new limits will be more effective than the old limits?\n  And, third, how do we go about changing the culture of the IRS?\n  With the painful disclosures still lingering weeks after the \nhearings, I believe it is safe to say that we have an answer to the \nfirst question. The IRS does have too much power. The very manner by \nwhich seizures, liens, and levies can be imposed--often without due \nprocess, and the manner in which the agency has now been shown to abuse \nthose methods of tax collection-- suggests that the IRS's power is \nbeyond what would be considered necessary and prudent.\n  Now, Mr. President, we must focus on the latter two questions: How \ncan Congress effectively limit the agency's power while allowing it \nsufficient authority to carry out its important responsibility? And \nwhat can we do to change the culture of the IRS?\n  As we turn our attention to these issues and consider possible \nlegislative remedies, I want us to keep the following four criteria in \nmind:\n  First, we must restructure the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS--\nlike many Federal departments and agencies--was created in the \nindustrial age. While its mission is necessary to collect the revenue \nGovernment needs to run legitimate programs and services, its \norganization, administration, and infrastructure must be engineered to \nmeet the needs, demands and expectations of the information age. The \nIRS must be dedicated to service. It must be responsive to taxpayer \nneeds and above political influence.\n  Second, in restructuring the IRS, we must build into its system a \nmechanism that promotes accountability and continuous improvement. Our \nhearings raised serious problems about the lack of accountability of \nIRS employees. We found there to be little accountability for their \nactions--against taxpayers and internally, against employees of the \nagency. There is a need for a zero tolerance policy for improper and \nabusive behavior. There must be zero tolerance for failure to follow \nprocedures and regulations. Accountability must also contain \nappropriate restraints on powers--especially the use of liens, levies \nand seizures--to assure that taxpayers are treated fairly. It must \ninclude a top to bottom review of employee evaluations, and make \ncertain that such evaluations are not based on goals, quotas or \nstatistics. There must be no promotion in spite of abusive behavior. \nAnd accountability certainly includes the ability to identify IRS \nemployees. The IRS must include signatures on correspondence and do \naway with false identifications.\n  Third, comprehensive reform must address the issue of due process for \ntaxpayers. Our investigation and hearings disclose cases where innocent \ntaxpayers had liens placed against their homes, where they had their \nautomobiles seized and bank accounts frozen without notification or the \nright to appeal. Restructuring and reforming the agency must include \nstrengthening and implementing fundamental procedures for due process, \nand those procedures must be followed to protect and serve the \ntaxpayer.\n  Fourth, and finally, reform and restructuring the IRS must result in \nmore timely results for taxpayer problems. Our hearings showed that the \nIRS does not fix problems within a reasonable time frame. Change in \nthis area must go beyond the systemic to embrace the culture within the \nIRS, as well.\n  Just as in the private sector, an employee's promotion should be \nbased on his or her ability to serve the client--to resolve problems, \nnot create them--to assure that a fair and appropriate tax has been \npaid, and not to harass or intimidate the client into paying more than \nis due.\n  These Mr. President are changes that can be made. Service must be the \nhallmark of the IRS. It is certainly the hallmark of America's finest \ncorporations. Each day they become more effective and efficient, more \nservice oriented and customer friendly. If they do not, they are \nquickly overtaken by other concerns, or they go out of business \naltogether. A mechanism that establishes self-sustaining improvement \nwithin the IRS is critical to the future of that agency.\n  As I said during the hearings, just as the IRS is quick to say that \nno honest taxpayer should ever fear an agency audit, the IRS itself \nshould never fear congressional oversight. Congress must continue its \noversight. One discovery from our first series of hearings is that it \nwas the first time the full Senate Finance Committee--which has IRS \noversight authority--has ever held such hearings. Congress must be \nvigilant. Our current efforts must lay a foundation for systematic \noversight.\n  These four recommendations that have come immediately out of our \nhearings lay a strong foundation for the reform process. We have a \nconsensus that something must be done. What we do must build on this \nmomentum to assure that our effort at reform and restructuring is based \non a complete understanding of the problems and necessary remedies.\n  Toward this end, the Finance Committee will continue to investigate \nand hold hearings. When Congress returns next year, the Finance \nCommittee will hold additional hearings and work to act on reform and \nrestructuring that addresses all the problems and concerns disclosed \nthus far. We will work with the House, the President, and Commissioner \nRossotti--once he's been confirmed--to ensure that not only is there a \ncomplete understanding of the challenges and problems currently \nplaguing the IRS. We must ensure that such efforts at restructuring and \nreforming are complete, workable, and effective in making this powerful \nagency more efficient, more service oriented, and less frightening to \nhonest Americans.\n  Mr. Rossotti has a background and the experience that will be \ninvaluable in helping us bring about the kind of changes we believe are \nneeded in the agency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, our revered chairman, in calling up \nthis important nomination of Mr. Charles O. Rossotti, spoke at length \nof the problems we have encountered with the Internal Revenue Service \nand spoke of the need for public confidence in that agency and the \nmanner in which our tax revenues are collected.\n  He spoke of the determination of the Committee on Finance to see that \nthis issue is addressed fully, comprehensively, and carefully. I would \nlike to stand here and say that as this goes forward, there can be \ncomplete public confidence in the chairman of the Committee on Finance, \nSenator Roth, that it will be done in a nonpartisan way. I don't think \nI should use the word ``bipartisan,'' because I don't think there is a \nRepublican method of collecting taxes fairly and efficiently or a \nDemocratic method. It is something that we must do properly as a \nNation.\n  We do well to remind ourselves that we began as a Nation in protest \nagainst taxation we thought was improper and illegal and that this \nissue has never been far from our concerns, although not until recently \nhas the Committee on Finance exercised its oversight jurisdiction. It \nis our duty to see what is going on in this large public agency,\n\n[[Page S11586]]\n\nwhich was founded in 1862 on the occasion when the Federal Government \nimposed for the first time an income tax. And which, as the \ndistinguished chairman said, has the organization and pattern of the \nindustrial age, as yet but little responsive to the modes of management \nwhich have emerged in a postindustrial age with great efficacy and \npublic response.\n  I am here to state that there is complete support on this side of the \naisle for the chairman's program. The particulars will emerge as we \nwork at the facts, as we uncover them. We have our first hearing on the \nIRS restructuring legislation this Wednesday. Again, I will say this is \nnot a bipartisan matter, it is a nonpartisan matter of central \nimportance to the Federal Government. As the chairman indicated in his \nclosing passage, the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner \nof the Internal Revenue Service is an important measure of cooperation \nfrom the executive branch. The chairman noted that President Clinton \nhas supported this. In particular, Secretary of the Treasury Rubin, \nmuch impressed by the work of the commission headed by a member of our \ncommittee, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and legislation introduced by \nhim and another Member, Senator Grassley of Iowa, again in an across-\nthe-aisle mode. It was Secretary Rubin who thought that the time had \ncome to bring modern management modes into the IRS and, indeed, Madam \nPresident, Mr. Rossotti will be the first Commissioner not to be a tax \nlawyer in a half century, since World War II. This is not, as Everett \nDirksen would have said, to slight the tax lawyers. They typically \ndefend the public, the individuals against the Government, and their \ntask grows steadily more rewarding as the tax code become steadily more \nincomprehensible. Still, we have brought the right man to do the job at \nthis moment.\n  I would like just to offer a brief comment, if I can have the \nindulgence of the Chair, about an article which appeared in the New \nYork Times, whilst we were contemplating this second phase of the \neffort which the chairman began with those 3 days of dramatic and \npowerful testimony. And that is an article by Paul C. Light, a \nprofessor of public affairs and political science at the University of \nMinnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, in which Professor Light pointed \nout that whatever we do to restructure and simplify the Tax Code, we \nstill have a problem of organization within the IRS itself. We still \nhave to do something to reduce the multiple layers of bureaucracy \nwhich, and I quote Dr. Light, ``leaves no one accountable for how \nagents treat taxpayers.''\n  I think you would find this is a normal development of an agency in \nplace over a very long time in which you have career public servants in \na system which has gradations of compensation, and presumedly \nresponsibility that go from General Service 3 to General Service 17, \nand then there are supergrades beyond that.\n  You create this in a 19th-century mode. It is called civil service \nreform. And on this floor a century ago, 110 years ago, it was debated \nwith great vigor. It meant to take the individuals in the public employ \nout of any area of political influence, political choice, patronage of \njobs.\n  But it easily results in what Professor Light calls layering--the GS-\n5 on top of the GS-4, the GS-6 on top of the GS-5. And he gives this \nillustration, a very concise one. He said:\n\n       Just imagine a bureaucracy that goes something like this: \n     an agent--\n\n  The agent is the person who deals with the individual citizen--\n\n     an agent reports to a district group manager, who reports to \n     a branch chief, who reports to an assistant chief of the \n     division, who reports to the assistant district director, who \n     reports to the assistant regional commissioner, who reports \n     to the regional commissioner, who reports to the chief of \n     staff to a deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the \n     deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the assistant \n     commissioner, who reports to the chief operating officer, who \n     reports to the deputy commissioner, and so on.\n\n  You haven't even reached the top of the layer.\n  That is the kind of progression you will get over a century in an \norganization in which the internal incentives are to be promoted, as \nthey should be. It is how Colin Powell went from being a member of the \nPershing Rifles at City College in New York, where I began my \neducation, to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed \nForces. And they encourage them. But there can be too much. It can \nseparate accountability to the point where it cannot be found in the \nsystem.\n  It has been remarked that the Catholic Church, which has been around \nfor centuries, has managed all these years with just three layers of \nauthority. You have Pope, bishop, and priest. There are some honorific; \nevery so often a priest will be called a monsignor, but it is Pope, \nbishop, priest. And it is something to be thought about, as this whole \nsubject is considered in the Congress.\n  We spend too little time on organizational matters, too little time \non how much we have spread out agencies. I have been witness, in my \ntime in Government, to a number of sequences by which the Bureau of \nPublic Roads in the Department of Commerce, a small effective agency \nknown in the 1920's and 1930's for its very vigorous civil service that \nwas mostly working on farmer market roads, and then comes some other \nlegislation, the interstate highway program, and the next thing you \nknow you have the Department of Transportation.\n  I have seen small activities in the field of education. We had a \ncommissioner of education, oh, going back a long way, and various able \npersons ran it. It was in the Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare. And don't you know, gradually it spun off and became the \nDepartment of Education. And there have been efforts in the other body \nto put an end to it. But by and large, these efforts are never \nsuccessful. They take longer than you think. They are not very \nrewarding. You cannot put them in a newsletter.\n  As a matter of fact, we don't have newsletters anymore. I do not want \nto speak with anything less than the fullest admiration of our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, but when I came to this \nbody each Senator had a certain amount of funds--we had the franking \nprivilege, which went back to 1790, and enabled us to write persons, to \nsend out mailings to our constituents.\n  For my part, I represent some 18 million people. You cannot meet \nthem, but you can write them. Or rather you could write them. The one \nthing from that great revolution we had across the way a few years ago \nis we abolished the one direct contact between Members of the Congress \nand the citizenry, which was the newsletter. The first one went out \nfrom Philadelphia in 1790, a gentleman from North Carolina, as I \nrecall, telling his folks that there was not much going on just then, \nbut he had hopes that there might be a tariff change which would \nimprove the sales of our local product. By ``our local product'' he \nmeant whiskey, corn whiskey, as against rum from the Caribbean. Indeed, \nit was an important source of revenue. And it kept the settlers across \nthe Appalachians connected to the Atlantic coast as against the Ohio-\nMississippi system which took them through French territory at the \ntime.\n\n  We have lost that direct contact. This agency ought not to lose its. \nI was impressed, if I may say, by Mr. Rossotti's response on this \npoint. We were speaking of these matters during his hearing, and I \nraised this issue of layering. And afterward he wrote me a letter in \nwhich he said--and I will take the liberty of quoting as I do not see \nany other Senator seeking recognition just now--he said:\n\n       Your comment about the ``layering'' that accumulates in \n     many large organizations that are organized on traditional \n     lines is getting at a very important point. Excessive \n     layering often lies at the heart of many problems, especially \n     the difficulty upper management faces in understanding \n     accurately what actually goes on in the front lines. It can \n     also slow down action to fix problems. Of course, I do not \n     yet know enough about the specific facts at the IRS to know \n     how this problem affects the IRS and what might be done about \n     it. As I begin my assessment of the situation at the IRS, \n     however, I will most certainly be thinking hard about this \n     issue.\n\n  If I may say, this is a promising response. We have had lots of \nnominations before our committee in the 21 years that you and I have \nserved there together, sir. And without in any way disparaging any of \nmy predecessors, this is the first evidence I have ever had of any of \nthe nominees listening to\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\nanything that we said. Perhaps at most they keep an ear open, thinking \nthat as soon as we stop talking, it is over, and ``I can get out of \nhere and on with my job.''\n  But to get a letter like that back--well, Mr. Rossotti is a \nmanagement specialist. He deals with modern systems. He has built an \ninternational firm for which people engage him to help them with the \nkinds of problems we have here. It is a good beginning.\n  Now, sir, one last point. The employees of the Internal Revenue \nService are well-paid public servants, but none of them makes a third \nof the salary of an average tax attorney. And the average tax attorney \nhas to master this--what is it?--9,479 pages of the Internal Revenue \nService. Look at it--9,479 pages. That speaks dereliction of our duty. \nWe can't go on producing these.\n\n  I take the liberty of displaying to the Senate and to our \ndistinguished Presiding Officer the bill we adopted on July 31--820 \npages added to the 9,479; 820 pages entitled Taxpayer Relief Act. What \ntaxpayer relief will there be from having the IRS have to understand \nwhat is in here, as well as individual taxpayers? We better watch this. \nIt is the way organizations can develop. It is a form of entropy. \nEnergy goes down the system, complexity goes up and abuse takes place.\n  We can attend to organizational matters as much as we want. We can \ncertainly attend to abuse. But until we simplify the Tax Code as a \nmultiyear effort, as one that is real, we will fail to address the \nheart of the problem. Remember the simplifiers that took over on the \nother side of the Capitol who said we will get rid of all these \ncomplexities? What did they do? They added 820 pages. That speaks to a \nsystemic problem, and we are old enough and capable enough as a society \nto address them. I, for my part, am hugely pleased that we will.\n  I want to thank again our chairman, without whom this would not be \ntaking place, and thank Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and thank Secretary \nRubin. This is a good beginning and a good note on which to start. I \nurge the confirmation of Mr. Rossotti, an extraordinarily able man.\n  I do not know that political party has ever entered into the \ncalculation of who ought to be the Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue, but I do expect that by and large it has been a person who is \nof the same party as the President who nominates him. It is an \ninteresting fact that this is not the case in this instance. I am sure \nwe will have his cooperation, and I am sure you will know how to use it \nto the greatest public advantage.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the previously referred to material \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 27, 1997.\n     Hon.

Light)\n\n       Philadelphia.--Before Congress and President Clinton create \n     an oversight board to monitor the Internal Revenue Service \n     and end taxpayer abuse at the agency, they should take \n     another look at what made that abuse possible.\n       There are simply too many layers of bureaucracy at the \n     I.R.S. which leaves no one accountable for how agents treat \n     taxpayers.\n       Creating an oversight board won't make a difference unless \n     it can see abuse happening at the bottom. The solution, then, \n     is not to add layers of supervision, but to get rid of them.\n       The I.R.S. has been lengthening the chain of command for \n     decades. In 1960, for example, the senior leadership \n     consisted of just 13 people. By 1996, despite efforts to \n     streamline the agency it had grown to more than 60.\n       There can be something like a dozen layers of supervisors \n     between the President, who is the chief executive of the \n     agency, and agents in regional offices.\n       Just imagine a bureaucracy that goes something like this: \n     an agency reports to a district group manager, who reports to \n     a branch chief, who reports to an assistant chief of the \n     division, who reports to the assistant district director, who \n     reports to the assistant regional commissioner, who reports \n     to the regional commissioner, who reports to the chief of \n     staff to a deputy assistant commissioner who reports to the \n     deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the assistant \n     commissioner, who reports to the chief operating officer, who \n     reports to the deputy commissioner, and so on.\n       No wonder rogue agents thought they could get away with \n     harassment. Had the I.R.S. added field agents instead of new \n     layers of supervisors perhaps district managers wouldn't have \n     needed to institute the collection quotas that fueled \n     taxpayer abuse.\n       Some legislators believe that simplifying the tax code is a \n     solution to the agency's problem, but that won't make the \n     I.R.S. any less likely to abuse taxpayers. The best way to \n     reduce taxpayer harassment is not a flat tax, but a flat \n     I.R.S.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I assure my distinguished colleague I will be very brief.\n  I want to point out that the hearings we held earlier this year were \nthe result of the close cooperation between the minority side and \nmajority side. I appreciate very much the full cooperation and \nassistance that the distinguished Senator from New York provided us.\n  We look forward to bringing about reform that has nonpartisan \nsupport. I think the Senator is perfectly correct. It is not a \nRepublican, it is not a Democratic, it is a nonpartisan solution that \nwe seek.\n  I have to say that I do think we are very fortunate in having a \ndistinguished individual like Mr. Rossotti to be available. I think you \nmade a very strong case as to why he should be confirmed because he has \nthe very qualities and the very experience that I think are essential \nat this particular juncture.\n  You talked about the layered lives within the IRS. Mr. Rossotti is, \nfortunately, an expert on management. He is an expert on high \ntechnology. As I understand, much of his experience is giving advice \nand consulting with large firms as to how to become more effective, \nmore efficient. So I think you made the point very well.\n  I think next year, I say to my distinguished friend and colleague, it \nis critically important that we begin some steps to simplify the Code. \nThat is something I want to consult with you at the staff level because \nit is complex. It is going to be a multiyear effort. But there is no \ntime better suited to start this than next year. I look forward to \nworking with you on this important matter.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I thank my dear chairman for \nsaying there is no time like now. What a better moment to start \naddressing the Tax Code than that point which, nominally at least, we \nhave a balanced budget and we are not driven by the exigencies of \nrevenue as such. We can address the question of complexity, efficiency, \nand clarity.\n  Simplicity--we are a republic. We are meant to be simple. Good people \nof Maine would like that, I think, and I think the people of Delaware \nwould. In New York we are somewhat given to complexifying, but I think \nwe might find a little simplicity refreshing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for about 5 minutes and that the time be deducted from the \ntime of the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before we vote on IRS Commissioner \nnominee Charles O. Rossotti, I'd like to take this opportunity to make \na few remarks about the direction IRS reform should take.\n  But first let me commend Mr. Rossotti for his courage to take on this \njob. I believe with his expertise and experience in private business \nmanagement, Mr. Rossotti is qualified to head the agency, and I am \nconfident that he will help improve IRS services and management.\n  Madam President, the American people have every right to be outraged \nby the disturbing details that emerged during 3 days of Senate hearings \ninto the tax collection practices of the IRS.\n  Testimony from taxpayers and current and former IRS officials \nprovided chilling accounts of mistreatment, abuse of power, and the \nmerciless trampling of citizens' rights. What's even more shocking is \nthat these improper and illegal practices within the IRS aren't random \noccurrences--they happen regularly.\n  For decades, IRS agents have routinely snooped through the supposedly \nconfidential tax files of thousands and thousands of Americans. That \ncould include me, or you. IRS agents are evaluated and promoted based \non their total tax collections, a practice outlawed a decade ago.\n  IRS managers often cover up abusive behavior by collection agents. In \nstark contrast to our legal system, all alleged tax debtors are assumed \nguilty and treated as criminals.\n  The distressing tales told by the Senate witnesses were hardly \nisolated incidents; hundreds of working, law-abiding Minnesotans have \ncontacted my office with similar grievances.\n  Though the individual details of their stories vary, the message is \nthe same: the IRS devastated their lives. Many lost their homes, cars, \nbusinesses, and professional licenses--not to mention their reputation \nand self-respect.\n  Congress established the IRS with good intentions but the agency has \nevolved into what Nobel laureate Dr. Milton Friedman labels ``a self-\ngenerating monstrosity over which the people have little control.''\n  As a result, our tax system has become extremely complicated, \ndifficult even for IRS experts to understand, and our tax burden has \nbecome so heavy and so unfair that it's unbearable for many working \nAmericans.\n  The tax system under which the IRS operates today has become a \nredistributor of private incomes, a mechanism to enforce social re-\nengineering, and a launch pad for class-warfare.\n  It is anti-family. It destroys economic opportunity, hinders our job \ncreation, impedes productivity and retards competitiveness. It has \ndeepened the despair and disaffection among the poor and disadvantaged. \nIt encourages abuse, waste, and corruption.\n  Congress deserves much--if not most--of the blame for the abuses of \nour current tax system because it is Congress that writes the Tax Code \nin the first place.\n  There are now nearly 10,000 pages of Tax Code, 20 volumes of tax \nregulations, and thousands and thousands of pages of instructions.\n  Besides making the tax system so complicated, Congress has seriously \nneglected its oversight responsibilities over the IRS. In fact, the \nSenate hearings were the first formal oversight of the agency ever \nconducted by Congress. That in itself is very shocking.\n  Congress for decades has been passing new tax laws and regulations \nwithout looking back to see how the system has been affected, or if \nit's working, or if it's unfair.\n  It's more obvious than ever that the present tax system will fail to \nlead us into the next century without fundamental reforms. But can \nWashington fix the IRS problems it created? Yes--if Washington can \nmuster the political will to do it.\n  The first thing Congress must do is take its oversight responsibility \nof the agency more seriously. Let's end the secretive ways of the IRS \nand open the process to the sunlight.\n  Let's put the IRS under strict scrutiny, periodically reviewing its \noperations, exposing abuses, and ending illegal practices.\n  I welcome the fact that President Clinton changed his mind and \npresented a plan aimed at improving taxpayer-assistance services at the \nIRS, including a board with private citizens to oversee the agency.\n  Although this is a positive step, the proposed changes are mostly \ncosmetic and will do nothing to address the deep-rooted deficiencies \nwithin the IRS. Very simply, the heart of the problem with the IRS is \nthe tax policy on which all IRS decisions are based.\n  To end the abuse once and for all, Congress must pass new legislation \nto reform our tax system and replace the ever-more-complicated Tax Code \nwith one that's simpler, fairer, and more friendly to taxpayers.\n  The American people deserve a fair Tax Code that promotes harmony \nbetween people and doesn't separate us into classes, a code that \nencourages work and savings; a code that rewards families and success \nrather than penalizes them; a code that stimulates real economic growth \nand produces more jobs and, yes, higher tax revenues; a code that \nallows taxpayers to keep more of their own money.\n  Congress must explore every available solution in our quest to re-\ncreate our tax system and achieve these objectives.\n  Passing the House IRS bill may sound tempting, as it does make some \nneeded changes, but I agree with Senator Roth that we need to do the \njob right the first time around, not accept minor changes that may \nprevent or delay efforts to reform our overall tax system.\n  Madam President, the leadoff witness at the Senate IRS hearings \nsummed up the debate with a message Congress cannot ignore: ``If the \npublic ever knew the number of abuses covered up by the IRS, there \ncould be a tax revolt.''\n  The public is beginning to understand the depth of the IRS problems. \nTinkering with the IRS won't work and the time for real tax reforms is \nnow.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might use \noff the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11588-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11588-S11590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRS REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wanted to come over today and talk \nabout the IRS and about reforming the IRS. We are on the floor \nconsidering the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be head of the IRS. \nWe had an excellent hearing on the nomination in the Committee on \nFinance. His background is somewhat different in that he is an \ninformation management person, a very successful businessperson. I \nbelieve that he will be an excellent head of the IRS. I intend to vote \nfor him. However, like most people who have spoken during this time, I \nwant to talk about reforming the IRS, not the naming of the new head of \nthe agency.\n  First of all, Madam President, I want to reject the idea that what is \nwrong at the IRS is sort of a sociological environment that has \ndeveloped there. We heard a little of that during our hearings. We \nheard a lot of it from the Treasury Department when an effort was \nundertaken to try to change the IRS.\n  The whole logic of this argument, which I reject, is that the problem \nat the IRS is that an atmosphere has developed, that there is this \nsociological environment that has come into existence over a long \nperiod of time, and what we really need is to have some counselors come \nin and have sensitivity training for IRS agents and that will make \neverything great.\n  We then have terms used, and I would have to say by Members of both \nparties, such as, ``Let's make the IRS a consumer-friendly agency.'' I \nam afraid that just reeks of nonsense to me. Let us not forget that we \ndid not create the IRS with the best of intentions. Congress created \nthe IRS to get money from people who, by and large, did not want to \njoyfully give. When it comes to the IRS, most Americans are not happy \ngivers. They believe that Government spends too much money. I share \nthat belief. They believe that the Government spends it inefficiently \nand unwisely. I share that belief. In fact, both\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\nof those beliefs would be strengthened if the average citizen could \nspend 1 week as a Member of the Senate. People do not like paying \ntaxes. They object to much that the Government does, and the IRS uses \nthe power of the State to force people to provide money that, by and \nlarge, they do not want to provide.\n  But there has developed a notion that somehow at the end of this \nprocess, when the agent calls up and says, ``I'm from the Internal \nRevenue Service and I want to help,'' people would say, ``Well, gosh, \ngreat; it's awfully nice that you called. This is the beginning of a \ngood day, possibly a good week or year and may be a turning point in my \nlife.''\n  If we are going to approach the IRS problem from the point of view \nthat the agents simply need sensitivity training or that this can \nbecome such a friendly Government agency that people will be happy to \nhear from it, I think we are making a terrible mistake.\n  I think the problem with the IRS is very easy to define and quite \nhard to do something about. The problem with the IRS, to paraphrase an \nancient Greek, is that power corrupts. The basic problem with the \nInternal Revenue Service is that IRS agents, in the bureaucracy that \nhas developed to collect taxes, have tremendous power. I guess the best \nway I found to try to get people to visualize it is to talk about a \ncourtroom. Most of us, fortunately, have never been in a courtroom, but \nalmost everybody has seen it on television or at the movies.\n  Think of yourself as going into a courtroom and the judge is from the \nIRS. You look over at the jury, and the 12 jurors are all from the IRS. \nAnd then you look over at the prosecutor's table, and the prosecutor is \nfrom the IRS. And the policeman who is going to testify, having \narrested you, is from the IRS. And you walk into the courtroom faced \nwith a presumption that you are guilty.\n  Now, that sounds like a picture that is completely out of focus as \nfar as the American system of justice is concerned. But in reality that \nis an accurate picture of a taxpayer dealing with the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Now, the question is, how do you change that picture? How do you do \nit in such a way as to guarantee due process? How do you separate the \npowers of the IRS to eliminate the abuse? And how do you do it all in \nsuch a way that you do not undermine the ability of the Internal \nRevenue Service to collect $1.6 trillion a year in taxes from working \nAmericans.\n  That is our challenge. I want to congratulate our colleagues in the \nHouse for their efforts. I want to congratulate Senators Grassley and \nKerrey for their IRS restructuring commission effort. I think that \neffort gave us a good starting point. I think Chairman Archer's bill is \na good bill.\n\n  But I would have to say that I agree with Chairman Roth, that what we \nneed to do is to carry this issue over until next year. We had very \nproductive hearings, hearings that awakened not only us but the \nAmerican people to abuses in the IRS. But now, before we legislate, we \nneed to hear from some people who have ideas as to how we fix the \nproblem. I think we need to hear from financial experts, including \npeople from the Internal Revenue Service. I think we need to be certain \nthat this issue has been thoroughly examined.\n  I would like to share just a few thoughts and then yield the floor, \nbecause I see that we have other colleagues who have come to the floor.\n  First, I believe that we need, to the maximum extent possible, to try \nto find a way to separate powers that are currently joined together in \nthe Internal Revenue Service. It seems to me, if you look at the \ncriminal justice system, that the separation of functions represents a \nseparation of powers that, while it doesn't always succeed, while there \nare failures and abuses in the system, at least in the criminal justice \nsystem you have the police that do the investigating and then they take \ntheir evidence to the district attorney and the district attorney \nevaluates their evidence and in the process evaluates them. And then \nthe district attorney goes to a grand jury and the grand jury evaluates \nthe evidence and makes the determination as to whether there is \nsufficient evidence to take you into court. If they decide there is, \nyou go into a court where you have a judge and where you have a jury. \nAnd the investigating police, the district attorney, the grand jury, \nthe judge, and the jury all represent separations of power and checks \non the potential abuses of one or the other.\n  Our problem in the Internal Revenue Service is that this one agency \nperforms all of those functions. It seems to me that the first thing \nthat we have to try to do is to find a way to separate those functions \nso that each of these different levels of our dealings with the \nInternal Revenue Service represents a check on the potential abuses of \nthe other level or function that we are dealing with.\n  Obviously, this is a golden opportunity for us to look at the Tax \nCode, to look at its complexity, to look at the degree to which it is \nunfair, and try to fix it. I am not one of those who believes that \nshort of Heaven we will ever eliminate the Internal Revenue Service. We \ncan change its name, we can change the plaque, we can take down the \nflag, but in reality, as long as the Government spends massive sums of \nmoney, somebody, some agency is going to have to collect that money. \nBut I think, with a simplified system, we could dramatically change the \nway the IRS works by making it easier for citizens who intend to abide \nby the law to do it.\n  I think also that, to the degree that we control Government spending \nso that Government takes less, to the degree that we spend the money \nmore wisely, then I think we would make people more willing to pay \ntaxes. The great Abraham Lincoln was quoted during the Civil War as \nhaving said that he was a joyful taxpayer. He perhaps was the last one \nin America. Because he supported winning the Civil War. I think, to the \nextent that we can make the system simpler and fairer, to the extent \nthat we can be wiser in our expenditure of money, that we can improve \nthe situation. But, in the end, the Internal Revenue Service has too \nmuch power. We need to shift the burden of proof. The Internal Revenue \nService should have the burden of proving that someone is a lawbreaker. \nWe should not begin with the presumption, when you are dealing with the \nInternal Revenue Service, that the taxpayer is guilty.\n  It seems to me that we ought to also look at a system where, if I am \ntrying to run a business and the IRS comes in and audits me and I spend \n$250,000 on accountants and lawyers, defending myself from the IRS, and \nat the end the IRS says, or the judge and jury say: This was all a \nmistake. You didn't do anything wrong. If that turns out to be the \ncase, it seems to me that small business ought to be able to go into \ncourt and say: Look, I spent $250,000. I didn't do anything wrong. The \nIRS didn't even say it's sorry. Maybe the IRS ought to have to pay that \nsmall business $250,000 and pay their court costs.\n\n  A final point which has almost never been mentioned in this debate \nbut which I want to mention here because I think it has to be a factor \nin our deliberations, is that at the end of the day, with whatever we \ndo in reforming the IRS, it still has to be able to collect taxes. I \nhave no sympathy for people who cheat on their taxes. People who cheat \non their taxes make the rest pay more. And as we strengthen the rights \nof taxpayers--which I am in favor of, and I intend to fight hard for--\nas we shift the burden of proof, as we divide the powers of the IRS and \nmake it less intrusive, to the extent that such reforms make it easier \nfor people to cheat we have to have stiffer penalties for those who \nknowingly violate the law.\n  So I think we have quite a legislative effort ahead of us. I think we \nhave a golden opportunity to do something that is important. I want to \ncongratulate Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee because I do \nbelieve we had an excellent set of hearings. But simply because we know \nmore about the problem does not mean that we yet know the solution. I \nam hoping that we can have equally productive hearings on ideas from \npeople around the country as to what could be done to fix the IRS, how \nwe could change the system. We should take the time to get it right, be \nmore comprehensive in what we want to achieve, and build on an \nexcellent bill that came over from the House. We have an opportunity to \ndramatically change the Internal Revenue\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nService and convince Americans that, while the Government is still \nspending too much money and is not spending it as wisely as it should, \nthat the tax system is fairer and that the collection process is fairer \nas a result of the reform efforts that we are about to undertake.\n  I don't think people expect to love their Internal Revenue agent, \nunless they married one or unless one is their child or their parent. \nBut they expect to be treated fairly. And obviously they know when they \nare contacted by the IRS that they are potentially in deep trouble, and \nit is that threat that drives many people to go ahead and declare \nincome that they might have hidden and to pay taxes that they didn't \nwant to pay.\n  So, finding this balance, I submit, is going to be a difficult task. \nI am very grateful that I am on the Finance Committee and I am going to \nhave an opportunity to play a small role in it.

Mr. President, in March of this year, over 200 \nschoolchildren in my State contracted the hepatitis A virus from food \nserved by the school lunch program. As news of the outbreak began to \npour in, the Michigan Department of Community Health and the Centers \nfor Disease Control went into action to determine the cause. They soon \nfound the culprit: frozen strawberries sold to the school lunch program \nby a San Diego company named Andrew & Williamson. Investigators also \ndiscovered that some of the strawberries sold to the school lunch \nprogram had been illegally certified as domestically grown when, in \nfact, they had been grown in Mexico.\n  Mr. President, these strawberries should never have been served in \nthe school lunch program in the first place. By law, products sold to \nthe school lunch program must be certified as being domestically grown.\n  Companies have typically been trusted to do the right thing, but \nAndrew & Williamson chose to do something else. They chose to \nmisrepresent their product's country of origin and over 200 people were \npoisoned as a result.\n  But now, Mr. President, disturbing new information has come to light \nfrom the criminal case against Andrew & Williamson which indicates USDA \nofficials may have had advance warning of the illegal strawberries. An \narticle in Saturday's edition of the San Diego Union Tribune disclosed \nthat USDA was alerted 1 week after the school lunch purchase from \nAndrew & Williamson that the fruit was from Mexico. In addition, the \nnewspaper also reports that the Federal official at USDA who was \nalerted thought it serious enough to file an administrative report and \nwanted to investigate the charge, but was rebuffed by her supervisor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the San Diego \nUnion Tribune article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the San Diego Union-Tribune, Nov. 1, 1997]\n\n                    Berry Alert Came Week After Sale\n\n\n       witness said he warned USDA that fruit was grown in mexico\n\n                            (By Rex Dalton)\n\n       A federal official received an early complaint in October \n     1996 that a San Diego company was illegally selling Mexican \n     strawberries to the federal government for school lunches, \n     according to newly released documents.\n       That means the U.S. Department of Agriculture knew about \n     the sale four months before the strawberries were served in \n     February. The USDA did not investigate until after the \n     berries caused about 270 cases of hepatitis A in Michigan \n     schools in March.\n       In fact, the 1.7 million pounds of frozen strawberries had \n     not been delivered to government warehouses when the warning \n     came in, shortly after the USDA's strawberry purchase was \n     announced Oct. 17, 1996.\n       The disclosure of the early warning is in witness \n     statements recently released under unusual circumstances to \n     defense attorneys for Andrew & Williamson Sales Co. Inc. of \n     Otay Mesa.\n       The stawberry-processing company and two executives were \n     indicted on charges of fraud and making false statements in \n     connection with the sale of Baja-grown fruit to the USDA for \n     the National School Lunch Program. The charges are not \n     related to contamination of the berries. Produce sold to the \n     program must be grown in the United States, according to \n     federal law.\n       The witness statements were made in April to the USDA's \n     Office of the Inspector General, but were not disclosed to \n     defense attorneys until Oct. 14. The defense attorneys had \n     received many other witness statements and documents after \n     the June indictments.\n       Joseph Milchen, the attorney for company founder Frederick \n     L. Williamson, said he received the key witness statements \n     from the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego. The U.S. \n     Attorney's Office informed Milchen it sent the statements \n     right after getting them from the USDA.\n       Williamson, 60, of Oceanside has pleaded innocent. The \n     other executive, Richard H. Kershaw, has pleaded guilty.\n       The San Diego Union-Tribune reported in September that at \n     least three leaders in the California strawberry industry \n     told USDA officials in January that Mexican strawberries \n     were being sold illegally to the lunch program. The \n     berries were served around Valentine's Day and the \n     hepatitis A cases developed within a few weeks.\n       At congressional hearings in the spring on the hepatitis A \n     epidemic, USDA officials testified they only had vague \n     allegations about a possible illegal sale shortly before the \n     outbreak.\n       When Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., learned The Union-\n     Tribune had reported the USDA had evidence in January of an \n     illegal strawberry sale, he expressed outrage and called for \n     a Senate hearing on the USDA's handling of the strawberry \n     sale.\n       Sen. Paul D. Coverdell, R-Ga., chairman of the Senate \n     Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection and Product \n     Promotion, then began working to set up the hearing into the \n     USDA's accountability.\n       Against this backdrop of heightened concern about food \n     safety and imported produce, the new witness statements were \n     released in San Diego.\n       Phillip L.B. Halpern, an assistant U.S. attorney whose \n     office is handling the Andrew & Williamson prosecution, could \n     not be reached for an interview.\n       USDA officials in Washington declined to comment.\n       The agency is continuing to investigate the Mexican \n     strawberry sale, which also has been linked to nearly 50 \n     cases of hepatitis A in Maine, Louisiana and Wisconsin. \n     Federal authorities believe a field worker in Mexico \n     accidentally contaminated the fruit while it was being picked \n     in April and May 1996.\n       Hepatitis A is spread through contact with human fecal \n     matter. Investigators who later visited farm fields where the \n     berries were grown found outhouses adjacent to rows of \n     strawberries, and no ready method for harvesters to wash \n     their hands. The virus can cause nausea, vomiting, fever and \n     jaundice. In rare cases, it can be fatal.\n       The key witness statement that recently was released was \n     made by Frederick J. Haas, who operates a Watsonville produce \n     sales operation called U.S. Food Service.\n       As the USDA's Office of the Inspector General began its \n     probe, Haas made separate statements on different dates in \n     April.\n       In an April 8 statement, Haas told the inspector general's \n     office he called the USDA's Sandra K. Gardei in January and \n     told her about the Mexican strawberry issue. Gardei oversaw \n     the October 1996 strawberry purchase.\n       That statement and those of other witnesses were provided \n     to Andrew & Williamson defense attorneys last summer.\n       But not until Oct. 14 did the defense attorneys receive an \n     ``addendum'' statement that Haas made April 15 and an April \n     11 statement by Haas' administrative assistant, Jeanette \n     Baum.\n       Those statements detail how on Oct. 24, 1996--just a week \n     after the announcement of the USDA's purchase of frozen \n     strawberries--Gardei was called about the use of Mexican \n     strawberries.\n       Haas' April 15 statement says he told Gardei the USDA \n     should not purchase the strawberries from Andrew & \n     Williamson's brokers ``because that product was grown in \n     Mexico.''\n       After the strawberries first were linked to hepatitis A in \n     Michigan on March 28, Gardei prepared an administrative \n     report for the USDA describing how she was alerted in January \n     and February about the Mexican fruit.\n       In that administrative report, Gardei said she sought to \n     open an immediate investigation.\n       She said in the administrative report that her USDA \n     superior, Darrell J. Breed, refused to open an investigation. \n     Gardei also said\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\n     Breed ordered his secretary to remove copies of her \n     administrative report from USDA files.\n       But Gardei's April 3 statement to USDA investigators makes \n     no mention of any calls in October from Haas or any other \n     California strawberry leader.\n       Neither Gardei nor Breed have been available for interview. \n     Breed denies in his statement to the inspector general's \n     office that he sought to cover up or mislead USDA \n     investigators. His secretary denied in her statement that he \n     ordered her to remove Gardei's administrative report from \n     USDA files.\n       While Michigan's Abraham had hoped to have a subcommittee \n     hearing soon to explore USDA handling of the strawberry \n     purchase and probe, congressional aides say it appears as if \n     no hearing will be held this year.\n       Congressional aides say USDA Inspector General Roger C. \n     Viadero has asked to meet privately with interested \n     legislators about the issue.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this information, if true, is very \ninconsistent with what was asserted by Federal officials at a June 5 \nhearing of the full Agriculture Committee. There, USDA officials \ntestified at the hearing that they knew nothing more than nonspecific \nand vague complaints of potential violations at Andrew & Williamson, \nthe San Diego company which sold the fruit to the Government for school \nlunches.\n  If the newspaper article and witness allegations are true, it would \ncertainly raise serious questions as to whether the full committee and \nthis Senator were misled. I believe we are owed an explanation and \nsuggest the Government officials involved be called to testify under \noath regarding their actions.\n  Senator Coverdell has written USDA to ask for a response to these \nserious charges, but so far nothing has been heard. It is my intention \nto keep pressing the USDA for answers as well as seek the appropriate \noversight of this matter. I want to be sure that the Government \nagencies responsible for protecting us are doing their job.\n  This dangerous incident, the poisoning of Michigan children by their \nown School Lunch Program, should concern us all, Mr. President. The \ncompany involved seems to have demonstrated a reckless disregard for \npublic safety.\n  To that end, I have introduced legislation which makes such conduct a \nfelony with a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of \n$250,000 per count. This change in law will ensure that individuals who \nintentionally misrepresent their goods will now suffer the appropriate \nconsequences of their actions. The recent outbreaks of hepatitis A, \ncyclospora and E. coli demonstrate that a new commitment to food safety \nis sorely needed in this country. I will continue working to see that \nCongress takes the appropriate measures to assist the USDA, FDA, and \nCenters for Disease Control in their efforts to keep America's food \nsupply the safest in the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11590-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11591-S11597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CHARLES ROSSOTTI, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, TO BE \n                    COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may require to \nmy distinguished friend and colleague on the Finance Committee, the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom New York, for recognizing me.\n  I take this time just to say a couple of words about the President's \nnominee to be the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, Mr. Charles \nRossotti, who I enthusiastically support. I think the President has \nmade a good choice. It is interesting to note that this appointment \nwill be the first nontax lawyer to head the Internal Revenue Service \nsince World War II. That might not make a lot of waves in some areas, \nbut I think considering the problems we are experiencing with the \nInternal Revenue Service that this is a very positive qualification at \nthe current time.\n  I say that because I think that many of the problems that we heard in \nthe days of hearings that we had in the Senate Finance Committee about \nthe Internal Revenue Service were not so much tax problems but human \nproblems; not so much a problem about how much money was being \ncollected and where it was being collected from or where it was not \nbeing collected from, but really more evidence was given to us about \nmishandling of individuals, mistreatment of individuals, setting quotas \nfor Internal Revenue Service agents that they had to meet in order to \nbe considered for an appointment; review processes of Internal Revenue \nService personnel that were conducted by Internal Revenue Service \npersonnel themselves whose appointments many times were based on how \nthey defended the Internal Revenue Service.\n  These are not problems that call for a tax attorney but rather cry \nout for a person who is experienced in the business world, who is \nexperienced with handling large numbers of employees, who is \nexperienced in the management of a company or in the management of a \ncorporation. These are the type of qualifications that I think are \nneeded at this particular time in the history of the Internal Revenue \nService. It is a very large agency with over 100,000 employees, and, of \ncourse, there are going to be mistakes made. The question is not \nwhether mistakes are going to be made, but rather how we correct those \nmistakes. I think Mr. Charles Rossotti brings a particular degree of \nexpertise to this position at this particular time.\n  I was interested in some of the answers that he gave when we asked \nhim questions about what he thought needed to be done and how would he \napproach his job. I think the responses we received were right on \ntarget for what is needed at this time.\n  He said that he would not tolerate IRS workers who treat taxpayers \nabusively and would fire such workers as necessary.\n  I don't know about my colleagues, but as one Member of the Senate, I \nfeel a sense of apprehension when I deal with the Internal Revenue \nService, and I am a Member of the U.S. Senate and sit on the Senate \nFinance Committee which has jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue \nService. Yet, I feel a little hesitant when I deal with the agency for \nfear of doing something wrong. It is like that knock on the door that \ncomes and someone says, ``It is the IRS,'' and they are here to see you \nand you go into an absolute panic. That should not be the feeling that \nAmericans have toward an agency that really works for them. They work \nfor the taxpayers of this country, as do we.\n  So I was very pleased to see Charles Rossotti say, ``I will not \ntolerate IRS workers who treat taxpayers abusively and would fire such \nworkers, if necessary.''\n  He also said that the practice of evaluating an IRS employee \nperformance based on quotas or based on how many cases they make will \nnot be a determining factor in how well they do within the agency. I \nthink that is important.\n  I think some of our colleagues have probably had experiences in \nrespective States where State troopers were promoted and evaluated \nbased on how many tickets they wrote. It was a quota system. They had \nto issue so many tickets in 1 day or they were going to be looked upon \nas not doing their job properly. That is something that I think is a \nmistake.\n  Mr. Charles Rossotti has indicated that that will not be the basis \nfor evaluating and determining performances by IRS agents. I think that \nis a step in the right direction. They should not be judged just on how \nmuch money they bring in. They should be judged on a whole series of \nfactors on how they perform on their jobs, not the least of which is \nhow they treat the people they work for--the taxpayers of this country.\n  He outlined three principles. These are not tax principles. These are \npersonnel principles, management principles, and that is why I think he \nis the right man for the job at this time.\n  In talking about management responsibility, he said he would expect \nmanagers to keep on top of activities under their authority and quickly \nhalt abuses. These managers will be responsible for the abuses that may \nor may not occur within their jurisdiction.\n  He said that he was going to be strongly supportive of open \ncommunication. He wants to create an atmosphere in which workers are \nwilling to bring problems to the attention of the managers without fear \nof reprisal. That is a personnel decision. We had people\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\nfrom the agency testifying before our committee behind a screen to \nseparate them from the other IRS personnel for fear of retribution \nbecause of their testimony.\n  They actually said they were fearful to tell anybody about the \nproblems that they saw for fear of being retaliated against or demoted \nor never promoted because of their willingness to come up and say, \n``Look, there's something wrong in my section. I don't think we're \ndealing right with the people that we work for.'' So I was very pleased \nto see that the nominee addressed the question of open communication.\n  And then, finally, on the performance measurements--and I mentioned \nthis--he said, there will be no revenue quotas or perceptions of quotas \nin worker evaluation. Instead, he said he wants to create a set of \nmeasurements that do in fact measure what we want, including taxpayer \nsatisfaction with their dealings with the agency.\n  I think that that goes a long way. If an agent is of the opinion that \nhe is going to be judged on his performance based on how much money he \nbrings in, there is a certain degree of pressure to go out and do as \nmuch as he or she possibly can. That should not be the guiding \nprinciples of the Internal Revenue Service agents when they deal with \nthe American public.\n  The final point I make is that I think most of us would agree that \nthe American taxpayer should feel there is someone within this \ndepartment that is on their side. They know that the 104,000 Internal \nRevenue Service agents have a job, that their job is to collect the \nlegitimate revenues that are owed by taxpayers so that their country \ncould be a better place, a safer place in which to live. They \nunderstand that.\n  But right now they feel that in dealing with this agency of \nGovernment, there is no one on their side, that they are against a \nbureaucracy and that they are really helpless, particularly when they \nunderstand that they have to somehow prove themselves innocent if they \nare ever accused by the Internal Revenue Service. I think that is \nwrong.\n  I mean, every courthouse in America that I have ever been in, when \nsomeone is accused of doing something wrong, the person who is bringing \nthat accusation, whether it be a State's attorney, the district \nattorney, or what have you, has an obligation to make the case beyond a \nreasonable doubt and with a preponderance of the evidence in civil \ncases and beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases. The person \nmaking the accusation has to prove it to various standards according to \nthe court that they happen to be operating in--except here, where the \nGovernment can bring down the full bureaucracy of the American \nGovernment on an individual taxpayer, and somehow that individual has \nto come in and say, ``Let me attempt to prove my innocence,'' instead \nof having the Government prove that something was done incorrectly, \nimproper, or illegally in order to justify a penalty against the \nAmerican taxpayer. I think that is incorrect. I think that that should \nbe changed.\n  The other point that I think is important to note right now is that \nwe have legislation--I have introduced it with a number of cosponsors; \nit has been incorporated into the Senators Kerrey and Grassley \nproposal--which creates this commission, which creates what I will call \na Taxpayer Protection Office where when the taxpayer has a problem with \nthe agency, that he or she knows there is some place where he or she \ncan go, either by walking into a district office or using a 1-800 \ntelephone number to explain their side of the dispute and have someone \nin the agency take the time to learn their side of the issue, so that \nthey can have someone to represent them and their position before their \nown Government. I think that is important.\n  We have a type of office like that now called the Taxpayer's \nAdvocate, but it really is run by IRS agents. They are only going to be \nthere a short time. Then they will be promoted or demoted, depending on \ntheir performance, to some other part of the department at a later \ndate. So those people are just moving through the system.\n  Our legislation says that these people shall not directly be IRS \nemployees, but should be more an organization that looks after the \ninterests of the taxpayer and would be subject to the Commissioner \nhimself's jurisdiction. I think that should go a long way to helping \nthe American taxpayer know that within this bureaucracy there is some \ndepartment, some division, someone who is actually going to be on their \nside and help them represent their case to the Internal Revenue Service \nitself.\n\n  So I think that is where we are today, and the question before the \nSenate is, should the Senate confirm this nominee? I enthusiastically \nlend my support to the nomination. We had an excellent hearing with \nhim. I think what he said was right on target. The fact that he is not \na tax lawyer is probably part of his qualifications for this particular \ntitle. I support the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that my time be taken from the \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I voted for Mr. Rossotti to be reported \nout of the Senate Finance Committee. So, obviously, I support his \nnomination on the floor of the Senate today.\n  His resume differs from many of his predecessors. That is, he did not \ncome to this position through appointment of the President as a tax \npractitioner. He comes to us from having succeeded in the business \nworld, but not as a tax lawyer.\n  In business, he provided a superior product and a superior service. \nThe country desperately needs a superior product and superior service \nat the IRS and a manager who can deliver both. That is why the country \nneeds someone like Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner of the IRS.\n  Senator Kerrey and I found, through our work on the Commission to \nRestructure the IRS, that what the IRS really needed was not a tax \nlawyer to head it up. That had been tradition. What they need is an \norganizational leader. I think Charles Rossotti fills that \nresponsibility. The duties of the IRS are very much like a big business \norganization.\n  Last year, the IRS had revenue of $1.4 trillion and a congressional \nappropriation of over $7 billion to collect that money. On the other \nhand, the IRS cannot satisfy the General Accounting Office that its \nbooks are in order. The IRS has a work force of 106,000 people. This \ncompares to the 50 largest business organizations in America. The IRS \nserves 115 million individual taxpayers. Last year, it received 76 \nmillion inquiries. It handles 200 million different tax returns and \nover 1 billion information returns annually.\n  It has offices in every State in the Nation. The National Treasury \nEmployees Union is one of the largest labor unions in the country. The \nIRS deals with over 12,000 financial institutions and 12 Federal \nReserve banks in some 600 locations.\n  All of these things taken together require a manager with very \nspecial skills. Those skills do not necessarily involve expertise in \nthe Tax Code. Consequently, that is my argument. The tradition of \nhaving a tax lawyer as IRS Commissioner is overblown. Somebody with \norganizational skills coming from a business organization with a proven \ntrack record in that environment is the best person to run this massive \norganization we call the IRS.\n  The IRS Commissioner's job has been thought of as the chief tax \ncollector of our country. In a way, I hope that Mr. Rossotti does not \nbecome the Nation's chief tax collector. We all expect him to collect \nevery dollar that is legally due.\n  But I would rather think of the Commissioner's job as that of the \n``chief customer service representative'' at the IRS. We need to \ninstill, in other words, through Mr. Rossotti and his background, the \nattitude of customer service at the IRS. In other words, another way to \nsay that would be to put the word ``service'' back into the Internal \nRevenue Service. Mr. Rossotti seems to recognize improved customer \nservice as his personal task. In the private sector he knew his \norganization would not be successful without putting customer service \nNo. 1 on his priority.\n  In January this year I wrote to the President. I discussed the kind \nof person that we would need to be the next\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\nIRS Commissioner. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 1997.\n     Re selecting a non-lawyer as the next IRS Commissioner.\n\n     The President,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Presently you are confronted with the \n     resignation of Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Margaret \n     Milner Richardson. Though the Commissioner and I have \n     disagreed on certain practices and policies of the IRS, we \n     have had a good working relationship that has resulted in \n     some successes.\n       As you begin to consider persons whom you will nominate as \n     the next IRS Commissioner, I urge you to consider nominating \n     a new kind of administrative leader for the IRS. Rather than \n     focusing on lawyers with a workable knowledge of the tax law, \n     it may be time to nominate someone who is both a non-\n     Washington, D.C.-insider and a non-lawyer to be the next IRS \n     Commissioner. A person educated in business and experienced \n     in running a large private sector company would be better \n     suited to administer the IRS than most lawyers.\n       The duties of IRS are very much like a business. The IRS \n     would benefit from the leadership of a trained and \n     experienced business person. Last year, the IRS had a revenue \n     of 1.4 trillion dollars, and a Congressional appropriation of \n     over 7 billion dollars, but it cannot balance its own books \n     to satisfy our own Congressional accountants, the General \n     Accounting Office.\n       The IRS has an employee workforce of 110,000 individuals. \n     This makes it comparable to the group of the fifty largest \n     companies in the country. The IRS has 115 million individual \n     taxpayers that it must serve. As taxpayers, all of these \n     customers, are also owners of the IRS. IRS received 76 \n     million taxpayer inquiries last year. It handles 200 million \n     different tax returns, and over 1 billion information returns \n     annually. It has offices in every state in the nation. The \n     employee union with which the Commissioner must deal, the \n     National Treasury Employee's Union, is one of the largest \n     labor unions in the country. The IRS deals with over 12,000 \n     financial institutions and 12 Federal Reserve Banks in some \n     600 locations.\n       I think that these things suggest the need for an expertise \n     that is not taught in law school and is not tested on any bar \n     exam. The best of our prospective administrative leaders are \n     found in this country's private sector companies. One would \n     think that, if the President of the United States would ask, \n     he would have his choice of the best of the best.\n       There will be people in both the public and private sector \n     who will criticize the idea of a non-lawyer running the IRS. \n     Many of these people will be professionals of what I call the \n     federal tax industrial complex. About these criticisms, I \n     will say two things. First, most of the critics will \n     themselves be lawyers. Second, I will remind them that many \n     non-lawyer CEOs of this country all have many lawyers who \n     work for them, and they seem to get along just fine. I would \n     even suggest that the stock-holders of big companies run by \n     non-lawyers are much happier with the production and service \n     of those companies, than the people who own the IRS, the \n     federal taxpayers.\n       For these reasons, I sincerely hope that you can select a \n     non-lawyer as your next nominee for the post of IRS \n     Commissioner. If you are interested, I would like to help you \n     with the selection process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In subsequent discussions with Deputy Secretary Summers \nwe agreed that now is the time to acquire a nontax practitioner to lead \nthe IRS.\n  With Mr. Rossotti, we hope to capture the benefit of a superior \norganizational leader. The risk is that a nonlawyer could not handle \nthe legal side of the Commissioner job. At the Finance Committee \nhearing on Mr. Rossotti's nomination, I asked Mr. Rossotti how he \nintends to perform legal analysis as a Commissioner of the tax law \nagency when he does not have that background. He responded that he \nwould do it exactly the same way he would do it as a private-sector \nbusiness leader. He would hire good advisers, consult the experts, and \nmake clear decisions based upon all the information supplied to him.\n  The Nation has a great opportunity with a person like Charles \nRossotti. When coupled with legislative reform at the IRS, a nontax \npractitioner as IRS Commissioner represents a sea change at the IRS. \nThe IRS is moving away from being a law enforcement agency and toward \nbecoming a customer service agency. Of course, it is about time. Most \npeople pay their taxes voluntarily and pay them honestly.\n  Therefore, I encourage all my colleagues to support Mr. Rossotti's \nnomination and then we can take up the matters of legislative reform of \nthe IRS with him as an ally.\n  I think I need to speak for a moment in support of the Internal \nRevenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, the Kerrey-Grassley \nlegislation. Our bill, S. 1096, is the product of 1-year's work in the \nNational Commission to Restructure the Internal Revenue Service. \nSenator Kerrey and I participated in the commission as four \ncongressional Members of this 17-member commission. The other 13 \nmembers were non-Congress-oriented, and 10 of those were from the \nprivate sector. So I think we had a broad range of expertise on this \ncommission to study how can we make the IRS more consumer friendly and \nmore efficient in its operation.\n  The House might pass this same legislation as early as tomorrow. Our \nlegislation is maybe the only thing more important to the IRS and the \ntaxpayers than who the next Commissioner might be. If that Commissioner \nis dedicated, as I think Mr. Rossotti is, to change at the IRS, then he \nneeds our legislation in order to succeed.\n  I introduced S. 1096 with Senator Kerrey last July. However, the \nSenate seems to be on track to address this legislation next year \nrather than this year. There are arguments to wait--and I think our \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Roth, is very sincere in his expression \nof these reservations. But, speaking for myself, delaying IRS reform is \na mistake. The Senate should pass our legislation yet this year. The \nHouse is prepared to pass the companion bill. We can make IRS reform \nthe law of the land before the 1997 holidays. If we did, the Senate \nwould create a new reason for Americans to be thankful this November.\n  There are two reasons for the Senate to join the House in supporting \nthe IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. First, troubled taxpayers \nliterally can't wait for the relief that we provide in our bill. \nSecond, the Senate will hopefully confirm the next IRS Commissioner \nnomination. Mr. Rossotti needs the tools that are in our bill in order \nfor him to fully succeed in his job. Let's not require him to spin his \nwheels for another half-year. When you are dealing with the Internal \nRevenue Service, every day counts. If you are a taxpaying family and \nyou are being hunted by the IRS, you need relief right away. If the \nSenate does not pass relief until 5 or 6 months from now, individual \ntaxpayers will continue to suffer. At best, they may lose their life's \nassets. At worse, they may lose that which holds the family together. \nIf you are in trouble with the IRS, 6 months is an eternity.\n  The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act would provide immediate relief \nto taxpayers in trouble. We would extend to taxpayers a greater ability \nto recover costs and fees incurred to defend the family against the \naggressive tax man. In the Senate hearings where we had these sort of \nhorror stories about how the IRS can treat the taxpayer, we found that \nmany taxpayers simply pay an unlawful tax assessment. Often it is \ncheaper than a legal defense against the IRS.\n\n  When there is a tax due, our legislation sets standards and sets \nallowances within which we would require the IRS to make offers in \ncompromise of a disputed claim. In other words, taxpayers get to pay \ntheir bill and go on with their lives. When a disputed claim includes \nboth an IRS debt to the taxpayers and a taxpayer debt, we once and for \nall eliminate the IRS interest rate preference over taxpayers.\n  Currently, when you owe the IRS money you pay a higher percentage \nthan when the IRS doesn't make your refund and the Government owes you \nmoney. So if we wait another 6 months, we continue to give the \nGovernment the monetary advantage over the taxpayer. The Government \nearns a higher rate of interest from taxpayers than what the taxpayer \nget in return. It is a matter of equity that we would not charge the \ntaxpayer more than we are willing to pay the taxpayer for money not \nrefunded.\n  Indeed, fundamental fairness is what finding a new breed of IRS \nCommissioner is all about. We are about ready to confirm Mr. Rossotti \nto be this person. I think he will be a fundamentally\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\nnew sort of IRS Commissioner. He is experienced in leading large \nmultistate organizations. He is experienced in organizing state-of-the-\nart information systems. That is his business. He is experienced in \nproviding customer service or he would not be the head of a very \nsuccessful private-sector organization.\n  However, when he takes office, he is going to need all of the tools \nthat we can think to provide him in order to succeed. It seems to me \nthat Congress needs to pass legislation to knock down the legal \nbarriers to his success on behalf of the taxpayer. Charles Rossotti \nneeds the tools of reform on his very first day, not 6 months from now, \nand the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act provides those tools.\n  For example, our legislation provides that the incoming IRS \nCommissioners would sit for a single 5-year term. The revolving door \nbetween the Commissioner's office and the tax industry will be closed. \nWe will require Commissioners to stick around long enough to reap what \nthey sow. More important, we will provide the Commissioner with an \nindependent board of nine persons who will be his strategic leaders. \nThe board will provide guidance on long-term goals and investments. The \nCommissioner will implement the corresponding day-to-day leadership at \nthe IRS.\n  Our legislation provides that the new Commissioner need not operate \nas a team of one. Our legislation offers the opportunity for the new \nCommissioner to bring in his or her own team of senior managers, \nbecause currently at the IRS and over decades of time, high-level \nbureaucrats at the IRS know they can always outlive any new IRS \nCommissioner. Previous IRS Commissioners have gone into those positions \nwith high-level management there in a place frustrating what the \nCommissioner wants to accomplish.\n  So it seems to me that the taxpayers deserve the best. Our \nlegislation allows the next Commissioner to recruit the best and then \nto retain the best. We make it clear as the intent of the law. Mr. \nRossotti hopes that even under existing law he can bring people in from \nother agencies of Government, through the Senior Executive Service, to \naccomplish a team that he wants. However, it is not clear if he can \nbring in people from outside of Government. He will need such new faces \nin order to get the job done. We ought to give him the best team that \nhe sees necessary to accomplish his goal.\n  However, I would say, having the right personnel is not enough \nbecause much of the trouble at the IRS stems from the IRS information \nsystem debacle. Currently, the IRS gets poor information from its \ncomputers and then makes it worse. In this age of information and \ntechnology, most persons are still filing paper tax returns. Then \nemployees of the IRS input that data by hand at the IRS processing \ncenters. This is where mistakes happen most often. Each mistake \ntranslates into an expense of time, money and, most importantly, \nhardships for the taxpayers. In our legislation, the Senate offers some \nstrategic direction.\n  We will direct the IRS and the next Commissioner to reach a target \nelectronic tax filing rate of 80 percent by the year 2007. That 10 \nyears starts right now, and it ought to start right now; it ought to \nnot start 6 months from now when the Senate gets around to acting on \nthis legislation. The Commissioner nominee recently told the Finance \nCommittee that, once he can begin his job, it will take him 10 years to \ndesign and implement a state of the art information system at the IRS. \nWe need to get that 10-year clock ticking right now, not 6 months from \nnow. And the 10-year clock will not tick until the taxpayers get this \nlegislation, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act.\n  For example, our IRS Restructuring and Reform Act would provide and \nset standards for security and access to taxpayers' electronic \naccounts. If we are going to have electronic filing, we will need \nelectronic payment. Otherwise, we would still have people out there \nlicking stamps and going to the post office on April 15. Our \nlegislation accomplishes these things and many more.\n  In short, waiting until next year to pass IRS reform is bad for \ntaxpayers, and it's going to be lengthening the period of time that Mr. \nRossotti will be the most effective Commissioner we have had for a long \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Moynihan pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 142 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nconcurrent and Senate resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the nomination \nof Charles Rossotti to be IRS Commissioner. I don't know whether to \noffer this new Commissioner congratulations or condolences. He comes to \nthe IRS at a time of great turmoil and, I must say, also at a time of \ngreat opportunity. The process of investigating and reforming the IRS \nhas only just begun, and I commend Senator Roth and the ranking member, \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, for holding the recent Finance \nCommittee hearings, and especially commend the courage displayed by the \nwitnesses at those hearings. I say ``courage'' because oftentimes in \nthe past, as witnesses have come forward, they were to find themselves \nonly later victims of a very aggressive rogue agency that would not \nadhere to any reasonable policy of treating the taxpayer as somebody \nwho deserved appropriate treatment.\n  I suggest that those hearings and those witnesses are merely the tip \nof an iceberg; there is so much more to be uncovered and to be \ninvestigated. The recent hearings were barely over when my office \nstarted hearing from basically two groups of taxpayers: those who were \ncynical, saying, well, now that the hearings are over, I suspect \nnothing more will happen and it will be business as usual.\n  That was the first type. The second type were those who were relieved \nto discover what appeared to be a very serious Congress finally looking \ntoward reform and an effort to prevent IRS abuse. So they were saying \nto me, as a Senator, that they were not alone and that they were now \nwilling to come forward and to express to me, or to a larger body of \ninterest, their experience with the IRS, the problems they had.\n  Similarly, the IRS restructuring bill that is now moving through the \nother body is a start. Let me suggest, and I think the ranking member \nwho is here on the floor, the Senator from New York, would agree it is \nonly a start. Taxpayers deserve as much due process protection in the \nmatter of taxes as do all other citizens dealing with our Government in \nall other issues.\n  Blatant disregard for individual rights has all been in pursuit of \none goal by the IRS, and that was, ``Get the money, get the money,'' \nand sometimes at nearly all costs to due process, and we heard some of \nthose examples expressed by witnesses before the Finance Committee. \nDrug dealers, child molesters and organized crime in many instances \nhave more legal rights than the average taxpayer whom the IRS suspects \nmay owe a few dollars of back taxes.\n  With the IRS, the taxpayer is guilty until proven innocent, and \ntherein lies the difference, because I will tell you that a drug dealer \nis, by law, innocent until proven guilty, as is the child molester. But \nwe heard very clearly from those witnesses that they were guilty until \nproven innocent. Unlike the FBI or the local sheriff, if the IRS thinks \nsomeone has underpaid taxes, it can seize cars, freeze bank accounts, \nand all under its own authority without obtaining any kind of impartial \nor prior approval. If the taxpayer fills out his or her return relying \non tax advice from the IRS and that advice turns out to be wrong, guess \nwho is liable. Not the IRS, that's for sure, but the taxpayer himself \nor herself. If the IRS wrongfully assesses back taxes or penalties, the \ntaxpayer usually has three basically no-win choices to make: You pay up \nand shut up, take the case to the tax court where the judge is usually \na former IRS employee and taxpayers usually lose, or pay up and then go \nto Federal district court and sue to get your money back.\n  Remember, I say ``sue to get your money back.'' While the Finance \nCommittee's investigations focused on middle- to lower middle-income \nindividuals, I had the representative of a relatively large corporation \nin my State approach me and say: You know, Senator, I know we get no \nsympathy.\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\n We are considered big and therefore we are considered wealthy as a \ncompany. But a good number of years ago the IRS withheld an additional \n$8 million that they thought was theirs and we thought was ours, and we \nwent after it, and not long ago the courts ruled it was ours. The only \nproblem is, the $8 million plus the interest plus all other assessments \nwas now about $24 million.\n  Will they get it back? I doubt it. But it was the IRS that was wrong, \nand it was the large corporation that was right. Now, that large \ncorporation could spend the money to fight the IRS and they probably \ncould write off a lot of their expenses fighting the IRS. Could an \nindividual, small taxpayer, do that? Absolutely not. So, even when the \nIRS loses, it really wins, because the IRS, with unlimited resources, \nhas been known to appeal and appeal a weak case until the innocent \ntaxpayer gives up or is just simply financially exhausted and goes \naway. That is a story that should not have to be told on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, but it is in fact a story of fact that occurs many \ntimes across this country when it should not.\n  I think the IRS needs to realize that the taxpayer is the boss, \nbecause in our system of Government that is exactly the way it ought to \nbe. Taxpayers are not a suspect criminal class in our society. Yet it \nappears from what we have heard, in example after example, and a good \nmany more that could be expressed, that that is oftentimes the way they \nare viewed by the IRS. Taxpayers should be treated with respect and \ndignity and should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n  Why should this Senator have to say that on the floor, when it ought \nto be a matter of fact and law? Because it is not a fact today, and now \nwe know it. There should be no quotas, pushing agents to prosecute \ndubious cases. Taxpayers should not be targeted on the basis of how \nlittle resistance they can offer. Can you imagine that as the policy of \na Federal agency, ``Let's pick on those who can offer least resistance \nbecause we will get a greater yield on the money spent,'' when they \ncould be innocent and can be at least embattled until they are willing \nto give up? There should be no vendettas, absolutely not, and yet there \nappear to have been some and probably are some. The privacy of \ntaxpayers should be fully respected. And, yet, is it?\n  Both the IRS and the Congress have been a part of the problem. I can \npoint the finger only at the IRS, but that would be somewhat unfair. We \nhave created one of the most complicated tax systems in the history of \nthis country. Sometimes the problem is the IRS, who act outside the \nlaw--or certainly to the very edges of the law. I am sure most IRS \nemployees are decent, hard-working, and conscientious people. And I \nknow many of these employees, as do others, and they would fit that \nwhich I have just described. But the exception has become the rule, \ntragically enough. The tail is wagging the dog, and the IRS is now \nwidely perceived as a rogue agency, marching to its own beat with \nCongress afraid to touch it because Congress itself, individually, \ncould be audited. And that has happened in the past.\n\n  So we draw back quietly, talk tough on the floors of our collective \nbodies, but very seldom follow through with actual and real hearings \nand reform that is a product of those hearings. I certainly hope that \nis simply now the exception, and the rule of the day, with the action \nthat the other body is taking and the action that I hope we will take, \nwill be comprehensive and broad-ranging reform of this agency.\n  Sometimes problems happen because previous Congresses, liberal \nCongresses, or simply those with a ravenous appetite that the taxpayer \npay the money because we need the money--whether it is balancing the \nbudget or spending beyond the will of the citizen--the money has to be \nthere. So we have granted IRS what I call power beyond the law, in many \ninstances, to collect what we ask them to collect. In any case, there \nis never an excuse for such behavior, and this Congress is going to \nchange things, I hope. Certainly, if it is this Senator speaking by his \nintent, then it is my intent, and I believe the intent of a bipartisan \nCongress, for major reform. And that we must get at.\n  So I invite the Commissioner whose nomination will be voted on today \nto work with us in a constructive way to change the character, the \nimage, the style, the culture of an agency that is now out of control. \nAnd witnesses in our country, those who make up our country, have so \ndemonstrated.\n  Real IRS reform also depends on real Tax Code reform. I will not \nmention the Senator, but right after we offered some reasonable tax \nrelief this year, he said: Well, there is relief in the Code, if you \ncan find it. So now, to the lower middle-income people for whom we \nchampion the tax relief, we say now go hire an accountant and spend the \nmoney to get the tax relief, and probably the tax relief will at least \npay for the accountant. If that is true, that is tragic. And tragically \nenough, that is probably true.\n  Sometimes the problem is the Tax Code--too complicated even for the \nIRS to understand it. Listen to these figures. The IRS publishes 480 \ndifferent tax forms and another 280 forms to explain the first 480. If \nlaid end to end, the 8 billion pages of instructions sent out by the \nIRS every year would circle the Earth 28 times. That is why Senator \nShelby and I introduced--or reintroduced--the Freedom and Fairness \nRestoration Act, better known as the flat tax. Why? Simplification, \nequity, fairness, the ability with ease to fill out a form, to know you \nare in compliance when you do it, and to once again set in motion \nsomething that has been historically true up until about two decades \nago of the taxpayer versus the Tax Code--that was an understanding in \nthis country that laws ought to be self-enforcing and that citizens \nreally did want to pay their taxes, their fair share of running a \nGovernment and keeping a free society and assuring that our democracy \nsurvived.\n  That has not been true of the last several decades. Taxpayers today \nare much more often heard to be telling their tax accountant: Find out \neverywhere you can where I do not have to pay taxes, because the code \nis too complicated and the taxes are too much. Grandfathers used to pay \nonly about 20 percent in their taxes. That meant they got to keep 80 \npercent. Their grandchildren in today's work force now have to pay \nnearly 50 percent in their taxes, keeping only half.\n  And we wonder why families can't provide for themselves today, why \nboth parents are working when one may not want to. Oftentimes it is a \ncombination, but most often it is just simply that they have to pay so \nmuch, so much is taken from their paycheck that they cannot survive \nunless both are working and providing for their family.\n  Underlying our commitment to making substantial tax reform a reality, \nI have also cosponsored leading bills to sunset the current Internal \nRevenue Code by the year 2001. Mr. President, this Senate, the 105th \nCongress, led by conservative Republicans, have a unique opportunity, \nworking with all of our colleagues, to assure that major reform of the \nIRS occurs and that we lead a march toward a significant reform of the \ncode that brings us to a simple, fairer form that then allows the \nresponsible downsizing of the IRS.\n  No people can remain free or their government effective if they do \nnot display trust and confidence in each other. Yet, America's tax \nsystem increasingly eats like a cancer at the very bonds of support and \nthe legitimacy of our society.\n  I urge all of my colleagues and invite the new IRS Commissioner to \nredouble their efforts to restore fairness to the tax system and trust \nto the people. Reform for the Tax Code, making it simpler, fairer and, \nI hope, flatter, is one approach toward doing that. Reform for the tax \ncollector, increasing IRS accountability and requiring the IRS to treat \nthe taxpayer with dignity, respect and the due process of the law would \nbe a legacy that I wish could be done during my tenure in the U.S. \nSenate and I believe that would be a legacy that a majority of the \nSenators would like to leave. That is our goal. That is certainly my \nhope. Recognizing that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \non the pending nomination at 5:45 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to express \nmy support for the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be the new \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Rossotti will face a \ndaunting challenge as he takes over the reins of this besieged agency.\n  The IRS has suffered from years of neglect and lack of focus. As new \nCommissioner, Mr. Rossotti will need to repair the damage that has \neaten away at the Service's foundation and try to restore some \nsemblance of respect for the IRS among the average taxpayer.\n  At the same time, he will need to be preparing the IRS for the \nchallenges of the next century.\n  The public expects some essential services from the Government, and \nmost people are willing to pay their fair share of taxes in order to \npay for these services.\n  Nobody likes paying taxes, but most of us do it regularly and \nhonestly.\n  In return, we expect the Government to keep the process fair, make it \nas simple as possible, and keep our personal information private.\n  Running the IRS is a study in careful balances. And I believe that \nthe IRS has somehow lost its ability to maintain one side of the \nequation over the years.\n  Many tax collectors, in their zeal to catch the few people who don't \npay their taxes, seem to have lost sight of the most important truth \nabout our tax system--that citizens have rights that must be protected.\n  Anything less undermines our ability to make a system of voluntary \ntaxation work.\n  We certainly don't want to tie IRS's hands so much that tax cheats \nare encouraged, because the rest of us end up picking up the tab when \nsomeone cheats.\n  At the same time, we also can't have IRS harassing innocent citizens, \nassuming everyone is guilty the minute they walk in the door. Mr. \nRossotti will be the one person we will expect to help IRS find its way \nback to the reasonable balance that our tax system requires.\n  I hope and expect that we in the Congress will do our best to help.\n  We will be looking at legislative solutions, to give the new \nCommissioner the tools to encourage the climate of change we need if we \nare to reverse the past years of decline.\n  We will be looking at stable funding, to make sure Mr. Rossotti has \nthe money to pay good people and buy new computers.\n  I hope we would also be looking at tax simplification, to make it a \nlittle easier for both taxpayers and the IRS to figure out how much our \nfair share really amounts to.\n  Mr. Rossotti has the background and expertise to help him achieve the \ndifficult tasks we expect of him in the days ahead. I wish him every \nsuccess, and look forward to working with him to make sure the Internal \nRevenue Service reaches its full potential.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Charles \nRossotti's nomination to serve as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService. The IRS is an agency under widespread, deeply felt, and \nentirely justified criticism. In my view, the nomination before us \ntoday is perhaps one of the most critical the Senate will vote on this \nsession. I commend President Clinton for endorsing an individual who \nhas the expertise and vision to lead the effort to restructure and \nreform this troubled agency, as well as my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee for moving the nomination expeditiously.\n  It is no secret that the IRS has come under fire lately from \ntaxpayers who, in their dealings with the agency, have experienced \nanger, frustration, and despair. The hearings conducted by the Finance \nCommittee earlier this fall highlighted some of the problems at the \nIRS, including shoddy management, poor taxpayer service, and in some \ncases, reports of taxpayer abuse by IRS employees.\n  I've heard stories from my own constituents about calls that aren't \nanswered, and about calls that are bounced from one person to the next, \nwhere they never get a real answer or any type of guidance or support. \nI've also heard stories about the IRS losing people's checks and then \ncharging them interest and penalties on this money. The list goes on \nand on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk to, the more \nnightmares you hear.\n  Every citizen who pays taxes has a right to be treated fairly, and \ntreated as innocent until proven guilty. Although we have taken several \nsteps in this regard in the last few years, there is still more that \ncan be done, and that is why I am a cosponsor of S. 1096, the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act.\n  This legislation aims to transform the troubled agency into a modern \ninstitution that provides efficient and fair service, yet still has the \nability to effectively collect revenues. Specifically, the bill will \nenact 21 new taxpayer protections and will establish a hotline for \ntaxpayers to register complaints of IRS misconduct. This legislation, \nwhich enjoys broad, bipartisan support and is endorsed by the \nadministration, is, in my view, a tremendous step forward in our effort \nto protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers.\n  Yet, without an effective leader to implement these much-needed \nchanges, our ideas become nothing but good intentions. I believe that \nMr. Rossotti is up to the challenge to successfully steer the IRS \nthrough this difficult period. Mr. Rossotti brings with him the \nrefreshing ideas and outlook of a successful businessman with more than \n30 years of management and technology experience, including his current \nposition as Chairman of American Management Systems.\n  During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Rossotti expressed a \nwillingness and desire to implement fundamental changes that would \nfocus on the rights of the taxpayer, modernize the agency and its \ntechnology, and strengthen communication between Congress, the IRS, and \nthe public. In my view, Mr. Rossotti has the vision and the capability \nto lead this agency and is committed to holding the IRS to the highest \nstandards of efficiency, competence, and accountability. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the nominee \nto be Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Charles \nRossotti. Mr. Rossotti is unique among nominees for this position since \nhe is the first nontax-lawyer nominated for the post. In fact, he is a \nbusinessman who is chairman of American Management Systems, a company \nhe cofounded in 1970, which now employs some 7,000 people.\n  Mr. President, if this man is confirmed, and I expect that he will \nbe, he faces a daunting challenge in turning around an agency which has \nvery serious credibility problems with this Senator and, I think, a \nmajority of the American public as well.\n  As this country learned some 6 weeks ago in the hearings at the \nSenate Finance Committee, the IRS is an agency with structural and \npersonnel problems that have led to an agency culture that is abusive, \nunresponsive, and to some extent arrogant. Far too often, the Internal \nRevenue Service appears to be out of control, with no accountability to \nthe public or to the policymakers here in Washington. For anyone who \nhas tried to phone the IRS lately, why, I think you get the flavor for \nmy generalizations.\n  The bipartisan Kerrey-Portman Commission that examined the Internal \nRevenue Service recommended a series of changes at the IRS, including \nthe creation of an independent board to oversee IRS operations. \nRecently, the House passed a measure incorporating nearly all of the \nCommission's recommendations. However, I believe that the lessons \nlearned from the Finance Committee September hearings suggest that far \nmore needs to be done if the public is going to regain a measure of \nconfidence in the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I applaud the Finance Committee chairman, Chairman Roth, for his \ncommitment to hold a series of hearings\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nthat will build on the achievements of the House and bring a tough \nreform bill to the floor of the Senate next year.\n  To give you an idea of the structural problems that exist at the \nInternal Revenue Service, consider the following description of the \nService that was done by Paul Light, author of ``The Tides of Reform: \nMaking Government Work, 1945-1995.''\n\n       Just imagine a bureaucracy that goes something like this: \n     an agent reports to a district group manager, who reports to \n     a district group manager, who reports to a branch chief, who \n     reports to an assistant chief of the division, who reports to \n     the assistant district director, who reports to the assistant \n     regional commissioner, who reports to the deputy assistant \n     commissioner, who reports to the assistant commissioner, who \n     reports to the chief operating officer, who reports to the \n     deputy commissioner, and so on.\n\n  What we have here, Mr. President, is a layered bureaucracy which \nimplies accountability on paper but which, in reality, is designed by \nits very nature to be unaccountable.\n  Consider, Mr. President, the testimony the committee heard from Lynda \nWillis of the General Accounting Office [GAO].\n\n       IRS systems, both manual and automated, have not been \n     designed to capture and report comprehensive information on \n     the use and possible misuse of collection authorities.\n       IRS cannot readily produce data on the overall use or \n     misuse of its collection enforcement authorities or on the \n     characteristics of affected taxpayers.\n\n  In effect, GAO said they couldn't audit IRS because the systems IRS \nhas put in place are designed to ensure that there is no way for IRS \npersonnel to be held accountable for their erroneous actions. There is \nno way to determine how many times IRS has made a mistake in sending \nout a collection notice. No way to determine how many complaints have \nbeen received. And this is the way the managers at IRS set up the \nsystem--set it up so that no one can trace improper behavior.\n  Mr. President, the committee also heard testimony to the effect that \nthe Problem Resolution Office [PRO], the office designed to resolve \ntaxpayer disputes with IRS is, and I quote one of our witnesses, \n``utterly useless'' in protecting the American taxpayer. The reason the \nPRO cannot function as designed is because employees at PRO are \nevaluated for promotions by the same Collection Division management \nthey are supposed to police while assigned to the PRO.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason that that kind of conflict of \ninterest should exist. I plan on working with the Finance Committee \nchairman to develop legislation that will fundamentally change the PRO \nstructure to ensure that taxpayers get a fair shake when there's a \nconflict with the IRS.\n  Mr. President, the Finance Committee hearings had a profound effect \non the American public and on the President of the United States. \nShortly after those hearings, and seeing the polls, the President did a \n180-degree U-turn on the recommendations of the IRS Commission and \ndecided to back the House reform legislation creating an independent \nIRS management board.\n  That's not the end of this matter. Instead we need a top-to-bottom \nreview of the IRS. In the past, we adopted two taxpayer bill of rights \nbills which many of us thought would improve taxpayer-IRS interactions. \nThe hearings in the Finance Committee suggest that these bills did \nlittle to alleviate tensions between the IRS and the American taxpayer.\n  That is why the Finance Committee needs to hold further hearings on \nIRS reform. It has taken decades for the IRS to develop internal \nprocedures that appear to make it unaccountable. We've learned of these \nproblems 6 weeks ago. I am willing to admit that we don't know all the \nanswers, but I know that now is not the time to merely take the House \nbill, pass it, and tell the public we fixed the problems at IRS. We \nhaven't.\n  Mr. President, Charles Rossotti is to be admired for his willingness \nto leave the private sector and take on this challenge at a time when \nIRS is in serious trouble. I look forward to receiving his \nrecommendations for change at the Service after he has been there a few \nmonths. And I am sure his hands-on experience will assist the Finance \nCommittee in drafting a comprehensive IRS reform bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination of Mr. Rossotti.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Charles Rossotti, of the District of \nColumbia, to be Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service?\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, it is an honor to take this opportunity \nto pay tribute to Sheila Widnall, the Secretary of the Air Force, who \nis leaving office at the end of this month to return to the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of aeronautics and \nastronautics. In 1993, Secretary Widnall became the first woman to \nserve as a service Secretary when she assumed her present position as \nthe Secretary of the Air Force, and she has done an outstanding job.\n  During her distinguished tenure, Secretary Widnall has led the Air \nForce through a critical period of post-cold-war consolidation and \nadjustment. Congress and the country are proud of her achievements. She \ndirected a modernization program to shape the future\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\nof the Air Force and incorporate space technology into military \noperations. She led the Department's remarkable success in overhauling \nits business practices, including major initiatives in acquisition \nreform, outsourcing, and privatization to increase efficiency and make \nmaximum use of scarce funds. She has also taken the lead in \nstrengthening the Nation's role in space, by working effectively with \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National \nReconnaissance Office, and the private space sector.\n  Above all, Secretary Widnall has done her best to care for Air Force \nmembers and their families. Her emphasis on equal opportunity and her \nskillful and tireless pursuit of quality of life issues kept morale \nhigh during a period of significant and far-reaching change.\n  Secretary Widnall brought an outstanding background to her current \nposition. Her accomplishments include many years as a professor of \naeronautics and astronautics and also as associate provost at MIT. She \nhas earned international recognition for her work in fluid dynamics, \nand has had extensive service on numerous boards, panels, and \ncommittees in government, industry, and the academic world.\n  In her years as Secretary, Sheila Widnall has set a high standard of \nleadership and service to the Nation. I know I am joined by my \ncolleagues in Congress and a grateful Nation in thanking her for her \ndedication and distinguished service to our country, and I wish her \nwell in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11597-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM DAVIDSON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly \noutstanding business leader and philanthropist from my home State of \nMichigan, William Davidson. Bill Davidson has been chosen as the \nhonorary chair of the Council of Michigan Foundations 25th annual \nconference, which takes place November 5-7, 1997.\n  Bill Davidson is one of Michigan's most renowned businesspeople. He \nis the chairman of the board and president of Guardian Industries, an \ninternational manufacturer of flat glass products for the construction \nand automotive industries. He is also the majority owner of the Detroit \nPistons Basketball Club, the Palace Sports and Entertainment Arena, \nPine Knob Music Theater, the Detroit Vipers hockey team, and the \nDetroit Neon soccer team.\n  Bill has received numerous citations and awards for his philanthropic \nactivities, his contributions to the glass industry, and professional \nsports. Some of these awards include the Phoenix Award, an honorary \ndoctoral degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, the \nOrder of Merit in Labor of the Highest Class from the Republic of \nVenezuela, the Fred M. Butzel Award for Distinguished Community \nService, and membership in the Michigan Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n  One of Bill Davidson's most remarkable traits is his commitment to \nimproving the lives of people throughout the world. Giving is an \nimportant part of his life, and he is known locally and nationally for \nhis philanthropic vision and generosity. He does not take success for \ngranted and is most thankful for what he has achieved. As a result, he \nchooses to support institutions and programs which help develop the \nminds and bodies of tomorrow's leaders.\n  It is this commitment to philanthropy that was the guiding force for \nhis creation of the Pistons-Palace Foundation, the philanthropic arm of \nthe Detroit Pistons and the Palace of Auburn Hills. Bill Davidson and \nthe foundation have contributed millions of dollars to support \nmeaningful youth and recreation programs throughout metropolitan \nDetroit. The Pistons-Palace Foundation is quickly gaining recognition \nin the National Basketball Association and receiving national attention \nfor its work in the city of Detroit, specifically through the PARK \nprogram, which works to revitalize neighborhoods by refurbishing and \nrenovating parks and installing outdoor basketball courts and other \nrecreation equipment at sites.\n  Developing tomorrow's leaders through higher education is another of \nBill Davidson's highest priorities. He contributed $35 million to \nestablish the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan \nSchool of Business Administration. The institute strives to help \ncountries as they make the transition to free market economies and to \nassist companies which seek to operate successfully in those countries. \nTo that end, the Davidson Institute offers seminars for business and \ngovernment leaders from countries with economies in transition and \ndevelops faculty fellows who teach or work in those countries upon \ncompletion of the program. Bill also established the world's first \neducational institution entirely dedicated to the international \nmanagement of technology-based companies at the Technion-Israel \nInstitute of Technology. Bill Davidson's commitment to keeping Jewish \neducation strong led him to help to create graduate school of Jewish \neducation at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York \nCity, which trains educators for North America.\n  It is not possible to do Bill Davidson's lifetime of good works \njustice in a few words, but there is no doubt among anyone who knows of \nhim that he is a truly remarkable person. His dedication to improving \npeople's lives and the unpretentious way he goes about that quest has \nearned him respect and gratitude from countless people around the \nworld. Millions more who will never know of Bill Davidson have \nbenefited from his efforts and accomplishments.\n  Mr. President, all of us in this body can learn from the examples set \nby Bill Davidson. I know my colleagues will join me in offering him \ncongratulations and best wishes on this important occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11598-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11598-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE CANCELLATION OF DISCRETIONARY BUDGET AUTHORITY (97-72)--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 77\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, received on November 1, 1997, \ntogether with an accompanying report, referred jointly, pursuant to \nPublic Law 93-344, to the Committee on Appropriations and to the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the dollar \namounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the attached \nreports, contained in the ``Department of Transportation and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-66; H.R. 2169).

Res. 142\n\n       Whereas the current economic expansion is now in its \n     seventh year and shows no signs of ending;\n       Whereas the unemployment rate is below 5 percent for the \n     first time in 24 years;\n       Whereas the current official inflation rate, which may be \n     overstated, is about 2 percent;\n       Whereas the deficit has been reduced from $290,000,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 1992 to $23,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1997, \n     or just three-tenths of 1 percent of the Gross Domestic \n     Product (GDP);\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office projects that, \n     under present law, the unified budget will have a surplus of \n     $86,000,000,000 in 2007;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office also projects that, \n     under present law, the debt held by the public will fall from \n     about 50 percent of GDP this year to about 30 percent by \n     2007;\n       Whereas this extraordinary combination of good budget and \n     economic news is largely\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\n     the result of budget policies included in the Omnibus Budget \n     and Reconciliation Act of 1993;\n       Whereas the budget is not yet in surplus;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office also projects that \n     the deficit is likely to reappear after 2007, and that the \n     debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP is also likely \n     to increase as the baby boom generation begins to retire;\n       Whereas, without the on-budget surpluses of the social \n     security trust funds, the Congressional Budget Office still \n     projects annual deficits of about $100,000,000,000 even after \n     the budget is ``balanced'' in 2002; and\n       Whereas projected unified budget surpluses in the short-run \n     would rapidly disappear if the current expansion ends, and \n     the economy would enter a recession: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any unified budget surpluses that might arise in the \n     current expansion should be used to reduce the Federal debt \n     held by the public; and\n       (2) to achieve this goal during this economic expansion \n     that there be no net tax cut or new spending that is not \n     offset by reductions in spending on other programs or tax \n     increases.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there is now clear evidence that at \nleast for the short run, both the economy and the budget have attained \nto a singular degree of stability.\n  Consider the following facts:\n  The current economic expansion is now in its seventh year and shows \nno sign of ending; the unemployment rate is below 5 percent for the \nfirst time in 24 years; the current official inflation rate, which may \nbe--and almost certainly is--overstated, is about 2 percent; the \ndeficit has been reduced from $290 billion in fiscal year 1992 to $23 \nbillion in fiscal year 1997, or just three-tenths of 1 percent of our \ngross domestic product; the Congressional Budget Office projects that, \nunder present law, the unified budget will have a surplus of $86 \nbillion in the year 2007. I repeat that unfamiliar phrase--a surplus of \n$86 billion. The Congressional Budget Office also projects that, under \npresent law, the debt held by the public will fall from about 50 \npercent of gross domestic product this year to about 30 percent by \n2007.\n  May I suggest to my colleagues that, for the first time in 20 years \nor more, such good economic news is upon us and was previously thought \nunattainable.\n  Last week, at a Finance Committee hearing on his confirmation to be \nTreasury Assistant Secretary of Economic Policy, David Wilcox quoted a \nfavorite economics professor of his at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology--and I have the honor to say, parenthetically, a long and \ngood friend of mine--the distinguished Nobel laureate Robert Solow. As \nWilcox recalls, Professor Solow said something as follows.\n\n       . . . the most important thing economists have to \n     communicate to the rest of the world is how effectively \n     markets work. The most important thing that economists have \n     to tell each other is the important ways in which markets \n     sometimes don't work exactly right.\n\n  One need not engage in a long discourse on the fundamental \ndifferences between Keynesian and classical macroeconomic theories, to \nrealize that during the last recession and current expansion, the \ndeficit has changed as economists would expect, or in any event would \nhope.\n  Between fiscal 1989 and fiscal 1991, as the economy entered a \nrecession, gross domestic product in nominal--which is to say money \nterms--grew at an average rate of 4.7 percent. Revenues to the Federal \nGovernment, however, only grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent, while \noutlays grew by 7.6 percent. Now this imbalance between the growth in \nrevenues and outlays--which helped moderate the recession, as we \nlearned through painful experience in the middle of the century--would \nordinarily be welcomed were it not for the fact that, in 1989, the \nFederal Government's deficit was already 3.8 percent of GDP. As it \nwere, the deficit reached 5.5 percent of GDP in 1991 and 1992.\n  For the next 2 years, the economy slowly recovered from the \nrecession. And then, in 1993, something extraordinary happened; we \npassed what I have since acknowledged to be the largest tax increase in \nhistory. We also limited the growth in spending.\n  The results--quite contrary to those predicted by many who opposed \nthe measure--are truly remarkable. Between 1993 and 1997, GDP increased \nat an average annual rate of 5.3 percent. Mr. President, that doubles \nin something like 13 or 14 years. To double your GDP every 14 years, \nthat would quadruple in a generation, which is almost unimaginable. \nReal gross domestic product--that is adjusting for inflation--increased \nat an average annual rate of about 3.5 percent, compared to almost no \nreal growth for the period from 1989 to 1991. With rapid, \nnoninflationary growth, revenues increased at an average annual rate of \n8.2 percent, while outlays grew at a modest 3.3 percent annual rate.\n  For the fiscal year just ended, the comparison is even more striking. \nThe economy grew by 5.9 percent, while revenues grew by 8.7 percent and \noutlays by a mere 2.7 percent. We have had no such experience in \npostwar periods. I don't know if we have ever had such an experience.\n  Mr. President, may I suggest that while the revenues and outlays grew \nas one would expect during the various phases of a business cycle, it \nwas only after a very great deal of effort, and not an inconsiderable \namount of pain that we have brought the Federal budget into near \nbalance--a deficit of $22.6 billion, a rather insubstantial three-\ntenths of 1 percent of GDP.\n  But, sir, in the closing days of this first session of the 105th \nCongress, we can risk it all. Perhaps we should follow the admonition \nthat Hippocrates bequeathed to the medical profession, which somehow \ntranslated it from Greek into Latin, in the passage of the Hippocratic \noath: ``primum non nocere''--``first do no harm.''\n\n  Tax legislation for this session of the 105th Congress is and should \nbe concluded.\n  Mr. President, my remarks till now have focused on the short run and \npleasant and unparalleled economic and budget circumstances in which we \nnow find ourselves. But before we devote too much energy to tax cuts in \nthe next session of the 105th Congress, we should be mindful of the \nfollowing less-than-exuberant facts.\n  First, the budget is not yet in surplus.\n  Second, the Congressional Budget Office also projects that the \ndeficit is likely to reappear after the year 2007 and that the debt \nheld by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product is likely \nto increase as the baby boom generation begins to retire.\n  Third, without the on-budget surpluses of the Social Security trust \nfunds, the Congressional Budget Office still projects annual deficits \nof about $100 billion even after the budget is balanced in the year \n2002.\n  I make the point, Mr. President, as Senator Dole remarked yesterday \non ``Meet The Press,'' in 1983 we made major changes in the Social \nSecurity System which have made it solvent and in surplus every year \nsince then and for many years still to come. But that surplus is not \nsaved in any conventional sense of the word; it is expended on other \npurposes that have nothing to do with social insurance, a matter which \nI know troubled Senator Dole when he was still our most revered \ncolleague and majority leader.\n  And, lastly, projected unified budget surpluses in the short run \nwould rapidly disappear if the current expansion ends and the economy \nwere to enter a recession.\n  In that setting, Mr. President, I offer a resolution which I hope to \ncall up at some point in the days remaining in the first session of the \n105th Congress to express the sense of the Senate regarding the \ntreatment of any future unified budget surpluses.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from New York, who, I think, has spoken very \nclearly to what happens in large part when the Congress of the United \nStates restrains spending. While I recognize that there were certainly \nadded revenues by a substantially large tax increase, if the Congress \nfollowing that had followed the practices of past Congresss, and that \nis of course, a promise to reduce spending for every so many dollars of \nincrease--and, I think I had heard that promise over my years in the \nHouse and in the Senate--I doubt that we would be experiencing the kind \nof economic vitality that we are currently and that the Senator spoke \nto. This Congress adhered to very real spending restraints, and as a \nresult of that the markets recognized that we were not\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\ngoing to spend beyond our limits and, in fact, we would actually see a \nreduction in deficit of the kind the Senator spoke to. There is no \nquestion that with that kind of restraint here, the markets have \nresponded and our citizens and our work force are now experiencing the \nkind of economic growth of which we are all extremely proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11599-7", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THE RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 1545\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1269) to establish objectives for negotiating and \nprocedures for implementing certain trade agreements; as follows:\n\n       Add the following subsection (d) to section 3:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the U.S. \n     Government shall not enter into any treaty or other \n     international agreement that, in whole or in part, would have \n     the purpose or effect of transferring any jurisdiction or \n     authority to decide cases under U.S. law away from the \n     federal judiciary.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the trade \n     agreement negotiating authority of this section 3 of this Act \n     shall not apply to the negotiation of any trade agreement \n     that would have the purpose or effect of transferring any \n     jurisdiction or authority to decide cases under U.S. law away \n     from the federal judiciary, and the trade agreement approval \n     procedures shall not apply to implementing bills submitted \n     with respect to any such trade agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11601-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11601-S11611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               McCONNELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1546\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, and Ms. \nLandrieu) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nbill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free expenditures from education individual retirement accounts for \nelementary and secondary school expenses, to increase the maximum \nannual amount of contributions to such accounts, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new sections:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President I rise today to \nhonor the town of Hampton Falls, NH, for celebrating its 275th \nanniversary on November 22, 1997. The town is planning an evening of \ncelebration, commemoration, and entertainment on this most important \ndate. There will be a dinner party, a musical presentation by the \nWinnacunnet High School Chamber Singers, and a historical slide show \ndedicated to 275 years of history and heritage. This special night is \ncertain to include full participation from the town's proud people.\n  Originally, Hampton Falls was part of the town of Hampton. However, \ndue to its seacoast location, high tides often prevented those living \nin the area from attending the church. In 1709 the General Assembly of \nPortsmouth acted on this problem and gave the residents permission to \nmaintain a separate church. Nine years later Hampton Falls became a \nseparate parish. That same year the first town meeting was held in \nwhich selectmen and a town clerk were elected.\n  Hampton Falls, however, still remained a part of Hampton. The \ntownspeople successfully petitioned for independence from their parent \nchurch after the death of the minister from that town. On November 22, \n1722, the town was incorporated as an independent jurisdiction.\n  Hampton Falls can be categorized as the quintessential New England \ntown through its history and scenery. During the eighteenth century the \nlocal economy was dominated by mills; sawmills, gristmills, and cotton \nmills dotted the landscape and provided for a major source of \nemployment. Also, the town served as an important post town where horse \nchanges were frequently made. At times, up to 125 horses could be found \nstabled within this small vicinity. One of the most significant stables \nin the area was the Wells Inn, which could accommodate 40 horses. \nToday, the stage house is known as the Wellswood Inn, and provides fine \nfood and atmosphere to patrons. On December 13, 1774 Paul Revere passed \nthrough Hampton Falls on his legendary ride from Boston to Portsmouth \nproclaiming the arrival of the British. Few towns can claim a more \nAmerican existence. Hampton Falls, with its simple white churches and \ncolonial buildings, provides for a prime example of American history \nand culture.\n  Today, Hampton Falls is a thriving southern New Hampshire community \nof approximately 1,700 people. The town is unmistakably New England. \nWinding country roads bring one past many sprawling farms and picture-\nperfect farmhouses. Presently, the town's central industry is \nagriculture. A major area business is Applecrest Farms, one of the last \nworking orchards on the seacoast. Applecrest celebrates the harvest \nseason with pick-your-own apples, a country farmers market, and \nentertainment. Harvest season is a festive time in Hampton Falls, and \nit seems fitting that the town's anniversary would be during this \nperiod.\n  I congratulate the residents of this beautiful town on 275 years of \ndistinguished history, and wish to extend my very best wishes of \ncontinued prosperity. Happy birthday, Hampton Falls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11611-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11611-S11612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CAMPAIGN FINANCE IS STILL A PRIORITY\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I recently had the privilege of \nattending a reunion of Carter administration officials in Atlanta. In \nan interview he gave to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, President \nCarter, whose personal integrity has never been questioned, summed up \nthe current state of affairs very candidly, and all too well. The \nPresident's comments, which appeared in the October 19, 1997 edition of \nthe Journal-Constitution, were as follows:\n\n       The intense competition now almost forces Democrats and \n     Republicans to cut corners on basic principles of politics in \n     order to raise enormous amounts of soft money. I think it's \n     an embarrassment to our nation. It's a travesty of proper \n     political life. And I think it debilitates democracy itself \n     in our country. As (Vice President Mondale) and I have \n     agreed, it's a form of legal bribery. People can raise \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars and contribute that money to \n     candidates in both parties. They don't do this from a sense \n     of altruism or benevolence or generosity. They do it in \n     expectation of access to leaders, to present their point of \n     view personally to someone in the Senate or someone in the \n     White House when the people who might suffer from that sort \n     of decision don't have an equal opportunity to present their \n     point of view. So it distorts the whole political system and \n     I hope it will be changed.\n\n  At that same Atlanta gathering, former Vice President Mondale \nparaphrased Abraham Lincoln to the effect that, ``With public trust, \neverything is possible. Without public trust, nothing is possible.'' He \nadded, compellingly: ``Public trust cannot be bought. It must be \nearned.''\n  Indeed, this is an indictment of our political system from \nindividuals who have reached the pinnacle of success in that system. I \nbelieve the single most important step we can take in this Congress in \nrebuilding public confidence and faith in our democracy is\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\nto enact, on a bipartisan basis, meaningful campaign finance reform to \nclean up a system which has gotten completely out of control and which \nundermines both the operation and reputation of our entire national \ngovernment. I think President Carter and Vice President Mondale would \ncertainly agree, and I commend their observations to my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11611-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RICHARD LETTS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nLansing, MI's most outstanding citizens who recently passed away, \nRichard Letts. Because of his tremendous commitment and involvement in \nmany organizations throughout the community, Mr. Letts became \naffectionately known as Mr. Lansing.\n  Mr. Letts' life, even while fighting a battle against cancer, was a \ntribute to the human spirit. Whether as a champion athlete, a 27-year \ncareer as Lansing's human relations director or a community leader in \nvolunteer organizations such as Boy Scouts, United Way, Old Newsboys, \nUnited Negro College Fund, Boys and Girls Club, Urban League, and Lions \nClub just to name a few, Richard Letts was a dominating figure in \nLansing's landscape. Yet even as he struggled with his health, the \npeople of Lansing gave tributes, proclamations, speeches, and parades \nto a man who so often became the comforter, as people came to comfort \nhim.\n  Olivia Letts, Richard's wife of 46 years, has said, ``People don't \nchange who they are when they become ill.'' Indeed, Mr. Letts refused \nto quit. His message in his life, and our future: Race should not \nmatter, color should not matter, all people matter. Richard Letts \nmattered to Lansing and all of Michigan. The loss of his presence will \nbe mourned, but the mark his life left on Lansing is permanent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11612-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   POSITION ON CLOTURE VOTES ON H.R. 2646 AND DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION \n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was not present for the cloture \nvotes on October 31, 1997. I would like to record my position, had I \nbeen present for the votes.\n  Had I been present for the cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Education \nSavings Act for Public and Private Schools, I would have opposed \ncloture. In addition to the many serious public policy implications \nraised by this legislation, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee \nI have serious concerns about the virtually unprecedented manner in \nwhich it was brought to the floor. After H.R. 2646 was approved by the \nHouse it was sent directly to the desk, where it was pulled from and \nsent to the floor--completely bypassing the Finance Committee where \nvirtually all tax legislation is reviewed.\n  The lack of review is particularly distressing given the budget \nimplications of H.R. 2646--it would increase spending by $4 billion \nover 10 years. It is both shortsighted and unwise to make major \nmodifications in the Tax Code without review by the committee of \njurisdiction and without first asking a simple question: Are these \nIRA's our highest priority for educational funding? To my way of \nthinking, that question has not been addressed.\n  When this bill was immediately considered under a cloture strategy, \nall ability to make any changes in this policy were blocked. That is \nsimply unacceptable. This legislation should be considered under a less \nrestricted approach. In keeping with the customary Senate approach we \nshould conduct a thorough debate with ample opportunity for amendments. \nAnything less should be rejected.\n  I should also note my absence for the cloture vote on the Defense \nauthorization conference report. Cloture was invoked in an overwhelming \nvote. Had I been present, I too would have cast my vote in favor of \ncloture.\n  Mr. President, there are many demands made on the time of a Senator. \nFew are as important or as rewarding as being a part of the life of our \nschool children. And on last Friday, when presented with a choice \nbetween keeping important commitments to Montana students or procedural \nvotes in the Senate, I faced a difficult decision. And while I take my \nresponsibilities here in Washington very seriously, I decided that I \nneeded to be with these Montana students on this occasion. And in this \nparticular instance my votes would not have affected the ultimate \noutcome of either vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11612-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DANIEL URBAN KILEY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDaniel Urban Kiley of Charlotte, VT, recipient of a 1997 National Medal \nof Arts. The National Medal of Arts is our Nation's highest honor in \nthe arts, recognizing individuals and organizations who have made \noutstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and \navailability of the arts in the United States. Mr. Kiley is the first \nlandscape architect to be honored with this prestigious award.\n  Mr. Kiley, 84, has been called ``the most celebrated landscape \narchitect of this century''. His many works include the setting for \nDulles International Airport, the grounds for the Gateway Arch in St. \nLouis, the interior and exterior landscapes for the East Wing of the \nNational Gallery of Art, and the Navy Pier in Chicago. Yet, despite his \nwork all over the world, Mr. Kiley has stayed in close touch with the \npeople and landscapes of Vermont. His work can be seen at Twin Farms \nInn in Barnard, VT, the Lake Champlain Basin Region, and even at my own \nfarm in Shrewsbury.\n  Daniel Kiley's works have been likened to ``a walk through nature,'' \nreflecting his central tenet that designs should grow out of a \nlandscape, not be forced upon it. His designs have been sought out by \nthe leading modern architects and his unique vision celebrated and \ntaught throughout the world.\n  In addition to his long career as a landscape architect, Mr. Kiley \nserved as an Army Captain in World War II. He was selected by President \nTruman and General Eisenhower to find a site to try the Nazi War \ncriminals, and his selection of Nuremberg as the site as well as his \ncourtroom design earned him the Decorated Legion of Merit.\n  Once again, I rise to honor Mr. Kiley's many contributions and \naccomplishments, far too numerous to list today. As a Vermonter, and as \none of the millions of Americans who have enjoyed Daniel Kiley's \ndesigns, I extend my most heartfelt congratulations on his receiving \nthe National Medal of Arts, and I wish him many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11612-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11612-S11613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATIONS TO MEAGAN CORLIN AND ALIA SZOPA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate two outstanding youths, Meagan Corlin and Alia Szopa, who \nare the 1997 honorees from New Hampshire for the Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards. These awards, sponsored by the Prudential Insurance \nCo. of America in partnership with the National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, honor outstanding, self-initiated \ncommunity service by young people in middle and high school grades.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, the country's largest \nyouth recognition program based solely on community service, were \ncreated in 1995 following a nationwide survey of high school students. \nThe survey indicated that while 95 percent of teenagers believe \ncommunity volunteer work is important, a large proportion don't know \nhow to get involved and lack role models that could inspire them to \nseek out volunteer opportunities. As a former high school teacher, I am \nwell aware of the importance of empowering students with volunteer \nopportunities.\n  Meagan and Alia have both created innovative community service \nprograms to serve various needs in their respective communities.\n  Meagan Corlin, from Strafford School in Center Strafford, NH, created \na reading program called Story-time on the Road to share her love of \nbooks with others. She uses her title as Miss New Hampshire Pre-Teen to \npromote her program to day care centers, libraries, elderly housing \nfacilities, and homeless shelters. Each week, she and several of her \nschoolmates travel to these various locations in order to read stories \nto children or to the elderly.\n  Alia Szopa, from Central High School in Manchester, NH, created a \ndance program called Legato for pre-teen\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\ngirls with developmental disabilities. Her program works in conjunction \nwith the Moore Center, an agency serving the disabled, to provide \ntraining for dance instructors who will teach the children at the \ncenter. One hour each week, from November to June, Szopa and five other \ninstructors teach basic dance to five students.\n  School honorees are judged by State selection committees, which name \nthe top middle-level and high school volunteer in each State. These \nState-level honorees receive a silver medallion, $1,000 and a trip to \nWashington, DC with a parent or guardian, for several days of national \nrecognition events in May. Also, in May, America's top 10 youth \nvolunteers for 1998 are chosen from the State-level honorees by a blue-\nribbon national selection panel. These 10 national honorees will be \nannounced at a special ceremony at the National Press Club in \nWashington, where they each will receive an additional $5,000, a gold \nmedallion and a crystal trophy for his or her school.\n  Meagan and Alia have made significant contributions to their \ncommunities and to the State of New Hampshire. Not only have they \nserved their community selflessly, but they have also served as \ninspirational role models to other students. Volunteerism strengthens \ncommunity life as well as enhances the lives of people. I applaud \nMeagan and Alia's dedication and innovation in creating programs to \nserve the needs of citizens in their community. Without these young \nleaders, our country would be lost. It takes a special person to make a \ndifference in someone's life. Meagan and Alia are indeed special and \ntreasures to their school, the State of New Hampshire and to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11612-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE VETERANS' CEMETERY PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, next week, November 11, our Nation will \nobserve Veterans Day. Commemorative services will be held throughout \nthe Nation on that day. I expect services will be held at Arlington \nCemetery and other national cemeteries, where thousands of war dead are \nburied.\n  As I mentioned in a statement last May, prior to Memorial Day, Mr. \nPresident, not all activities at our national cemeteries have honored \nour Nation's veterans. There have been, unfortunately, instances of \nvandalism and theft at our national cemeteries. While many of these \nincidents are minor, many attacks on national cemeteries are serious. \nThe Department of Justice reports that between January 1, 1995, and May \n31, 1997, there were 21 reports of vandalism or crime at national \ncemeteries, where the estimated damage was over $1,000. The total loss \nto our national cemeteries from these incidents is more than $98,000. \nIn addition, more than 56 incidents were reported, with damage less \nthan $1,000, during that same time period. These incidents caused \nanother $15,000 in losses to the Government.\n  The harm resulting from attacks on our national cemeteries, however, \nis more than economic loss. Such criminal activity is an assault on the \nhonor of our veterans, particularly those who made the supreme \nsacrifice in defense of our Nation. It is an attack on the heritage and \nvalues for which our veterans fought. Such conduct is unconscionable \nand deserves a strong response.\n  The time has come to demand a stop to this type of insulting behavior \nand punish it when it occurs. That is why I introduced S. 813, the \nVeterans' Cemetery Protection Act of 1997. This bill imposes criminal \npenalties for vandalism and theft at national cemeteries operated by \nthe VA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Interior.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nreview and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide an \nappropriate sentencing enhancement for any offense against the property \nof a national cemetery.\n  I am delighted that Senators McCain, Inhofe, Inouye, D'Amato, and \nSessions have joined as cosponsors. I thank all Senators for their \nsupport on final passage. I particularly appreciate the support from \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission. I look forward to passage of this measure by the other \nbody, so this bill can be on the President's desk by Veterans Day.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto speak for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11613-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11613-S11614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PERFORMANCE OF TREASURY IG VALERIE LAU\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues \nabout an instance of failed leadership in protecting the taxpayers' \nmoney, and in executing the law enforcement functions of our \nGovernment. It's a story full of irony, of abuse of power, of a \nbreakdown in the people's trust.\n  Last Friday, and again today, hearings were held by the Governmental \nAffairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The chairman of that \nsubcommittee is Senator Susan Collins of Maine. The subject was the \nperformance and conduct of the Treasury Department's inspector general, \nValerie Lau, and her staff.\n  During Friday's hearing, we learned that Ms. Lau personally let two \nillegal contracts, including one to a long time associate, Mr. Frank \nSato. IG Lau violated procurement laws and regulations in the sole-\nsource procurement of the two consulting contracts. The judgment that \nthese two contracts were illegal was not made by members of the \nsubcommittee. It was made by the independent, nonpartisan General \nAccounting Office.\n  The GAO also found that IG Lau violated the standards of ethical \nconduct. This is because she failed to disclose her personal and \nprofessional relationship with Mr. Sato.\n  Today, at the subcommittee's second hearing, we heard more. We \nlearned that IG Lau and her staff provided false and/or inaccurate \ntestimony to Congress and congressional investigators. We learned of \nthe destruction of a document. The document was destroyed, in my view, \nas part of a cover-up. It was to hide the fact that a potentially \ncriminal investigation had been launched--without merit--of two agents \nof the U.S. Secret Service. It was in retaliation for their testimony \nbefore Congress in the FBI Filegate matter. Again, that is my own \njudgment.\n  The IG and her staff, as well as other Treasury officials, had told \nmy staff as well as officials of the Secret Service that a potentially \ncriminal case had been opened. Then, the IG and her staff denied having \ntold us that, and maintained that such a case was never opened. The \nrecord now shows that those statements were false: There was, in fact, \nsuch an investigation of the two agents.\n  Also today, we learned that the IG presides over an agency that has \nbecome totally demoralized. It's clearly because of failed leadership \nat the top. Wrongful and questionable activity can be assigned to \nvirtually the entire upper level of the IG's office. The troops below \nare suffering from bad morale. The office of the Treasury IG has been \nseverely crippled.\n  The irony in all this is that an inspector general's job is to detect \nthese very violations in others. An IG is not supposed to commit them.\n  One of the illegal contracts that the IG let, grew from $85,000 to \n$345,000. That's called contract nourishment. There's not much to show \nfor it. Except 1,000 rulers, Mr. President. The rulers are 6 inches in \nlength. They're made of flexible plastic. They have the inspector \ngeneral's mission, vision, and values statement printed on them to \nremind employees of who they are and what they do.\n  Mr. President, I take the amount of rulers purchased--1,000--and \ndivide that into the cost of the contract--$345,000--and I come up with \na value per ruler of $345.\n  That's right, Mr. President. The $345 ruler.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time in my experience that the \nGovernment bought ordinary products at extraordinary prices. I recall \ncoming to this floor in 1983. I had with me a small steel washer that \nwas a spare part for an Air Force airplane. The price of that washer \nwas $364. It was worth only about a quarter.\n  The Pentagon, at the time, defended the cost of the washer. First of \nall, it\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\nwasn't just a washer, you see. Why, it was a ``sheer pin spacer.'' And \nthe $364-price tag wasn't really outrageous. After all, it was \nprecision-molded from space-age alloys; extremely light weight, less \nthan half an ounce; no moving parts; easy-to-handle circular shape; \nplus, there was inflation; transportation costs; special packaging; \nobsolescence; breakage; deterioration; pilferage; and so forth. All of \nthese are costly. So, $364 was an absolute bargain, according to the \nPentagon, for a steel washer. Excuse me--a sheer pin spacer.\n  Given my experience with military spare parts, I thought to myself: \nNow, what could possibly be the justification for the Treasury IG \nfirst, buying all these rulers, and second, buying them at $345 per \ncopy?\n  Well, let's look at the first question: Why does the IG need all \nthese rulers? There are only 300 employees in the office. Yet, she \nbought 1,000. That's three rulers for each employee. Perhaps the extra \n700 are spare parts.\n  Also, Congress recently passed the Government Performance and Results \nAct. That act gives Congress the ability to measure the performance of \nGovernment agencies. It does so by requiring agencies to come up with \nperformance goals, and then provide us with data so we can measure \ntheir performance against their goals.\n  The contract in question provided no real benefit to the taxpayers. \nIt was intended to boost morale. But testimony from witnesses at \ntoday's hearing said morale was worse after the study than before it. \nThat means, the only real, tangible benefit to the taxpayers out of \nthis contract were the 1,000 rulers.\n  So I must assume, Mr. President, that the IG needed these rulers to \nhelp measure performance. Is it possible the IG took the measurement \nfunction a little too literally?\n  If so, that gives new meaning to the term ``performance \nmeasurement.''\n  Now that might justify why we purchased the ruler. But it doesn't \njustify the price tag.\n  Perhaps I could take a stab at that. I note that the ruler is \nlightweight--less than half an ounce. It looks like it could be made of \nprecision-molded space-age teflon. No moving parts. Flat, streamlined \nsides for trouble-free underlining. Able to withstand thousands of \nwhacks on the knuckles. Customized to fit in most standard pockets. \nIt's a real triumph of 21st century technological configuration. Then, \nof course, there's the packaging costs, the cost of inspection, \nplanning, transportation, and so forth. Just like the DOD steel washer. \nA real bargain, Mr. President.\n  With that kind of price tag, this IG is perhaps better off working at \nthe Pentagon as a contracting officer, rather than an IG guarding the \npublic's Treasury. At least at the Pentagon, a $345 ruler would not be \nan anomaly.\n  But seriously, Mr. President, clearly the aforementioned is a major \nembarrassment for the inspector general, who needs to always be beyond \nreproach, for the Secretary of the Treasury, and for the President, who \nnominated this IG. And also the Congress, which confirmed the IG.\n  But nothing is more unconscionable than what this IG's office did in \nperpetrating a potentially criminal investigation of two dedicated \nagents of the U.S. Secret Service, in retaliation for their testimony \nbefore two committees of the U.S. Congress. And after opening such a \ncase, it was denied and covered up. As part of the cover-up, an \nofficial document was destroyed.\n  I have seen similar abuses of power in the past, since I arrived in \nCongress. That's not what's new. Bureaucracies do that all the time. \nThat's why we have IG's. IG's are supposed to catch those who abuse \ntheir power.\n  What's new in all this is that the abuse of authority is by someone \nin whom the citizens have vested the powers to combat such actions. I \nhave never seen such an abuse of power by a Federal law enforcement \nofficial.\n  The responsibility of employing such powers is of enormous \nproportions. The full powers of the IG's office were directed against \nthe most precious right that exists in this country--the civil \nliberties of two American citizens. It cost these two agents over \n$26,000 so far. Worse, there has been a cloud over them and their \nfamilies for more than a year.\n  What happens the next time these agents are in a court of law, or \nbeing interviewed for a future job opportunity? Suppose they are asked, \n``Have you ever been the target of a criminal investigation?'' How are \nthey supposed to answer that question? Technically, they were targeted \nimproperly. But if it's a yes-or-no question, they would have to answer \nyes. It's just not fair.\n  The process of correcting the wrong that was done began today. The \nIG, after a year of denials, contradictions, and wordsmithing, finally \napologized at this morning's hearing. It was a year overdue. \nNonetheless, it was the appropriate thing to do.\n  I mentioned earlier that this ruler, purchased as part of one of the \nillegal contracts, displays the IG's value statement. Ironically, the \nactions of upper management in the IG's office systematically violated \nalmost every one of them.\n  The value statement reads as follows:\n\n       The core values which govern all of our employee and \n     organizational actions are trust, mutual respect, integrity \n     and competence. These values are demonstrated through \n     qualities such as fairness, honesty, cooperation, open \n     communication, shared goals, and a commitment to excellence.\n\n  Mr. President, in my view, the taxpayers would have got more value \nout of this contract had the Treasury IG's office practiced the values \nlisted on this ruler. It did not. And that reflects a major leadership \nvoid in that office.\n  I mentioned earlier that the IG engaged in the fine art of \nwordsmithing. Instead of answering questions, she did a soft-shoe \nroutine. For example, when GAO found that she let two illegal \ncontracts, her response was to call them ``technical violations.'' That \nresponse hardly instills confidence that this IG should remain in that \njob. Quite the contrary, it speaks volumes about the need for a new IG.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary of any Department is required, under the \nInspector General Act of 1978, to generally supervise the IG. I hope \nthat Treasury Secretary Rubin makes himself familiar with the facts and \nfindings of the investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. Were he to do that, I am confident that he would reach \nthe same conclusion I have--that the IG's own actions have undermined \nher moral authority to lead that office. Her ability to continue to run \nthat office effectively, and in the taxpayers' interest, has been \ncompromised.\n  I do not come to this judgment frivolously. I have been intimately \ninvolved in the investigation and circumstances of this case for over a \nyear. I worked with Chairwoman Collins for several months, who did an \noutstanding job on this investigation, Mr. President. She and her staff \nare to be greatly commended for digging out all the facts on this case, \nand laying them in front of the American people.\n  So I feel an obligation to call on the Treasury IG to step aside so \nthat a new IG and IG management team can be brought in to reestablish \nthe trust and confidence of the people, and to restore the morale of \nthe many hardworking and dedicated employees of that office. There is a \ntremendous responsibility that comes with being Treasury IG. And we in \nCongress need to make sure every effort is made to maintain the \npublic's confidence in their law enforcement agencies. That's why I \nthink this decision to step aside must be made.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/03/senate-section/article/S11613-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
