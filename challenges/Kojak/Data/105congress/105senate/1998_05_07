Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of the \nThompson-Sessions amendment to H.R. 2676, the IRS reform and \nrestructuring bill. Under the previous order, the time between \napproximately 9:30 and 10 a.m. will be equally divided for debate on \nthe amendment. At the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the \nSenate will proceed to vote on or in relation to the Thompson-Sessions \namendment. I repeat, that will be around 10 o'clock, maybe slightly \nafter. Or, of course, some time could be yielded back.\n  As a reminder, we have reached an agreement limiting amendments to \nthe bill. However, there are almost 50 amendments on the list. I had \nhoped maybe there would be a dozen. I assume, even though some of \nthese, or most of them, would qualify as relevant amendments, Senators \nwill decide that they can offer them on some other legislation or some \nof them, hopefully, will be accepted after working with the managers of \nthe legislation. I hope those who do want to offer amendments will come \nforward and do that this morning.\n  We need to begin to get a lineup of which amendments will be debated \nand voted on and a time that will be used. I see no need to debate \nthese amendments for 2 or 3 hours. Most of them we ought to talk about \n30 or 40 minutes and have a vote, because a lot of work has already \nbeen done on this legislation. We have two or three contentious issues \nwe need to flesh out and have a debate and vote on, but even those \namendments I don't think are going to be critical at this point if \neither side wins. We still can work further on this once we get to \nconference, even though I hope the conference will be short. I think it \nis incumbent upon the Congress to complete this legislation before we \ngo home--I mean in its entirety--for the Memorial Day recess.\n  We need the cooperation of all Senators in order to complete action \non this important bill today, and we all have assumed it will be done \ntoday. It should be done today. We don't need to, and should not, drag \nit over until next week because if it does it will bump everything \nelse. We have high tech, crop insurance, and Department of State \nauthorization, just next week. Higher education is pending out there. \nWe need to act on that.\n  There will be a lot of work during the next 10 days to see if we can \nget an understanding of how to proceed, if we are going to proceed, on \nthe tobacco bill. We need to get this done. For those who think I am \nhuffing and puffing here, we can replicate last Thursday night if the \nMembers want to. We can be sitting right here at 11 o'clock finishing \nup this bill or we can get going. Progress was made yesterday because \nwe got an agreement to limit amendments, but I didn't feel the sense of \nurgency.\n  So I say to the managers of the legislation, let's get going. Let's \nget the amendments racked up and be prepared to tell Senators that if \nthey are not going to come to the floor and offer their amendments they \nwill be shoved off at the end and they will get 5 minutes or 2 minutes \nto describe their amendments.\n  Again, we don't want to stifle the Senate being able to work its \nwill, but I think we have to be reasonable and be prepared to complete \nour work.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4451-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1502\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. shall be equally divided on the Thompson-Sessions amendment No. \n2356.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we brought this amendment up yesterday \nand had a brief discussion. My understanding is we have 30 minutes \nequally divided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes on each side and the time \nis equally divided until 10 a.m.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as you know, part of the IRS reform bill \nhas to do with the creation of an IRS Oversight Board. One of the new \nmembers of the IRS Oversight Board is delineated as a representative of \nan IRS employees union. However, because of the inherent conflict of \ninterest in this new member's position, the union representative was \nexempted from four essential ethics laws in the criminal code. That is \nwhat our amendment addresses, because the ethics experts in the Office \nof Government Ethics say these provisions are unprecedented and \ninadvisable and antithetical to sound Government ethics policy; thus, \nto sound Government.\n  In an era in which we seem to receive an awful lot of very general \nand hazy messages from the bureaucracy, we are getting a quite \ndefinitive, clear-cut opinion out of the Office of Government Ethics \nwith regard to this exemption, and that is that these provisions are \nunprecedented and, therefore, inadvisable.\n  I think it makes common sense. I must say that my primary interest in \nthis as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee has to do with \nthe rules under which our Federal employees operate. We do have an \nOffice of Government Ethics. We do have ethics provisions. They are for \ngood reason. We could talk about these provisions in some detail, but, \ngenerally speaking, one of the main things they try to address is to \nkeep people from being compensated by outside entities and outside \ngroups while they are on the Federal Government's payroll. In other \nwords, if an employee is going to be on the Federal Government payroll, \nthey should not be compensated by some outside group when they come and \nlobby the Federal Government. That is just sound common sense.\n  I understand that an agreement was reached, or at least it was voted \non in the committee, to have this representative on this nine-member \nboard. We could debate back and forth whether or not that is a good \nidea. But this amendment does not say that a person of this kind cannot \nbe on the board. All it says is that this person is going to be treated \nlike every other member of the board, and that is that they will not be \nexempt from the ethics laws. The private members who are on this board \nare certainly going to have to live under the ethics laws.\n  For example, the day after appointment of the board, the private \nboard member could not meet with representatives of the IRS or Treasury \non behalf of a client or the board members' corporate employer with \nrespect to proposed tax regulations. These prohibitions apply across \nthe board to all members. It said that it creates somewhat of a \nhardship on the union representative. Perhaps in all cases there will \nnot be a conflict.\n  As I look at some of the provisions that were discussed in committee \nin terms of the reasons for the creation of the board and the various \nfunctions that the board will have, I see where part of the function is \nto review and approve IRS strategic plans; for example, including the \nestablishment of mission and objectives and long-range plans. I can see \nan argument being made that this union representative would not have a \nconflict of interest regarding that particular function of this board. \nAnother function is to review the operational functions of the IRS. \nAnother is to recommend to the President candidates for the Commission.\n  I can see an argument being made that this would not create a \nconflict of interest. So it is indeed arguable that there will be \ncertain functions in which this board member could participate. It is \nnot our position to sit and factually delineate every possibility that \nmight come up. Quite frankly, it is going to be primarily on the board \nmember to determine that themselves. I see other functions where, to \nme, there is a clear conflict of interest, and that is, to review the \noperation of the IRS to ensure the treatment of taxpayers, to review \nprocedures of IRS relating to financial audits.\n  I can see where someone representing the IRS employees union --a paid \nemployee of the employees union would have a real problem in sitting on \nthis board and trying to determine what the rules ought to be with \nregard to those employees concerning the way they conduct their audits. \nThat is just common sense.\n  Now, there is one thing I think we need to keep in mind. We all know \nthat we have many--certainly the great majority--IRS employees who are \nloyal, dedicated public servants. But let's not forget the reason why \nwe have this IRS reform bill on the floor to start with; and that is, \nwe saw an absolutely appalling, unprecedented array of rogue \nactivities, which you would not see in a lot of good police states, \nconducted by some of these IRS agents out in the field. We saw people \nlike Howard Baker and Former Congressman Quillen, who were actually \ntargeted, and they attempted to set up these individuals. These are the \nkinds of things that are part of the reason that we have the bill and \npart of the reason that we have this oversight board.\n  So in order to say that a union member is going to have some problem \nsome time about sitting on this board as they represent those very \nemployees--the ones that are good, bad and indifferent--is no reason to \ncarve them out and exempt them from these ethics provisions.\n  So I think it is a bad step, Mr. President, if the very first thing \nwe do in starting out and trying to reform IRS is to say that with \nregard to some of these employees we are going to exempt them from the \nethics laws. I might point out also that as I read the bill, it doesn't \nseem to me like it necessarily has to be a paid employee, a paid union \nofficial of the IRS employees union. In other words, I would think that \na member could serve on this board who would simply be a union member \nand could be a representative. If they were not taking payment and \ncompensation from the union, as a professional union representative, \nthen perhaps a lot of these conflicts would be alleviated.\n  So we are trying to work out something reasonable here on the front \nend. But make no mistake about it, it would be a terrible mistake in \nthe face of the clear advice of the Office of Government Ethics to say \nthe first thing we are going to do is exempt these people who are, in \nsome cases the source of their problem, from the ethics laws under \nwhich everybody else is going to have to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nTennessee if he would answer a question. For the purpose of engaging in \nthis debate, does he support having a union rep on the board, an \nemployee rep on the board? That would be an amendment that will come \nup, I believe, later on, trying the individual on the board.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I do not think it is wise to have such a representative \non the board. That is another question. In fact, I think the Office of \nGovernment Ethics has the same opinion. They do not think it is wise to \nhave a union\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nmember on the board. My position is that if there is a union member on \nthe board, they should not be exempt from the ethics laws.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate the Senator's conclusion. However, I have \nreached the opposite conclusion. That really is the question for the \nbody. Do you think an employee representative needs to be on this \nboard?\n  Let me tell you why the Restructuring Commission reached the \nconclusion ``yes,'' and why the Finance Committee reached the \nconclusion ``yes.'' We heard from private sector individuals, as well \nas public sector people, who have gone through the sorts of things IRS \nis likely to go through. Let me be clear what the IRS is going to be \ngoing through. This is not about some cosmetic changes.\n  In this law, we give the Commissioner of the IRS new authorities to \nrestructure the IRS, and we direct the Commissioner to restructure to \neliminate the old three-tier system. I don't know how familiar \neverybody is with the three-tier system. There is a national, regional, \nand a district office. It is a system that was established in 1952. It \nmeans that if taxpayers move or decide they want to move from Salina, \nKS, to Grand Island, NB, which I think would be a sound thing for \nanybody to do--but if they decide they want to go from Kansas to \nNebraska, they are OK. But if they move from, let's say, Chattanooga, \nTN, to Salina or Grand Island, they are going to be under a new \ndistrict and regional office. As a consequence, their taxes are going \nto be handled by entirely different people.\n\n  What the law directs the Commissioner to do and gives him authority \nto do is organize along functional lines. There is going to be \ntraumatic change for employees--traumatic change. We may have few \nnumbers of people. This kind of restructuring is very difficult to get \ndone. From people both in the public and private sector, individuals \nwho have gone through this, we heard strong advice that an employee \nrepresentative should be on the Commission.\n  For members, the board itself sunsets in 10 years. We may decide we \ndon't need a board in 10 years. We might need a different composition \nfor the board. That is the first question. Do you believe that as a \nconsequence of what the Commissioner has been given--the authority to \ndramatically restructure this agency--there ought to be an employee \nrepresentative on the board? The authors of this amendment don't; \nneither does the Office of Government Ethics. They sent a letter \nindicating some problems which they had with having a representative \non. We accommodated those concerns by putting this language in here. \nNow the language is being attacked. But the question really is not do \nyou support the language, but do you want a rep on there? If you do, \nyou have to have that representative able to participate in the \ndecisionmaking.\n  To be clear, they are not given blanket ethics waivers. They are \nstill under all the same ethics requirements of every other member of \nthe board; indeed, somewhat higher. The annual disclosure requirements \nof this individual will be greater than for other members of the board. \nAll board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. If for some reason a member of this Chamber thinks that person \nshould not be confirmed, they can put a hold on it and likely make it \nimpossible for that person to be confirmed. And if the President \nbelieves, for any reason at all, this individual is not doing a good \njob, he or she can be removed by the President.\n  So there are lots of checks against problems this individual might \nhave for any reason, including some ethical problems, as I said. All \nother ethics statutes still fall against this individual. Indeed, we \nare requiring this individual to disclose more. We have all kinds of \nsituations. We asked the Office of Government Ethics about acceptance \nand they have made over 600 of them, including the Commissioner of the \nIRS. The Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, has private sector holdings, \nprivate sector business experience, and does business with the IRS. So \nthe question for us is, oh, my gosh, is he excluded or precluded from \nserving? The answer is no. We reached a conclusion that we have an \noverriding interest to have him serve as Commissioner. And so we draft \nvery carefully an agreement that has him doing a certain number of \nthings in order to be able to comply with our ethics laws.\n  So I urge colleagues, as they examine this amendment, to understand \nthat no blanket exemption is being granted.\n  The authors of the amendment do not want a Treasury employee \nrepresentative on the board. If you want a Treasury employee \nrepresentative on the board, you have to have language in there that \nsatisfies the ethical concerns about what will happen when an issue \ncomes up that has an impact upon the people he represents.\n  Mr. President, we are granting the Commissioner the authority to \nreorganize and restructure and get the IRS to operate in a much more \nefficient fashion, and that will cause traumatic changes inside of the \nranks of the IRS. For those who wonder whether or not an employee rep \nought to be on there, imagine if we had an oversight board that was \ngoing to be making a decision to restructure the Senate and one of the \npossibilities was, instead of having 100 Members, we have 80. Would we \nask to have Members on the board? Obviously, we would. And it would be \nright to do, and we would have to draft some sort of language to make \ncertain that we wouldn't violate ethics laws as well.\n  I hope the Members will reject this amendment.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Michigan is on the floor. I am \npleased to yield 2 minutes for him to speak against this amendment as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I think the effect \nof this amendment will be to make it impossible for an employee \nrepresentative to sit on the board. The Commission should have that \nrepresentation, according to the recommendation of the Commission that \nis recommending this Commission. If we want an employee representative \nto sit on this board, as a practical matter there is no way to do it \nwithout exempting that person from these laws. There is an inherent \nconflict which that person will have. And we might as well be very open \nabout it, and face it, and say, ``Yes, providing it is disclosed.'' And \nit is known that the benefits of having that perspective on the board \noutweighs any precedent that would be set by this kind of a waiver.\n  The IRS Oversight Board itself is unprecedented. I don't know of a \nboard quite like this that we have in the Government.\n  So to suggest that as we are creating a new board like this that we \ncannot, with our eyes open, make an exemption from our conflict of \ninterest laws in order to permit a very critical person to serve on the \nboard it seems to me is unduly restricting our options and, more \nimportantly, is making this board less useful. This oversight board \nwill be more useful with an employee representative on it. There is a \ncertain perspective, an important experience, which that person can \nbring to this board.\n  So we have to weigh the value, the benefit, of that against the \nprecedent we would be setting. It is like a cost-benefit analysis which \nwe recommend that others do. We have to look at the precedent and the \nvalue, and we are the policymakers.\n  I have great respect for the Office of Government Ethics. They \nenforce and implement the law. But we make policy. When we decide, with \nan unprecedented new board, that we will permit a representative of the \nemployees to sit there because we want that experience, we want that \nperspective, we then are making a policy judgment that we want an \neffective IRS oversight board and that the effectiveness of that board \nis to rein in the IRS to overcome the abuses which have disgusted us \nwhich we have all heard about for so many years which outweighs any \nprecedent we might be setting.\n  I oppose the amendment and hope we will defeat it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Roth, and others for introducing an outstanding bill. \nI know they have worked hard and dealt with a number of difficult \nissues. This is, I am sure, a good-faith effort to involve the union in \nthe process. But the truth is, as we have had a chance to look at\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nthe law, it just won't work. Senator Fred Thompson has made the point \neloquently and clearly. His amendment is the only way we can handle \nthis circumstance. We should not, and must not, agree to allow a clear \nconflict of interest to be waived, according to the Office of \nGovernment Ethics. If the Office of Government Ethics were to decide \nthis issue, a waiver would not be granted. It is because such a \nfundamental conflict exists that we should not expect it to.\n  The truth of the matter is that if you sit on the Government \nOversight Board and are also a paid union representative, you are being \npaid by two masters. You can't serve two masters. That is a paid \nposition. It is not a union member serving on the board but a person \nwhose salary is paid by an outside group who is not part of the \nprocess.\n  I know many people would like to involve an employees union \nrepresentative in the IRS restructuring effort. I support this idea. \nThere are many ways a union representative could be involved in the \nprocess. I have had many friends over the years who have been members \nof the Treasury Union. I think they do a good job and help to \ncontribute positively to our Nation's Government. But this is a \npowerful board that sets administrative rules and principles throughout \nthe agency.\n  I would suggest that the waiver is not of some ethics rule, it is a \nwaiver of the Criminal Code of the United States of America. At least \nfour sections are implicated. It is quite possible that if this union \nmember were to participate as a board member, he would be in violation \nof perhaps four different criminal codes--statutes. To ask us in this \nlegislation to just blithely waive these statutes, would be a mistake \nand unwise and would undermine the Office of Government Ethics ability \nto effectively manage and uphold ethics in government.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. I serve on the Senate \nEthics Committee. I understand what my colleagues are trying to \naccomplish. But this waiver is unprecedented, according to the Office \nof Government Ethics. That means that this has never been done before--\nthat the U.S. Senate, in a legislative act, has never granted exemption \nto one person from the Criminal Code of the United States. It is \nsomething we ought not to do.\n  I urge my colleagues in this body to vote yes on this amendment.\n  I yield what time is remaining.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 40 \nseconds, and the Senator from Nebraska controls 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, very briefly, it is not unusual to have \nan oversight board or an agency or a panel that does not have on it the \nsubjects of that panel's inquiry; in other words, the comparable \nsituation with regard to this oversight board would be U.S. taxpayers. \nThat is whose lives we are really affecting. We don't have any taxpayer \nmembers on this particular board.\n  I would also point out, as the Senator from Alabama did, that these \nare criminal laws. We are waiving four primary criminal laws of title \n18 of the United States Code with regard to one individual who \nrepresents some of those who have caused the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, briefly, we are doing something that is \nunprecedented. The distinguished Senator from Alabama says that the \nOffice of Government Ethics is unprecedented. It is the only venture \nthat is unprecedented; never in the history of Government have we \ncreated an oversight board with these kinds of powers. And we are doing \nit in order to be able to restructure the IRS in a relatively short \nperiod of time. The implications would be rather traumatic for the \nemployees of the IRS. Every private sector person whom we asked the \nquestion of--when you go through restructuring--and every public person \nwe asked the advice of said put the rep on the board.\n  This board sunsets in 10 years. We may decide we don't want the board \nand have another composition. We can revisit it, if you don't want a \nTreasury employee rep on the board. The Office of Ethics said there are \nproblems here. We have corrected those problems, but they don't want a \nrep on the board under any circumstances. If you want a rep on the \nboard, you have to vote no on this amendment. Otherwise, this \nindividual is not going to be able to do the job. If you don't have the \nrep on the board, I think this venture is likely to run aground and not \nbe as successful as all of us want it to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I urge the defeat of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, these are two amendments on which I worked \nvery closely with the chairman. They deal with two problems, one of \nwhich is a longstanding problem that we have had with the Internal \nRevenue Service, and that is how to deal with taxpayers who are \nwillfully noncompliant. This requires the Commissioner to do a study of \nthis issue and report back to the Finance Committee. Members need to \nunderstand, approximately the average for all taxpayers is nearly \n$1,600 per taxpayer for noncompliance, with penalty for willful \nnoncompliance.\n\n  The second amendment came as a consequence of a witness that we had \nin the hearings that the chairman held, Mr. Earl Epstein of \nPhiladelphia. He was talking about putting teeth in the provision \ndealing with violations of fair debt collection practices. And at the \nchairman's suggestion, what we have asked for in this study is that the \nnew Treasury inspector general for tax administration also look at this \nand provide Congress with a report, an annual report outlining any \nviolations of the fair debt collection practices that we have included \nin this bill.\n  Mr. Epstein notes, this is likely to result in better attention being \npaid to collection abuses as ``no Commissioner would be happy to report \nsignificant abuses, to say nothing of awards for damages [or] for \nfailures to enforce proper authority over collection agents.'' It is an \nimportant amendment. I appreciate the source of it was the chairman's \nhearings, and I appreciate a chance to work with the chairman to get \nthis worked out.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say that both of these amendments are \nacceptable to the majority side. We have worked with Senator Kerrey on \nthem and we think they are acceptable.\n  So I urge that they be accepted by voice vote.\n  Mr. FORD. En bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So it is \ncritically important that those who have amendments, if they want to \nhave them offered, that they do so promptly because time is slipping \nby. We will stay here until we complete the legislation.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Faircloth wants to go next. We \nwould like to get a time agreement.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two \nletters from the Office of Government Ethics, dated March 27 and May 1, \n1998, and one letter from the Senior Executives Association, dated \nApril 17, 1998, be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today \ncorrects a flaw in an otherwise fine bill that was offered by Senator \nRoth, and that is to reform the Internal Revenue Service. And no \norganization ever needed reforming more.\n  My amendment, which is supported by Chairman Roth, would remove the \nunion representative for the IRS employees from the oversight board \nestablished by this reform bill.\n  The reason for establishing the oversight board was that the union \nwas out of control. That is very simply the reason we did not put it up \nthere, that it is composed of private citizens--the oversight board--\nand not to be run by the union and the IRS bureaucracy. That is the \nproblem we have been facing.\n  If ever there was a case of hiring Willie Sutton to guard the bank, \nwhen we put a union representative on the board that is exactly what we \nhave done.\n  I just want to take a minute--and I will do it quickly--to explain \nwhy it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the IRS Oversight \nBoard to accomplish its intended task of reforming the IRS as long as \nyou have a union representative on the board.\n  Mr. President, it was said in hearings last fall again and again, and \nlast week, where we heard shocking and terrible testimony about abuses \nof taxpayers at the hands of IRS employees. These have been well \ndocumented, and the American people are outraged at what they have \nseen. I hear it on a daily basis.\n  The American people are calling and telling the Congress that the IRS \nis an agency out of control and it must be reined in. Control must be \nestablished. And several of my colleagues, I have heard, have come up \nwith the same thing.\n  An oversight board, if it is truly a private citizen oversight board, \ncould go a long way to rooting out the problems that are plaguing the \nIRS and will ultimately destroy it if they are not corrected.\n  But the same employees who have been abusing taxpayers are certainly \nnot going to like changes proposed by the oversight board, because it \nis going to change the way they have been doing business, and they do \nnot want to change the way they have been doing business. That is the \nreason we are creating the oversight board, to change the way that the \nIRS union has been operating.\n  Can you imagine what would happen if any decision which was opposed \nby the union IRS employees could be vetoed by the representative of the \nunion? In effect, that is what we will have if a union representative \nis appointed a member of the board. You are going to negate the effects \nof the board.\n  Some have suggested that unless a union representative is a member of \nthe board, there will be no one to persuade the employees to go along \nwith the reforms. All I can say is that anybody who says that has never \nrun a business. I think that is the most foolish argument I have ever \nheard. I do not think IRS reform should be held hostage to what the \nunion members like.\n\n  If employees resist reform, and we have heard time after time in \nhearings about the abuses of these employees, then those employees \nshould be removed from the IRS. We should not put the new oversight \nboard in the position of begging the IRS employees, through their \nunion, to agree to a change. If that is the way we are going to do it, \nthere will be no change. It will be business as usual.\n  Furthermore, it is common sense that the union representative should \nnot be in a position to argue the case of the employees who pay his \nsalary. I cannot think of anything more ludicrous than putting in an \noversight board and then putting on it the man who works for the people \nwho have created the abuses that the oversight board is intended to \ncorrect. It goes round and round. The union representative would be \nvoting on issues which affect his own pocketbook--a clear conflict of \ninterest.\n  As Senator Sessions and Senator Thompson have already pointed out, \nputting the union representative on the oversight board does not just \nviolate common sense, it violates Federal criminal law. Whether those \nlaws are waived or not, we should not go down the road of disregarding \ncriminal laws that are inconvenient for one person. We are waiving \ncriminal laws because one person, a union representative, wants them \nwaived.\n  Let me share with my colleagues what the Office of Government Ethics \nhad to say on the matter of including the IRS employee union \nrepresentative on the oversight board. In a letter to the Senate \nFinance Committee, Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan, dated March 27, the Office of Government Ethics said the \nfollowing: ``We recommended that the IRS reform bill not include an \nindividual who is a representative of an organization,'' which \nrepresents a substantial number of the IRS employees.\n  Now, that is a nice way of saying don't put the union boss on the \nboard. If you do, you might as well not create the board.\n  The Office of Government Ethics, in another letter to the majority \nleader, dated May 1, 1998, said that putting the union representative \non the oversight board is, ``Fundamentally at odds with the concept \nthat government decisions should be made by those who are acting for \nthe public interest and not those acting for a private interest.'' The \nprivate interest being referred to is the IRS employees union. So it is \nclear that the union representative will be in a position of violating \ncriminal laws concerning conflict of interest if he or she serves on \nthe oversight board, unless those criminal statutes are waived, and \nthat is what we just did.\n  Some of my colleagues who support including the IRS employee union \nrepresentative on the board have tried to fix it by waiving the \ncriminal laws, but we should not have waived a criminal law for one \nunion representative. Both the Senior Executives Association and the \nOffice of Government Ethics recommended removing the union boss rather \nthan removing the waiver. I agree.\n  On April 9, 1998, the Senior Executives Association, a nonpartisan, \nnonprofit organization which represents career executives throughout \nthe Federal Government, wrote to me to express their serious concerns \nabout including an IRS employee union representative on the oversight \nboard. The Senior Executives believe as long as the union \nrepresentative is on the board, it will be impossible for IRS managers, \nthe Commissioners, and the oversight board, and even the President, to \nimplement the personnel reforms affecting IRS employees. In other \nwords, as long as their ``boss man'' is sitting on the board, he isn't \ngoing to do anything to allow any reform. He will, in effect, veto the \nactions of the board.\n  To quote the Senior Executives Association: ``The inclusion of the \nunion representative on the IRS Oversight Board threatens the ability \nof IRS management to manage and control the IRS workforce.''\n  It would seem to me the last thing that Congress should do is make \nIRS employees even less accountable for their actions than they \ncurrently are. That would be hard to do.\n  In summary of my amendment, take some good advice of the Office of \nGovernment Ethics and the Senior Executives Association and remove the \nunion representative from the oversight board. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                             U.S. Office of Government Ethics,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1998.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan: We understand that \n     your Committee is reviewing the provisions of H.R. 2676 in \n     anticipation of developing a Senate bill, regarding the \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As Commissioner Rossotti \n     indicated in his testimony before your Committee earlier this \n     year, the Administration believes that the conflict of \n     interest and financial disclosure provisions that section 101 \n     of that bill would make applicable to the Members of the \n     newly created IRS Oversight Board are in need of technical \n     revision and, we believe, should be made more consistent with \n     the standard ethics systems applicable within the executive \n     branch. We recognize that this part-time Board is being given \n     far more than advisory duties, and we believe that conduct \n     and compensation restrictions and financial disclosure \n     requirements should be commensurate with those additional \n     duties. Because time is of concern, we have chosen to set \n     forth the type of requirements we believe would be most \n     appropriate and consistent with sound ethics policies. We \n     would be happy to work with your staff and the legislative \n     counsel in developing the exact legislative language.\n       1. Status of the private sector members. The House bill \n     specifies that the private sector members, other than the \n     individual representing the union, are to be special \n     Government employees ``during the entire period'' each \n     individual holds appointment. We believe this language will \n     cause unnecessary hardships on the Members of the Board and \n     will substantially inhibit the Government in attracting the \n     types of individuals you might wish to serve on the Board. \n     Briefly, this will occur because more onerous criminal \n     conflict of interest restrictions (particularly those \n     applying to private compensation arrangements and matters \n     unrelated to tax or IRS issues or policies) will apply to \n     Members after 60 days of service. Under the House language, \n     those restrictions will apply 60 calendar days after \n     appointment, not after 60 days of actual service as is \n     ordinarily the case for special Government employees.\n       We recommend that the bill be silent as to the status of \n     the Members as special Government employees. We understand \n     that it is not expected that these individuals will actually \n     serve more than 60 days in a 365-day period, so that the \n     regime for less than 60 days of service would apply. Then the \n     bill can include additional restrictions and requirements \n     that are tailored specifically to service on this Board \n     rather than simply service anywhere in the executive branch \n     as a special Government employee. Recommendations for those \n     restrictions and requirements are in points 2 and 3.\n       2. Additional conflict restrictions. Given the duties of \n     the Board anticipated by the House bill, we would recommend \n     that Board Members be subject to the following restrictions \n     in addition to the standard criminal conflict of interest \n     provisions applicable to special Government employees.\n       In addition to the restrictions in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 203 \n     and 205, members of the Board should be prohibited from \n     representing anyone before the IRS or the Department of the \n     Treasury on any matter involving the management or operations \n     of the Internal Revenue Service or the internal revenue laws \n     (or more narrowly, tax matters) or before the Board or the \n     IRS on any particular matter.\n       In addition to the restrictions in 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(1) and \n     (2), members of the Board should be prohibited from \n     representing anyone before the IRS (or possibly the entire \n     Department of the Treasury as are former IRS Commissioners) \n     for one year following termination of Board service. We would \n     not suggest that there is any need to apply the restrictions \n     of section 207(f) to the members of the Board who do not \n     serve more than 60 days.\n       In drafting these additional restrictions, we recommend \n     that all of the exemptions and procedural mechanisms \n     presently in sections 203, 205 and 207 apply to these \n     additional restrictions.\n       3. Financial disclosure requirements. Given the substantial \n     authorities of the board as set forth in the House bill, we \n     recommend that the statute be drafted clearly to reflect that \n     the Members of the Board are required to file new entrant, \n     annual and termination public financial disclosure statements \n     regardless of the number of days in a calendar year that the \n     individual actually serves. If the Senate determines that the \n     Board should be purely advisory, we recommend that the \n     bill be silent so that the standard nomination form which \n     can be made public by the confirming committee and the \n     annual non-public financial disclosure forms will be \n     required.\n       4. Union member. We recommend that the bill not include an \n     individual who is a representative of an organization which \n     represents a substantial number of IRS employees. Given the \n     duties of the Board, this individual cannot serve as a \n     ``representative''--a status recognized in applying conflicts \n     laws to certain individuals carrying out purely advisory \n     duties. We believe that the basic criminal financial conflict \n     of interest statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208, will be applicable \n     to this individual and will substantially limit that \n     individual's ability to carry out any meaningful service on \n     the Board. More importantly to the individual, such service \n     will expose him or her to constant scrutiny for even the \n     smallest official acts. While section 208 does contain a \n     waiver provision, it applies only where the financial \n     interest involved is ``not so substantial'' as to be deemed \n     likely to affect an employee's service. We believe that it \n     would be almost impossible for an officer of a union to \n     legitimately meet the test set forth in the statute because \n     of his own and the union's financial interests that would be \n     affected by the matters before the Board. In addition, we \n     believe that such a member will also be substantially \n     inhibited from carrying out his or her duties on behalf of \n     the union by the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 203. There \n     are no applicable waivers for these restrictions.\n       As an alternative, we suggest that the Board be directed by \n     statute to consult with, but not seek the approval of, \n     representatives of organizations which represent substantial \n     numbers of IRS employees when the matters before the Board \n     would have a substantial effect upon IRS employees. It is \n     crucial to sound government ethics policy that those who have \n     approval authority be accountable to the public for their \n     actions. Those who only provide the views of interested \n     parties for the decision makers' consideration need not be \n     subject to an array of ethics restrictions.\n       5. Pay. We recommend that the pay for the members of the \n     Board be rewritten so that it references some standard \n     Government pay schedule. Since many ethics statutes make \n     reference to those schedules for purposes of applying \n     provisions, this would be much simpler under the present \n     system and most probably for any future restrictions or \n     regulations that might be enacted or promulgated. We suggest \n     that the reference be made to the Executive Level Schedule, \n     which is typical for advise and consent appointees. However, \n     we would not recommend a reference to Level I of that \n     Schedule because positions listed at that Level (Cabinet-\n     level positions) have unique post-employment restrictions \n     that would not be appropriate for these members.\n       We believe that this Board is a very important Government \n     body and that the ethics and conflicts of interest \n     restrictions applicable to the Board should be clear, correct \n     and appropriate. We look forward to working with your staff \n     to address the changes to the language of the House bill that \n     we believe are necessary to clearly meet the obvious intent \n     of the House as well as our recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen D. Potts,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             U.S. Office of Government Ethics,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This Office has reviewed H.R. 2676, the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998, as it has been reported by the Finance Committee and, \n     we understand, is soon to be taken up by the Senate. At the \n     request of both the majority and minority, we provided \n     technical assistance to the Finance Committee staff with \n     regard to drafting the language of provisions setting forth \n     the ethical considerations for the Members of the Internal \n     Revenue Service Oversight Board. We believe those provisions \n     are written in a clear and technically correct manner.\n       However, one provision of the bill, the proposed 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7802(b)(3)(D), provides for waivers of applicable \n     conflict of interest laws for one Member of that Board. We \n     believe that this provision is antithetical to sound \n     Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such \n     across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a \n     mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.\n       We understand and agree that the employees of the Internal \n     Revenue Service should have an opportunity to be heard in any \n     decisions that may affect them. As we stated in a letter to \n     the Finance Committee, there are standard ways of allowing \n     input from interested parties without allowing the interested \n     party to be the actual decision-maker in a Governmental \n     matter. It is the latter role that is fundamentally at odds \n     with the concept that Government decisions should be made by \n     those who are acting for the public interest and not those \n     acting for a private interest. The one private interest that \n     is being waived in each case for this Board Member is the one \n     most fundamentally in conflict with his or her duties to the \n     public.\n       On the other hand, we cannot recommend that the waivers be \n     eliminated for the individual appointed to such a position. \n     That elimination would leave this individual extremely \n     vulnerable to charges of criminal conduct for carrying out \n     many Oversight Board actions or for carrying out his or her \n     private duties for the employee organization. The fact this \n     vulnerability exists exposes the pervasiveness of the \n     conflicts for an officer or employee of an employee \n     organization to serve on the Oversight Board.\n       Rather, we recommend the elimination of the position on the \n     Board that creates such inherent conflicts. The elimination \n     of the position could be coupled with a requirement that the \n     Board consult with employee organizations. While we think a \n     reasonable Board would consult without that requirement, \n     requiring consultation might provide some assurance to the \n     various employee organizations that they will be heard.\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\n       The criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed \n     as impediments to good Government. They are there for a \n     purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience. Some \n     may point out that certain provisions of these laws are \n     waived by agencies quite frequently. That is true. Some of \n     the laws anticipate circumstances where a restriction could \n     be waived and set forth the standards that must be met to \n     issue waivers. Agencies can and do issue such waivers, but \n     the waivers must meet the tests set forth in the statutes. \n     For those conflicts laws that do provide for waivers (not all \n     do), we believe that it would be extremely difficult for a \n     reasonable person to determine that the interests this \n     individual Board Member will undoubtedly have through his or \n     her affiliation with the organization could meet those waiver \n     tests.\n       In order to meet our recommendation, we believe the \n     provisions of Subtitle B, sec. 1101(a) should be amended to \n     eliminate proposed sections 7802(b)(1)(D), (b)(3)(A)(ii) and \n     (b)(3)(D). All other references to an individual appointed \n     under section 7802(b)(1)(D) should be removed and wherever a \n     number of members of the Board is indicated (such as a Board \n     composed of nine members or five members for a quorum) that \n     number should be altered to reflect the elimination of this \n     position.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to express our concerns and \n     our recommendations. These are the views of the Office of \n     Government Ethics and not necessarily those of the \n     Administration. We are available to answer any questions you \n     or any other Member of the Senate may have with regard to \n     this letter or the conflict of interest laws. We are sending \n     identical letters to Senators Daschle, Roth and Moynihan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen D. Potts,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Senior Executives Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 1998.\n     In re: S. 1096, the IRS restructuring and reform bill.\n\n     Hon. Lauch Faircloth,\n     U.S. Senate, Attn: David Landers, Legislative Counsel, Hart \n         Senate Office Bldg, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Faircloth: The Senior Executives Association \n     (SEA) is a non-partisan, non-profit, professional association \n     representing the interests of career members of the Senior \n     Executive Service and other career executives in equivalent \n     positions in the federal government.\n       As you know, the Senate Finance Committee reported out S. \n     1096, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Bill. In the \n     Chairman's mark that was considered by the committee, \n     Chairman Roth had excluded from membership on the IRS \n     Oversight Board both the Secretary of Treasury and the \n     representative of the National Treasury Employees Union, the \n     union that represents many IRS employees.\n       In response, Senator Robert Kerry (D-Neb) sponsored an \n     amendment to put the union representative and the Secretary \n     of Treasury back on the Oversight Board, and that amendment \n     passed the Committee. Senator Kerry's amendment was proposed \n     in the face of an opinion from the U.S. Office of Government \n     Ethics (copy attached) that having the union representative \n     occupy a position on the IRS Oversight Board would place that \n     individual in a position of potentially violating two \n     criminal statutes which apply to all persons occupying \n     similar positions in the federal government. Senator Kerry \n     dismissed this opinion, stating that the union representative \n     could simply be exempted from coverage of these two criminal \n     provisions in S. 1096. Senator Kerry's amendment was passed \n     by the full committee.\n       The Senior Executives Association strongly opposes \n     inclusion of both the union representative and the Secretary \n     of Treasury on an IRS Oversight Board for the reasons stated \n     below.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Internal Revenue Service plays a unique and important \n     role in the federal government. It is one of the few federal \n     agencies whose employees interact on a daily basis with tens \n     of thousands of U.S. citizens. It is the law enforcement \n     agency which, in contrast to other law enforcement agencies, \n     must often deal with citizens who are neither criminals nor \n     accused of crimes. However, it is a law enforcement agency \n     forced to deal with negligent or willful refusal by 15%-20% \n     of citizens to comply with Internal Revenue laws. The \n     complaints of some taxpayers, and the alleged actions of some \n     IRS employees, must be viewed against the background of the \n     frustration of dealing, for example, with wrongdoers who have \n     spent the withholding dollars belonging to their employees \n     for their own purposes, rather than paying them into the \n     Social Security Trust Fund or the Treasury Department for \n     their employees' portion of payroll withholding taxes.\n       This is not to say that there are no examples of abuse by \n     individual IRS employees. In an agency of over 100,000 \n     employees who deal with tens of thousands of citizens on a \n     daily basis, even when they are correct 99.9% of the time, \n     the 1/10th of 1% of mistakes or abuses of authority are \n     enough to ensure headlines. We agree that perpetrators of the \n     small numbers of abuses of authority and power by IRS \n     employees should be seriously dealt with, and the guilty \n     employees disciplined or discharged.\n       IRS employees are deeply imbued with a few principles from \n     the time they are first hired, during their training, and \n     continuing throughout their employment. These principles \n     include (1) the absolute integrity required of all IRS \n     employees; (2) the fair, non-political, and non-partisan \n     enforcement of the tax laws; (3) the fair treatment of all \n     taxpayers; and (4) the equality of treatment of all similarly \n     situated taxpayers.\n       In the 1950's, major reorganizations took place within the \n     Internal Revenue Service because the principles stated above \n     were violated. At that time, political appointees were \n     appointed by each Administration as chief collectors in each \n     state. These political appointees, it was found, were \n     sometimes involved in partisan political enforcement of the \n     tax laws and, as a result, corruption of the tax system, as \n     well as personal corruption of some IRS employees, was found \n     to be a major problem throughout the Internal Revenue \n     Service. Hearings were held in Congress, and legislation was \n     enacted reforming the IRS, establishing only two political \n     appointees to provide leadership of the IRS (the IRS \n     Commissioner and the IRS Chief Counsel) and creating of the \n     ``Inspection Service'' within the agency, which performed \n     both internal audit and internal security functions in the \n     agency to ensure the integrity of IRS operations and its \n     employees.\n       The IRS was also separated in large part from the control \n     of the Department of the Treasury, under the theory that the \n     Department, with its numerous politically appointed \n     officials, should not be involved in the day-to-day \n     administration and enforcement of the tax laws. Of course, \n     Treasury continued as a major player in the establishment of \n     federal tax policy, as well as other areas. But Congress \n     intentionally divorced the Department of the Treasury from \n     interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of the \n     Internal Revenue laws enacted by Congress.\n\n\n        the secretary of the treasury on the irs oversight board\n\n       Against this background and the principles first enumerated \n     (of ensuring the non-partisan administration of the tax laws) \n     must be weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the \n     Secretary of the Treasury being on the IRS Oversight Board. \n     The citizens of this nation must believe that the tax laws \n     are being fairly enforced for everyone, and that similarly \n     situated taxpayers are being treated equally. In large part, \n     our government depends on the voluntary compliance by \n     citizens with the tax laws. If the appearance or the reality \n     of partisan politics ever crept, once again, into the \n     nation's perception of the enforcement of tax laws, it could \n     destroy belief in the integrity and fairness of the tax \n     system that has been developed in the IRS by its largely \n     career workforce over the last forty years. Our concern is \n     that placing the Secretary of the Treasury on the IRS \n     Oversight Board could once again breach the appearance and \n     the reality of the wall of impartiality that has been so \n     carefully constructed.\n       We recognize that Secretary of the Treasury Rubin (and this \n     Administration) would take great pains to ensure that the \n     perception or reality of political interference in the \n     enforcement of tax laws would not occur. However, federal \n     government policies should not depend on individuals who \n     serve in particular positions, but on the laws enacted by \n     Congress. This is, after all, a nation of laws, not of men.\n       While Secretary Rubin and even his immediate successors \n     might never abuse their power or authority, it is not to say \n     that some such abuse might not occur in the future. In recent \n     history, the Nixon Administration, in the 1970's, established \n     an enemies list and sought to have the IRS audit particular \n     individuals and organizations for political purposes. The \n     nation became outraged by these allegations, and it was one \n     of the reasons that President Nixon ultimately resigned from \n     office. In the current Administration, the allegation that a \n     number of FBI files on previous Republican appointees were \n     being retained in the White House became an issue of extreme \n     concern. Again, even if this was, indeed, an innocent \n     mistake, the perception created in the public's mind becomes \n     the reality of the public's attitude.\n       For the above reasons, we believe that it is imperative \n     that the Treasury Department continue its arms-length \n     dealings with the Internal Revenue Service, and that the \n     Secretary not be provided a seat on the IRS Oversight Board. \n     Obviously, the Secretary of the Treasury has line authority \n     over the Commissioner and Chief Counsel of the Internal \n     Revenue Service, who are appointed by the President and the \n     Secretary. If the Secretary believes that these officials are \n     not properly performing their jobs or that improper policy \n     decisions are being made, the Secretary can seek removal of \n     these officials by the President. This kind of Power gives \n     the Secretary of the Treasury sufficient authority to ensure \n     that his opinions or policy positions are seriously \n     considered and, in most cases, followed. The Secretary does \n     not need to be on the IRS Oversight Board to have appropriate \n     influence on the agency. We believe that the possibility of \n     an appearance of partisan political influence that could be \n     engendered by the Treasury Department's deeper penetration \n     into the operations of the IRS clearly outweighs the benefits \n     of having the Secretary of the Treasury on the IRS Oversight \n     Board. Our conversations with, and surveys of, IRS employees \n     reinforce this belief. The consensus\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\n     of career officials is that they would much rather have the \n     intrusion of an independent IRS Oversight Board into their \n     management decision making processes than they would have the \n     additional intrusion of the Treasury Department.\n\n\n    inclusion of the nteu representative on the irs oversight board\n\n       From the outset of the proposal by the Kerry-Portman \n     Commission (which studied the IRS) to include the IRS union \n     president on the IRS Oversight Board, we have been inundated \n     with objections from managers of the Internal Revenue Service \n     and throughout the federal community.\n       IRS supervisors, managers and executives must deal with \n     union stewards and unionized employees at the IRS in \n     thousands of different situations each work day. In many \n     instances, these dealings are extremely cooperative. In \n     others, they are not. The labor management provisions of law \n     that were enacted by Congress in 1978 for the federal \n     government struck a careful balance between the union's \n     rights and management responsibilities in the labor-\n     management context (see Chapter 71, Title 5, U.S. Code). The \n     law sets forth the rights of employees to union \n     representation, the subjects of bargaining, and establishes \n     the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Impasses Panel \n     to decide various disputes between the labor and management \n     positions when negotiations cannot solve the issues. It is a \n     carefully constructed process which has served the federal \n     community well for over 20 years.\n       However, the placement of the IRS employee union president \n     on the Oversight Board, and the provision in the House and \n     Senate bills which gives the union absolute veto power over \n     any attempt by the Oversight Board, the Commissioner, IRS \n     manager, or even the President, to implement personnel \n     reforms which would affect bargaining unit employees \n     represented by the union stands this law on its head.\n       First, the placement of the union president on the \n     Oversight Board would alter the balance of power between \n     labor and management. A supervisor or a district director at \n     an IRS district office trying to negotiate with the local \n     union could be totally bypassed, and the union's position \n     conveyed to the IRS Oversight Board by the union president in \n     such a way that distorted the merits of management's position \n     at the district office. This would prevent the entire IRS \n     management structure from being able to negotiate on an equal \n     basis with the union. The House and Senate bills give the \n     Oversight Board the authority to oversee the selection, \n     evaluation, and compensation of IRS career executives. The \n     union's presence on this Board, and its resultant ability to \n     influence the selection, evaluation, and compensation of IRS \n     managers is a direct conflict of interest, one which would \n     eviscerate the IRS executive's ability to deal with the union \n     on any but a subservient basis.\n       In addition, the union's participation on the Board, which \n     will prepare and present a recommended budget for IRS to \n     Congress puts the union in a position to be able to benefit \n     itself as an organization, as well as the IRS employees which \n     it represents, in violation of current criminal law. As the \n     attached opinion from the Office of Government Ethics \n     explains:\n       ``Given the duties of the Board, this individual [union \n     representative] cannot serve as a `representative'--a status \n     recognized in applying conflicts laws to certain individuals \n     carrying out purely advisory duties. We believe that the \n     basic criminal financial conflict of interest statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 208, will be applicable to this individual and \n     will substantially limit that individual's ability to carry \n     out any meaningful service on the Board. . . . In addition, \n     we believe that such a member will also be substantially \n     inhibited from carrying out his or her duties on behalf of \n     the union by the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 203. There \n     are no applicable waivers for these [two] restrictions.''\n       Even in the face of the opinion of the Office of Government \n     Ethics (the interpreter of the application and enforcement of \n     ethics laws in the Executive Branch), the Administration and \n     Senator Bob Kerry continued to insist that the IRS union \n     representative be placed on the Oversight Board. Senator \n     Kerry directed the Committee staff (at the time he sponsored \n     his amendment before the Senate Finance Committee) to work \n     with the Office of Government Ethics to provide in S. 1096 \n     for waivers of these two criminal statutes as applied to the \n     union representative on the IRS Oversight Board.\n       In our view, this would be an outrageous action by the \n     Congress. To exempt a specific individual who is serving as a \n     union representative from the application of two criminal \n     laws for which there are no waivers available in law, is \n     unprecedented, so far as we can determine. At the very least, \n     the waiver of the application of criminal laws should at \n     least have full consideration by the United States Senate, \n     and, we believe, should require hearings by the Senate and \n     House Judiciary Committees before being enacted. We cannot \n     believe that the American people would be willing for \n     Congress to selectively exempt a union representative from \n     the application of criminal laws which apply to other \n     citizens. If anything, these two criminal statutes should be \n     repealed for all, rather than providing immunity from \n     prosecution for one individual.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we strongly urge that you \n     sponsor an amendment in the Senate to strike the provision \n     from S. 1096 authorizing and/or requiring that the \n     representative of the IRS employees union and the Secretary \n     of the Treasury be placed on the IRS Oversight Board. The \n     placement of the Secretary of the Treasury on the Oversight \n     Board threatens, in our view, to erode the necessary \n     confidence of the American people in the non-partisan \n     administration and enforcement of the tax laws. The inclusion \n     of the union representative on the IRS Oversight Board \n     threatens the ability of IRS management to manage and control \n     the IRS workforce. In addition, the provision granting the \n     union representative immunity from two criminal laws which \n     apply to every other citizen threatens not only the \n     appearance but the actuality of the integrity and non-\n     partisan impartiality of the Internal Revenue Service.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol A. Bonosaro,\n                                                        President.\n     G. Jerry Shaw,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am ready to call for the yeas and nays, but I \nunderstood that Senator Byrd was going to speak.\n  Mr. KERREY. Earlier we did request that. We have some Members who \nwill leave at 11 o'clock, so I asked Senator Byrd if he would speak \nafter the rollcall vote.\n  Does the Senator still want a rollcall vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2362 and 2363, en bloc\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk and \nask that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2362 and 2363, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2362\n\n (Purpose: To add a counsel to the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate who \n          reports directly to the National Taxpayer Advocate)\n\n       On page 203, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       On page 203, line 10, strike the period and insert ``, \n     and''.\n       On page 203, between lines 10 and 11, insert:\n       ``(III) appoint a counsel in the Office of the Taxpayer \n     Advocate to report directly to the National Taxpayer \n     Advocate.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2363\n\n   (Purpose: to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to provide a \n        combined employment tax reporting demonstration project)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . COMBINED EMPLOYMENT TAX REPORTING DEMONSTRATION \n                   PROJECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     provide for a demonstration project to assess the feasibility \n     and desirability of expanding combined Federal and State tax \n     reporting.\n       (b) Description of Demonstration Project.--The \n     demonstration project under subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) carried out between the Internal Revenue Service and \n     the State of Iowa for a period ending with the date which is \n     5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act,\n       (2) limited to the reporting of employment taxes, and\n       (3) limited to the disclosure of the taxpayer identity (as \n     defined in section 6103(b)(6) of such Code) and the signature \n     of the taxpayer.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 6103(d)(5), as amended \n     by section 6009(f), is amended by striking ``project \n     described in section 976 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     11997.'' and inserting ``projects described in section 976 of \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and section---- of the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first amendment that I am offering \ntoday will simply place a counsel--a lawyer--in the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate's office.\n  The purpose of doing this is to give the Taxpayer Advocate ready \naccess to legal opinions and legal judgments, Currently, the Taxpayer \nAdvocate must put requests into the Office of Chief Counsel.\n  In order to make the Taxpayer Advocate more independent, which is \nwhat this bill does, it logically follows that the Taxpayer Advocate \nshould have its own legal counsel. This will guarantee it fast, \nconfidential legal advice to help those taxpayers in greatest need. \nBecause it is the taxpayers in greatest need who go to the Taxpayer \nAdvocate.\n  The second amendment should not be controversial. It applies only to \nIowa. It is only a pilot project. We created an identical pilot project \nin Montana last year. A nationwide project like this was recommended by \nthe IRS Restructuring Commission. My amendment is only a pilot program \nand it is only for Iowa.\n  This project would simplify reporting for some Iowa businesses. It \nwould give a try to a program that would allow them to report taxes on \none form. This gives businesses more time to conduct business, and \nspend less time on paperwork.\n  Mr. President, these amendments have been cleared by the other side, \nand I ask that they be adopted by consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2362 and 2363) were agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I refer to the third chapter of Genesis, \nverse 20, ``And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the \nmother of all living.''\n  This coming Sunday, May 10, is Mother's Day. And, upon awaking that \nmorning, some mothers will be treated to a lovingly prepared culinary \nsurprise, and a glue-streaked--but treasured--handmade card. Others \nwill be invited to brunch or to lunch or to dinner with their children \nand, perhaps, grandchildren, many of whom may have traveled long miles, \nsome perhaps from one edge of the continent to the other, to help honor \ntheir mothers and grandmothers on this very special day, a day that \noriginated in West Virginia, Mother's Day.\n  In my own case, and that of my wife, we will be visited by our two \ndaughters, Mona Carol and Marjorie Ellen, and their husbands, Mohammad \nand Jon, respectively. And we will also be visited by our five \ngrandchildren. I will name them in the order of their ages: Erik Byrd \nFatemi, and then Mona Byrd Moore, Darius James Fatemi, Mary Anne Moore, \nFredric Kurosh Fatemi. They will all come to our house, the Lord \nwilling, this coming Sunday, and they will bring flowers to my wife \nErma. And we will sit and talk for awhile, and then we will have those \nbeautiful flowers and those beautiful thoughts and those beautiful \nmemories that will be with us for--in the case of the flowers, all \nsummer; in the case of the thoughts and memories, as long as we live. \nOthers of my colleagues will experience the same visits from their \ndaughters and granddaughters. And this will go on all over the country, \nwith children coming back home, the family circle again coming \ntogether.\n  This weekend will be one of the busiest weekends of the year, one of \nthe busiest for florists who deliver baskets and bouquets of long-\ndistance love. As for telephone lines, they will be busy also, carrying \nthe loving voices of sons and daughters, unable to make the long \njourney home. Some will be calling from foreign lands, but they will \nmake those calls to mother.\n  This annual outpouring of affection and appreciation gives me hope \nthat the strength of family feeling in this Nation has really not \ndiminished all that much, but ever how much, is too\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nmuch. Yet, those feelings are still strong. Despite the afternoon hate-\nfests on television that sometimes pass for talk shows, in which high \nratings are garnered by mother-daughter rivalries or mother-son \nconflicts that devolve into circus sideshows, caring and affection are \nstill widespread among ordinary families like mine, and like the \nfamilies of others here.\n  I cannot adequately describe how proud I am that the strength, the \ncharacter, and the devotion that my wife Erma instilled in our \ndaughters have carried through their families and are manifested in the \nfine families that my grandchildren are building. And I know that other \nSenators are just as proud of their families as I am of mine. I have \nsaid many times that the love and confidence and support of my family \nhave helped me through the hardest moments of my life--I have had some \npretty tough moments--and have sweetened every victory, and there have \nbeen some victories.\n  ``Simply having children does not make mothers,'' someone has said, \nbut a good mother is a pearl without price, for a mother's role in \nmaintaining a civil and decent society is incalculable.\n  I say mothers here, not to denigrate the active role played by many \nfathers in the lives of their children today, but in recognition of \nthat fundamental tie between a mother and her child--between a mother \nand her children. It is mother who wakes first at night to soothe the \nfevered brow. It is mother whose kisses are better than Bactine at \ntaking the sting out of the tender skin. It is mother whom you call \nwhen things are really, really bad, no matter your age. It is mother \nwho teaches us love. Mothers are our first and our best role models, \nwhose wisdom and training guide us through our headstrong teenage years \nand comfort us when we are older.\n  Napoleon Bonaparte said, ``The future destiny of the child is always \nthe work of the mother.'' To raise children to become good citizens is \na challenge, and it seems that today there are so many more malign \ninfluences out there, working to bend that childish twig into a \nblighted and twisted tree. ``As the twig is bent, the tree is \ninclined,'' it has been said. And, so, as I have stated, there are so \nmany more malign, malignant influences out there everywhere, working \ntoday, than there were when I was a child, working to bend that \nchildish twig into a blighted and twisted tree.\n\n  When I was younger--I will not say when I was young, I am still \nyoung, as young in spirit as ever--but when I was a boy, there was no \ntelevision, thank God; no television, and only very limited radio \nprogramming. That was back in the days when radio was good. We had an \nold Philco radio, just a little radio that sat on a shelf on the wall.\n  Of course, during the years when I lived as a country boy ``out in \nthe sticks,'' as we sometimes are prone to say, we had no radio at our \nhouse. We had no electricity in the house. No radio, no running water, \nno electric lights. But we moved later to a coal camp where we did have \na radio, the Philco that sat on the wall shelf.\n  A trip to the movie theater was rare. I remember that the strong man \nin the old silent movies was Joe Bonomo, and the cowboys were Tom Mix, \nHoot Gibson, Jack Hoxie, and William Desmond. But there was no Internet \nand no video, not even a school library in the two-room schools that I \nattended. But later on when I was in high school, there was a school \nlibrary. Then there was Bible class on Sunday. It was, in many ways, an \neasier time, a simpler time in which to rear children; it was much more \neasy to protect children against corrupting material.\n  I am no Luddite opposing technology and progress. Isaiah said that we \nwould have progress. He said:\n\n       Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert \n     a highway for our God.\n       Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill \n     shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, \n     and the rough places plain:\n       And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh \n     shall see it together. . .\n\n  So Isaiah foresaw the diesel motor train, the submarine, the \nunderocean cable. He foresaw television. He foresaw that wonderful \nnuisance, the telephone, and all of these inventions, of course, would \nlevel the hills and all flesh would see the glory of the Lord together. \nThat was Isaiah.\n  I am no Luddite opposing technology; I am for it. And progress, of \ncourse, I am for that, too.\n  With the bad comes the good, and with the good comes the bad. \nChildren, unfortunately, have access to pornography on the Internet, \nbut they also have access to Shakespeare and to Milton and to Carlyle. \nThey have access to their Government and to many other sources of \nuseful and intellectually stimulating information.\n  With television and with videos, our children can visit the world and \nsee history in the making. But a parent's job, the mother's job or the \nfather's job, is harder. It is more difficult to protect your children \nfrom material that may be too seamy or too misleading. It is more \ndifficult to shield your children from language that is profane, \noffensive, vulgar. It is more difficult to demonstrate acceptable \nbehavior when aggressive drivers, offensive song lyrics and violent \nbehavior are present on the streets, in the air and on television, \ntherefore, right in your living room. Seemingly everywhere, everywhere.\n  When sports heroes spit in the face of the umpire or choke their \ncoaches, their fans--some of them--may think it is all right, because \none will probably also notice that not enough of a penalty was \nattached. When the news is full of lawyers or politicians or \ncommentators throwing out slurs and wild allegations, youngsters may \nthink that courtesy and respect are not needed in business or public \nlife. By the way, John Locke wrote a constitution in 1669 for the \ngovernment of the Carolinas. In John Locke's constitution, there could \nbe no lawyers. No fees could be charged in John Locke's constitution. \nEvery law would sunset at the end of 100 years. That was John Locke's \nconstitution.\n  Hence, when the kind of language that I have been discussing, when \nthe kind of behavior permeates the schoolyard and the neighborhood, it \nsoaks into youngsters like water into a dry sponge.\n  When I see children of all ages celebrating their mothers on Mother's \nDay, I am encouraged. It means that many mothers and fathers are \novercoming the difficult challenges placed before them. They are \nsucceeding in building families. They are strong enough, caring enough, \nsupportive enough to fend off the disrespect that surrounds them and \nwho see no shame--no shame--in following the dictate of the Bible to \nhonor thy mother and thy father. ``Honor thy father and thy mother.'' \nThese surely are families that spend time together around the dinner \ntable.\n  I am overjoyed when I see my grandchildren come into my home. They \nare really, grown men and women.\n  They still kiss me on the cheek. It does not make any difference how \nmany people are around, they still kiss me on the cheek--that \ndemonstration of heartfelt, genuine love and affection that can only \ncome from children. Oh, as an aside, I might add, not altogether \njokingly, but also from my little dog ``Billy.''\n  These are families that spend time around the dinner table. These are \nfamilies in which the children do their homework, in which parents know \ntheir children's teachers and their friends, families in which the \nmembers help and encourage and support each other through triumph and \ntragedy.\n  We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about children, what \npriceless treasures they are, and the things we ought to do or ought \nnot to do to help them. I am happy today to look past those young gems \nin our national treasury, to recognize and honor the mother lode from \nwhich they issue, the ore that shapes them--clear, flawless, and true \nin all of their colors--their mothers. I hope that the mothers on my \nstaff enjoy their Mother's Day festivities, and that they, and my wife \nErma, the mother of my daughters, who are the mothers of my \ngrandchildren, and all mothers around the Nation, know that I salute \nthem, encourage them, and honor them this Sunday and every day.\n  I salute the mothers on my staff. It is very difficult for them and \nfor mothers on the staffs of other Senators. They have to be dedicated, \nand they do make a sacrifice in order to serve. And it is a sacrifice \nthat can never be retrieved or recouped. My admiration and respect go \nout to all of the young mothers who work in this great Senate family.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  Now, I lost my mother when I was 1 year old. She died in the great \ninfluenza epidemic in 1918. She died on Armistice Day. And I had what I \nthought were three brothers and one sister. Only about a month ago, I \nfound that I had another brother, a fourth brother, who had died at \nchildbirth. I did not know that until about a month ago.\n  In 1918, times were very hard. My father worked in a factory that \nmanufactured furniture. The Spanish flu killed 500,000 people in this \ncountry, and, according to estimates, more than 20 million people \naround the world. My mother knew that she might not recover, and so she \nasked my father to give me, the baby, to his sister Vlurma. I believe \nhe had 10 sisters. And my other brothers were to be farmed out to \nothers of his sisters.\n  But I was given to my father's sister Vlurma and her husband, Titus \nDalton Byrd, and they raised me. They did not have much of an \neducation, but they gave me their love and they urged me to do right. \nThey had the Holy Bible in the house. They could barely read, but the \nexample that they set was a shining example of a couple who revered \nGod. They did not wear their religion on their sleeves. They were not \nof the religious left or the religious right or anything of that \nnature; they were just good persons, trying to make an honest living \nand according to God's will.\n  I can imagine my own mother, had she lived; I have no recollection of \never having seen her, naturally, by virtue of her having gone away when \nI was just a year old. But the woman who raised me gave me tenderness \nand love and affection. I can see her wearing her bonnet and her apron. \nShe was a hard worker. I can see her, as others in this Chamber can see \ntheir own mothers, I am sure, especially as most Americans who are \nperhaps not as old as I am, can remember their mothers, especially \nthose who lived out in the country, out on the farm, wearing their \nbonnets and their aprons as they worked in the kitchen.\n  Those were old-fashioned mothers. We picture them in our minds. My \nmom, I used to watch her as she cooked the meals when I was a little \nboy. And I would hear her sing. And I would hear her use an expression: \n``Well, you put in a pinch of this and a pinch of that.'' They did not \nhave cookbooks. And my mom probably could not have read a cookbook, in \nany event. But I often heard her use that expression: ``A pinch of \nthis, a pinch of that.'' They did not use recipes; they just knew about \nhow much of this ingredient to put in, how much of that to put in, and \nhow long to cook it. By experience, they learned to cook. They were \ngreat cooks--great cooks.\n  Well, as I think of that woman who raised me, I think of the old-\nfashioned mother that most of us can remember. And I will close with a \nfew lines that take off on my mom's expression, ``a pinch of this, a \npinch of that.'' Now, I did not write this poem. I do not remember the \nname of the author. It is a fitting poem:\n\n     When Mother use to mix the dough,\n     Or make a batter--long ago;\n     When I was only table high,\n     I used to like just standing by\n     And watching her, for all the while,\n     She'd sing a little, maybe smile,\n     And talk to me and tell me--What?\n     Well, things I never have forgot.\n\n     I'd ask her how to make a cake.\n     ``Well, first,'' she'd say, ``Some sugar take\n     Some butter and an egg or two,\n     Some flour and milk, you always do,\n     And then put in, to make it good--''\n     This part I never understood\n     And often use to wonder at--\n     ``A pinch of this, a pinch of that.''\n\n     And then, she'd say, ``my little son,\n     When you grow up, when childhood's done,\n     And mother may be far away,\n     Then just remember what I say,\n     For life's a whole lot like a cake;\n     Yes, life's a thing you have to make--\n     Much like a cake, or pie, or bread;\n     You'll find it so,'' my Mother said.\n\n     I did not understand her then,\n     But how her words come back again;\n     Before my eyes my life appears\n     A life of laughter and of tears,\n     For both the bitter and the sweet\n     Have made this life of mine complete--\n     The things I have, the things I miss,\n     A pinch of that, a pinch of this.\n\n     And, now I think I know the way\n     To make a life as she would say:\n     ``Put in the wealth to serve your needs,\n     But don't leave out the lovely deeds;\n     Put in great things you mean to do,\n     And don't leave out the good and true.\n     Put in, whatever you are at,\n     A pinch of this, a pinch of that.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What a stirring speech from the Senator from West \nVirginia on such a fitting time and occasion, on Mother's Day. I just \ndid my note to my mother this morning for Mother's Day. I sent a poem--\nnot orally delivered; I think orally is much better than in writing.\n  As you reflect and talk of the essence of motherhood, it seems it is \nthe essence of love you are talking about. It reminds me of what we are \ncalled to do. We are called to love--to love our Lord, our God, with \nall our heart, mind, soul, and flesh, and to love our neighbor as \nourselves. Mothers seem to exemplify that perhaps better than anybody \ndoes.\n  How fitting, on National Day of Prayer, when we are praying for our \nNation, why not add a prayer for your mother, too, and pray for the \nmothers of the country who rock the cradle, who lead us in many places, \nin many facets.\n  I can see my own wife, today, with our three children, leading them \nand leading us and leading our family--that central unit of the \nRepublic, the family.\n  I am very touched by the Senator's speech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4460-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4462-S4466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

I think the chairman of the Finance Committee has done \nextraordinary work on bringing this topic to the floor, and I am going \nto support it. I think it is an important measure to us and for the \nRepublic.\n  I rise to speak for a few minutes on the need not only to reform the \nInternal Revenue Service but to change the way our Government is \nfinanced. During consideration of the budget resolution, just a short \nmonth ago, the Senate voted not only for the need to make some basic \nchanges in the IRS but also the need to sunset the Tax Code.\n  It is a sad and easily recognizable fact that big government \nadvocates have socially engineered our culture into the ground through \nthe use--and abuse, I might add--of the power to tax. To save our \nculture, we must at once not only recognize and support those entities \nin the culture that help us, but also remove the ability of Government \nto discriminate against institutions that help us, as well. For \ninstance, the marriage penalty; we have a tax on being married. If you \nare married, you get taxed more than if you just live together. That is \nwrong. That is harmful to society. It is harmful to the culture and \nneeds to be removed. We promote, also, gambling in the Tax Code.\n  In short, we must cut back on Government's micromanagement of our \nlives, and particularly those areas that create vice and hinder and \nhurt our Republic and our Nation and our culture. This is a Tax Code \nthat we have today that will go down in history as one of the most \nonerous burdens ever placed on the American people. I am convinced that \nwe cannot have another American century with this Tax Code. It is \nantifamily. It is antigrowth. It cannot be saved. It must be scrapped.\n  But in the meantime, we must try to correct for some of the well \ndocumented cases of abuses that were given life by this Tax Code and \nwere brought to light by the Senate Finance Committee. The IRS needs to \nbe reformed as much as the code that has given it unprecedented power \nneeds to be put to rest. Americans demand reform of our Tax Code as \nwell as the agency charged with enforcing it. We have promised that \nreform. Now, during the course of this bill, we must begin to deliver \non that promise to the American people.\n  I believe we need to stay focused on where the problem really lies.\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n  In order to make this point, I have a horror story from Kansas--not \nthat everybody doesn't have one from their home State, actually many of \nthem coming forward--that involves an older couple--the husband is \nnearly 70 years old--running a small business from their home. In the \nmid-1980s, they were selected for an IRS audit that focused heavily on \nhome office deductions and related expenses and resulted in the \nassessment of additional taxes, penalties, and interest. The \nconstituents have made payments on the back taxes, but in so doing, \nthey limited their ability to make their current estimated tax \npayments. So the IRS said, ``Stop making your back tax payments and \nlet's get caught up on your current estimated taxes.'' The constituents \ntold them they would do that. But they were told, as well, that the IRS \nwould put a hold on the collection of their back taxes until they were \ncaught up on their current estimated taxes. The IRS said, ``OK, we will \nput a hold on collecting your back taxes. You get caught up on the \nestimated current taxes.'' However, the IRS failed to inform the \nconstituents that interest on the back taxes would continue to accrue.\n\n  Now, the outstanding principal balance my constituents owed was \n$18,000. However, when the penalty and accrued interest are added, the \namount balloons to $46,000--from an $18,000 back tax to $46,000 in \ninterest and penalties. My constituents have offered to pay $18,000. \nThey believe that they might be able to come up with that with loans \nfrom friends and relatives. However, the IRS cites the constituents' \nequity in their home as a source of income that could be used to settle \nthe entire debt, but they need to sell their home or otherwise \nrefinance in order to be able to get the equity to pay off this bad tax \ndebt.\n  Unfortunately, because of the situation with the IRS, the IRS has put \na lien on their home. And, in fact, in this era of declining interest \nrates, my constituents have been forced to pay over 10 percent interest \nrates because the lien precludes them from refinancing at lower rates, \npossibly as low as 7 percent. Therefore, again, my constituents are \nmaking very high house payments, which squeezes their budget even \ntighter, which limits their ability to pay their back taxes and \ninterest due to the IRS or the current estimated taxes due to the IRS.\n  If my constituents were to sell their home, their age would likely \npreclude them from generating enough income to purchase another home. \nThe IRS has even garnished their Social Security retirement income. \nSocial Security benefits comprise the bulk of their income. They are \nstill trying to reach a settlement with the IRS. In trying as hard as \nthey can to make this payment, they are getting squeezed and boxed in \nby this IRS and by this code. This is just another horrible example of \nthe IRS in the Catch-22 situation that is forced upon many Americans. \nIt must be put to a stop. This cannot continue.\n  The underlying problem, though, along with the IRS enforcement, is \nthe Tax Code. Not only does our Tax Code undermine the basic building \nblocks of our society, the family, it also punishes good investment \ndecisions and distorts the labor market as well as our rates of \nnational savings are distorted by this Tax Code. It manipulates \nbehavior by adding an incentive to do one thing while punishing those \nwho would do something else.\n  A quick look at some of the inadequacies in our code should make the \ncase for reform clear. For example, if you are a gambler, you can \ndeduct your gambling losses against your winnings. But if you are a \nhomeowner and you happen to make a bad home investment, and the value \nof your home declines, you have no recourse in the Tax Code because you \ncannot claim a deduction for the capital loss. Now the question really \nis--think about this--should we allow for a bad game of blackjack to be \ndeducted but not a bad home investment which you were building a family \naround? Does this make sense to anybody? I don't think so.\n  The code is full of these inconsistencies, like the one I just \nmentioned. Sure, we can try to fix the problems within our Tax Code, \nand we should, but the fact of the matter is, our Tax Code is riddled \nwith these inconsistencies. It is micromanagement to the greatest \ndegree, which leads to the conclusion that we cannot reform this code. \nWe have to sunset it and go to one that is simpler, better, and fairer. \nWe must move to a tax system where individuals are not punished for \ngetting married, for saving for their children's education, or for \nother investments, where the national rate of savings is not distorted \nby these unintended consequences. This current Tax Code doesn't make \nsense. It is unintelligible. It has 10 million words and it has to be \ngotten rid of.\n\n  We should go to a tax system that does not discriminate against the \ncomponents of growth in our economy or the family. Some will disagree. \nBut this is the precise issue upon which we must focus our debate. We \nmust decide where we want the tax to be imposed; and further, we must \nunderstand what effect the imposition of the tax will have on the \nhealth of the economy. We need to go to a progrowth, profamily taxation \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, we are soon going to have a debate on replacing this \nTax Code. I have spoken with the majority leader and he agrees with the \nneed to bring this up during the Treasury-Postal debate. We will have a \nfull debate about replacing and sunsetting this Tax Code and going to \none that is simpler, fairer, and better.\n  It is time to have this debate. We voted previously in the Senate on \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution to sunset this Tax Code by the end of \nthe year 2001 and start the great national debate now about what we \nshould replace this riddled code with. That is what we should do--\nfigure out what we are going to replace it with and set the time line \nthat by this date we will have a new code. It may take 15 years to \nimplement it. We are going to have to do some phasing in doing it. But \nit is time to start the great debate on this. Reform is important. \nReforming the IRS is critical. The next step is reforming the IRS code, \nthe law. We will vote on sunsetting it and start this great national \ndebate of going to a different system so that we can have another \nAmerican century, an unlimited America. We can't with this code. We can \nand we must do better.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Idaho for \nallowing me to break in here to give a 5-minute speech dealing also \nwith what Senator Brownback is talking about, which is really the \nunfairness of the current Tax Code that we have.\n  Mr. President, I am usually not one to quote poetry here on the \nSenate floor, but I rise today and ask my colleagues' indulgence as I \nbroach a serious subject with a not-so-serious bit of rhyme.\n\n       Abracadabra, thus we learn\n       The more you create, the less you earn.\n       The less you earn, the more you're given,\n       The less you lead, the more you're driven,\n       The more destroyed, the more they feed,\n       The more you pay, the more they need,\n       The more you earn, the less you keep,\n       And now I lay me down to sleep.\n       I pray the Lord my soul to take\n       If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake.\n\n  Mr. President, it was 1935 when poet Ogden Nash took up his pen to \nwarn of the dangers of a tax system run amuck. Then, the federal tax \nrate topped out at less than 4 percent.\n  Sixty-three years later, Washington now demands 28 percent of every \npaycheck; the additional burden of state and local taxes boosts the \ntotal tax load to nearly 40 percent of every worker's paycheck.\n  I cannot say with certainty what sort of poem Mr. Nash might produce \non the subject were he alive today, but it would not surprise me if it \ncould not be repeated here on the Senate floor.\n  There exists no other date the American people await with such dread \nas April 15, tax filing day. Rightfully so. Oppressive taxes, coupled \nwith abuses the Internal Revenue Service routinely carries out upon \ntaxpayers--abuses exposed during the recent hearings of the Senate \nFinance Committee--certainly highlight the reasons why.\n  Yet, taxpayers face another annual event they should look upon with \nequal disdain, an event that reveals a great deal about the federal, \nstate, and local tax burden working families are expected to bear: Tax \nFreedom Day.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\n  As it does every year, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has calculated \nthe date average American stops working just to pay their share of the \ntax burden and begin working for themselves and their families.\n  In 1998, Tax Freedom Day falls on Sunday, May 10. That means \ntaxpayers must work 129 days before they can count a single penny of \ntheir salary as their own--that is a full day later than 1997, and \nmarks the latest-ever arrival of Tax Freedom Day.\n  By the time Tax Freedom Day arrives, the American people will have \nspent the last 129 days imprisoned by their own tax system. And that is \nnot the whole picture, because if the cost of complying with the tax \nsystem itself were included in the calculations, Tax Freedom Day would \nbe pushed forward another 13 days. As proof of just how far we have \ntraveled--in the wrong direction--Tax Freedom Day in 1925 arrived on \nFebruary 6.\n  Taxpayers are now working more than an entire week longer to pay off \ntheir taxes than they were when President Clinton first took office in \n1993. Calculate the tax load in hours and minutes, instead of days, and \nAmericans spend fully two hours and 50 minutes of each eight-hour \nworkday laboring to pay their taxes.\n  While May 10th marks the arrival of Tax Freedom Day for taxpayers in \nan average state, many Americans are forced to wait longer. My home \nstate of Minnesota, for example, is the third highest-taxed state, and \nour taxpayers will not mark Tax Freedom Day until May 16, nearly a week \nlater. If you live in Wisconsin or Connecticut, you will wait even \nlonger.\n  After 16 major tax increases over the past 30 years, the need for tax \nrelief has never been more pressing.\n  Congress and the President moved toward the taxpayers in 1997 by \nenacting the ``Taxpayer Relief Act'' with its $500 per-child tax \ncredit. In 1998, Congress and the President can and must do more, \nbeginning with fundamental reform of the entire tax system. Merely \ntinkering around the edges of the Internal Revenue Service won't reduce \nthe burden on overtaxed Americans, though. Real reform means creating a \nmore sensible way to pay for the services of government through a \nsystem that is flatter, simpler, fairer, and treats the taxpayers with \nrespect. Meaningful tax relief--relief that leaves more dollars in the \nhands of working Americans to spend on child care, health insurance, \nclothing, and groceries--will quickly follow.\n  Instead of serving as yet another occasion for tabulating the high \ncost of government, Tax Freedom Day must become a national call to \naction. How far will it go if the taxpayers do not step forward? To \nparaphrase Mr. Nash: Abracadabra, thus we say Just where is the \n``freedom'' in Tax Freedom Day? I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 2364, 2365, and 2366, en bloc\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send three amendments, en bloc, to the \ndesk and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2364, 2365, and 2366, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment 2364 \nbe modified, and I send that modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2364), as modified, is as follows:\n\n                    amendment no. 2364, as modified\n\n     (Purpose: To require advance notification to taxpayers before \n disclosure of their income tax return information to state and local \n                              governments)\n\n       On page 394, after line 15, add new item 5 to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(5) Whether return information should be disclosed under \n     Section 6103(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to any \n     agency, body, or commission of any State (or legal \n     representative thereof) unless the Secretary determines that \n     such agency, body, or commission (or legal representative) \n     has first notified each person for whom such return or return \n     information was filed or provided by, on behalf of, or with \n     respect to, personally in writing that the request described \n     in section 6103(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has \n     been made by such agency, body, or commission (or legal \n     representative) and the specific reasons for making such \n     request.''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I discuss these three amendments en \nbloc, let me say, as so many of us have on the floor over the last \nseveral days, how proud we are of Senator Bill Roth for the very \nstatesmanlike approach he has taken toward major reform of the Internal \nRevenue Service. His committee, the Finance Committee of this Senate, \nand the hearings he has held with the full participation of Democrats \nand Republicans alike in most instances, is producing the first \nsignificant reform in the IRS in its history in well over 200 years. We \nare reversing a trend that over 200 years progressively took away from \nthe average citizen, the taxpayer, more and more of their rights as \nindividuals, their personal power upon themselves, and their own \nfinancing. So what we do here today and what we have been doing for \nseveral days is phenomenally significant. I am tremendously proud of \nour chairman, Bill Roth, and the statesmanlike approach he has taken.\n  Let me also say that the leadership of our majority leader, Trent \nLott, has also helped to cause this to happen. He has supported our \nchairman and insisted that we move this along in a timely fashion. Of \ncourse, I am pleased that the American public is supportive of what we \nare doing. They know more than anyone else the importance of the \nreforms that we are debating.\n  While this is a major step taken forward, my three amendments touch \non\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nan area that really has not gone overlooked but is very seldom talked \nabout; that is, taxpayer privacy and disclosure of taxpayer \ninformation. It is probably one of the more important areas. And it is \nsomething that a lot of our citizens simply don't know a great deal \nabout. They assume, and you and I assume, Mr. President, that our \ninformation, our forms, our files at the IRS are very, very private. \nThey are not. For the next few moments let me explain why they are not, \nand why my three amendments would make a major effort to correct that.\n  While the citizens of our country believe that the agencies of the \nFederal Government responsible for collecting and administering our tax \nlaws will hold their information confidential--and I think they have \nbeen led to believe that over the years--it just simply is not the \ncase.\n  I was stunned when I found out that under the Internal Revenue Code \nand the IRS regulations all it takes is one simple letter from State \ntax officials to get the IRS to turn over to thousands of officials \nacross the Nation millions of pages of citizen returns. Those citizens \nhave no way of finding out that their returns have been passed on in \nwhatever manner. Does the IRS tell them? No. It doesn't. Does it state \nto them that at least they have been turned over to the State? Or does \nthe State notify them that they are in possession of their Federal tax \nrecords? Again the answer is no. It doesn't tell them. You and I, Mr. \nPresident, would like to think that those are our private records. We \nknow, as every citizen knows, that they are the most disclosing of all \nfinancial information that any citizen ever provides. And it is all \nconsidered, at least by the citizen, confidential.\n  The evidence is very clear that there could be abuse. We don't know \nat this moment whether there has been State or local abuse. I say local \nabuse because we know that cities that have income taxes also can have \nmade available to them those citizens' Federal IRS returns referenced. \nSo what we don't know is where the abuse is occurring. What we do know \nis that these are released.\n\n  More than 60 jurisdictions under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue \nCode are allowed to have access, all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, Commonwealth and territories, plus all of the cities with \nincome taxes and with populations of over 150,000. It is true that \nsection 6103 of the code prohibits sharing tax return information--\nWatergate style, that is--with Governors and mayors. Or shall I say \npolitical individuals? But then you and I know, Mr. President, that in \nsome of our States there still lurks and there always will lurk the \n``good ole boy'' system.\n  Who appoints the tax commissioner in the State? Very few are elected. \nThe Governor does. Who has access to all of these files? The tax \ncommissioner does. If I want to know something about an individual, and \nI am a Governor, or I am a mayor of the so described cities, is it \nimpossible to get that information? Let me tell you. There is a law \nagainst doing that. But we know that law has not been enforced, or we \nknow that in many instances. Who would ever find out? Do we have \nFederal agents at State collection agencies ensuring the security and \nthe confidentiality of those thousands of records they have passed \nforward? No. Absolutely not. We couldn't afford it if it were the right \nthing to do.\n  So what I am suggesting in my amendments is that we change the \nbehavior, change the attitude. Drug dealers, child molesters, and \norganized crime individuals have more protection outside of the Tax \nCode than the average citizen has inside the Tax Code.\n  Frankly, I am amazed that this type of sharing of confidential tax \ninformation has not been found to be an unreasonable search under the \nfourth amendment of the Constitution.\n  I want to stress that this information is not passed along only in \ncases in which an individual is under investigation by a State or a \nlocal tax agency. One routine request will provide detailed computer \ntapes on virtually all of the taxpayers in that State. Then computers \ncan be used to scan the tapes for any item of information that the \nState or the local officials think may indicate ``fishy behavior,'' or \nthe tax return information of selected individuals may be accessed. And \nthe taxpayer, again, let me repeat, is never told that his or her \nrecords are being passed around in the character and in the nature \nwhich I have described.\n  What kind of confidential taxpayer information can be passed around \nso freely? I was astounded to find out how much. The kind of \nconfidential tax information being handed out includes the taxpayer's \nannual tax returns, information returns, declarations of estimated \ntaxes, claims for refunds, amendments, supplements, and supporting \nschedules and attachments. Worse yet, many types of information can be \npassed around simply because they are called return information. This \ncan include the taxpayer's identity, the nature, the source, and the \namount of income, any payments or receipts in the IRS files, and any \ndeductions you may have taken. From that type of information it is \npossible to figure out what kind of house the taxpayer lives in, the \namount of the debt that taxpayer has, if you are sick, if you are not \nsick. The confidential taxpayer information being passed around \nincludes your net worth, your tax liability, any deficiencies in tax \npayments you have and the like. It gets worse. It doesn't get better \nbecause there are a lot of things in those files.\n  The confidential information shared includes any data received or \nprepared by the IRS regarding a return deficiency, penalties, interest, \noffenses, and the like. It includes any information regarding actual or \npossible investigation of a return. And it also includes any part of an \nIRS written determination or background file document not opened to \npublic inspection.\n  Now, remember, I just said information not open to public inspection \nthat can be sent out across the country to any lesser tax collecting \nagency. It may even include an incorrect or an unfavorable credit \nreport, a report which under any other circumstance you could access, \ndispute, and correct.\n  Generally, however, taxpayers do not have access to their own IRS \nfiles. Therefore, you, the taxpayer, have no way of checking the \naccuracy of the information or refuting incorrect information that may \nbe passed back and forth freely amongst several levels of government.\n  The bundle of amendments I have offered today does several things. My \nfirst amendment would advance the idea of not allowing this kind of \nconfidential information to flow forward. I understand that States that \nhave income taxes use the IRS code and its information to shape and \ndefine their own taxpayers, and I understand that if we were to stop \nthat immediately it could cause grave impact on State tax collecting \nagencies. So what I have asked in this amendment, in the modification \nthat I sent to the desk, is that we review through the study within the \nproposed law that we are debating now of 6103, that we look at this as \na part of a study to see how we can shape the assurance of \nconfidentiality, as information in some instances probably must flow to \nother tax collecting agencies. And I hope we can accept that. It is a \nstudy to begin to look at assuring confidentiality in an area that, \nvery frankly, the committee did not take a lot of time looking at.\n  The second amendment would limit the sharing of tax return \ninformation with States or local governments to circumstances in which \nits disclosure and use is necessary to administer a State or local \nincome tax. So we are talking exclusively of an income tax calculation, \nnot, if you will, the broad search for information.\n  Under careful examination of section 6103, I noticed that large \ncities, as I mentioned, would receive confidential tax information only \nif they impose their own city income tax. So we want to limit it to \njust those cities that have an income tax. But States, the District of \nColumbia, territories, and Commonwealths could receive detailed, \nvoluminous information on income tax returns as long as they assure the \nIRS that the information is somewhat related to State tax law; in other \nwords, we want to make it specific: States, governments, local \njurisdictions that have income taxes as a part of their revenue \ncollecting and therefore to be very specific so that States that do \nnot, cities, large cities of over 225,000 that do not, cannot request \nit because the law would deny, or allow the IRS to deny that kind of \nrequest of these\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nvery large volumes of confidential information.\n  Amendment two would shape that and limit it. In short, this amendment \nsimply says income tax information should only be shared for a relevant \npurpose--for income tax purposes, period. It would treat States and \nother jurisdictions the way the Tax Code already treats the larger \ncities. This amendment represents a modest first step toward better \nprotection for taxpayer privacy.\n  The third amendment requires the IRS to publish a reasonable \ndisclosure to all taxpayers in the instruction booklets already \naccompanying the basic Federal income tax returns. This would simply be \nan explanation to the taxpayer in clear language, in conspicuous print, \none page, in the front of the information booklet, the conditions under \nwhich the taxpayer's tax return information may be shared with any \nother party outside the IRS.\n\n  In other words, it puts the taxpayer on notice that here is the limit \nand this is information they simply did not know before. I firmly \nbelieve that virtually none of America's taxpayers realize just how \npublic their private tax records are. The very least we owe them is to \ndisclose up front the circumstances under which their information will \nbe shared. This would also assure them of the extent, however limited, \nto which their privacy is protected. This disclosure also should result \nin increased compliance with State and local tax laws since taxpayers \nwill be reminded up front as they prepare their Federal return that the \nsame information may be shared for State or local compliance purposes. \nSurely, the IRS can do this for its taxpayers. Taxpayers who will send \n$1.7 trillion this year to the Treasury of this country deserve to have \na clear, one-page explanation of the extent to which their privacy is \nprotected.\n  Let me repeat that. One page of information, that is all it takes, in \nthe front of the information book that goes out to every taxpayer. I do \nnot want the regulators downtown to decide that it takes an entirely \nnew book with multiple pages saying blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah. We \nwant the taxpayer to know the circumstances and those who can receive \nthis very private and very confidential information. So that is what \nshould happen, and I believe these are amendments Congress should \naccept as we move to reform the IRS code.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of amendment 2364, as modified, and I \nask to set aside for the time being amendments 2365 and 2366.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2364), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, I applaud my chairman, Bill Roth, \nfor the leadership he has brought on this most significant of issues. \nAs I say, it is fun to be a part of rolling back 200 years of \naccumulation of assault on the American taxpayer that clearly this \nSenate is acting upon now in this major reform of the IRS. Of course, \nto our majority leader, and to all who have joined in the Finance \nCommittee, it is especially important that we do this.\n  So I hope that the disclosures I am talking about, the limitations as \nthey relate to privacy and the confidentiality of this information can \nbecome a part of that reform. And then, of course, the other, an \nintense study to understand how far we can go and how we can work with \nincome-tax-collecting State agencies and cities to assure even greater \nconfidentiality is so very important.\n  With those comments, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

ENZI\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take some time while we are in a \npause here to talk about something that all of us are aware of, and \nthat is Mother's Day, which is on Sunday, but I also want to talk a \nlittle bit about a special mother, a lady from Sheridan, WY.\n  This lady was selected to be Mother of the Year in Wyoming a short \ntime ago. Just last week, she participated in the National Mother of \nthe Year event, American mothers event. She is a lady who has done all \nof the things that people want to do.\n  She had a long and happy marriage, a career with her husband in a \nsmall business, a leader in her church. She continues to be an elder of \nthe Sunday school, superintendent of a Presbyterian Church, first woman \npresident of the Sheridan County Chamber of Commerce, a scout leader, \ndirector of the National Miss Indian Pageant for 12 years, twice Worthy \nMatron of Eastern Star. Currently, she is serving on the boards of the \nSheridan County Senior Center, Salvation Army, Lifelink and Camp Story. \nShe is a busy, busy lady. She also has two children.\n  Her name is Dorothy Enzi, and one of her children is Senator Mike \nEnzi from Wyoming, my associate, who went, by the way, last weekend to \nthis national event.\n  I want to take a moment to recognize this lady for all that she does, \nnot only because she is my friend's mother and my friend as well, but \nbecause this is the time to celebrate motherhood, a time to celebrate \nfamilies, a time to celebrate things that we think are so important.\n  I was struck by the homey sort of poem that was written by her \ndaughter, the other child of Dorothy Enzi. I am going to share it with \nyou.\n\n                       A Woman Ahead of Her Time\n\n                          (By Marilyn Koester)\n\n     Dorothy Enzi has always worked hard all her life\n     With a wholesome work ethic, whatever the strife.\n     A woman who was always ahead of her time\n     A 90's woman of each era--a role model of mine.\n\n     In the 40's a grocery store she did run\n     With her husband, yet still had time for her son.\n     Then I came along and she handled that too\n     This 90's woman of the 40's knew just what to do.\n\n     In the 50's she ran the Thermop Trailer Court\n     While Dad sold shoes on the road for his family's support.\n     Then to Sheridan they moved and worked side by side\n     At their very first shoe store--a real source of pride.\n\n     Mom always made time for Mike's and my needs\n     As Den Mother, Scout Leader, she did many deeds.\n     She always worked hard--often into the night\n     A 90's woman of the 50's she knew what was right.\n\n     In the 60's more shoe stores were opened elsewhere\n     And Mom worked just as hard as anyone there.\n     She was active in clubs and the Chamber as well\n     As their first woman President she served them quite swell.\n\n     Whatever the challenge, she took it in stride\n     But her family remained a great source of pride.\n     As we both entered college we knew what it took\n     The 90's woman of the 60's had written the book.\n\n     In the 70's Mom was still going strong\n     She and Dad worked hard and the hours were long.\n     But they took time to golf and oft headed south\n     When the winters up north got them down in the mouth.\n\n     Her kids were now grown and both married as well\n     Grandchildren now made her feel pretty swell.\n     She cuddled and coddled and to them she did tend\n     This 90's woman of the 70's came full circle again.\n\n     In the 80's the shoe stores were now changing hands\n     And Mom still was strong when alone she did stand.\n     Dad passed on to a place where Mom could not go\n     But she cherished the memories whene're she felt low.\n\n     She kept loving life and worked hard at all tasks\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n     And volunteered time to all groups that did ask.\n     Still active and busy, not once standing still\n     This 90's woman of the 80's thought life was a thrill.\n\n     Now the 90's have come, and Mom still shows us how\n     You can work hard, enjoy life and do it all now.\n     Life's never dull if you give it your best\n     And God's blessed us with a Mother above all the rest.\n\n     On this great occasion Mike and I say\n     Congrats Mom, we love you, let's make this your day.\n     Mother of the Year we salute you and say\n     You're a woman ahead of your time to this day.\n\n  So I rise to salute Dorothy Enzi, and all the mothers in this \ncountry, and particularly the good bringing up that our good Senator \nfrom Wyoming has had from his mother.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the issues that we think is very \nimportant and needs to be addressed by this Congress is the issue of \nmanaged care. A number of us have, every day the Senate has been in \nsession recently, brought to the floor stories of what is happening in \nhealth care in this country and examples why a Patients' Bill of \nRights, which we would like to see the Congress enact, would be \nbeneficial to the American people.\n  Today I want to tell you about a man named Frank Wurzbacher of \nAlexandria, Kentucky. Fred received monthly injections of a drug called \nleupron as treatment for his prostate cancer. Under his retiree health \nplan, that treatment, which cost $500 per injection, was fully covered.\n  When a different insurance company took over as the plan \nadministrator, however, the new company notified Mr. Wurzbacher that \nhis coverage for this treatment was reduced from 100 percent to only \ntwo-thirds of the total cost. In other words, rather than paying the \nfull $500 for the shot, the company would pay only $320.\n  At the time, Mr. Wurzbacher was a 66-year old retiree. He didn't have \nthe extra $180 a month for the leupron injections, so he asked his \nphysician what his alternatives were. The physician said the \naggressiveness of the cancer suggested that the only other alternative \nwas the removal of the patient's testicles. The surgery was approved. \nMr. Wurzbacher had that surgery and then returned home from the \nhospital to find a letter from the insurance company notifying him that \nit had made a mistake and that his plan would, in fact, pay the full \n$500 for the monthly leupron injection. But by then, of course, it was \ntoo late; the surgery had been done.\n\n  That should not have happened to Mr. Wurzbacher and would not happen \nif the Patients' Bill of Rights were law. Under the Patients' Bill of \nRights, there would have been an appeal of the new plan administrator's \ndecision and that appeal, perhaps, would have then disclosed that the \ncoverage for leupron was in fact fully available. Mr. Wurzbacher would \nnot have had to go through his operation. Of course, no one can turn \nback the clock, and Mr. Wurzbacher is just one more victim of decision-\nmaking by those who all too often see medical care as a function of \ndollars and cents and the bottom line, rather than as a function of \nsaving someone's life.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights simply says that those 160 million \nAmericans who are now herded into managed care organizations for their \nhealth care have certain rights. One of those rights ought to be the \nright to be told all of your medical options for the treatment of your \ndisease, not just the cheapest option.\n  You also ought to have a right to appeal an adverse decision that is \nmade about your health care by your managed care plan. Such an appeal \nmay very well have prevented the kind of tragedy that was visited on \nFrank Wurzbacher of Alexandria, KY.\n  Mr. President, we hope very much that Republicans and Democrats \ntogether this year will agree that the issue of managed care and the \nissue of a Patients' Bill of Rights should be brought to the floor of \nthe Senate and addressed not only in the Senate, but also by \nlegislation enacted by Congress this year. We will continue to discuss \non the floor of the Senate the stories of the problems people face, one \nby one across this country, with managed care when managed care \norganizations view health care as a function of someone's profit and \nloss statement.\n  Let me conclude by describing, as I have on previous occasions, an \ninteresting front-page story in the New York Times about a woman who \nhad suffered a severe brain injury and was being transported by \nambulance to a hospital. She had the presence of mind, as her brain was \nswelling from this injury, to tell the ambulance driver she wanted to \nbe transported to the hospital farthest away. She said this because she \nknew that the closer hospital, which was affiliated with her health \ncare plan, had a reputation for treating emergency room care as a \nfunction of the bottom line. She wanted to go to an emergency room in \nwhich someone looked at her and did what needed to be done in every \ncircumstance, against all odds, to save her life. She was fearful \nenough of going to a hospital where she would be viewed as a function \nof someone else's bottom line that she wanted to be transported to the \nhospital farther away.\n  That relates to this issue. Should health care that relates to a \nspecific patient's condition be practiced in a doctor's office or a \nhospital, or should decisions about a patient's health care be made in \nan insurance office 2,400 miles away by some accountant? The American \npeople understand what the answer to that question should be. The \nanswer is embodied in a proposal called the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThat proposal has been introduced here in the Senate, and I hope very \nsoon that we can bring a proposal of this type to the floor of the \nSenate and discuss these central questions about health care in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4467-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4468-S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2368\n\n (Purpose: To amend the provision regarding offset of past-due legally \nenforceable State income tax obligations against overpayments to apply \n to debts for which an administrative hearing has determined an amount \n         of State income tax to be due, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for Mr. Grassley, \n     for himself and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2368.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 386, lines 17 and 18, strike ``return for such \n     taxable year'' and insert ``Federal return for such taxable \n     year of the overpayment''.\n       On page 387, line 23, insert ``by certified mail with \n     return accept'' after ``notifies''.\n       On page 388, strike lines 17 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A)(i) which resulted from--\n       ``(I) a judgment rendered by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction which has determined an amount of State income \n     tax to be due, or\n       ``(II) a determination after an administrative hearing \n     which has determined an amount of State tax to be due, and\n       ``(ii) which is no longer subject to judicial review, or\n       ``(B) which resulted from a State income tax which has been \n     assessed but not collected, the time for redetermination of \n     which has expired, and which has not been delinquent for more \n     than 10 years.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment offered by Senator Grassley \nand I will fix a problem having to do with Federal tax refunds and \nState offsets. For those of us that have State income tax, there is a \nproblem of some considerable proportion. I thank Chairman Roth for \nbeing willing to work with Senator Grassley and me on this one. There \nwas confusion. We answered incorrectly when the chairman asked us about \nwhether or not judicial judgments would solve this. I appreciate very \nmuch the chairman working with us to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I believe the amendment in its present form \nis satisfactory. I did initially have some serious concerns--some \nconcern that an innocent taxpayer might find money owed him that would \nbe offset by the State under situations where that would not be \nappropriate. But we have worked together and have come up with an \namendment that takes care of that concern. The majority is willing to \naccept the proposed amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, is not on the floor, but I am certain he is going to \nwant to speak on this. However, I think it will be fine if we urge \nadoption of the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2368) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the IRS \nReform and Modernization Act. It is now over six months since the House \npassed this reform measure. I am pleased that at last we are taking \nthis bill up here in the Senate, and that we will be voting on this \ntoday.\n  Let me tell you why I think this bill is so important.\n  Others have spoken on the new projections that this bill will provide \nfor taxpayers. I agree that they are very important.\n  As my colleagues have noted, this bill will provide taxpayers with \nimportant new rights and protections. It shifts the burden of proof in \nmany tax court cases from the taxpayer to the Secretary of the \nTreasury. It gives taxpayers an expanded ability to recover costs if \nthey win their cases. It protects ``innocent spouses''.\n  The bill also will help taxpayers by changing the framework for \ninterest and penalties and improving due process in matters regarding \naudits and collections. These are all important reforms. They will help \nensure fairness for taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I really want to get to the heart of why I am for this \nbill.\n  First, the Senate should know that I am very, very proud of the fact \nthat the IRS will have its headquarters in Maryland. I want to salute \nthe devoted men and women at the IRS who have worked under a very \ndifficult set of conditions. They have often worked under a lack of \nleadership and often with a lack of technology. I hope that as we move \nahead with the IRS reform package, we really remember and reward the \ndedicated and faithful civil servants who follow the laws that Congress \npasses.\n  I must tell why I am so enthusiastic about this bill. It provides not \nonly a new legislative framework, but a new culture and a new attitude \nat the top that then says to the agent at the grassroots level what is \nexpected of him. Let me tell you why I think this new culture and new \nattitude is so important. I believe there is no doubt that the IRS has \nengaged in many inappropriate management practices. I know from my \nconversations with Maryland constituents that too many of them have \nbeen outright harassed by the IRS.\n  I want to talk about two constituencies: the veterans of the State of \nMaryland and the firefighters in Frederick County. I think it is \noutrageous that IRS singled out these veterans of Maryland, and \nactually even stalked them over what they were doing in their VFW halls \nand their American Legion posts. The IRS wanted to penalize them \nbecause they had a little beer and a little bingo on a Friday night.\n  Over the past several years IRS has targeted a number of veterans \nposts in Maryland. Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion posts \nhave been subjected to audits, harassment and threats. What is their \ncrime? They sell drinks and food to their post members and their \nguests; a little bingo and a little beer and a lot of IRS. Let me tell \nyou, that has got to end.\n  Every member of this Senate has veterans' posts in their state. We \nknow that these neighborhood meeting places offer veterans a place for \nfellowship, entertainment and an affordable meal for their families and \nfriends. The IRS believes that posts should have to pay taxes on these \nsales. Maryland veterans' posts report that IRS has confiscated their \nsign-in books. People have been subpoenaed. One post, the Dundalk post \nin the State of Maryland, was even threatened the loss of their \nnonprofit status.\n\n  Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, these are the men and women who \nfought to save America, and I am willing to stand up today to save \nAmerica's veterans from the Internal Revenue Service. And that is why I \nam going to be an enthusiastic voter for the final passage of this \nbill.\n  What did our veterans have to do? They had to hire attorneys, they \nhad to hire CPAs. Amazingly, the American Legion was told by the IRS \nthey could not use post funds to provide this legal help. Then instead \nof offering to work cooperatively with the post to help them come into \ncompliance, the IRS went after them in the most heavy-handed manner. \nThey also said, ``If you go to any Member of your Congress, we will get \nyou.'' I am not out to get anybody. But what I am here to be sure of is \nthat our Tax Code is a workable one and that the people who work at IRS \nfollow the law.\n  Let me give you another example--our volunteer firefighters. \nUnderline that, Mr. President. Volunteer firefighters, who put \nthemselves, their lives on the line to save us and our families.\n  One of the ways that they get money to be able to purchase a \nfiretruck or other equipment is something called a tip jar. It is just \na big glass jar which they have in taverns or other places; voluntary \ncontributions to help a volunteer fire department. But, oh, no. Along \ncomes the IRS and says even though you risk your lives, even\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nthough you do not have the backing of big city technology, we are going \nto make sure we are going to tax you for what you have done.\n  To help the firefighters, the Frederick County Commissioners passed a \nlocal gaming law making it legal and less bureaucratic for the fire \ncompany to have tip jars in local taverns. The new law eliminated the \nneed for the county tax processors to get involved in a voluntary \nphilanthropic activity. But, no, the IRS had other ideas. They had to \ncome after our firefighters. They audited the fire company. They \ninformed the volunteers that they owed $29,000 in back Federal taxes \nbecause the money was not funneled through some local tax authority.\n  What comes next? Are they going to be after the Girl Scouts when they \nsell their cookies?\n  I believe an agency culture that identifies America's veterans and \nAmerica's volunteer firefighters as the enemy is a culture in desperate \nneed of change.\n  So that is why this bill is important. I believe that we are not only \nchanging the law, but it will change the culture of IRS.\n  The Oversight Board this bill provides will work to ensure the best \nuse of agency resources. It will help the IRS focus its priorities \nwhere they should be--stopping flagrant tax cheats and tax evaders, not \ngoing after veterans and volunteers who have made innocent mistakes.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate, and the system of local taxpayers \nadvocates will help these groups navigate their way through an often \nintimidating and complex dispute resolution process. The special \ncustomer group dedicated to working with members of the tax-exempt \nsector will also be a big help. This division will be able to work with \nthe non-profits to ensure they understand their responsibilities under \nthe law, and to help them comply.\n  Mr. President, before closing, I want to pay tribute to the devoted \nmen and women who work at the IRS, often under difficult circumstances, \ninadequate and dated technology, and often poor leadership or \nsupervision. I believe this bill will help them too. They have chosen \nto devote their careers to our government and to public service. They \nreceive little recognition and little thanks. I want them to know I \nvalue their work. And I am delighted that the Oversight Board will \ninclude an employee representative. No one knows more about how to \nchange the culture of the IRS than the employees themselves. This bill \nrecognizes the importance of ensuring that they have a place at the \ntable.\n  I do want the IRS to focus on collecting the taxes in the most \nefficient way, and I want them to go after tax cheats, tax evaders, and \ndrug dealers so that we can use the IRS to stop real crime in our \ncountry. There is no crime going on in the VFW or in the volunteer fire \ncompanies of America.\n  I know this bill and hopefully now the new Commissioner will interact \nwith different customer groups by working with them in a different type \nof way.\n  I look forward to the fact that with the new leadership and the new \nlegislation that we will really back the dedicated civil servants with \nthis new framework and that we will be able to help them. But today I \nvote for reform of IRS. I stand here on the Senate floor in my own \nmodest way to fight as hard for the veterans as they have fought for us \nand to stand up for protecting our volunteer firefighters.\n  Certainly in the United States of America a little beer and a little \nbingo should not be penalized.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we approach so-called Tax Freedom \nDay, I rise to offer some comments about the IRS Reform measure before \nus, and to address some more general issues on the state of our tax \ncode.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by especially commending the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, for his efforts to bring IRS reform \nbefore the body. His long involvement in this issue, and his unflagging \nefforts to bring these reforms before us deserve our highest praise.\n  This bill is very much the product of Senator Kerrey's work, and \nAmerican taxpayers are fortunate to have his gifted advocacy.\n  Mr. President, there are many significant reforms included in the \nbill before us, but one that I was especially interested to see \nincluded mirrors legislation I was pleased to join in introducing with \nthe senior Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) .\n  Our measure would extend the protections of the Equal Access to \nJustice Act to taxpayers who have had actions brought against them by \nthe IRS.\n  Mr. President, for those who are not familiar with this important \nAct, it was established in response to the dilemma individuals and \nsmall businesses face when the government brings an unjustified action \nagainst them that may be relatively expensive to contest.\n  Even though they may feel very strongly that they are right and they \ndid nothing wrong, they feel they cannot pay the costs associated with \nit.\n  Too often, an individual or a small business may feel forced to forgo \ncontesting the government's action, feeling that any potential fine or \nforfeiture would be less expensive than the cost of fighting the \ngovernment in court.\n  Mr. President, I saw this long before I entered the political world \nas an attorney representing small business people who faced this \nfrustration and feeling that they really couldn't fight the Government \nin these cases because of the problems with fines, and especially \nattorneys' fees.\n  Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, those individuals and small \nbusinesses are entitled to recover their court costs if they are \nsuccessful in fighting the government action.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate, I worked to \nestablish an Equal Access to Justice law for Wisconsin, and since \ncoming to this body, I have offered measures to further strengthen the \nFederal law in this regard.\n  This bill, the IRS bill, is a golden opportunity for us to improve \nthis law by including in large part the provisions of the bill Senator \nLeahy and I introduced that would make the IRS have to play by these \nrules as well.\n  I also want to thank the managers of the bill for accepting the \namendment my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, and I offered \nregarding the equal employment opportunity problems that were brought \nto our attention by IRS employees in Wisconsin.\n  This matter came to the attention of the Finance Committee at a \nrecent hearing, and I very much hope the action we are taking in this \nlegislation will help resolve those problems.\n  Mr. President, the IRS reform bill before us is by and large a good \nresponse to many of the problems with our current tax collection \nsystem. The tax collection system is a vitally important issue, and it \ncertainly contributes to the larger issue surrounding the Tax Code \nitself. Of course, the problems with the Tax Code are likely to be much \nthornier to address, and as we approach what has been called Tax \nFreedom Day, I want to offer a few comments on the challenges we face \nin taking the next step beyond this bill in reforming the Tax Code \nitself.\n\n  We have all heard about this Tax Freedom Day. There is some dispute \nabout when it really is, but it is supposed to be the day by which we \nhave worked enough to pay our taxes for the year. The Tax Foundation \nmaintains that the date is May 10. Other organizations question that \nand point to other dates. One says Tax Freedom Day is really April 22. \nLooking just at the Federal personal income tax, some say Tax Freedom \nDay for the typical taxpayer is really January 20. So it may be \ninteresting to examine all of these estimates and compare the \ndifferences in the way we calculate Tax Freedom Day. But without trying \nto argue which day is the right day, I think we can at least agree \nthere probably is not anyone who, if told their own tax freedom day was \nthis Sunday, wouldn't prefer that it was Saturday instead. No one likes \nto pay taxes and everyone would like to pay less than they do now. For \nmost people this would be a key part of tax reform, and I think they \nare right.\n  Although we may not be voting on a significant overhaul of the Tax \nCode this year, I really hope that serious debate of various tax reform \nproposals\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\ncan begin. This was something that was identified as one of the very \ntop four or five priorities after the 1994 election, to have a debate \nabout tax reform. But we have never had that debate over the past 4 \nyears. The work that has gone into the IRS reform bill, and especially \nthe leadership of Senator Kerrey, shows how much can be done if this \nbody actually works toward reform. And I think the same would be true \nif we really dedicated ourselves to tax reform legislation.\n  While we may not be voting on tax reform this year, we are certainly \nlikely to be taking actions, including apparently passing tax bills, \nthat will have a direct bearing on tax reform when it does finally come \nbefore us.\n  With this in mind as we take actions that are likely to have this \ndownstream effect on tax reform, I hope we keep various principles in \nmind. We should promote equity and fairness; we should resist \ncomplexity; and we should insist on fiscal responsibility.\n  An aspect of the current Tax Code that really strains each of these \nprinciples, and which contributes to our having a later Tax Freedom Day \nfor most of us, is, in fact, the huge number of special interest \nprovisions that appear throughout the Tax Code. It is riddled with \nthem. These provisions, often called tax expenditures, have been \nenacted over the years to help specific groups of taxpayers but they \nhave come at a cost. They come at a cost of lost revenue, and that ends \nup being a burden that other taxpayers are left to bear through higher \ntaxes.\n  While some tax expenditures are justified, many are not. And they can \ncombine to produce significant tax avoidance by some of the biggest and \nmost profitable financial interests in the world.\n  One example related to me recently concerned one of our largest \nautomakers, a firm that is obviously one of the largest and most \nsuccessful corporations in our Nation's history. This enormous \ncorporation reportedly had billions in U.S. profits for 1995 and 1996. \nBut they didn't pay one penny of Federal income tax. In fact, they \nactually got refunds totaling over $1 billion. In a case like this, for \na company like this, Tax Freedom Day isn't in May or April or March or \neven January 1. It must be last December because they were getting a \nrefund. That is a real freedom from taxation.\n\n  This kind of special treatment is, unfortunately, all too common, and \nwhile Tax Freedom Day may not be in the previous tax year for all of \nthese interests as in the example I gave, it is certainly the case that \nwhile many of us have to work until the flowers are blooming to pay our \ntaxes for the year, many special interests get their tax freedom at \nleast by Groundhog Day. Thousands and thousands of interests have been \nable to slip special provisions into the Tax Code over the years, \nincreasing the tax burden for the rest of us and further complicating \nthe Tax Code.\n  I am sorry to say that in the past few years Congress has not stopped \nthis trend. It has not slowed this trend. Congress has continued down \nthis path. On an almost annual basis, Congress passes more and more of \nthese special provisions. And these special provisions not only add to \nthe Tax Code's complexity while shifting a greater tax burden on the \nrest of us, they actually also undermine our ability to get to that \ngenuine tax reform that all of us are talking about. Again, sorry to \nsay, although I believe it is correct, last year's so-called tax cut \nbill was a prime example of this sort of abuse.\n  First and foremost, it was premature. It was not fiscally \nresponsible. Despite all of our recent good economic news and the \nwindfalls to the Government's bottom line, according to the most recent \nCBO estimate, we are still nearly $100 billion short of a truly \nbalanced budget. We have not balanced our books, unless you are somehow \nwilling to again and again, as has been done for far too many years, \nuse the Social Security trust fund balances to, in effect, mask the \ncurrently existing deficit. The real budget is still in deficit, and \nlast year's tax cut bill has made it harder to finish our most \nimportant task, and that is to actually balance the Federal budget.\n  Making matters worse, the cost of that tax bill was heavily back \nloaded, putting even more pressure on our budget just when the baby \nboomers begin to retire. That tax bill, of course, added even more \nlayers of complexity to a Tax Code that was already thick with it, and \nthat complexity was not only to the entire code, it reached down to the \nlevel of the individual taxpayer. Anyone who had to fill out some of \nthe tax forms that were changed because of the 1997 tax bill knows just \nhow much more complex taxes became because of last year's legislation.\n  Mr. President, I use last year's tax bill as an example only because \nI want to make the point that these problems not only are reason to \nfault that specific legislation, they also, again, undermine our \nability to get anywhere near genuine tax reform. Tax reform inevitably \ncreates winners and losers. But we have a better chance of enacting \nreform if at the time of doing the reform we can increase the number of \nwinners and decrease the number of losers by cutting taxes at the same \ntime that you enact reform. Do not do the complex and all the things \nthat mess it up first and then expect the resources to be available \nwhen we have to do tax reform. We have to link the effort to simplify \nthe Tax Code and give some people tax relief.\n  Simply put, if you could lower taxes while you reformed the code, you \nsure would have a better chance of enacting real reform. Unfortunately, \nwhat last year's tax bill did was commit hundreds of billions of \ndollars that could have gone to help us achieve true tax reform. It \nalso, unfortunately, created several new classes of winners under the \ncurrent system, groups that will benefit from the specific provisions \nin the bill. Why do I say ``unfortunately''? Because these winners, and \nthese winners were only a very few among us--there were far more losers \nthan winners--these few winners now have a bigger stake in the current \ntax system and they will now be less likely to want to give up their \ngains or will again require greater tax cuts to allow us to move to a \nnew system. We keep creating our own inertia against reform by giving \nout more of these tax break goodies. And, as the history of our Tax \nCode has shown, special tax provisions lead to even more special tax \nprovisions.\n\n  So, as we approach what I hope is a real effort to achieve \nsignificant tax reform, and as we consider those tax bills that will \nwork their way to us prior to that larger debate, I hope we will, \nagain, keep three principles in mind: We should use our Tax Code to \npromote equity and fairness, we should resist complexity in the Tax \nCode, and we should insist on fiscal responsibility when we are taking \nactions with respect to the Tax Code. Adhering to these three \nprinciples will not only result in better tax bills, it will also pave \nthe way for truly significant tax reform, tax reform that will move Tax \nFreedom Day back for all American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in response to the statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, might I say, first of all, I \nappreciate very much his constructive involvement in this legislation, \nimproving it and making it a better piece of legislation. The Senator's \nvoice was heard by the Finance Committee on several key points.\n  I would like to give some additional information that my colleague \nprobably already has, so I am being redundant about it, on this issue \nof tax simplification. Today, it is estimated that taxpayers spend \nabout--somewhere, actually, between $70 billion and $100 billion to \ncomply with the Tax Code, $70 to $100 billion a year to comply with the \nTax Code. The IRS budget is about $7 billion, so we spend about $7 \nbillion on the IRS to have them collect our taxes.\n  There is another side to the coin of this complexity. Again, I don't \nwant to revisit this education IRA that just passed on the Senate \nfloor; I don't want to argue that specific objective. But, in order to \nimplement that, the other side of the coin is, the IRS actually becomes \nmore invasive. So a lot of the horror stories that we have heard came \nas a consequence of the IRS insisting that the taxpayer do X, Y, and Z. \nThey are insisting that they do X, Y, and Z because we passed a law \nhere that will require it, a specific one, which is the 64th change in \nthe tax law since 1986--64 times. Last year, after\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997--ask anybody what schedule D looks like \nout there in the country as to capital gains and they will tell you how \ncomplicated and how costly and how difficult it is to comply.\n  On the education piece, the IRS, in order to make certain that the \ntaxpayer is following the law, will have to insist that the taxpayer \nproduce documents, insist the taxpayer produce receipts to be able to \ndemonstrate that the expenditures are going to education-related \npurposes; not only education-related purposes, but purposes that have \nbeen required by the school in which the child is enrolled. It is going \nto be a very difficult set of compliance requirements, A, that the \ntaxpayer is going to have to do, and that the IRS is going to have to \nmake certain the taxpayer has done in order to make certain that they \nqualify for this tax credit. In addition to the cost, anywhere from $70 \nto $100 billion annually the taxpayers spend to comply, in addition to \nthat, there is the other side of the coin, which is the IRS. As a \nconsequence of us using income as a basis of determining what the tax \nis going to be, the IRS has to come out and request the receipts and \nthe documentation and all sorts of other things. That produces the \ninvasive mood that many people on this floor have talked about over and \nover and over as one of the problems with the IRS.\n  So I would just say to the Senator from Wisconsin, he is dead right; \nthe next debate has to be, How do we organize this Tax Code to begin \nwith? I am excited that some of the provisions the Senator has added to \nthis bill will increase the likelihood that this debate will go \nforward. The Taxpayer Advocate that is in title I is going to change \nthe dynamic, because not only are they a Taxpayer Advocate, they are a \nNational Taxpayer Advocate and they will have a tremendous amount of \nindependence. They will be a National Taxpayer Advocate in the State of \nWisconsin, of Nebraska, of Ohio. They will have a separate phone \nnumber, a separate fax; they will not be operated by the IRS, they will \nbe independent. They are told by this law that they are to come back to \nthis Congress and say: ``Here are items that are repetitive problems \nwith the taxpayer, causing us problems every single year, and they are \npart of the law. We recommend you change the law.''\n\n  Second, as the Senator from Wisconsin knows, because he strengthened \nthe provision, the Commissioner of the IRS will be at the table when \ntax laws are written. Unlike the education IRA, unlike the Balanced \nBudget Act last year, where the tax commissioner is silent--the best \ntest of this is, ask yourself, when is the last time you heard an IRS \nCommissioner say, ``Mr. President that's a great tax idea but here's \nwhat it's going to cost the taxpayers to collect''? When is the last \ntime you heard the tax commissioner say, ``Senator Blowhard, that's a \ngreat tax idea, but here is what it's going to cost the taxpayers to \ncomply''?\n  We, under this law, say to the Commissioner, you are empowered to \ntell the American people and to tell us what it is going to cost and \nwe, as well, require, as a result of the simplicity index, some kind of \nevaluation, as we do with regulation, as we do with all regulation--\nsome kind of evaluation to inform the Congress as to the cost to \ncomply.\n  Last, I would say one of the reasons that I felt very strongly about \nhaving an employee representative on this board is that the \nCommissioner is granted, under this legislation, the authority--indeed, \ndirected--to reorganize the IRS along functional lines. I can tell you, \nof all the things in this bill, I would put that in the top five things \nthat I think taxpayers will notice immediately. Today, what you have is \na three-tiered system: National, regional, and district organization. \nIt is very complicated and very difficult for the taxpayer to figure \nout how this organization occurs. Under the new organization, what you \nwill have is taxpayers organized by category: Individual payers, small \nbusiness, large business, and nonprofit, all with special problems, all \nwith different needs. The Commissioner has already said that he intends \nto follow up on some of the suggestions the National Restructuring \nCommission made, which is that it may be that for both the individual \nand especially small business, there will be entire categories where \nthe Commissioner will say: ``The small business community spends $2 \nbillion a year complying with this particular provision of the code. We \ngenerate, with $2 billion worth of cost, nothing. All we have is cost. \nThere is no revenue coming in. We recommend that large categories of \npeople actually be exempt from having to go through all the compliance \nrequirements.''\n  I believe what you will see as a consequence of this is a lot of \nexciting changes being proposed by the Commissioner of the IRS to this \nCongress that will enable the taxpayer, with its individual small \nbusiness, large business, or nonprofit, to say, ``I still may not like \npaying my taxes. I still may think they are too high. But it has gotten \na heck of a lot easier. You have gotten rid of some of the things that \ndon't make any sense at all.'' As a consequence, the customer \nsatisfaction is going to increase.\n  So I applaud the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. His \namendments, his suggestions, his input have improved this bill. And I \nespecially point out that he is right on target, talking about \nsimplification. Not only is there a cost but there is also an invasion \nthat occurs as a consequence of the complexity of the code.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I understand \nare going to be acceptable, but they are being drafted in a manner to \ncomply with the wishes of the committee. I will refer to the two. Then \nI understand that, in due course, the chairman and ranking member will \nbe introducing amendments and mine will go in as one of their en bloc \namendments, but I will have spoken to two of them for just a minute, \nand then for a couple of minutes on the overall bill.\n\n  The first one of my amendments is cosponsored by Senator D'Amato and \nSenator McCain and anybody else who would like to join. I welcome them \ncosponsoring it. The IRS already provides forms and instructions in the \nSpanish language. I commend them for that. Obviously, we are now being \ntold that, while the Hispanic population in America is very large, it \nwill soon be the largest minority by far. And by middle of the next \ncentury, one out of every four Americans will be of Hispanic origin--\nwhich will be the largest by far.\n  This first amendment, that is currently sponsored by Senators D'Amato \nand McCain, would have the telephone help line mandated to provide \ncommunications in Spanish to those who can more easily communicate in \nSpanish.\n  I indicated that we already have forms in Spanish. I am for English-\nplus, in America, which is English--clearly, we should all learn, but I \nthink that instead of talking about English only, we should talk about \nplusing it up with other languages. That would mean that English and \nSpanish would be very much appreciated and used in many parts of the \ncountry as we educate our young people.\n  That is one of the amendments. I understand neither the floor manager \nnor the minority opposes this amendment. Again, I ask if anyone would \nlike to join in cosponsoring that amendment. It is going to be offered \nby the floor manager as one of the en bloc amendments in the not-too-\ndistant future here on the floor.\n  Second, I don't know how many Senators have participated in making \nenough of their own telephone calls these days to find that large \ninstitutions have an automated system when you call.\n  Let's say you want to call, I say to the occupant of the Chair, Sears \nand Roebuck. Understand, it used to be 25 years ago you would call up \nand say, ``I'd like the sporting department.'' They would say, ``Just a \nmoment, sir.'' And the next person answering would be somebody in the \nsporting department.\n  If you made that phone call today, the answering voice would likely \nbe a recording. ``If you want somebody in the merchandising, punch 1. \nIf you want somebody in''--this area-- ``punch 2.'' And when they get \non, they say, ``If you are looking for this department''--or that \ndepartment--``punch 4.''\n  The IRS has a similar system. If you want information on withholding \npress 1; If you want information about filing\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nseparately press two; If you want information about the new child \ncredit press three. Too often, unfortunately, there isn't a number to \npress for the question you want answered. My amendment would correct \nthat problem.\n  I am told as of yesterday in the State of New Mexico, my home State, \nif you are trying to get a voice to respond to you, believe it or not, \nin the State of New Mexico, if you want a voice to answer you at the \nIRS, it now takes 45 minutes for that event to occur. That means you \nare going through telephones one after the other: Punch this one, then \nyou wait and you tell them what you want; punch another one.\n  All this amendment says is, if you are going to have these automated \nlines with press 1, press 2, press 3, you have to have one early on in \nthe numbering system that says, ``Press if you want to speak to a \nperson who can either answer your question or direct you to a person \nwho can.''\n  I think the American people calling the IRS would be thrilled to \ndeath if sooner, rather than later, it did not take you 45 minutes of \ngoing through the press 1, press 3, press 28, and you could press \nsomething that would give you a live IRS person to talk to you. That is \nthe second amendment.\n  It is obvious to me that this bill is telling the IRS how to manage \nthings, but it is pretty obvious that those of us who have constituents \nand go home and ask our office staff what the constituents are saying, \nthey are saying the kind of things that I am telling Senators right now \nreally bug them.\n  They lose hope when they are 35 minutes on the line and haven't \ngotten a person yet, so they hang up. I don't think we want that. That \nisn't good government.\n  I am hopeful that the new management and the person in charge, who is \na manager and businessman, will not see this as trying to micromanage, \nbut sees it is obviously as something they ought to be doing. I don't \nwant to take a chance and not put it in this bill and, in 4 years, when \nwe have oversight, find we are still where we are.\n  These two amendments, in addition to those other provisions crafted \nby the committee make up a good bill. The Committee incorporated a \nnumber of the recommendations that came from our State as I went \nthrough my offices asking what kind of things were not working in \ndealing with the IRS.\n  Having said that, I would like to speak for a few moments on the \nbill.\n  There are more than 168 ways that this bill makes the IRS more \nservice oriented, and taxpayer friendly. It cracks down on abuses \nhighlighted in the hearings. It corrects some problems called to my \nattention by constituents. Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee \nshould be commended for the fine job they did on this bill.\n  Often when we pass legislation, I ask the question: Who cares?\n  I can assure you that this is one piece of legislation that everyone \ncares about. No agency touches more Americans than the IRS. Yet one out \nof two Americans said they would rather be mugged than be audited by \nthe IRS. This bill should reverse that prevailing view.\n  Among the key provisions the bill strives for better management; \nbetter use of technology; reinstatment of a checks and balances system \nso that the IRS will no longer be the judge, jury and excutioner; \ndiscipline for rogue IRS agents; taxpayer protections including the \nright to a speedier resolution of a dispute with the IRS; fundamental \ndue process and a long overdue reorganization. Hopefully, these reforms \nwill change the environment and change the culture at the IRS.\n  The bill prohibits the IRS from contacting taxpayers directly if they \nare represented by a lawyer or an accountant. The IRS called this \npractice of bypassing the tax professional and visiting the taxpayer at \nwork or at dinner ``aggressive collection'' techniques, my constituents \ncalled it harrassment.\n  The bill attempts to make the IRS employees more accountable for \ntheir actions by putting their jobs on the line when they deal \nabusively with taxpayers.\n  The bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if any of the \nfollowing conduct relating to the employees official duties is proven \nin a final administrative or judicial determination:\n  Failure to obtain the required appproval signatures on documents \nauthorizing the seizure of a taxpayer's home, personal belongings, or \nbusiness assets.\n  Falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes made by the \nemployee with respect to a matter involving a taxpayer.\n  Assault or battery on a taxpayer or other IRS employee.\n  Under the bill, the IRS will no longer be allowed to send out tax \nbills with huge penalties compounded with interest and cascading \npenalties just because the IRS was years behind in its work.\n  If the IRS does not provide a notice of additional taxes due (a \ndeficiency) within 1 year after a return is timely filed, then interest \nand penalities will not start to be assessed and compounded until 21 \ndays after demand for payment is made by the IRS. (This excludes \npenalties for failure to file, failure to pay, and fraud) It isn't fair \nfor the IRS to wait years before contacting a taxpayer who honestly \nbelieves he has paid the correct amount, only to deliver to him years \nlater a tax bill with interest and penalites that dwarfs the original \nunderpayment. I had a constituent who was told he owed an additional \ndollar--one dollar--in taxes but owed more than $2,500 in penalties and \ninterest! The IRS agent's response when asked about it was, ``Well, I \nguess we gotch ya good.''\n  Small businesses have been the target of some of the worst abuses. I \nwill always remember the day a good friend, a restaurant owner in New \nMexico called my office, justifiably hysterical. The IRS had just \npadlocked her restaurant! What was she to do? What could I do?\n  This bill codifies the proposition that all men and women, even if \nthey work for the IRS, shall follow fundamental due process \nrequirements. Padlocks and raids should be a last resort under this \nbill.\n  The bill requires the IRS to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days (90 \ndays in the case of life insurance) before the IRS files a notice of \nFederal tax lien, levies, or seizes a taxpayer's property.\n  The bill gives taxpayers 30 days to request a hearing. No collection \nactivity would be allowed until after the hearing.\n  The bill requires IRS to notify taxpayers before the IRS contacts or \nsummons customers, vendors, and neighbors and other third parties.\n  The bill requires the IRS to implement a review process under which \nliens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor, who \nwould review the taxpayer's information, verify that a balance is due, \nand affirm that a lien, levy, or seizure is appropriate under the \ncircumstances.\n  The bill requires the IRS to provide an accounting and receipt to a \ntaxpayer including the amount credited to the taxpayer's account when \nthe IRS seizes and sells the taxpayer's property. It seemed ironic that \nan agency that requires a receipt if a taxpayer is claiming a $5 \nbusiness lunch wouldn't provide a receipt to a taxpyaer when it seized \nand sold all of a taxpayer's earthly belongings.\n  The bill legislates common sense. It prohibits the IRS from seizing a \npersonal residence to satisfy unpaid liabilities less than $5,000, and \nprovides that a principal residence or business property should be \nseized as a last resort.\n  In addition, the bill expands the attorney client privilege to \nacountants and other tax practioners.\n  Under this bill, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive \nhis rights. In particular, the IRS could no longer insist that a \ntaxpayer waive the statute of limitations before the IRS would settle a \ncase. The bill requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with a notice \nof their rights regarding the waiver of the statute of limitations on \nassessment.\n\n  The bill makes it easier for a taxpayer to settle his or her \nliability with the IRS.\n  If the IRS cannot locate the taxpayer's file, the bill prohibits the \nIRS from rejecting the taxpayer's offer-in-compromise based upon doubt \nas to the taxpayer's liability. I have known constitutents who are left \nin an IRS twilight zone because the IRS lost their file. I know of one \nconstitutent who had his file lost five times. Fortunately, he kept a \ncopy of the file himself, and worked next door to a Kinko's copying \ncenter.\n  This bill allows for a prevailing taxpayer to be reimbursed for his \nor her\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\ncosts and attorney's fees if the IRS is found not to be ``substantially \njustified.'' The substantially justified standard in consistent with \nthe little-guy-can-fight-the-federal-government-and-win philosophy. I \nam glad this standard is being expanded, and incorporated into this \nbill. Originally, the notion that a citizen should be able to recoup \nattorney's fees and costs when the federal government was not \nsubstantially justified was a concept in the Equal Access to Justice \nAct which I authored in the early 1980s. It is historically interesting \nto note, and perhaps prophetic, that the IRS lobbyied very hard to be \nexempt from that law. In fact, the IRS was exempt when the bill was \nfirst enacted. When the Equal Access to Justice was reauthorized five \nyears latter, Senator Grassley and I worked to include the IRS. It was \na big fight but Congress prevailed and got the IRS under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act's umbrella. The federal government with its deep \npockets shouldn't be allowed to simply ``outlast'' the average American \ntaxpayer. That isn't what our justice system is about.\n  The bill also clarifies that attorney fees may be recovered in a \ncivil action in which the U.S. is a party for unauthorized browsing or \ndisclosure of taxpayer information. I have heard a lot about this abuse \nboth from constituents and from the witnesses in the Campaign Finance \ninvestigation.\n  If a taxpayer makes an offer to settle his or her tax bill and the \nIRS rejects it and the IRS ultimately obtains a judgment against the \ntaxpayer in the amount equal to, or less than the amount of the \ntaxpayer's statutory offer, the IRS must pay the taxpayer's fees and \ncosts incurred from the date of the statutory offer. I am pleased this \nprovision is included in this bill. The offer and settlement provisions \nare patterned after the Securities Litigation Reform bill which Senator \nDodd and I authored last Congress.\n  I can't believe we have to pass a federal statute to accomplish this \nnext task but apparently we do.\n  The bill requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the \nname, phone number and address of an IRS employee the taxpayer should \ncontact regarding the notice. To the extent practicable and if \nadvantageous to the taxpayer, one IRS employee should be assigned to \nhandle a matter until resolved.\n  In New Mexico, a notice can come from the Albuquerque, Dallas, \nPhoenix, or Ogden IRS center. Taxpayers are often left with no option \nbut to contact my office asking for help in simply identifying who they \nshould talk to at the IRS to settle their tax matter. The caseworkers \nare experts, but it would take them two days to track down the right \nIRS office so that the constituent could try and solve their problem. \nIt was so commonly befuddling to constituents that my caseworkers asked \nthat this identification provision be included in this bill.\n  Movie stars, rock singers and hermits like, and need unlisted phone \nnumbers. The same is not true for federal agencies. The bill also \nrequires the IRS to publish their phone number in the phone book along \nwith the address. We have a beautiful new IRS building in Albuqueruque, \nbut the only phone number for the IRS is the toll free number that is \ntoo frequently busy. If you didn't know the IRS building in Albuquerque \nexisted, you wouldn't find a clue of its location in the telephone \nbook.\n  We experienced a lot of complaints about the IRS toll free numbers. I \nam glad that an amendment that I authored to this bill includes a \nprovision requiring that automated phone lines include the option to \ntalk to a real, knowledgable person who can answer the taxpayers' \nquestions. This would be an option in addition to merely listening to a \nrecorded message.\n  I am pleased that the Senate was willing to accept a Domenici \namendment, cosponsored by Mr. D'Amato and Mr. McCain that requires IRS \nhelplines to include the capability for taxpayers to have their \nquestions answered in Spanish.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a toll free number for taxpayers to \nregister complaints of misconduct by IRS employees and publish the \nnumber.\n  The bill requires the IRS to place a priority on employee training \nand adequately fund employee training programs. The IRS is making \nprogress. The accuracy of the advice that taxpayers received when they \ncalled the IRS was very bad. For example, in 1989, the advice was \ncorrect only 67 percent of the time. The accuracy has fortunately \nimproved. Training is the key.\n  The bill requires the Treasury to make matching grants for the \ndevelopment expansion or continuation of certain low-income taxpayer \nclinics.\n  The bill requires at least one local taxpayer advocate in each state \nwho has the authority to issue ``Taxpayer Assistance Order'' when the \ntaxpayer Advocate believes it is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, many, in fact most, IRS employees work very hard and \ndo a good job. Perhaps the best way to reform the IRS is to reform the \ncode to make it simpler. The doubling from $100 billion to $195 billion \nof the tax gap--the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the \namount actually paid--is evidence that the system is breaking down.\n  The last point I would like to make is that I was going to offer an \namendment to provide for a biennial budget and appropriations cycle \nbecause if Congress took this step, it would give us more time to do \nadequate and more aggressive oversight. If we had biennial budgeting \nthe Finance Committee would have more time to focus on keeping an eye \non the IRS. Senator Moynihan is a distinguished student of history and \nhe told the Senate that the IRS was created in 1862, but it wasn't \nuntil 1997 that the full Finance Committee exercised its oversight \njurisdiction. Other committees could, likewise, exercise better \noversight of all federal agencies if we had biennial budgeting. We \nwould have better run programs and an opportunity for a truly more \nefficient federal government.\n  The Majority Leader has agreed to schedule time for the Senate to \ndebate this bill in the near future. I am pleased that we were able to \nreach that agreement. Thank you Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2369\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the actual knowledge standard of the innocent \n                           spouse provision)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     D'Amato and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2369.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 293, strike lines 3 through 10, and insert:\n       ``(C) Election not valid with respect to certain \n     deficiencies.--If the Secretary demonstrates that an \n     individual making an election under this section had actual \n     knowledge, at the time such individual signed the return, of \n     any item giving rise to a deficiency (or portion thereof) \n     which is not allocable to such individual under subsection \n     (c), such election shall not apply to such deficiency (or \n     portion). This subparagraph shall not apply where the \n     individual with actual knowledge establishes that such \n     individual signed the return under duress.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering, joined \nby our colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein, makes two \nmodifications to the innocent spouse provision which is in this \nlegislation.\n  Background: Under the current tax law, if a husband and wife jointly \nsign a return, they are jointly responsible for any deficiency that \nmight subsequently be found to have been the result of that filing.\n  A typical case is that after a husband and wife have had marital \ndiscord and are divorced, the husband may have left town and is \ndifficult to find, the IRS locates the custodial parent, typically the \nwife, who is more easily accessible, and then she becomes responsible \nfor 100 percent of the tax deficiency that was the result of a filing \nwhile the marriage was in place.\n  Under the current law, there is a provision called ``innocent \nspouse'' in which a spouse can theoretically avoid that responsibility. \nI emphasize the word ``theoretically,'' because the testimony we heard \nbefore the Finance\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nCommittee was that it is virtually impossible for the standards of that \ninnocent spouse provision to be met and that, in fact, there are some \n50,000 women, generally ex-spouses, who are caught up in this 100-\npercent responsibility for a tax return.\n  In the Finance Committee hearings, we were impressed with a \nrecommendation made by the American Bar Association as to a different \napproach to this issue. That approach was essentially an accounting \napproach which said that instead of using joint and several \nresponsibility, it would be an individual responsibility.\n  If, for instance, the husband was responsible for 60 percent of the \nincome, which went into the tax return, and the wife, 40 percent, then \nthose percentages would define responsibility in a subsequent \ndeficiency.\n  That basic approach was adopted by the Finance Committee, but there \nwere some exceptions to that filing for proportional responsibility. \nThe primary exception was that if the Secretary of the Treasury could \ndemonstrate--and the burden is on the Secretary of the Treasury to \ndemonstrate--that an individual making this election to be taxed only \nfor their proportional share of the deficiency of the return, that if \nthey had actual knowledge of the conditions within that return which \nled to this deficiency, then they would be 100 percent responsible. So \nactual knowledge would override the ability to elect only partial \nresponsibility.\n  This amendment makes two modifications to that provision. The first \nis the question of when is that knowledge relevant. The language that \nwe are inserting into the legislation which is currently before the \nSenate is that the actual knowledge has to be ``at the time such \nindividual''--that is, the individual who is seeking to pay only a \nproportionate share of a deficiency-- ``signed the return.'' So the key \nquestion is what did you know at the time you signed the return.\n  The second issue is an unfortunate reality where we had testimony \nthat some spouses signed the joint return, and may even have had actual \nknowledge of its contents, but did so under duress, including under \nphysical duress. So we have provided a second provision which says that \neven if you had actual knowledge at the time you signed the return, \nthat you would not be denied the right to apply for this proportioning \nof responsibility if you, the individual, can establish that the return \nwas signed under duress.\n  The burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish that even though \nthey had actual knowledge of the circumstances in the return that led \nto the deficiency, but still want to secure the benefits of less than \njoint and several responsibility, because they were under duress, \ncoerced into signing, it is their responsibility to carry the burden of \nproof that, in fact, those circumstances existed.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for having taken the time of the Senate, \nbut I thought it was important since this is a very significant part of \nthe provision of taxpayer relief which is in this legislation. And it \nis a fairly expensive provision in terms of the potential for lost \nrevenue. But that expense is one that we believe is a just expense \nbecause it will lift from the responsibility of taxpayers who were \nignorant of circumstances but were entrapped by conditions that were \noften beyond their control and certainly beyond their knowledge and in \nsome cases the result of actual duress and coercion, that we should \nrecognize that and not require them to be responsible for more than \ntheir proportional share of the deficiency.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the joinder in this amendment by \nSenator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein and ask for the amendment's \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nGraham on this very important amendment.\n  Senator Graham and I recently introduced S. 1682, the Innocent Spouse \nTax Relief Act of 1998, to bring long overdue relief to innocent \nspouses, predominately women, who become responsible for the tax \nliabilities of their spouses merely because they happened to sign a \njoint return.\n  I am pleased that the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee \nagrees that the current law innocent spouse provisions are weak at \nbest, and needs dramatic change. I commend him for his leadership in \nmaking that change.\n  There were concerns, and rightly so, that some taxpayers may try to \nabuse the innocent spouse rules by knowingly signing false returns, or \ntransferring assets for the purpose of avoiding the payment of tax, and \nthen claim to be innocent. Obviously, no one would want to open the \ndoor to that type of fraud. As such, language was included in the bill \nthat would prevent an individual from electing the innocent spouse \nprovision if they had ``actual knowledge of any item giving rise to a \ndeficiency.''\n  However, this language raised concern for Senator Graham and myself \nbecause the IRS or the courts could deny relief to an innocent spouse \nsimply because he or she had ``actual knowledge'' after the fact.\n  Our amendment will correct what would have been an unintended \nconsequence. It will clarify that the ``actual knowledge'' standard be \nbased on knowledge of an item at the time the return was signed, and \nthat it was not signed under duress.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and provide relief to \nthe 50,000 innocent spouses each year who are unfairly pursued by the \nIRS.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my distinguished friend from Florida that his \namendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. Accordingly, I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just say, we see this amendment as \nvaluable on this side, as well. And we have no objection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2369) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2370 and 2371, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, they will be considered en \nbloc. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2370 and 2371, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2370 and 2371), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2370\n\n   (Purpose: To require on all IRS telephone helplines an option for \n                  questions to be answered in Spanish)\n\n       On page 381, after line 25, insert:\n       (c) Telephone Helpline Options.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury or the Secretary's delegate shall provide on all \n     telephone helplines of the Internal Revenue Service an option \n     for any taxpayer questions to be answered in Spanish.\n       On page 382, strike lines 1 and 2, and insert:\n       (e) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, this section shall take effect 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Subsection (c).--Subsection (c) shall take effect on \n     January 1, 2000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2371\n\n (Purpose: To require on all IRS telephone helplines an option to talk \n      to a live person in addition to hearing a recorded message)\n\n       On page 382, before line 1, insert:\n       (d) Telephone Helpline Options.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury or the Secretary's delegate shall provide on all \n     telephone helplines of the Internal Revenue Service an option \n     for any taxpayer to talk to a live person in addition to \n     hearing a recorded message.

Mr. President, I point out these two amendments are the \namendments discussed by my good friend,\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nSenator Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, as modified. And these \namendments, as modified, have been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  I urge their adoption.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we, too, on this side, agree to these \namendments, find them useful and constructive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendments, en bloc, are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2370 and 2371) were agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the bill \nbefore us. The Finance Committee bill is a dramatic improvement over \nthe bill that was passed in the other body last year. This legislation \nwill make the IRS far more accountable.\n  I want to take this moment to thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Roth, and thank the ranking member, Senator Moynihan. I also \nthank my colleague, Senator Kerrey, because they have really all \nparticipated in this effort.\n  This is a significant advance. As a former revenue commissioner \nmyself, elected in my home State, I can say, based on my own \nexperience, that these provisions are going to make a positive \ndifference. The bill not only addresses the administrative structure of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, but also makes substantive changes in the \nlaw that will improve taxpayers' rights and protections.\n  The Commissioner of the IRS will get new tools to deal quickly and \nfirmly with misbehavior by IRS personnel. We certainly heard in the \nFinance Committee's hearings of that kind of misbehavior. We want to \nsend a clear and unmistakable signal that those actions and those \nbehaviors are unacceptable and will not be permitted to continue.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers, under the legislation, will receive greater \nprotections, particularly in the areas of innocent spouse relief, \ninterest and penalties, and audit and collection activities. These \nareas, too, as we heard repeatedly in the hearings, are areas that \nrequire improvement. And Congress, too, will share in the increased \naccountability as it will have to assess the complexity of tax law \nchanges before they occur.\n  Under the legislation, the IRS will undergo restructuring. I think we \nall understand that the fundamental obligation of the IRS is to serve \nthe public. And that has been overlooked for too long, at least by \nsome. I think we should also readily acknowledge that the vast majority \nof employees of the IRS are honest, are hard working, and have provided \ngood service. But it is also clear that the Internal Revenue Service is \nnot well structured to meet the requirement to provide the service that \nthe public expects.\n  Overseeing the IRS should not be a game just for Government insiders. \nThat is why the bill mandates an IRS Oversight Board dominated by \nprivate sector representatives.\n  We took a hard look at the offices of the Treasury Inspector General \nand the IRS Chief Inspector--the offices which, under current law, \ncarry out the bulk of IRS oversight activities. We concluded that the \ncurrent arrangement is not working. The Office of the Chief Inspector \ndoes not have the autonomy it needs to perform objective and credible \noversight. The Treasury Inspector General does not devote enough of its \nresources to IRS oversight.\n  Consequently, the bill would establish an independent Inspector \nGeneral within the Treasury Department, which would have as its primary \nresponsibility auditing, investigating, and evaluating IRS programs.\n  When IRS agents step over the line, the Commissioner has to be able \nto respond swiftly and firmly. This legislation will give the IRS \nCommissioner that authority and that power. The bill requires \ntermination for IRS employees who commit gross violations of the law in \nconnection with the performance of their official duties.\n  There are also other provisions--the innocent spouse protections--\nthat I think are a real advance for taxpayers in this country. In our \nrecent hearings, the Finance Committee heard stories from women who \nwere being pursued by the IRS for tax liabilities, often including \nenormous penalties and interest, that arose as a result of the wrongful \nactions of their spouses. These were acts about which the women knew \nnothing. Yet because they were married, they wound up being responsible \nfor bills that they had absolutely no idea were being incurred. The \ncurrent law's test for spousal innocence does not work. It needs to be \nsimplified, and the bill does just that.\n  Interest and penalty reform are also provided for in the legislation. \nIf a taxpayer comes to terms with the IRS to pay his or her taxes under \nan installment agreement, current law can still impose a penalty. This \nmakes no sense. The legislation we are advancing eliminates this \nirrational penalty for any taxpayer who is, in fact, paying taxes under \nan installment agreement.\n  The Finance Committee considered the provision which allows accrual \nof interest and penalties for unpaid taxes even when the taxpayer is \nunaware that there is a tax due. It is only fair that the IRS notify \ntaxpayers promptly whenever it detects a deficiency or an amount due. \nConsequently, the bill provides that accrual of interest will be \nsuspended if the IRS has not sent a notice of deficiency within a year.\n  There are additional audit and collection protections which I think \ntaxpayers around the country, when they become more aware of them, will \napplaud. Taxpayers who need to seek outside guidance to comply with the \ntax laws should not have the Internal Revenue Code influencing their \ndecision as to the type of tax practitioner they employ. The common law \nprivilege of attorney-client confidentiality extends to tax matters \nwhen a taxpayer goes to an attorney for tax assistance. There is no \ncompelling reason why a taxpayer who chooses another option should be \ndeprived of that privilege of confidentiality. This bill addresses that \nquestion.\n  The bill would also strengthen the IRS's approval process for liens, \nlevies, and seizures by requiring every such action to be approved by \nan agent's supervisor, and only after careful review that verifies the \namount of the balance due and the appropriateness of the proposed \nenforcement action.\n  We also know of taxpayers who had their business assets--and in some \nextreme cases, even their homes--seized, to satisfy relatively small \ntax liabilities. These types of seizures can have a significant impact \nnot only on the taxpayer, but on his or her family and on a business' \nemployees and customers. So steps have been taken in this legislation \nto prevent those abuses. The IRS must exhaust all other payment options \nbefore seizing either a taxpayer's principal residence or business.\n  The legislation also provides for fuller disclosures to taxpayers. \nThe tax return, obviously, is one of the most important legal documents \nan individual ever has to sign. Doing so establishes a variety of \nrights and responsibilities that affect the behavior of the taxpayer \ntowards the IRS, and vice versa. Too often the taxpayers are at a \ndisadvantage when it comes to knowing about these rights and \nresponsibilities. As a result, this legislation imposes a number of new \nrequirements on the IRS.\n\n  First, the IRS must alert married taxpayers to the ramifications of \nsigning and filing a joint return. Second, the IRS must let taxpayers \nknow that they are entitled to be represented, and to have that \nrepresentative present, when the IRS wants to conduct an interview with \nthe taxpayer. Third, the IRS must let taxpayers know that, when they \nreceive a letter of proposed deficiency, they can request a review of \nthat action in the IRS Office of Appeals.\n  These are fairminded changes to give taxpayers a fair hearing and a \nfair process. I think these will be welcome changes as we move forward.\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  Now, there is also the question of congressional responsibility, \nbecause, very frankly, we here in Congress are responsible for the \ncomplexity of the Tax Code itself. Without question, the single most \npersistent complaint about tax law that I receive is that the tax laws \nare too complex.\n  One reason I am in the U.S. Senate is that, when I was tax \ncommissioner of the State of North Dakota, I adopted a dramatically \nsimplified tax system for our State. I instituted a postcard return. \nYou could just take a percentage of the Federal liability and pay that \nto the State of North Dakota and not have to have a separate tax return \nat all. That was well received by the people of North Dakota. It saved \nliterally hundreds of thousands of hours of tax preparation time and \ngave us a dramatically simplified tax system. We should strive for that \nmagnitude of simplification nationally. We have that opportunity.\n  At the very least, we ought to make clear that the Congress has a \nresponsibility to simplify this tax system. We all understand that we \nlive in a complicated economy, and that creates complicated tax \nsituations for more and more taxpayers. This means that any tax system, \nbased on income, is going to have a certain amount of irreducible \ncomplexity. But all too often, we in Congress have changed the Internal \nRevenue Code without even taking the complexity question into \nconsideration.\n  Consequently, the bill would, for the first time, require a formal \nanalysis of the complexity issues related to pending tax legislation. \nNot only will this analysis be an important tool for members of the \ntax-writing committees, but its presence on the public record will \nheighten awareness of pending tax law changes and their possible future \nconsequences.\n  There are other important provisions that are in this legislation. I \nwill not enumerate them all here this afternoon. Suffice it to say, I \nbelieve the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, has done a good \njob of taking initial steps to dramatically reform the Internal Revenue \nService. We are going to restructure it. We are going to provide new \nprotections to taxpayers so that they are more fairly treated. We are \ngoing to remind the Internal Revenue Service that they have an \naffirmative obligation to treat our taxpayers with respect.\n  Again, I want to conclude by saying the vast majority of people at \nthe IRS are responsible, honest, decent and hard working. But we have \nsome problems there that very clearly need to be addressed. We need to \nsay loudly and clearly that we simply will not accept any mistreatment \nor abuse of America's taxpayers. That is unacceptable. It will not be \npermitted to continue. This legislation is an excellent first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to withdraw an amendment that I had \non this bill, but I want to make a short statement. Although this \namendment will be ruled as not relevant to this piece of legislation, \nit is very relevant to the field of agriculture.\n  I have submitted S. 1879, which would make income averaging for \nfarmers permanent in the Tax Code.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment to the Revenue Reconciliation Act \nof 1997 which extended to farmers the ability to average their income \nover a 3-year period. That amendment was included and made part of the \nU.S. Tax Code, but only after further negotiations will we have to \nextend it beyond 2001 because it sunsets in the year 2001.\n  I don't think many of my colleagues really understand what is going \non in agriculture today. There are a few. If there is one way we can \naffect change regarding farm income, it would be through how we treat \nit regarding taxes. We will consider the agriculture research, and we \nwill consider crop insurance later on this month. It is really in the \nbest interest of this Government to pass that piece of legislation so \nthat it is enforced with this year's crop. It won't be long until we \nare coming into harvest time.\n  This business of farming and ranching is difficult at best; we know \nthat. There are no monthly checks. There is not much reward in the \nfinancial field for those who participate in it. And it is not getting \nany easier. Today we are seeing more and more family farms fade from \nthe landscape of middle-income America, where this country has been. \nCorporate farms become more and more of a factor every day. Those of us \nwho grew up in the farming communities understand the frustrations of \nthe business. Of course, we are trying to do something right now at a \ntime when just about all parts of agriculture, if you are in the \nbusiness of producing a raw product, are in trouble. We cannot make it \nselling our farm commodities below what they were selling for in 1948 \nand still expect to provide the abundance of food that we provide for \nthis country.\n  I will make one point. It is hard for me to understand, and it is \nhard for our farmers to understand why if you go into a grocery store \nand you look down and find out you are paying $2.75 for a pound of \nWheaties, and we can't get $2.75 for a 60-pound bushel of wheat. \nAmerica must understand that. And if this is allowed to happen, there \nwill be no wheat, because it will just be beyond the cost of production \nto produce it.\n  Market forces are funny. Right now, we have a situation in the \nPacific rim where you have four, maybe five economies that are in \ndesperate trouble and could not buy even if they wanted to. When you \nlive in a State where the biggest share of your production goes to the \nPacific rim, that means we are in big trouble.\n  Last fall, we had the fiasco in the rail business in Houston. A lot \nof grain didn't get moved, or they took advantage of a higher market \nthat cost us a lot of money--out of the control of the farmers. Yet, \nthey are the ones that pay the costs.\n  So we are going to consider this. And I hope that this will be made \npart of the permanent law of the Tax Code. I would like to get some \nkind of commitment from this committee and the Finance Committee that \nit will be considered because it is very, very important. We had income \naveraging at one time, and we lost it in 1986.\n  The bill, last year, received overwhelming support in the U.S. \nSenate, and I understand that it will be ruled irrelevant now by the \nParliamentarian, so I plan to withdraw the amendment. Before I do, I \nwant to emphasize to this body that we have a situation not only in the \ngrain industry, but the livestock industry, and it is in areas where \nthe producer has little or no control. They are at the end of the line. \nThey sell wholesale, they buy retail, they pay the transportation and \nthe taxes both ways. We have to do something in the middle to at least \ngive them some relief.\n\n  This bill has very little impact on our Federal budget. The American \npeople would look at this as an insurance policy. We must pay to insure \nour cars or our lives. How much would you pay to ensure that the \ngrocery store is full every time you go there? There are a lot of us \nthat know about the front end of the grocery store; very few of us know \nanything about the back end. So I think America has a stake in this--\nall the citizens that live in this country.\n  I will agree to withdraw the amendment, but I want to reaffirm my \ncommitment to the American farmer that this Congress will act, and this \nwill become a permanent part of the Tax Code before we end the 105th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be \nwithdrawn from consideration. I thank the managers of the bill and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nMack offers his amendment, there be 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided for \ndebate on the amendment; further, that at expiration or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Mack \namendment, and no amendments are in order.\n  I further ask as part of the unanimous consent request that Senator \nMack be permitted to offer his amendment upon the conclusion of the \nstatement of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the Senator\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nfrom Florida for allowing me a few moments to make a statement.\n  I wish to begin by indicating my support for this bill. I believe it \nwill be very helpful to every taxpayer throughout the Nation. I am very \nhappy to support the bill, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4468-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4477-S4478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A CRUCIAL MOMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate \nbecause I was very concerned in reading this morning's newspaper about \ncriticism of the administration in the Middle East peace process. As a \nstrong supporter of Israel and its security, I want to take this \nopportunity to commend President Clinton and Secretary Albright for \ntheir current effort to preserve the peace process.\n  About a month ago, 81 Senators sent a letter to the President of the \nUnited States in which they expressed concern about the negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians. They, in effect, were concerned \nabout a proposal for land redeployment going public, about security \ncooperation, and final status talks.\n  I was not one of those 81 Senators. In fact, a few days later, I sent \na letter of my own expressing my support for the current course. In \nthat letter, I mentioned that I have great faith in what the \nadministration is doing, and I still believe that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: At a time of considerable urgency in \n     the Middle East peace process, I write to express my support \n     for your ongoing efforts to help achieve a diplomatic \n     resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The success of these \n     efforts is crucial to the fulfillment of the United States' \n     commitments to ensure Israel's security, to enhance regional \n     stability, and to protect U.S. strategic interests in the \n     Middle East.\n       Progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track is clearly the \n     most urgent need. The stalemate that has defined these talks \n     for the past year poses great dangers for all sides. Your \n     approach to moving this process forward has included a \n     healthy combination of urging the parties to uphold their \n     commitments, discouraging unilateral acts that undermine \n     confidence, facilitating ongoing contacts and negotiations, \n     helping each side understand the other's needs, and \n     presenting ideas intended to help bridge gaps between the \n     parties.\n       As you and Secretary of State Albright have repeatedly \n     stressed, an all-out Palestinian effort to combat terrorism, \n     and the full commitment of both sides to Israeli-Palestinian \n     security cooperation, are absolutely essential for further \n     progress to occur. Without these, the region could easily \n     descend into violence, ending the chances for a peace \n     settlement in the foreseeable future.\n       In addition, you have consistently urged the parties to \n     approach their negotiations with a sense of realism and \n     restraint, while understanding the needs of the other side, \n     and avoiding unilateral steps that call into question the \n     parties' commitment to achieving a settlement.\n       While you understand that U.S. diplomacy may be essential \n     to bridge some of the gaps between the two sides, you have \n     remained keenly aware that only the parties themselves can \n     make the difficult, but necessary, decisions required to move \n     toward a final agreement. We cannot do this for them.\n       America's longstanding and unshakeable commitment to \n     Israel's security, which you have faithfully upheld, is fully \n     consistent with your efforts to move the peace process toward \n     a successful outcome. Without a peaceful permanent resolution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's security--which \n     is undoubtedly a vital U.S. interest--can never be \n     guaranteed.\n       I have great faith in your Administration's efforts to move \n     the peace process forward without undue micromanagement from \n     Congress. I believe that you, Secretary Albright, Special \n     Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, and Assistant Secretary \n     of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk have great \n     ability and credibility in this effort. As you continue to \n     pursue this vital mission, you will continue to have my \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in view of the attacks leveled against \nthe administration's efforts by leaders of the other body, I felt it \nnecessary to come to the floor today to respond. As a concerned \nAmerican, who cares deeply for the State of Israel, its future and its \nsecurity--as I think my statement in the Record on Israel's 50th \nanniversary will reflect--and as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, and the relevant subcommittee for the past 4 \nyears, I have watched these negotiations go up and down.\n\n  What I have never forgotten is the importance of Israel's survival as \na Jewish, democratic state with safe and secure borders. I have never \nforgotten a meeting I had with Yitzhak Rabin in the mid-1980s, when I \nwas the Mayor of San Francisco and he was Israel's Minister of Defense. \nHe explained to me how the demographics of Israel and the West Bank and \nGaza showed that, over time, the Jewish majority in these areas would \nbe eroded.\n  He showed me even then, as we stepped out on the Knesset balcony and \nlooked out and saw how close Jordan really is to the capital, how \nIsrael could return some land, which accomplished the goal of \npreserving Israel's security from a military and strategic view while \nalso preserving a strong Jewish majority. I have never forgotten that. \nThat is the reason why success in this peace process is so important--\nbecause peace is the ultimate guarantor of Israel's security.\n  No one ever thought it would be easy to achieve peace between Israel \nand the Palestinians. If it were easy, peace would have already been \nachieved. It is almost 20 years now since the end of the Camp David \naccords. But criticizing the administration at this particular point in \ntime, I strongly believe, is counterproductive. In many cases these \ncriticisms are driven by politics--not by the urgent desire for peace \nand Israel's security. And I find that deeply troubling.\n  It is a responsibility of the executive branch to conduct these \nnegotiations, not the Congress. That is provided for in the United \nStates Constitution. So, in my view, it would be prudent for all of us \nwho care about Israel and the search for peace to give these \nnegotiations a chance to succeed before rushing to criticize.\n  There is no more knowledgeable or respected negotiator that I know of \nthan Ambassador Dennis Ross, who is leading the American effort. The \nState Department has an institutional knowledge of these talks going \nback 20 years--all the way to the Camp David Accords--which deserves a \ncertain amount of respect as well. And President Clinton's own \ncommitment to Israel and its security cannot seriously be called into \nquestion.\n  For months now, the President has been urged--by many of the same \npeople who are now criticizing him--to put forth a strong effort to \nrescue what has been a crumbling peace process.\n  In that time, the Secretary of State and the Middle East peace team \nhave shuttled back and forth to the Middle East trying to find a \nformula that would advance the talks. President Clinton has been \npersonally engaged in the details of these talks, and has met on \nseveral occasions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Arafat, and \nother regional leaders.\n  After months with no progress, the issues that divide the two sides \nhave crystallized into a clear few dominant issues. So our negotiators \nhave tried to help the two sides identify possible solutions that would \nallow them to move on to the next stage of the talks.\n  Like any mediator, having reached this point, the United States now \nfaces two choices: Either identify the terms it feels the parties can \nmove ahead on, or walk away from the talks. Frankly, I would expect \nthem to be criticized whatever they would do.\n  But what the President and Secretary Albright are doing is not trying \nto impose a solution on either side--they are simply trying to create \nthe conditions that allow for progress by proposing the ideas they \nbelieve can bridge the gaps between the two sides. Ultimately, only the \nparties themselves can decide if these ideas are acceptable.\n  To the best of my knowledge, the terms being discussed are quite \nfavorable to Israel: The Palestinians originally sought Israeli \nredeployment from 30 percent of the West Bank, and Israel offered 8 \npercent. On the table now is 13 percent, which many security officials\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nmaintain could isolate two or three settlements, but would not \njeopardize Israel's security.\n  In addition, the current proposal would result in final status talks \nbeginning immediately, and tough requirements on Palestinian security \ncooperation--both of which Prime Minister Netanyahu has been seeking \nfor many months.\n  And the Administration is still working hard to address Israel's \nconcerns. Ambassador Ross, who just arrived back from London last \nnight, is flying out to Israel tonight for further talks.\n  President Clinton made clear what he is trying to do yesterday in a \npress conference. He said:\n\n       I have tried to find a way actually to do what [Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu] suggested. I have done my best for a year \n     now to find the formula that would unlock the differences \n     between them to get them into those final status talks. \n     That's all I am trying to do. There is no way in the world \n     that I could impose an agreement on them or dictate their \n     security to them even if I wished to, which I don't.\n\n  If the current peace process fails, the deadlock will likely lead to \nunilateral acts by both sides, an escalation of violence, the further \nunraveling of Israel's relations with its neighbors. If the United \nStates is committed to Israel's security, we cannot allow that to \nhappen.\n  So I want to express my support for the Administration's efforts. I \nthink they are principled, worthy efforts, and are the best hope at the \nmoment of saving the peace process from disaster. They are also \ngrounded in a deep commitment to Israel's security.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to please give these talks a chance to \nsucceed, to please refrain from attempts to micromanage the \nAdministration's conduct of these negotiations, and to please recognize \nthat Israel's security depends on their success.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 minutes to \nspeak as if in morning business and then to proceed to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it was not my intention, frankly, to speak \non the issue of Israel. But Senator Feinstein and I have a difference \nof opinion on this, and I feel compelled, frankly, to make a comment.\n  I strongly believe the administration has made a major mistake in \npublicly tabling and publicly pressuring the Government of Israel in \nthis particular set of circumstances. The administration knew at the \ntime that the plan that was being proposed would be accepted by Arafat \nand rejected by Prime Minister Netanyahu. I, again, think it is \nfundamentally wrong for one democracy to try to impose on another \ndemocracy what it should be doing. The people of Israel have chosen its \ngovernment. They have chosen this government based on what they \nperceive to be their No. 1 priority, which is security, and that \ngovernment should not be pressured by the ally, the United States. It \nis fundamentally wrong. And I personally believe that to do that could \nend up with a forced agreement, which, in fact, would be a false peace. \nThat would endanger the Middle East.\n  Again, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express those \nfeelings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4477-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4478-S4485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the Secretary of the Treasury from the Internal \n                    Revenue Service Oversight Board)\n\n  Mr. MACK.

I thank the Chair.\n  Last week, thanks to the leadership of Finance Committee Chairman \nRoth, Congress resumed the first meaningful IRS oversight hearings we \nhave conducted in decades. The testimony we heard reinforced the \nimpression of a rogue agency that is literally out of control. As was \nthe case when the oversight hearings began in September, some of what \nwe heard was shocking, much of it was saddening, and all of it was \nangering. Witnesses testified to incidents of IRS abuse and of blatant \nmisuse of IRS power that are simply unacceptable.\n  I recall in particular the story of one taxpayer who could not be at \nthe hearings in person but was represented by his former attorney. The \nreason the taxpayer could not attend was that he was literally hounded \nto death by the IRS. The 61-year-old taxpayer had been suffering from \nsevere health problems. He had heart disease and was weakened by \ncancer. The IRS revenue officer assigned to his case was informed that \nthe taxpayer could not physically withstand stressful situations but, \nwith the support of his supervisor and the chief of collections, \npersisted in aggressive and intimidating tactics.\n  I want to make this clear now about the IRS being well aware of the \nhealth conditions of the taxpayer. They had a letter, I believe, from \nthe physician that was sent to them informing them of the condition of \nthe taxpayer, and yet they persisted in aggressive and intimidating \ntactics. The IRS, disregarding this humanitarian appeal, sent the \ntaxpayer a notice of intent to levy.\n  By the way, let me back up for a moment as well. Notice I talked \nabout that taxpayer going to his attorney. The request on the part of \nthe attorney was that further contacts in this case be with the \nattorney, not the taxpayer, again because of the health condition. They \ntotally ignored that request. And so 2 days after this levy, the man \ndied from a heart attack.\n  This story highlights, perhaps better than any other we heard, the \nfundamental and disgraceful problems at the IRS, an agency which never \nseems to consider the interests and perspective of the taxpayer. This \nattitude is entirely unacceptable and cannot be tolerated. The IRS \nCriminal Investigations Division has apparently learned from the FBI \nand the DEA criminal investigative techniques that are appropriate for \ndealing with violent and dangerous criminals and now uses these in \nroutine criminal tax investigations of taxpayers who are neither \ndangerous nor violent. Taxpayers have had their businesses raided by \narmed agents, their lives turned upside down, and their reputations \nruined.\n  In listening to hours of compelling testimony, members of the Finance \nCommittee could not help but wonder how in the world could such things \nbe happening. Why would the IRS send 10 special agents to a woman's \nhome at 7:30 in the morning to serve a search warrant and spend 8 hours \nin her home not to search for drugs or illegal contraband but, instead, \nso that a furniture appraiser could value items from her grandmother's \nestate? Who could have approved such a blatantly intrusive act? Why \nwould the IRS send 64 agents to raid a man's family business with 35 \nemployees at the home office? The taxpayer was not a violent or \ndangerous criminal. What purpose could be served by the use of 64 \nagents in this raid other than to intimidate and oppress the taxpayer?\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\n  The villains of the horror stories that were presented to the Finance \nCommittee last week were not just frontline, low-level employees of the \nIRS. None of these abuses could have taken place without either the \napproval of management or of failure in supervision. Last week's \nhearings exposed a corrupt culture permeating IRS management which will \nrequire a major housecleaning at the Service.\n  The current oversight of the Service is just not working. The \nTreasury inspector general has the power to investigate IRS operations, \nbut we learned last week that the inspector general is being ignored by \nthe IRS. The inspector general investigated and substantiated \nallegations of travel fraud, abuse of subordinates, sexual harassment, \nfraudulent performance appraisals, and others to cover up illegal \nactions, all against IRS executives. Yet in each and every one of these \ncases the report from the inspector general was sent to the Deputy \nCommissioner's desk and no disciplinary action was taken. In other \ncases, the IRS has hindered oversight by keeping information from the \ninspector general.\n  Now, this particular problem of inspector general oversight is \naddressed in the IRS reform bill that we have before us through the \ncreation of a new inspector general for tax administration. But the \nproblem underscores the corrupt culture at the IRS, a culture in which \nthe decent, honest IRS employees who report abuses of their coworkers \nreceive not thanks but retaliation.\n  At the IRS, an individual who sexually harasses his subordinates can \nend up being the National Director of Equal Employment Opportunity. At \nthe IRS, midlevel managers can decide to close the audits of major \ncorporations and determine that no extra taxes are owed even when the \ncorporation concedes that it owes more taxes. At the IRS, a renegade \nspecial agent with a drinking and substance abuse problem can \nfabricate allegations of political corruption and be protected rather \nthan punished by his supervisors.\n\n  This culture must change, and it is not happening. We heard last week \nthat some IRS managers have been bragging that they have no regard for \nthe Finance Committee's oversight hearings and that they intend to go \nback to business as usual once the spotlight is off. Even after we \nexposed the illegal use of enforcement statistics to evaluate IRS \nemployees and offices, it seems that the southern region is still \nranking their district offices based on property seizures.\n  Many IRS bureaucrats appear to have concluded that we are not serious \nabout oversight and that we are not serious about reform. We in the \nCongress must prove them wrong and send a strong message to the IRS and \nto the taxpayer that business as usual will not be tolerated.\n  Since our hearings last September exposed numerous instances of \ntaxpayer abuse, it seems that not one person has been fired at the IRS. \nIt is my hope that the provisions in the IRS reform bill that require \nthe termination of employees who commit certain acts such as taxpayer \nabuse will help correct this problem.\n  Commissioner Rossotti has made a number of positive moves since \ntaking office. He has ordered an independent review of the IRS \nInspection Service, and now he has enlisted Judge William Webster for a \nmuch needed review of the Criminal Investigations Division. In order to \nchange the corrupt culture at the IRS, it is necessary that outside \npeople with a perspective different from that of the IRS bureaucracy be \ngiven a prominent role.\n  It is for this reason that I have offered this amendment. My \namendment, cosponsored by Senator Faircloth and Senator Murkowski, \nwould move us closer to Chairman Roth's vision of a private sector \noversight board by removing the Secretary of the Treasury from this \nboard.\n  The purpose of the oversight board is to reform the IRS from the \noutside. The board will be composed of people from the private sector, \npeople with management and information systems expertise, people who \nstill have the interest of the taxpayer in mind. To change the culture \nof the IRS, we need to replace the law enforcement mentality with a \ncustomer service mentality. The independent oversight board will play a \nvital role in changing this culture. There is no place on such a board \nfor a Government official, such as the Secretary of the Treasury. The \nboard must be the voice of the taxpayer, not the voice of the status \nquo. For this new board to have any credibility with the public, it \nmust not be under the influence of the Cabinet Member who already has \nresponsibility for the agency.\n  We must prove that we are serious about reform of the IRS. Making the \noversight board a private sector check on the IRS is essential for \nreform. Otherwise, it is just Washington business as usual with another \nWashington-controlled commission. That is not what we need. We need an \noversight board of the taxpayers, by the taxpayers, and for the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear, because I realize that in \nthese kinds of situations the impression could be drawn that I am \nfocusing my concerns personally at the Secretary of the IRS. That is \nnot the point at all. The Secretary of the Treasury is, frankly, \nreflecting the views of the bureaucracy. I find it troubling that we \nwould have changed the legislation from the markup document that we \nbegan with, which Senator Roth proposed, which did not include members \nother than private sector individuals. Again, I want to stress this \npoint. This is not directed personally at the Secretary of the \nTreasury, but it is a response in essence to an attempt by the \nbureaucracy to protect itself.\n  Here is what the Secretary has said in the past with respect to this \nissue. In the Cincinnati Inquirer, on September 17, 1997, Secretary \nRubin said:\n\n       The fact that the agency was being run by private sector \n     individuals would almost surely have what lawyers call a \n     chilling effect on IRS employees and influence audit policy, \n     enforcement policy, and the like.\n\n  You bet it would. I think that is exactly the reason we had called \nfor a board in which there were only private sector representatives on \nthat oversight board.\n  The ultimate concern that I have here is that if we are going to make \na change, it should not be business as usual. It should not be a \ncommission dominated by Washington insiders. Why do I say it would be \ndominated when this is a board that would be, under its present \norganization, nine members, six from the private sector, three not? The \nsix private sector members, as I recall, are part-time members of this \ncommission, this oversight board. When you add the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Commissioner of the IRS, and a representative of the \nemployees at IRS, what you have done is totally changed the makeup in \nthis sense. There are huge bureaucracies that the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the other members from Government can call on who will \ndominate, in my opinion, the six individuals who are serving from the \nprivate sector on a part-time basis with very limited staffs.\n  I want to conclude my comments by saying to those Members of the \nSenate who participated in hearings, not just in the Senate but also in \nthe process outside the committee, in no way do I try to lessen the \nsignificance of the work that you have done. But this is not an issue \nof what we hear at hearings. This is an issue of how Washington works \nand how the bureaucracy will do whatever is necessary in order to \nprotect itself. And to put the Secretary of the Treasury and a \nrepresentative of the employees on this board is just business as \nusual, Washington protecting itself.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend from \nFlorida relative to this particular issue concerning the IRS evaluation \nand the oversight board, in particular the position of the Secretary on \nthis board.\n  First of all, in this amendment that my friend from Florida has \nproposed, we would give the IRS Advisory and Oversight Board a far \ngreater capacity to exercise its oversight and advisory functions, \nensuring taxpayers are treated fairly. That is the object of this \nentire exercise.\n  Our friends on the Finance Committee, and I am a member of that \ncommittee, as we discussed in the makeup of the nine-member board, we \nreflected on the debate yesterday where the Senate rejected the idea of \nmaking the board a full-time board consisting exclusively of private \ncitizens. However,\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nin my view, this board will have a very, very hard time fulfilling its \noversight and advisory functions because, I think, as does the Senator \nfrom Florida, that its composition is basically unbalanced.\n  First of all, let's examine the board. We have six private sector \nmembers to be selected based on their expertise in such areas as \nmanagement, customer service, information technology, and, most \nimportant, the needs and concerns of the taxpayer. If those were the \nonly members of the board, the board would be basically free to take an \nunbiased and objective view of how to improve the operations of this \nagency, with the goal of ensuring the proper treatment of the American \ntaxpayer and the efficient and courteous delivery of services.\n  But let's look at it realistically. Unfortunately, the board is not \nmade up that way. As the board has emerged, it will likely be dominated \nby three additional people who are required to be members. First of \nall, we have added the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner. A \nrepresentative of the employees of the IRS is the second member. And \nthird, the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Does anyone in this body really believe that this board, consisting \nof three of the most important people--these are policy people--most \nimportant people involved in the operation of the IRS, will be free to \nexercise real oversight of the IRS? Why do we even need an advisory \nboard to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nCommissioner of the IRS when these two individuals already serve on the \nboard? What kind of advisory group are we talking about here? You have \ninsiders on the advisory group. These insiders are very powerful--the \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, a union employee \nrepresentative of the Internal Revenue Service, and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. So where is the objectivity? These people will control \nthe direction and policy of this board. So where does this advisory \nboard stand independently? It does not. That is the fallacy in the \nmakeup. That is why I encourage my colleagues to consider the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Florida, which I wholeheartedly support.\n\n  We have heard the horror stories of taxpayer abuse described in the \nFinance Committee last September and at last week's hearings. Mind you, \nMr. President, this occurred on the watch of the Treasury Secretaries \nappointed by both Republican and Democratic Presidents. What kind of \noversight did these Treasury Secretaries perform on the IRS during \ntheir tenure in office? It appears there was very little, if any, \noversight. Why? We would like to think because we don't have an \nindependent board. But, if you put the insiders on the board, you don't \nhave objectivity. If we allow the Secretary of the Treasury to \nparticipate on this board, along with the IRS Commissioner, I fear we \nwill have business as usual in the IRS. That is what the Finance \nCommittee attempted to address: no longer business as usual.\n  I assume many of my colleagues are out there now making their sound \nbites, appealing to the folks back home that this is a major step \nforward, this legislation, in making the IRS accountable. But it is \nnot. It is business as usual. You have the same insiders, only this \ntime they are on the board that is supposed to oversee the IRS.\n  Mr. President, let's stop kidding ourselves around here. The \nSecretary has a staff of thousands of people. They can provide him with \nany number of reasons to dissuade the board from recommending and \nimplementing significant changes to the Internal Revenue Service. The \nSecretary and the IRS Commissioner work together. They have to. They \nwork together on a regular basis and will form a powerful team that \ncould prevent real and meaningful changes at the IRS.\n  I have seen it in my own business career, where people of knowledge \nand responsibility who are insiders direct the activities of an \nobjective group of outsiders simply because they have the power and \ninfluence of their position. This board should have as its No. 1 goal \nfinding ways to improve services by the Internal Revenue Service to the \nAmerican taxpayer. If the Treasury Secretary who oversees the IRS is on \nthis board, I fear the interests of the bureaucracy--and I noted my \nfriend from Florida mentioned time and again in his presentation \n``don't underestimate business as usual''--and the power of the \nbureaucracy. And, don't kid yourself, it is in the Internal Revenue \nService as well.\n  So I fear the interests of the bureaucracy and the Government are \nsimply going to be put ahead of the interests of the taxpayers because \nit has always been that way in the past. It is inherent in the nature \nof his high position and his large and sophisticated staff that the \nSecretary of the Treasury will dominate this board and the interests of \nthe taxpayer will not be adequately represented.\n  I have the utmost respect and admiration for the Treasury Secretary, \nBob Rubin. He has done, and is doing, an admirable job as Secretary of \nthe Treasury. I differed with him on the Mexican bailout, but he proved \nto be right. He has done, and is doing, an admirable job as Secretary \nof the Treasury. My support for this amendment has nothing to do with \nMr. Rubin, in the interests of full disclosure. But it is my concern \nthat the official in charge of Treasury and the IRS operations cannot \nbring an objective view to oversight of his own operations. I urge the \nadoption of the Mack amendment.\n  Finally, I have been in the business community for 25 years. Many of \nmy colleagues here have not. I can tell you how it works in that kind \nof environment, where you have insiders with positions of influence, \nnot that they are not well meaning, but it is the very nature of the \nbeast that you lose the objectivity that you are going to have if you \nhave this board set up without considering the implications of the \ninfluence of the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider the merits of this amendment \nand act accordingly. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have very much appreciated listening to \nthe arguments for this amendment. However, I think it is important for \nus to step back a little bit and look at this issue a little more \nbroadly. The first point I would make is to remind my colleagues that \nthe IRS Restructuring Commission recommended that the Treasury \nSecretary serve on the Board, as well as recommend there be a \nrepresentative of an employee organization.\n  The Restructuring Commission spent a lot of time thinking about this. \nThis is not something they willy-nilly recommended to the Congress. \nJust as we in the Senate voted to honor the Restructuring Commission's \ninclusion of a representative of an employee organization, I submit it \nmakes sense for us to honor the Restructuring Commission's \nrecommendations to continue to include the Treasury Secretary. The \nRestructuring Commission spent a lot of time thinking about this, and \nthey did conclude that the Treasury Secretary should be a member of the \nBoard.\n  Why did they do that? I think for a number of reasons. First, the \nTreasury Secretary has responsibility for the IRS. After all, that is a \nlarge part of his job. In fact, 80 percent of Treasury's resources and \npeople are in the IRS--over 100,000 employees.\n  Second, there is an analogy with corporations. Corporate boards \ninclude chairmen. Corporate boards include CEOs. Why do they do so? \nBecause they want communication between the governing board on the one \nhand, and the operation management on the other. You have to have \ndirect communication; you have to have guidance. If the Treasury \nSecretary is not on the Board, that certainly diminishes communication \nbetween the Board and the Treasury Secretary. It is just obvious and \nalso does something else which is the exact opposite of what we are \ntrying to do here. It tends to create an adversarial relationship \nbetween the Treasury Secretary and the Board.\n  The analogy which someone alluded to earlier of having `the fox guard \nthe chicken coop' to have the Treasury Secretary on the Board, is \ntotally inapplicable. Why? Simply because the other board members, the \nsix private board members, are going to be pretty strong-willed people \nif they are going to agree to serve on this Board. Any President who \nwants to make IRS restructuring work is going to get pretty\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nstrong people. These are not people who are going to roll over willy-\nnilly at the insistence of the Treasury Secretary.\n  First of all, they don't work for the Treasury Secretary. These are \nprivate sector people. The only working relationships between the \nSecretary and Board members is with the Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, and \nin some indirect way, the employees representative. There are six \nprivate sector people on the Board who are going to be strong-willed, \nstrong-minded people. They are not going to roll over and play dead.\n  In addition, the Treasury Secretary is going to want to be a two-way \nmessenger, both to and from the Board, to the President's Cabinet, to \nthe President himself. If we want IRS restructuring to work, we want \nhim to participate in the Board's deliberations. He will be able to \nshare information with the other members of the Board that they might \nnot otherwise know about, and that no one else would know. At the same \ntime, he would learn things about the IRS by serving on the Board that \nhe might not otherwise discover.\n  Another way to see that we have ensured independence of the Board is \nthat each of the six private sector members is subject to the \nconfirmation process in the Senate. When we are talking to these \nnominees as they go before our committees in the Senate, we have ample \nopportunity to insist upon the independence of these board members. We \nhave ample opportunity for commitment from these nominees. They are not \ngoing to kowtow to any Secretary.\n  To sum up, Mr. President, the Restructuring Commission recommended \nthe Treasury Secretary. It makes sense to keep the communication \nflowing between the Board and the Treasury Department and the \nPresident's Cabinet. The private sector Board members are going to be \nstrong-willed people. They are not going to just acquiesce to the \nsuggestions of the Treasury Secretary. In fact, there are provisions in \nthis legislation to help assure that independence. One is having the \nBoard send a separate budget to the Congress, for example, independent \nof the Treasury Secretary. It makes good sense to follow the \nrecommendations of the Restructuring Commission on this matter. I urge \nmy colleagues to keep the Treasury Secretary on the Board.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 minutes 56 seconds for the \nSenator from Florida and 39 minutes 38 seconds for the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. \nAgain, I thank the chairman and other members of the Finance Committee \nfor their work in crafting this measure.\n  The vast majority of Americans comply with our country's tax laws. In \nthe same vein, most IRS workers do their jobs in a conscientious \nfashion.\n  We have heard numerous accounts of abuses and mismanagement at the \nIRS. We have had months of hearings and hours of debate. Some of the \nreported incidents of taxpayer abuse have been so outrageous that it is \nhard to believe that they actually took place. Clearly, the system that \nguides and directs workflow at the IRS needs to be overhauled.\n  Today, we are poised to go beyond talking about IRS reform. We are \nactually doing something about IRS abuse of innocent individuals.\n  The reforms in this bill are carefully crafted structural reforms. \nThey are reforms that will not only change the practices and procedures \nof the IRS, but its fundamental culture as well. These reforms will \nensure that the IRS treats taxpayers fairly and with the respect they \ndeserve.\n  As with any proposal, there are improvements that can be made. Our \ncolleagues have sponsored several amendments to make this bill even \nbetter.\n  I am a strong advocate of IRS initiatives which provide increased \ncustomer service, fiscally responsible computer modernization, \nmanagement and employee accountability and overall protection of \ncitizens' rights. I support measures that would remove the union \nrepresentative and the Secretary of the Treasury from the IRS Oversight \nBoard, as well as a measure to create a full-time oversight board for \nthe IRS.\n  I also support a measure that would establish a Spanish-language help \nline at the IRS to ensure that all citizens can get needed assistance \nin paying the taxes they owe.\n  I support an amendment that would greatly reduce unnecessary and \nonerous reporting requirements on colleges and universities that were \nimposed in last year's Taxpayer Relief Act in support of two new \neducational tax credits.\n  I support an amendment to suspend interest and penalties on deferred \ntaxes due from individuals who are in officially declared disaster \nareas.\n  In addition, I support amendments to protect innocent spouses from \nundue harassment in an effort to collect taxes from their spouse.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of a Coverdell amendment to \nthis bill which outlaws random audits. Numerical quotas and random \naudits are inherently unfair. A culture that permits and encourages \nsuch practices is counterproductive to overall fairness and \naccountability. It is difficult to find another area of American \nsociety where you become subject to such intense Government scrutiny \nbased solely on a random selection process.\n  It is fundamentally unfair to impose the burden of a tax audit on an \nindividual taxpayer for no reason other than his or her name was \nrandomly selected.\n  Reforming the tax collection and enforcement agency is only part of \nthe solution of reducing the burden of excessive taxation on Americans. \nWe still must continue our efforts to simplify the existing Tax Code \nand provide additional tax relief to all Americans.\n  I am an original cosponsor of the Coverdell-McCain Middle Class Tax \nRelief Act of 1998, which is a step toward a simpler, flatter, fairer \nTax Code. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act would deliver sweeping tax \nrelief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers by increasing the number \nof individuals who pay the lowest tax rate, which is 15 percent. In \n1998 alone, this bill will place approximately 10 million taxpayers, \nnow in the 28 percent tax bracket, into the 15 percent tax bracket. \nPreliminary estimates by the Tax Foundation indicate that 23 million \ntaxpayers would benefit from this broad-based middle-class tax relief \nin 1998 alone.\n  Mr. President, I supported the Middle Class Tax Relief Act because it \nis a step forward to further reform, it helps ordinary middle-class \nfamilies who are struggling to make ends meet without asking the \nGovernment to help out, and it promotes future economic prosperity by \nincreasing the amount of money taxpayers have available for their own \nsavings and investments.\n  In addition, this bill significantly lessens the effect of one of the \nTax Code's most inequitable provisions--the marriage penalty. Our \ncurrent Tax Code taxes a married couple's income more heavily than it \ntaxes a single individual earning the same amount of income as the \nmarried couple. This bill reduces this inequity by taxing a married \ncouple's joint income and a single individual earning the same income \nas the married couple at essentially the same effective rates.\n  It is essential that we provide American families with relief from \nthe excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of \nthe opportunity to provide for their needs and save for the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This measure permits individuals to keep more of the \nmoney they earn. This extra income will allow individuals to save and \ninvest more. The increased savings and investment are key to sustaining \nour current economic growth.\n  In sum, the Coverdell-McCain measure is a win for individuals and a \nwin for America as a whole. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act is a good \nbill, and I am hopeful that we can move forward on this bill during \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, regarding action taken yesterday on the IRS reform \nbill, let me note that I supported the chairman's amendment to fully \noffset the costs of implementing these reforms. However, I do have some \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nabout one of the funding sources. Specifically, the relaxed IRA \nrollover rule may create greater long-term revenue losses than \nanticipated. Because we cannot accurately score a bill beyond 10 years, \nit is difficult to determine how much additional revenue we may lose in \nthe future as more individuals take advantage of the relaxed IRA \nrollover rules and make tax-free withdrawals from their accounts. I \nraise this concern simply to bring it to the attention of the managers \nof the bill as an item to be considered in conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying that the IRS Restructuring Act \nof 1998 illustrates our continuing effort to change the way we collect \nour taxes and, on a larger note, the role of Government in our everyday \nlives. This bill reinstates the principles of fundamental fairness and \noverall efficiency to the operation of the IRS.\n  We should pass this bill today and move forward to provide additional \ntax relief to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill which, of \ncourse, creates the IRS Oversight Board and follows exactly the \nproposal made by the report of the National Commission on Restructuring \nthe Internal Revenue Service: ``A Vision for the New IRS.'' This \nexceptional document is the work of an extraordinarily able public and \nprivate group, including the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Nebraska, who is managing this legislation today. Their \nreport called for the inclusion of the Secretary or Deputy Secretary on \nthe board.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is not a bureaucrat, sir. He is the \nsecond-ranking member of the American Government; third if you want to \ninclude the Vice President. At any given moment there is the Secretary \nof State and the Secretary of the Treasury. Their predecessors begin \nwith Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and the sequence since \nhas been extraordinary.\n  Now, I speak from personal experience. I have known every Secretary \nof the Treasury since the Honorable C. Douglas Dillon of New Jersey, \nwho served President Kennedy so well and then stayed on with President \nJohnson--Secretary Dillon; Henry Fowler; Joseph Barr; David Kennedy; \nJohn Connally; George Shultz; William Simon; Michael Blumenthal; \nWilliam Miller; Donald Regan; James A. Baker, III; Nicholas Brady; \nLloyd Bentsen--our own Lloyd Bentsen--and now Robert E. Rubin.\n  They have been among the principal officers of the American \nGovernment. And a board that includes such is an important institution. \nAbsent that, sir, it is inevitably one of the myriad advisory \ncommissions which do useful work but are never and cannot be central to \nthe concerns of the American Government.\n  The House of Representatives voted 426-4 for a bill that included the \nSecretary for the obvious reason that absent his membership or her \nmembership on the board, nothing comes back to the Secretary with the \nforce of his or her own endorsement. The board does not know what only \nthe Secretary can know. If you prefer the model of a corporate board \nand the chief executive officer, do so. I prefer the model of American \nGovernment with a Cabinet officer chosen in a two-century succession, \nchosen by an elected President, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, \nresponsible for this high and solemn responsibility.\n  If the Secretary is on the board, the board will know things it \ncannot otherwise learn. And the Treasury Department in turn will have \nthe advice and counsel of persons, we hope, not next year but 50 years \nfrom now and will continue to think of this as a public service of \nimportance and consequence.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is a world figure. This very moment our \nSecretary is on his way to London to again engage in the increasingly \ninstitutionalized international economic deliberations which are so \nimportant to the world. If he is on this board, it becomes an important \none; if he is not, it becomes a marginal advisory committee.\n  The idea that there are concerns that a board might have, that \nprivate members might have, which the Secretary would not have, does \nnot speak well to our understanding of the centuries of occupants of \nthis high office.\n  Nor, sir, does it address a slight matter, but little noted in this \ndebate, which is the information we received from the Treasury \nDepartment that in a given year there are some $195 billion in taxes \nowed but not paid. Anyone who wishes to describe ours as a tyrannical, \nunfeeling, and ruthless tax collection administration might ponder how \nit comes about that $195 billion a year--$2 trillion a decade--of \nlegitimately owed taxes go unpaid.\n  That will be a part of the responsibility of this panel as well, and \nproperly so, so let us do what the wise judgment of the Commission \nproposed that we do. We are here in response to that effort. Let us do \nwhat clearly is in the interests of this institution and include the \nSecretary, as the Finance Committee did in the measure now before the \nSenate.\n  I see my friend from Florida. Is there any Member wishing to speak in \nfavor of the amendment?\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator, I do not know if there are additional \nSenators who wish to speak in favor. I ask the Senator the same \nquestion, whether there are others who wish to speak.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is on the floor now Senator Dorgan, and I yield 5 \nminutes to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me associate myself with the remarks just made by the \nSenator from New York, and let me also say that the work that has been \ndone by Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan to bring this legislation to \nthe floor is work that will benefit all of America. I think this \nlegislation has a great deal to commend it to the Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  It is true that in recent hearings evidence of misconduct and \nmismanagement, and, yes, in some cases the abuse of taxpayers by the \nInternal Revenue Service by a few employees of the Internal Revenue \nService, has cast a shadow over that organization.\n  A recent speaker indicated, I believe it was Senator McCain, that he \nwas certain--and I share that view--that by far the majority of the men \nand women who work in the Internal Revenue Service are good people who \ndo good work and try to do the best job they can. But because of the \nabuse by some few agents in the Internal Revenue Service, we must take \nsteps to make sure it never happens again.\n  This piece of legislation brought to the floor of the Senate creates \na nine-member oversight board. The purpose of that board and its duties \nis to oversee the administration, the management, the conduct, to \nprovide some assistance and some guidance and some additional \nmanagement, to make certain that we never again convene a hearing and \nhear of abuses by IRS agents of the American taxpayers. In short, this \nlegislation, in many ways, is an attempt to restore credibility by \nrestructuring the Internal Revenue Service and creating an oversight \nboard.\n  The two goals, it seems to me, are: One, to make the changes \nnecessary to make certain that this behavior never again occurs, and to \nprevent this kind of taxpayer abuse from surfacing again, because we \nwant to prevent it from ever happening again; No. 2, to enforce the tax \nlaws so that the many citizens in America who pay their taxes will have \nsome confidence that the few who try to avoid them will be required to \nmeet their responsibility. Those are the two elements that are \nimportant here.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Florida would strike from \nthe nine-member oversight board the Treasury Secretary. I agree with \nthe Senator from New York, who says that this board will not be a \nsignificant and important board unless it has as part of its membership \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. Part of it is about accountability, but \npart of it is about whether or not this will be a significant oversight \nboard. I believe very strongly that the membership on this board is \ngoing to contribute to the effective\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\nworkings of the Internal Revenue Service, but it must include the \nTreasury Secretary.\n  For all of the reasons I think that have been articulated by others \nwho have spoken before, let me just again say that I hope we will \ndefeat this amendment and I hope we will pass this underlying piece of \nlegislation with a very significant vote today.\n  I must say as well, I regret opposing an amendment offered by my \nfriend from Florida, for whom I have the greatest respect. I know he \nsupports the purpose of this bill, to give assurance to the American \npeople that we have an agency that can do what we expect a tax \ncollection agency ought to do, while at the same time protecting the \nrights of all the American people.\n  I will vote against this amendment but will be pleased to vote for \nthe underlying bill.\n  Again, I commend Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for the work they \nhave done to bring this to the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my friend will not mind adding Senator \nGrassley and Senator Kerrey, whose work on the original Commission \nbrings us here today.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my intention now is to make a few closing \nremarks, and then I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time \nand go to a vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 27 minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. KERREY. I think I will go for about 27 minutes and yield back 28 \nseconds.\n  Mr. President, 30 seconds, and then I will yield it all back.\n  Likewise, I have great respect for the Senator from Florida. I \nbelieve his amendment is well intended but, if it is accepted, it will \nsignificantly weaken this board. This board needs to be more than \nadvisory; it needs to have a sufficient amount of authority and power \nwhen it meets with Congress and we pay attention to it. If it advises \nand works with the IRS Commissioner, the IRS Commissioner, as well, \nlistens and pays attention.\n  So, this amendment will weaken the board. I understand what the \nSenator from Florida is trying to do, but I hope this amendment will be \ndefeated.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate the kind comments that my colleagues have made \nin their disagreement over the amendment I offer today.\n  Let me go to the heart of the matter as I see the argument that the \nSenators are making. What they are saying is that this oversight board, \nin essence, has no authority without the Secretary of the Treasury. I \nfundamentally disagree with that. The power comes from the law, not the \npresence of the Secretary. The authority is written into the \nlegislation that is before the Senate today. Having the Secretary of \nthe Treasury on that Commission does not add power. In fact, I say it \nreduces the power of the taxpayer, which is the intention behind, at \nleast from my perspective, the oversight board.\n  The reason we need an oversight board is because there have been \ndecades of inadequate oversight by the people empowered to oversee the \nIRS--Commissioners, Secretaries, Presidents, and Congresses. The entire \npurpose of the oversight board is to provide to private citizens, to \ntaxpayers, some power over the IRS. If the Secretary of the Treasury is \non the board, his oversight power is not enhanced but the power of the \nprivate citizens on the board will be diluted.\n  There is no guarantee that the staff of the board will be of any size \nat all. My fear would be that they might be detailees from the IRS and \nfrom the Treasury.\n  It is not very realistic to assume that the private sector members of \nthe oversight board can escape the dominance of the Treasury Secretary.\n  There is one last argument I will respond to and then yield the \nfloor. Should the Secretary be on the board so the board has the \nadvantage of his knowledge and access to information? Nothing prevents \nthe Treasury Secretary from submitting his views to the oversight \nboard. It should be expected that the oversight board will consult with \nthe Treasury Secretary. Input from within the Treasury Department is \nalready guaranteed by the Commission's representation on the board.\n  I think the amendment that I have offered and the perspective that I \nhave argued, frankly, have great power. I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will support this amendment.\n  I yield back the remaining time. I believe the yeas and nays have \nbeen called for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I rise today with an amendment, which I \noffer for myself and my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, to improve \nelectronic filing of tax and information returns. After working with \nthe managers, I believe we now have an agreement on this amendment, and \nI send that amendment to the desk.\n  The bill we are now considering contains far-reaching provisions that \nwill encourage the Internal Revenue Service to expand the use of \nelectronic filing. My amendment improves those provisions in two ways. \nFirst, my amendment makes it absolutely clear that electronic filing of \ntax returns should be voluntary--not another burdensome government \nmandate on American taxpayers. While the bill calls on the IRS to make \nelectronic filing the ``preferred and most convenient means for \nfiling,'' it also establishes a goal of 80 percent electronic filing of \ntax returns by 2007. Without a clear statement of congressional intent, \nit will be too easy for the IRS to interpret those provisions as \nrequiring electronic filing by certain taxpayers or in certain \ncircumstances.\n  As the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have heard over \nthe past 2 years from hundreds of small businesses about a similar \ngovernment mandate--the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or EFTPS. \nUnder the statute establishing this system, the Treasury is required to \ncollect certain percentages of tax electronically each year. To \nimplement that requirement, the IRS established thresholds based on a \nbusiness' past employment tax deposits. Regrettably, the IRS \nestablished the thresholds to serve its convenience rather than the \ntaxpayer's. As a result, it now appears that far more taxpayers are \nrequired to pay their taxes electronically than the law requires.\n  While EFTPS deals with electronic payment of taxes, as opposed to \nfiling of tax returns as we are addressing in this bill, it is a clear \nexample of how the intent of Congress can be misinterpreted and result \nin an onerous mandate, in this case on America's small businesses. My \namendment cuts that misunderstanding off at the pass. As the IRS \ndevelops new programs and procedures for electronic filing, they must \nnot be forced down the throats of the country's taxpayers. If they are \ntruly convenient and cost effective, taxpayers will volunteer in droves \nto file their tax returns electronically, just as they have with the \nIRS' TeleFile program. And those taxpayers who, for one reason or \nanother, decide that electronic filing is not practical, should be \npermitted to continue filing paper returns.\n  Second, my amendment expands the reporting requirements under the \nbill to ensure that the IRS pays particular attention to electronic-\nfiling issues pertaining to small business. The bill currently requires \nthat the Treasury Secretary, the IRS Commissioner, and the advisory \ngroup on electronic filing to report annually to the Congress on the \nprogress made in expanding the use of electronic filing.\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee for \nincluding representatives of small business on the advisory group as I \nproposed. My amendment capitalizes on that small business voice, by \nrequiring that the report to Congress include an analysis of the \neffects of electronic filing on small enterprises. If we are to prevent \nanother burdensome program like EFTPS, I believe we must require the \nIRS to focus on how electronic-filing programs will affect small \nbusiness. It will be of little benefit to the government if new \nelectronic-filing programs include new requirements, like a substantial \ninvestment in new equipment, since most small businesses will not be \nable to participate. In addition, if the IRS pays particular attention \nto the issues facing small businesses in this areas, the agency will be \nbetter equipped to market and promote the benefits of electronic \nfiling--a 100 percent improvement over the agency's initial efforts to \nencourage small firms to use EFTPS.\n  I fully endorse the intent of this legislation to make electronic \nfiling widely available, cost effective, and an attractive option. My \namendment fine tunes the bill to ensure that the intent becomes a \nreality. With the continuing advances in technology, we have an \nenormous opportunity to make all taxpayers' lives easier. But with \ntechnological advances comes the risk of imposing even more burdens on \ntaxpayers, and Congress must make sure that these improvements are not \nimplemented at the expense of the taxpayers, and especially the small \nbusinesses, who are expected to benefit from them. My amendment is \ndesigned to achieve that goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator on \nhis amendment. It has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I think \nit better states the policy of Congress and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further remarks? The Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside as well. It is a good amendment and I appreciate the fine work of \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2373) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2374\n\n   (Purpose: To expand the shift in burden of proof from income tax \n                   liability to all tax liabilities)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The clerk will report the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2374.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, between lines 21 and 22, insert:\n       ``(4) Expansion to tax liabilities other than income tax.--\n     In the case of court proceedings arising in connection with \n     examinations commencing 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this paragraph and before June 1, 2001, this \n     subsection shall, in addition to income tax liability, apply \n     to any other tax liability of the taxpayer.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We have a \nprovision in the bill, a very important provision, that sets up a set \nof criteria where, if the taxpayer meets a test of keeping prudent \nrecords and of turning those records over to the IRS on a timely basis, \nthat once that transfer of records has occurred and the other \nrequirements have been met, then the burden of proof shifts to the \nInternal Revenue Service when someone is accused of having violated the \nIRS code by not being in compliance on their income taxes.\n  This was a provision that was included in the bill under the \nleadership of the chairman. We, I think, generally wanted to extend it \nto all tax cases but because of revenue constraints we were unable to \ndo it. I have constructed this amendment in a fashion which does permit \nthe expanded burden of proof transfer. It delays the expansion for 6 \nmonths and sunsets it at the end of 5 years, so it fits within the \nrevenue cap we have.\n  I believe that once we provide this protection that we will end up \nnot taking it back or allowing it to expire. I\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nthink this is an important protection, because on gift and estate \nissues, we have the same problem as income taxes, where the Internal \nRevenue Service enters into a dispute with the taxpayer and, in a \nsystem unlike any other system in American society, under existing law, \nyou are guilty until you prove yourself innocent.\n  This amendment would simply say that if you keep all the records that \na prudent person could be expected to keep, and if you turn those \nsubstantiation records over to the Internal Revenue Service so there is \nno question about the fact that you have shared the information you \nhave with them, at that point the burden of proof shifts from the \ntaxpayer to the IRS not only in cases dealing with income tax disputes \nbut in all other types of tax cases as well.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted. I have discussed it with both \nsides of the aisle. I believe it is strongly supported. It does fit \nwithin the budget constraint we have in the bill, so I commend this to \nmy colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, both of these amendments are good \namendments. I urge their adoption. I appreciate very much the burden of \nproof amendment. I think it is very important it apply to all income, \nand I appreciate the fine work the distinguished Senator from Texas has \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I, too, congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from Texas for this amendment. It was our desire that this \nburden of proof be extended to all types of taxes. I urge the adoption \nof the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2374) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2375\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit Government officers and employees from requesting \n               taxpayers to give up their rights to sue)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2375.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 370, between lines 18 and 19, insert:\n\n     SEC. 3468. PROHIBITION ON REQUEST TO TAXPAYERS TO GIVE UP \n                   RIGHTS TO BRING ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--No officer or employee of the United \n     States may request a taxpayer to waive the taxpayer's right \n     to bring a civil action against the United States or any \n     officer or employee of the United States or any action taken \n     in connection with the internal revenue laws.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply in any case \n     where--\n       (1) a taxpayer waives the right described in subsection (a) \n     knowingly and voluntarily or\n       (2) the request by the officer or employee is made in \n     person and the taxpayer's attorney or other federally \n     authorized tax practitioner (within the meaning of section \n     7525(c)(1)) is present, or the request is made in writing to \n     the taxpayer's attorney or other representative.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the hearings that we held in the Finance \nCommittee, over and over again taxpayers, who made compelling cases \nthat they had been abused by the IRS, told us that in response to their \nefforts to try to stop what they considered to be unfair treatment--\nwhether it was seizure of their home or their business or being accused \nof things they claim not to have done--one thing that they were \nconsistently required to do by the IRS in order to end the dispute, \neven though the Internal Revenue Service may have turned up no \nwrongdoing, was to sign a statement whereby the taxpayers gave up their \nright to sue the IRS for the abuses that had been imposed on them.\n  I have talked to Commissioner Rossotti. He has said that he has no \nobjection to this amendment. In addition, my staff has met with the \nstaff of the Treasury Department, and they have suggested some changes \nwhich we have made.\n  Basically, what this says is that if I am in a dispute with the \nInternal Revenue Service, they can't force me, as part of that dispute, \nto give up my rights. At the end of the process, if I have done nothing \nwrong, they can't force me to give up my right to sue them if I feel my \nrights have been violated.\n  They can notify my attorney that this is something that could be part \nof the negotiation. I can voluntarily propose that if we can settle the \ncase today, for example, I would be willing to pay so much and give up \nthis right. But what this amendment does is prohibit the Internal \nRevenue Service from forcing this provision as part of any settlement. \nI think it is an important protection.\n  With these changes, it is my understanding it is supported by my \ncolleagues and I hope it can be accepted at this point.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, again, I congratulate the Senator from Texas \nfor offering the amendment. This addresses a question that became very \nclear in our hearings last week that it was a serious problem.\n  It is my understanding this has been cleared by both sides of the \naisle. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I also support this amendment. The Senator \nfrom Texas has carefully drafted this amendment to make certain that \nthe waiver of the right to sue can still be granted. It is a very \nimportant provision in all kinds of negotiations, not just with the \nIRS. The Senator from Texas drafted it so that right is still \npreserved, but it just can't be coerced. It can't be coerced.\n  The IRS supports this amendment. They do not believe it is going to \nhave any impact on the capacity to reach agreements with taxpayers or \nget noncompliant taxpayers to comply. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment? \nIf not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2375) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the courage and decisiveness \ndisplayed by President Clinton and the Secretary of State, Ms. \nAlbright, in attempting to get the Arab-Israeli negotiations back on \ntrack. The attacks by some in the other body are disappointing and not \nhelpful. If there has been coercion and strong-arming or unreasonable \ntactics on the matter of negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinians over the last year or so, Mr. President, in my judgment, \nit has not been on the part of the United States.\n  The unfortunate reality as I view it, is that the Israeli Prime \nMinister has pursued a policy of paralysis in the peace process. I \nthink it is unwise for any responsible American leader to suggest that \nthis practice should continue, and the United States should not \nintervene to get the negotiations underway again in a meaningful way. \nThe Israeli Prime Minister has traveled to Washington before, totally \nempty-\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nhanded, with no proposal for moving the negotiations forward. In so \ndoing, he has catered to the forces working against progress. He has \nembarrassed the United States, and all who have supported a peaceful \nconstructive resolution of the issues on the table regarding Israeli \nand the Palestinians. It is no wonder, given his track record on the \nnegotiations since he became Prime Minister, that the administration \nhas seen fit to require some assurance that another visit to Washington \nwill produce something more than empty rhetoric and more stonewalling. \nI cannot support more strongly the position of Secretary Albright, that \nif the Israeli Prime Minister is unwilling to accept some moderate \nspecific American proposals for progress on the West Bank that there is \nnot much point in another fruitless trip to Washington, which might \nfurther inflame the situation in the Middle East.\n  As to the Israeli Palestinian problem, Mr. President, it has always \ntaken three to tango. All parties, the United States, the Palestinians \nand the Israelis must want the negotiations to move forward, and it is \nonly through compromise that success can be achieved. The United States \nhas used its good offices to broker the negotiations and has burnished \nsubstantial financial resources to ensure the stability of Israeli on \nan unstinting basis. Any one of the parties can derail the negotiations \nand so it is a measure of the tremendous difficulty the United States \nhas had with the Netanyahu government that the administration has felt \nit necessary to take specific steps to get the negotiations back on \ntrack.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I commend the President for this initiative \nin the interests of getting the negotiations jump-started. I hope that \ncooler heads will prevail and that all Americans will see the wisdom of \nsupporting a reasoned but decisive approach to the negotiating effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4485-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4486-S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2376\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the termination of employment of IRS employees \n for willful failure to file income tax return or threatening an audit \n                       for retaliatory purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have one final amendment. I am a little \nbit hesitant to consume further time so I shall be brief.\n  I remind my colleagues, we held hearings in the Finance Committee \nafter we wrote the initial bill, and issues arose in those hearings \nthat we want to address in this amendment. I understand that it has \nbeen approved by both sides of the aisle.\n  Basically, we have in the bill a list of offenses for which an \nemployee of the Internal Revenue Service may be terminated. In light of \nconcerns that have arisen since we had the bill before the committee, I \nwant to add two offenses to the list.\n  One has to do with testimony we heard where members of the Internal \nRevenue Service were said to be threatening to audit people for \npersonal gain. We heard an assertion that a police officer had stopped \nan IRS agent and was going to write him a ticket, and the IRS agent \nallegedly had told the officer that if he wrote the ticket, he was \ngoing to get audited.\n  The second provision has to do with a knowing and willful failure of \nan IRS agent to file a tax return or pay taxes or declare income. Both \nof these fit, I think, perfectly into the list of very strong offenses \nthat we have in the bill.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2376.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 253, line 13, strike ``and''.\n       On page 253, line 17, strike the end period and insert a \n     comma.\n       On page 253, between lines 17 and 18, insert:\n       (8) willful failure to file any return of tax required \n     under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on or before the date \n     prescribed therefor (including any extensions), unless such \n     failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful \n     neglect,\n       (9) willful understatement of Federal tax liability, unless \n     such understatement is due to reasonable cause and not to \n     willful neglect, and\n       (10) threatening to audit a taxpayer for the purpose of \n     extracting personal gain or benefit.\n\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, again, this amendment addresses a serious \nproblem that came out during the hearings held by the Finance Committee \nlast week.\n  It is an important change in the law. And I compliment the Senator \nfor propounding it. At the appropriate moment I will urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the National Restructuring Commission \nincluded this provision in our bill. It is in the House bill, or at \nleast provisions in it that dictate that an employee who does a number \nof things would be automatically terminated.\n  What the Senator from Texas has done is identified some additional \nthings that ought to be on the list and once again has carefully drawn \nit--I believe the language is ``willful'' and--what was the other word, \nI ask the Senator? ``Willful'' and ``intentionally.''\n  This would not be a situation where an individual accidentally \nunderpays taxes or misses a deadline or something like that. This is a \nmuch higher standard, a much more difficult standard. And I think it is \na quite reasonable provision to add to the list of things that would \nforce and require automatic termination.\n  In general, this legislation is attempting to change the culture by \nsaying here are some things that, if you do it, there are going to be \nsevere penalties. This is obviously a severe penalty. Punitive damages \nfor damages, we have an expanded right for legal fees.\n  What we are trying to do is change the culture so that there is a new \nseriousness given to actions taken by the IRS. And all of us understand \nthe penalty needs to be sufficient to meet the offense. I think the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Texas is a reasonable one \nand I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 2376.\n  The amendment (No. 2376) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate many \ntimes to speak about my native State of Vermont and to say how very \nspecial it is. One of the reasons that it is so special is not only the \npeople who are born there but some of the extraordinary people who come \nto Vermont and have made Vermont their home and have improved Vermont \nwhile there.\n  One person who we revere in Vermont is Arthur Gibb. Art Gibb served \nas a leader in the State legislature, one of the strongest voices in \nthe Republican Party for environmental concerns in Vermont, and he is \nwell respected by Republicans and Democrats alike for all he has given \nto the State.\n  Recently, Christopher Graff, chief of the Vermont Associated Press \nBureau, wrote an article about Art Gibb as he turned 90. Mr. Graff says \nthings about Art Gibb far better than I. But it is such a good profile \nof such a special Vermonter that I ask unanimous consent the article \nabout my good friend, Art Gibb, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 12, 1998]\n\n              Art Gibb: A Special State Leader, Law Maker\n\n                         (By Christopher Graff)\n\n       Take a stroll through the Statehouse and peek at the \n     portraits lining the walls. Governors, lieutenant governors, \n     military leaders.\n       Among all the paintings in the Statehouse collection are \n     just three portraits of legislators.\n       One is of Edna Beard of Orange, the first woman to serve in \n     the House. She was also the first to serve in the Senate.\n       The second is of Reid LeFevre of Manchester, a House member \n     starting in the 1940s who was the most colorful lawmaker of \n     all times. LeFevre was chairman of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee and in his off time ran King Reid Shows, a \n     traveling carnival that he once brought to the House chamber.\n       The third portrait is of Art Gibb, a legend in his own \n     time.\n       Gibb's large portrait fills part of a wall off the House \n     chamber. He is shown sitting outside and most of the painting \n     is a wonderful, colorful landscape, with flowers, fields and \n     mountains.\n       It is revealing that the portrait is more about Vermont's \n     beauty than about Gibb.\n       The Weybridge Republican turns 90 this week, still bustling \n     with energy and a passion for keeping Vermont special.\n       Gibb sits on the state Environmental Board, settling the \n     sticky questions of who gets to build what where.\n       It is a fitting place for him. He fathered the pioneering \n     state law that created the Environmental Board and the \n     process of keeping development in check.\n       It is a great story, one that serves as a reminder of the \n     special breed of leaders Vermont has enjoyed and the state's \n     ability to meet head-on the problems that destroy others.\n       Gibb was elected to the House in 1962. He was serving on \n     the tax-writing committee of the House when a vacancy opened \n     in the chairmanship of the House Natural Resources Committee.\n       Gibb asked House Speaker Richard Mallary if he could have \n     it--and Mallary agreed.\n       The outdoors enthusiast was placed in a critical role at a \n     critical time.\n       A few years later newly elected Gov. Deane Davis realized \n     southern Vermont was under siege from eager developers who \n     cared solely about profit.\n       Davis turned to Gibb--the governor later described Gibb as \n     ``a man of great personal charm . . . (who) was well-known \n     for his judicial and fair-minded temperament''--and asked him \n     to lead a special commission to examine the problem. Out of \n     the Gibb Commission came the framework for Act 250, passed in \n     1970 and still a vital part of Vermont.\n       Gibb says the issues that come to the board these days are \n     ones no one imagined when Act 250 was drawn up, like \n     snowmaking for ski areas and the siting of communications \n     towers.\n       Gibb says he has seen and done a lot in his years, but of \n     one thing he has never had any doubts. Act 250 has played a \n     crucial role in saving what makes Vermont special.\n       ``It leads to responsible development,'' he says. ``When \n     you think of the irresponsible development we had in 1969 . . \n     . Thank God for Act 250.''\n       As Art Gibb turns 90, we thank him for Act 250 and thank \n     God for Art Gibb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4487-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4487-S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN ADAMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of the times I have spoken about \nVermont, I have talked about the fact that in small cities and towns \neverybody knows everybody else. We are a State of neighbors, from the \nstores on the corner to the places of worship and our town squares.\n  Recently, the Burlington Free Press wrote an article about John \nAdams. He has spent 40 years fitting shoes and boots and footwear for \nthe people of Burlington, VT, and its surrounding areas.\n  When they were writing this article, it brought back to my wife and \nmyself the memories of going into that same\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\nstore with John Adams with our young children, lining them up, getting \ntheir shoes. Those children are all grown now. And John Adams is still \nthere. He is still one of the reasons why I love my home in Burlington \nand why Vermont always has been and always will be home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Burlington Free \nPress, dated Sunday, April 19, 1998, entitled ``Shoe Biz'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 19, 1998]\n\n                                Shoe Biz\n\n                          (By Melissa Garrido)\n\n       John Adams remembers when Oldsmobiles rolled down Church \n     Street. He recalls the days when ladies strolled by the shops \n     in matching handbags, hats and high heels. And he can't \n     forget the time Abernethy's department store gave away mink \n     scarves for its 105th anniversary in 1951.\n       Burlington's main drag has changed since then. One thing \n     hasn't changed: People are still wearing the wrong shoes.\n       ``You could see where the wrinkle is on his shoe. It's in \n     the wrong spot--he's wearing his shoe too big,'' said John \n     Adams, peering over his square glasses at a man in clunky \n     sneakers hoofing past his store, Adams Boots & Shoes.\n       Adams, 73, has been selling shoes on upper Church Street \n     for more than four decades. To him, the street is the heart \n     of Vermont. He made his best friends and found prosperity \n     here. He watched Abernethy's endure a fire and remembers when \n     expensive leather shoes cost $15.\n       As businesses came and went, Adams' customers grew out of \n     Stride Rites into Florsheim Royal Imperials. He has outlasted \n     almost every other entrepreneur on Church Street.\n       ``I've had the privilege of going from the old days to the \n     new days,'' Adams said in his raspy voice. A quiet man, Adams \n     sometimes winds up when he tries to make a point, and uses \n     his hands to recount a story.\n       ``I saw . . . (Church Street) transform into the \n     Marketplace,'' he said. ``Every time they put a brick down, \n     it was a step toward another year.''\n\n\n                              First steps\n\n       Adams' shoe career began in the 1950s, when he quit his job \n     installing radio and television towers around the United \n     States for a construction company. He felt the job was too \n     dangerous a way for a husband and father to earn a living.\n       In the late 1950s, he landed a position as a shoe clerk \n     with the Massachusetts-based Dennis Shoe Company, which \n     rented retail space at Abernethy's, the old Vermont landmark \n     on the corner of Church and Pearl streets.\n       ``I didn't ask how much it paid,'' he said. ``I just came \n     up to work.''\n       Adams had no clue he would remain in the foot business \n     until the turn of the century.\n       In 1983, a year after Abernethy's closed, Adams relocated \n     the Dennis Shoe Co.'s operation to Almy's in the University \n     Mall. In 1984, the shoe company moved back downtown into the \n     Gladstone building, but went out of business the same year. \n     Adams bought the small store and renamed it Adams Boots & \n     Shoes.\n       ``I was excited about it,'' Adams said. ``But I still \n     wasn't my own boss. The customers were the boss; they still \n     are.''\n       In 1996, he moved across the street, back into the original \n     Abernethy's building on upper Church Street, to make room for \n     the Eddie Bauer store.\n       ``The store has been his life,'' said Adams' 46-year-old \n     son David, a senior vice president at Vermont National \n     Bank. ``It's what keeps him going.''\n       ``All he does is talk about the store,'' he said.\n\n\n                             Personal touch\n\n       With a shiny shoe horn tucked in his back pocket, Adams \n     bent down and pressed the outer edge of Alex Brett's foot to \n     feel the girth of a shoe. He tugged on the tongue, poked at \n     the space between the 11-year-old's big toe and the tip of \n     the shoe, and squinted as he examined the vamp.\n       ``I like the way this one feels better,'' Adams told Alex's \n     father as he squeezed the sides of the left 8\\1/2\\ oxford.\n       ``Which one feels better?'' he asked the boy.\n       ``The left.''\n       Adams tossed his hands in the air and grinned: ``I might be \n     old, but I can still tell the difference.''\n       The shoe store owner still runs his business the old-\n     fashioned way.\n       He special-orders shoes, calls his elderly female customers \n     ``young gals,'' and he never lets customers put on and take \n     off their own shoes.\n       ``There's nothing that irritates me more than a clerk who \n     watches a customer put on a shoe,'' said Adams, who calls \n     himself a shoe fitter, not a shoe salesman. Unlike the \n     average part-time shoe clerk, he brings a formal education in \n     fitting shoes to his trade.\n       Decade after decade, his customers return, first with their \n     children, then with their grandchildren. They come for his \n     personal service and his expertise in fitting children's \n     shoes.\n       For Sen. Patrick Leahy, the shoe fitter is part of his \n     fondest memories from his days as a Burlington prosecutor in \n     the 1960s. Leahy used to buy shoes from Adams for his \n     children when they were in grade school. Leahy remembers when \n     Adams would line the three up and measure their feet with a \n     cold, metal Brannock, a device used to gauge the size and \n     width of a foot. ``He never lost his patience even when the \n     youngest one was squirming,'' Leahy said.\n       ``In an impersonal world, it's kind of nice to walk in \n     somewhere and not only do you know the person in the store, \n     but they know you and actually care,'' he said, ``We still \n     have places like this in Vermont, and that's why it will \n     always be home.''\n\n\n                              slower pace\n\n       These days, Adams is trying to stay in business as the mom \n     and pop shops are replaced by franchises. The four blocks of \n     Church Street between Main and Pearl Streets have become a \n     melange of tourists toting shopping bags, students in \n     backpacks heading into bars, and downtown employees grabbing \n     a quick bite to eat.\n       ``I have no intentions of giving up, and I don't intend to \n     retire,'' Adams said.\n       Business trends do not shock the entrepreneur.\n       ``Everyone is concerned about Wal-Mart and the other \n     stores. I'm not a lover of the big-box stores, but they do \n     bring in an extra 5,000 people.\n       ``That just means we have to work a little bit harder,'' he \n     said.\n       Like the business in his store, Adams is slowing down.\n       A couple of years ago, he was diagnosed with cancer. Though \n     he says he has ``licked it,'' he doesn't like to talk about \n     the ailment that keeps him away from his customers about one \n     day a week--not even to his employees.\n       ``I can't wait to go to work the next morning, because you \n     have your mind on other people,'' Adams said. ``You forget \n     the aches and pains.''\n       Aches and pains brought Jan Lawrence of Williston to Adams \n     about 30 years ago. Her daughter was having foot problems, \n     and a Barre doctor suggested she take her to Adams to have \n     her feet fitted properly.\n       ``You spend anything you want on clothes,'' said Lawrence, \n     52, ``but never gyp on a shoe, because you'll have foot \n     problems later on in life.''\n       Today, Lawrence buys her shoes from only Adams.\n       ``You are important to John at all times,'' she said. \n     ``Even when he is not feeling well, he does his best to serve \n     you and your needs.''\n       As Adams moves toward the millennium, he is adamant about \n     remaining a part of Church Street. The shop owner is eager to \n     see new stores like Filene's sprout in downtown and lure \n     customers. He hopes a new department store might rekindle the \n     heyday of Abernethy's.\n       ``It was a lot more fun in those days than it is today,'' \n     Adams said. ``It was a slower pace back then. Everyone is \n     always in a rush today.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware for his usual courtesy.

Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced Senate Bill \n2031, the Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1998. I am pleased \nthat Senator Breaux cosponsored this bill. This legislation will be an \nimportant tool in combating the waste, fraud and abuse that has \nthreatened the integrity of the Medicare home health benefit.\n  Although the majority of home health agencies are honest, legitimate, \nbusinesses, it is clear that there have been unscrupulous providers. \nLast July, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a \nhearing on this topic. The hearing exposed serious rip-offs of the \nMedicare trust fund, and highlighted areas that need more stringent \noversight.\n  In response to the hearing, Senator Breaux and I followed up with a \nroundtable discussion on home health fraud. The roundtable brought \ntogether key players with a variety of perspectives. Participants \nincluded law enforcement, the Administration, and the home health \nindustry.\n  The roundtable yielded a number of proposals which were shaped into \ndraft legislation and circulated to a wide variety of stakeholders. In \nresponse to comments, the draft was changed to address legitimate \nconcerns that were\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nraised. The result is a balanced piece of legislation that includes \nimportant safeguards against fraud and abuse of the system, but does \nnot stifle the growth of legitimate providers.\n  The Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1998 would do the \nfollowing: It would modify the surety bond requirement in the BBA so \nthat only new agencies need to obtain surety bonds. Because HCFA's \nsurety bond rule goes far beyond Congress's intention to keep bad \nproviders from entering Medicare, many existing agencies with no \nhistory of fraud have been unable to obtain bonds. This provision would \nforce HCFA to return to Congress's original intention. It also reduces \nthe amount of the bond needed to $25,000.\n  It would heighten scrutiny of new home health agencies before they \nenter the Medicare program, and during their early years of Medicare \nparticipation.\n  It would improve standards and screening for home health agencies, \nadministrators and employees.\n  It would require audits of home health agencies whose claims exhibit \nunusual features that may indicate problems, and improve HCFA's ability \nto identify such features.\n  It would require agencies to adopt and implement fraud and abuse \ncompliance programs.\n  It would increase scrutiny of branch offices, business entities \nrelated to home health agencies, and changes in operations.\n  It would make more information on particular home health agencies \navailable to beneficiaries.\n  It would create an interagency Home Health Integrity Task Force, led \nby the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services.\n  It would reform bankruptcy rules to make it harder for all Medicare \nproviders, not just home health agencies, to avoid penalties and \nrepayment obligations by declaring bankruptcy.\n  This legislation is an important step in ensuring that seniors \nmaintain access to high quality home care services rendered by \nreputable providers. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FINDING THE FUDGE FACTOR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, based on recent remarks by the \nPresident, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. If the story as \nreported is true, it is an unfortunate commentary. In a recent meeting \nwith religious leaders, Mr. Clinton asked them to withdraw their \nsupport for a legislative effort to hold countries to account that \nengage in religious persecution. Mr. Clinton, it seems, does not like \nlegislation that imposes sanctions. Well, that's not precisely right. \nWhat he does not like is sanctions that he didn't think of. When he \nwants sanctions on Iraq, for example, he is all for sanctions. But when \nit comes to other issues he cares less about, well, suddenly he finds \nthem unwelcome.\n  What are some of these? Well, he doesn't like mandatory sanctions for \nviolations of human rights. He objects to sanctions to stop the spread \nof nuclear weapons. He is not partial to sanctions on countries that \npersecute people for their religious beliefs. And he finds the idea of \nsanctions on countries that do not do enough to stop the traffic of \nillegal drugs to the United States burdensome. In a flight of candor \nwith the religious leaders, he allows as how it is difficult to be \nhonest in assessing another country's behavior if sanctions might be \ninvolved. ``What always happens,'' he says, ``if you have automatic \nsanctions legislation is it puts pressure on whoever is in the \nexecutive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going \non.''\n  That is refreshingly frank. It is also disturbing. When I look up \n``fudge'' in the dictionary, this is what it tells me the word means: \nto fake; to falsify; to exceed the proper bounds or limits of \nsomething; to fail to perform as expected; to avoid commitment.\n  If I am to believe these remarks, what the President is saying is \nthat his Administration finds it necessary to falsify the facts; to \navoid commitment; to fake information. His Administration finds it \ndifficult to be honest when it comes to telling the Congress and the \npublic what other countries are doing on critical issues. I guess the \nquestion we need to ask now is, what is the fudge factor in the various \nreports this Administration has submitted on these issues? We need to \nknow this for past reports. And we need to know what this factor is in \norder to properly evaluate future assessments.\n  The reason we need to know this is for what the President's comments \nsuggest. If we believe this report, the President is telling us that \nhis Administration finds it necessary to be less than candid when it \ncomes to enforcing the law. Now, I know that many Administrations do \nnot like the idea that Congress also has foreign policy \nresponsibilities. Many Administrations have fought against sanctions \nfor this or that issue they did not think of.\n  They have also fought for sanctions when it was their idea. What is \nof concern here is the admission that this Administration fights shy of \ntelling the truth in situations where it does not approve of the \nsanctions. It fudges the facts, presumably, even though the President \nhas the discretion, in law, to waive any sanctions for national \nsecurity reasons. This then is a candid admission that it enforces the \nlaws it likes and fudges those it does not. I find this disturbing.\n  Perhaps the Administration could explain just why it needs to fudge \nthe facts on drug certification, for example. What drug certification \nrequires is that the President assess what other countries are doing to \nhelp stop the production and traffic of illegal drugs. This means \nassessing what they are doing to comply with international law. To make \na judgment about what they are doing to live up to bilateral agreements \nwith the United States.\n  And to account for what these countries are doing to comply with \ntheir own laws. The certification law gives the President considerable \nflexibility in determining whether these activities meet some minimally \nacceptable standards. He is not required to impose sanctions unless he \ndetermines, based on the facts, that a country is not living up to \nreasonable standards. And he can waive any sanctions. This gives the \nAdministration a great deal of latitude. I have defended this \nflexibility. I have argued that just because the Congress and the \nAdministration disagree, honestly, over an assessment, it does not mean \nthat the facts are not honest. Or that the judgment is dishonest. But \nthese recent remarks open up another concern. If the facts are fudged, \nhowever, just how are we to determine what to make of the judgment that \nfollows?\n  And what is the occasion for employing the fudge factor? What is it \nbeing avoided or dodged? What the certification law and many of these \nothers that require sanctions ask for is not terribly complicated or \noutlandish. They express the expectation of the Congress and of the \nAmerican public that countries live up to certain responsibilities. And \nmore, that failure to do so involves consequences. This is, after all, \nthe expectation of law and of behavior in a community of civilized \nnations. The want of such standards or the lack of consequences reduces \nthe chances for serious compliance with international law or the rules \nof common decency. Are we really to believe that respect for these \nstandards and consequences are to be discarded because their \napplication is inconvenient? Because they reduce some notion of \nflexibility? That we only have to enforce or observe the laws we like? \nWhat a principle.\n  I for one do not intend to live by such a notion. I will also from \nnow on be far more interested in knowing just what the fudge factor is \nin assessments from the Administration. I hope my colleagues will also \nbe more demanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4489-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4489-S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I rise in strong support of this legislation which is going \nto overhaul the agency that is probably more feared by Americans than \nany other single agency--the IRS.\n  Mr. President, at the Finance Committee hearings that began last \nSeptember and ended last week, the American public heard some chilling \ntestimony--testimony of an agency that is\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\nsimply out of control and an agency that is unaccountable. Some say it \nwas designed that way. Well, in a democracy, there is no place for the \ntype of Gestapo tactics that we have seen. We have seen in the hearings \nand in the testimony that harassment, retribution, and abuse apparently \nhave been condoned in some areas of the IRS for some time.\n  Mr. President, when the GAO attempted to audit the IRS last year, it \nfound that the systems the IRS had put in place were designed to ensure \nthat there is no way--no way--for IRS personnel to be held accountable \nfor their erroneous actions. There is no way to determine how many \ntimes the Internal Revenue Service has made a mistake in sending out a \ncollection notice, and there is no way to determine how many complaints \nhave been received. In effect, the managers at the IRS set up the \nsystem so that no one can trace improper behavior. There are no paper \ntrails, there are no records.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no accountability. The lack of \naccountability and the arrogance among some that pervades the IRS was \nbest summed up last week when Tommy Henderson, a special agent and \nformer group manager of the IRS's Criminal Investigation Division \noffice in Knoxville, testified. He told the committee:\n\n       IRS management does what it wants, to whom it wants, when \n     it wants, how it wants, and with almost complete immunity. \n     Each district director and chief appears to operate from his \n     own little kingdom.\n\n  Well, there are no kingdoms in this country, Mr. President. Anyone at \nthe Internal Revenue Service who thinks he or she is above the law \nought to be summarily fired. No one enjoys paying taxes, but no one in \nthis country should fear the agency that is charged with the collection \nof taxes. Yet, we have learned that frightening taxpayers is certainly \na tactic that is often used by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Last week, Robert Edwin Davis, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Tax Division at the Justice Department, told the \ncommittee that IRS criminal agents use violent and sometimes fearful \ntactics against nonviolent taxpayers. He told the committee of a raid \nby 10 armed IRS agents on the home of a woman at 7:30 in the morning. \nThe 10 armed agents came into her house and searched throughout the \nhouse. What were they looking for? Illegal drugs? Firearms? Unreported \ncash? No. Well, then, why were 10 armed agents searching her home? They \nwere trying to appraise the value of the furnishings in the house \nbecause the Internal Revenue Service believed the executor of the \nwoman's deceased grandmother's estate had undervalued the furnishings \nfor estate tax purposes. Can you believe that, Mr. President?\n  The person who ordered that armed raid should have been fired. This \nis America, not Nazi Germany.\n  Mr. President, several current IRS employees had the courage to come \nforward during the hearings held in the Finance Committee. I want to \ncommend Senator Roth for calling those hearings. As a member of that \ncommittee, I was deeply moved by the testimony of the witnesses that he \nand the staff had generated.\n  Again, several current IRS employees did have the courage to come \nforward. They described situations where revenue officers, with \nmanagement approval, used enforcement to ``punish'' taxpayers instead \nof trying to collect the appropriate amount of money for the \nGovernment. One told the committee that IRS officials browse tax data \non potential witnesses in Government tax cases and on the jurors \nsitting on those Government tax cases.\n\n  We learned last week that one rogue agent, trying to make a \nreputation for himself, tried to frame a former Republican leader of \nthis body, Senator Howard Baker--at that time, he was a sitting Senator \nfrom Tennessee and the majority leader--and when a responsible IRS \nmanager tried to stop the agent, the agency retaliated, not against the \nagent, but against the manager.\n  Those are the types of actual situations the committee focused on.\n  Mr. President, lest I be overcritical, I am well aware of the \ndedicated people in the Internal Revenue Service who are doing an \nappropriate job in carrying out the duties that they must perform in \nservice to the IRS as well as the country.\n  Mr. President, Commissioner Ros-sotti has a tough job. If he is going \nto change the culture of the IRS, he is going to have to have some new \ntools and support by the Congress. This bill will give him some of \nthose tools that he needs to get that job done. For example, the bill \ngives him the authority to fire an IRS employee if he fails to obtain \nrequired approval for seizing a taxpayer's home or business asset. \nFurther, an IRS agent will be fired for providing a false statement or \ndestroying documents to conceal mistakes.\n  The bill creates an independent board to review and recommend changes \nto enforcement and collection activities of the IRS. I believe the \ncommittee made a mistake in placing the Treasury Secretary and the IRS \nemployee representative on this board, and I am disappointed that the \nSenate did not remove those two individuals from that board. This \nshould be a board that is made up of people who can act with real \nindependence on behalf of honest taxpayers. It should not represent the \ninterests of the Government or the employees of this agency.\n  We have set up a truly independent Taxpayer Advocate to resolve \ntaxpayer disputes with the IRS. This is a much-needed change, since we \nlearned last year that the current Taxpayer Advocate, in reality, faces \na conflict of interest because the people who rotate through this \noffice are often called upon to make judgments on the people in the \nagency who can promote the individual after he rotates out of the \nadvocate's office.\n  Now, in the area of computer-generated property seizures, like we had \nin my State of Alaska, some 800 permanent fund dividend seizure notices \nthat were issued last September should never, ever happen again, \nbecause IRS employees are going to have to have signed approvals before \nattempting to seize property.\n  And for the first time, a taxpayer will be able to appeal seizures \nall the way into Tax Court.\n  We've made sure that IRS won't be able to harass the divorced woman \nfor her ex-husband's cheating. I want to express my concern that it \nappears the Administration does not support the proportional liability \nprovision we've included for innocent spouses.\n  Last week, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Donald Lubick was \nquoted as saying the Administration cannot support our plan to provide \ninnocent spouse relief. When I read the story about this comment, I \nasked my staff to obtain a copy of Mr. Lubick's speech but was informed \nthere was no text for the speech. It is my hope that Mr. Lubick was not \nspeaking for the Administration, since according to one study, there \nare 35,000 innocent women who must contend with attempts by IRS to \ncollect on debts that they are not responsible for.\n  In addition, we've added a rule suspending interest and penalties \nwhen the IRS does not provide appropriate notice to taxpayers within \none year of filing. This ensures that delays by IRS, which can \nsometimes go on for years, will not benefit IRS by stacking penalties \nand interest on taxpayers who may have unwittingly made a mistake on \ntheir returns.\n  Finally, we've changed the burden of proof in cases coming before the \nTax Court. This is a long overdue change. When American citizens go \ninto a court, they should be presumed innocent, not guilty until they \ncan prove their innocence. That principle is enshrined in our \nConstitution and must apply in tax cases as well as any other cases.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, the culture at the IRS must change. \nThis bill makes very important changes that should give the American \npublic more confidence that if they make a mistake on their tax \nreturns, they will be treated fairly by their government and not \nsubjected to threats and harassment.\n  But this bill is just a first step. As I have indicated, there are \ncertain portions with which I am not satisfied. I think it is incumbent \non the Finance Committee to hold the agency accountable for \nimplementing what is in this bill. More oversight is needed because it \nis only through oversight that we can hold this agency accountable to \nthe American public.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Seeing no other Senator, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak as if in morning business to introduce legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2049 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee and his staff for working closely with Senator \nBaucus, Senator Hutchison, and me on language in this bill to protect \nthe trade secrets and confidential information of software publishers \nand their customers. The Senate IRS bill is far stronger than the House \nbill on these issues, and we appreciate the Chairman's efforts. To \nensure fair and adequate implementation of this legislation, I would \nlike to clarify our intent with regard to some of its provisions.\n  First, this bill confirms that, in an IRS summons enforcement \nproceeding involving software, courts have the authority to issue ``any \norder necessary to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets and other \nconfidential information'' with respect to software. I believe this \nauthority is inherent in the existing powers of the judiciary in \nsummons enforcement proceedings, and that our legislation simply \nreaffirms this authority with respect to the proceedings involving \nsoftware. Mr. President, this clarification would make clear that the \ncourt can also issue orders to protect confidential taxpayer \ninformation associated with the software.\n  Secondly, the legislation currently provides that ``the Secretary \nwill make a good faith and significant effort to ascertain the \ncorrectness of an item'' prior to issuance of a summons for software \nsource code. It is my belief that a good faith and significant effort \nrequires that the IRS conduct a thorough review of the taxpayer's \nbooks, records, and other data, including the issuance of Information \nDocument Requests and following-up those requests appropriately. This \nclarification would make certain that source code should be summoned as \na last resort only.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I appreciate and concur with the comments of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I too thank the Chairman for his work on \nthese issues. I am concerned that the Senate bill contains a provision, \nSection 7612(b)(3) that makes it easier for the IRS to gain access to \nsoftware source code in the event that a taxpayer refuses to provide \nhis own financial data to the IRS. Since the sofeware publisher can \nneither provide this data themselves, nor compel a taxpayer to provide \nit, I believe this provision is unnecessary. The bill should not punish \na third-party software company when the IRS fails to use those tools \nagainst an uncooperative taxpayer. I hope the Chairman will reconsider \nthis issue in conference.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues that the \nSenate Finance Chairman has produced an excellent bill which will help \nprotest software companies and their customers from intrusive IRS \naudits.\n  I would ask the Chairman to consider the issue of whether or not to \nextend the same requirements for non-disclosure and non-complete \nagreements to IRS employees as this bill requires of outside \nconsultants.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Texas \nfor their comments, and I will certainly look at these issues as this \nlegislation moves to conference with the House.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2676, the Internal \nRevenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This bill is the \nproduct of an extensive examination of the IRS that began with the June \n1997 release of a report by the National Commission on Restructuring \nthe Internal Revenue Service, and ended with recent Finance Committee \nhearings on taxpayer abuse by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n  I am pleased that H.R. 2676 incorporates a number of key \nrecommendations from the National Commission's report, such as IRS \nrestructuring and the establishment of an Oversight Board. I believe \nrestructuring the IRS will enable the agency to meet the particular \nneeds of taxpayers such as individuals, small businesses, large \nbusinesses, and tax-exempt organizations, and be more responsive to \neach group's particular concerns.\n  In addition to incorporating recommendations from the Commission \nreport, the bill includes provisions to address taxpayer abuse and \nmismanagement practices by IRS that came to light during the Finance \nCommittee's hearings. I was, along with most other Americans, very \ndisturbed by the anecdotes of taxpayer abuse that were presented at the \nhearings. To the extent that H.R. 2676 will address these problems, I \nam very pleased to support the bill.\n  Notwithstanding my strong support for many of this bill's provisions, \nI do have concerns about its projected cost of $19.3 billion over 10 \nyears. Mr. President, this is triple the cost of the House-passed \nversion of H.R. 2676. Although the bill includes offsets which purport \nto make the bill revenue-neutral, these offsets are a ticking time bomb \nthat will explode beyond the 10 year budget window. For example, a \nprovision modifying IRA rollover rules will raise $8 billion between \n2003 and 2007. However, this provision will cost the Treasury a yet-to-\nbe determined amount of revenue after 2007. I find it difficult to vote \non a proposal that we know will be costly in the long-term, without \nhaving a definitive sense of its budgetary impact.\n  When coupling the rollover provision with provisions included in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act that are phased-in through 2007, such as capital \ngains tax cuts, ``back loaded'' IRAs, and estate tax cuts, it becomes \nclear that there will be significant pressures on the federal budget \nafter 2007. I believe that these provisions could seriously compromise \nmaintenance of a balanced budget. In addition, these provisions could \ngreatly complicate our efforts to address the long-term solvency issues \nassociated with the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have concerns that the bill could \ncompromise the ability of the IRS to carry out its core mission--\nenforcement of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, the enhanced \nappeal provisions in the bill may unintentionally make it easier for \nnoncompliant taxpayers to avoid paying the appropriate taxes. \nSimilarly, I am concerned that shifting the burden of proof in certain \ncircumstances will undermine enforcement efforts and have the \nunintended consequence of making audits more intrusive.\n  Mr. President, while I am supportive of H.R. 2676, I am hopeful that \nwe can work in Conference to address the concerns that I have raised, \nwhich are share by the Administration. Ultimately, I believe it is \npossible to pass a strong IRS restructuring bill that can address \ntaxpayer concerns, without busting the budget or undermining the \nmission of the IRS.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the IRS Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998. This bill, when fully implemented, will achieve 3 \nimportant objectives:\n  First, it will greatly benefit the American taxpayer who, all too \noften, has been the victim of overzealous and rogue IRS agents, has \nbeen caught, through no fault of his own, in a nearly impenetrable \nbureaucratic morass, or has received poor and discourteous service from \nIRS employees.\n  Second, the bill will significantly reorganize IRS management and \nprovide the IRS Commissioner with new authority over IRS employees.\n  Third, the bill establishes an IRS Oversight Board, comprised of \nprivate citizens, the Secretary of the Treasury and a union \nrepresentative, which will oversee the IRS in administration, \nmanagement, conduct, and direction. I believe, however, those \nprovisions which most directly benefit the American taxpayer are the \nreal crux of this bill.\n  We need effective reforms which restore public confidence in an \nagency which touches the lives of more people in this country than any \nother agency.\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\nI believe the establishment of a ``National Taxpayer Advocate'' will \nprovide a significant step toward restoring such confidence.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate, who will have a background in \ncustomer service and tax law, as well as have experience representing \nindividual taxpayers, will be one of the most important and critical \nlinks between taxpayers and the IRS. Significantly, the National \nTaxpayer Advocate will not be an IRS employee and cannot have been an \nIRS employee within two years of his or her appointment. This two year \nlimitation will help ensure the independence that taxpayers who avail \nthemselves of the Advocate's Office expect and deserve.\n  As I travel through my home state of California, the most frequent \ncomplaints I hear from Californians regarding the IRS are: (1) the \ndifficulty they have receiving assistance resolving problems with the \nIRS, and (2) the difficulty they have receiving guidance from the IRS \nrelative to their specific tax question or concern. I believe the \nestablishment of a National Taxpayer Advocate, as well as the creation \nof a system of local taxpayer advocates, will greatly enhance the \nability of taxpayers, in my home state and around the country, to \nreceive the assistance and guidance they seek.\n  Innocent Spouse relief is another provision of the bill that will \ndirectly benefit taxpayers. An ``innocent spouse'' is one--usually a \nwife--who signs a joint tax return not knowing that the information \ncontained therein, provided by the other spouse, is erroneous. While \nrelief from liability for tax, interest and penalties is currently \navailable for innocent spouses, that relief is only available in \ncertain limited and narrow circumstances.\n  The bill before us, however, would directly impact taxpayers by \nmodifying current law to permit a spouse to elect to limit his or her \nliability for unpaid taxes on a joint return to the spouse's separate \nliability amount. I believe this change will greatly enhance the \nability of an innocent spouse to establish his or her innocence.\n  The final ``taxpayer friendly'' provision of the bill I will mention \nis the creation of low-income taxpayer clinics. This provision will \nensure that low-income taxpayers, and taxpayers for whom English is a \nsecond language, receive tax services at a nominal fee. Such clinics \nare essential if low-income taxpayers, and taxpayers who have minimal \nEnglish proficiency are to be represented in controversies with the \nIRS.\n  This provision is particularly important in my home state. According \nto the 1990 Census, California is home to approximately 2.7 million \nindividuals who speak little or no English. Thus, about 35 percent of \nall individuals in the U.S. who are non-English speaking reside in \nCalifornia--almost twice the percentage of those non-English speaking \npersons that reside in Texas and almost three times the number that \nreside in New York. In addition, California is home to more \nimmigrants--2 million--than any state in the country. It is important, \ntherefore, that we provide these taxpayers with the help they need to \nbe tax compliant.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers that come into contact with the IRS, whether \nthey are merely asking questions or whether they are attempting to \nresolve a disputed claim, should be treated in a fair, respectful and \ncourteous manner. Unfortunately however, we have heard all too often \nover the past months, of many instances in which IRS employees treated \ntaxpayers rudely, abruptly, and yes, at times so abusively that the \noffending employee's action could only be called criminal.\n  While such actions cannot and should not be imputed to all IRS \nemployees, the overwhelming majority of whom are honest and \nhardworking, it is important to weed out any employee, even if it is \nonly one, who engages in abusive behavior toward law abiding taxpayers. \nTaxpayers deserve better.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I am very pleased to support this bill \ntoday and I hope that it is only the beginning of Congress' commitment \nto making the IRS more user friendly, improving the management of the \nIRS and streamlining an overly complex tax code.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, no longer is there any doubt that \nCongress must audit the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The hearings that have recently been held in the Senate Finance \nCommittee have brought out under the glare of public scrutiny what many \ntaxpayers already know from personal experience: the IRS needs reform. \nWe have been made aware of incidents of flagrant, unbridled abuse of \ngovernment authority which until now were known only to the victims of \nan agency that has expanded far beyond its intended size and scope and \nis clearly guilty of violating the public's trust.\n  While these problems have been successfully highlighted by the \nFinance Committee, I would like to take just a moment to reiterate some \nof the more glaring examples of IRS abuse:\n  Former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker was victimized by an IRS \nagent in Tennessee who, in an attempt to advance his own bureaucratic \ncareer, tried to frame Baker of money-laundering and bribery charges. \nAfter the agent was exposed, IRS authorities, rather than engaging in a \nreform effort to root out similar abuses in the future, tried to cover \nup for the rogue official.\n  IRS agents, armed with automatic weapons and attack dogs, raided John \nColaprete's business after a former bookkeeper, who had embezzled \n$40,000, leveled bizarre and unsubstantiated allegations. Again, the \ncharges were completely unfounded and none were filed.\n  Robert Gardner was subjected to a 33 month investigation that \ninvolved the IRS engaging in activities including the seizure of his \noffice property, feeding lies to a grand jury, and attempts to compel \nMr. Gardner's clients to wear hidden microphones.\n  I know from personal experience the problems the IRS can pose for \nhardworking Americans. For an agency that the American people give a \nsignificant portion of their money over to, customer service is not a \ntop priority. In February of 1996, for example, Mr. and Mrs. Robert \nWiester of Orofino lost their home and outbuildings when Big Canyon \nCreek flooded. On their federal income tax return, they justly claimed \na casualty loss, although their tax preparer put the loss on the wrong \nline of their 1040 form. The IRS then refigured their return and, \ninstead of the $1,206 refund the Wiesters were due, the IRS claimed \nthat they owed the government $15,885 in tax, interest, and penalties. \nWithin five months, the IRS contacted Mr. and Mrs. Wiester saying that \na levy was going to be placed on their property. After numerous \nfruitless calls to the IRS, the Wiesters contacted my office, and after \nI wrote the IRS six times, the Wiesters' problem was finally rectified, \nnearly ten months after the simple error on the 1040 form was made.\n  This type of behavior is no longer acceptable. The Senate will \nshortly pass the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, which will \nfundamentally overhaul the agency and make comprehensive, meaningful \nsteps toward reform. The bill: creates an IRS oversight board to \noversee every aspect of IRS operations; holds IRS employees accountable \nfor their actions by requiring the agency to terminate employees who \nviolate rules; suspends interest and penalty payments when the IRS does \nnot provide appropriate notice to taxpayers; shifts the burden of proof \nfrom the taxpayer to the IRS in legal proceedings; makes it illegal for \nExecutive Branch officials, such as the President, to audit people; \ncreates new performance standards for IRS employees so that they are no \nlonger ranked on collection goals; expands awards for attorney's fees \nand civil damages to taxpayers; expands attorney-client privilege to \naccountants; and requires a greater notification process for the IRS to \nplace liens, levies, or seizures on taxpayers's property.\n  I believe that this legislation is a meaningful step to reform the \ntax culture in Washington. Once the new majority took control of \nCongress in 1994, a three-step process has been implemented to \nfundamentally change the Washington tax culture: (1) Reduce the \ncollection, (2) reform the collector, and (3) replace the complexity. I \nam proud to say that this Congress has passed the largest tax cut in \nAmerican history as part of the first balanced budget in a generation. \nI have supported all of these measures, and will look forward to \nsupporting legislation that will substantially ``reform the collector'' \nand provide the American people with a fair, just, and responsive IRS.\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of reforms \nto our Internal Revenue Service.\n  As I'm sure my colleagues are aware, recent Senate Finance Committee \nHearings have brought to our attention the harrowing stories of \nAmerican citizens victimized by over-zealous IRS agents.\n  These agents, often on the flimsiest of evidence, have bent and \nsometimes broken rules intended to protect citizens from abuse--rules \nthat clearly must be strengthened and more effectively enforced in \norder to protect Americans' freedom and peace of mind.\n  In my view, Mr. President, the most harrowing stories related during \nFinance Committee hearings are made all the more troublesome because of \nclear evidence that they are horrible examples of widespread practices.\n  As one agent testified last fall, ``Abuses by the IRS * * * are \nindicative of a pervasive disregard of law and regulations designed to \nachieve production goals for either management or the individual \nagent.''\n  The use of quotas and statistics used as performance standards for \nadvancement within the IRS pit agents against taxpayers at great risk \nto individual liberties and good order.\n  It is time to put an end to the adversarial relationship between the \nIRS and the taxpayer. And there is only one way to properly accomplish \nthat task: by reforming and restructuring the IRS to make it more \nservice oriented and to ensure that it no longer disregards the \nfundamental rights of American citizens.\n  I would like today to give special attention to one situation I \nbelieve has caused a great deal of undue hardship to many Americans: I \nmean IRS regulations holding innocent people responsible for the tax \nliabilities of their ex-spouses.\n  In this regard, Mr. President, I would like to relate one all-too-\ntelling anecdote: Elizabeth Cockrell came to this country from Canada \nover 10 years ago, when she married an American. Unfortunately, her \nmarriage, to a stockbroker, lasted only 3 years. Since the marriage \nbroke up, she has concentrated on raising her child while holding down \na job and strengthening her roots in the community.\n  Imagine Ms. Cockrell's surprise when, 9 years after she and her \nhusband had been divorced, the Internal Revenue Service informed her \nthat she owned it $500,000.\n  It seems Ms. Cockrell's ex-husband had taken some deductions for tax \nshelters that the IRS had disallowed. This made him initially liable \nfor $100,000. But time had passed and the IRS had been unable to \ncollect from him. So Ms. Cockrell, who had nothing to do with her \nhusband's business and did not help figure out the taxes, was now being \nhounded for $500,000. Why? Because she signed a joint tax return.\n  And it turns out that even $500,000 is not enough for the IRS. With \nnew interest and penalties, the IRS now wants $650,000.\n  Ms. Cockrell has fought and tried to settle, all to no avail. But she \nis not alone.\n  Take for example the case of Karen Andreasen. Ironically, Ms. \nAndreasen was married to a former IRS employee.\n  Imagine her surprise, after their divorce, when she found out that \nher ex-husband, who had handled all of their financial affairs, had \nbeen forging her signature on joint returns.\n  Imagine her shock and dismay when, even though she had no income for \nthe years in question, the IRS came after her for her husband's tax \nliability. Ms. Andreasen has now been paying off the debt for years, \nand still has a tax lien on her house.\n  Mr. President, cases like these are all too common. The General \nAccounting Office estimates that every year 50,000 spouses, 90 percent \nof them women, are held liable in the same way as Ms. Cockrell and Ms. \nAndreasen.\n  These women, most of them working moms struggling to make ends meet, \nfor the most part had nothing to do with the income or accounting over \nwhich the IRS is pursuing them. And, as of now, they have no legal \nresource.\n  The Supreme Court just recently dismissed Ms. Cockrell's legal \nappeal, in which she claimed that innocent spouses should not be held \nliable for income they did not earn.\n  We cannot let this decision stand. That is why I support a provision \nin this legislation that would say clearly a person can only be held \nliable for the income that he or she has earned and failed to properly \nreport.\n  Under this provision, every American would remain liable for his or \nher own taxes. No tax cheats would be let off the hook. But innocent \nparties, men and especially women who had no part in filing any false \nclaims with the IRS beyond signing their name to a joint return, would \nno longer be held liable.\n  No longer would ex-wives be made to pay for the mistakes and/or \nmisdeeds of their ex-husbands.\n  No longer would the IRS be allowed to victimize innocent people \nmerely on account of a former marriage.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of women out there just like \nElizabeth Cockrell and Karen Andreasen. They deserve our support and \nprotection against an over-reaching IRS.\n  This is a crucial provision, in my view Mr. President. But it is only \none of a number of provisions that must be taken to stop the IRS from \npushing its agents to pursue cases to the detriment of American's \nfundamental rights.\n  It is my hope that all of my colleagues will see the necessity of \nprotecting the people from federal employees who are hired to provide a \nneeded service to the public, but who have been given no license to \nintimidate or violate their rights.\n  This legislation is an important step in our attempt to bring the IRS \nunder control. However, I think it is crucial to note that we will not \nbe able to put an end to our problems with the IRS unless we reform and \nsimplify the tax code.\n  Only by making the code simpler, flatter and more fair can we reduce \nthe role of the IRS in the taxpaying process. We must keep in mind, in \nmy view, that many of our current problems are the predictable results \nof decades of bad tax policy, and that it is up to us to reverse these \npolicies as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, a recent USA Today poll found that 69 percent of \nAmericans believe the IRS ``frequently abuses its powers.'' Fully 95 \npercent believe the tax code isn't working and must be changed. And who \ncan blame them? The current tax code is 5.5 million words long, it \nincludes 480 tax forms, and 280 publications explaining those forms.\n  By instituting fundamental tax reform, establishing one low marginal \nrate with fewer loopholes, by designing a tax form the size of a \npostcard, we can eliminate the huge IRS bureaucracy and many of the \nheadaches people experience in filing their taxes every year.\n  Once we take the necessary steps toward IRS reform included in this \nbill, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move on to fundamental \nreform of our tax code in the name of fairness, of efficiency, and of \nthe rights of the people of the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we will cast one the most important \nvotes of the 105th Congress. We will vote on reforming the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Of all the powers bestowed upon a government, the power of taxation \nis the one most open to abuse. As the agency responsible for \nimplementing and enforcing the tax laws that we here in Congress pass, \nno other agency touches the lives of American citizens more completely \nthan the IRS.\n  I believe that Americans understand and appreciate that they have to \npay taxes. Without their tax dollars, there would be no defense; no \nSocial Security, Medicare, or Medicaid; no environmental protections; \nno assistance for education or job training; no national parks, food \ninspection, or funds for highway and bridges.\n  But, everywhere I go in Utah, I hear from my constituents about their \nfrustrations. My office receives numerous letters each month detailing \ntaxpayer interactions with the IRS. It seem that everyone has had, or \nknows someone who has had, a bad experience with the IRS.\n  The stories range from small annoyances such as unanswered phones or \nlong periods of time spent on hold to shocking abuses such as \nunwarranted seizures of assets or criminal investigations being based \non false information for the purpose of personal revenue. It is small \nwonder that the taxpayers are scared and frustrated. These stories \nillustrate a disturbing trend. They are\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\ndramatic reminders of the failure of Congress to exercise adequate \noversight over a federal agency.\n  I have been here long enough to know that we are never going to be \nable to achieve a system where people do not get frustrated about \npaying their taxes--both the process of paying taxes and the amounts. \nLet's face it: paying taxes is not something we will ever enjoy doing.\n  We must, however achieve a system of collection that is efficient, \nfair, and, above all, honest. Unfortunately, throughout the hearings we \nhave held over the last several months and in the letters my office has \nreceived from constituents from my state of Utah and all over the \ncountry, we know that the current system often fails on these counts.\n  We have heard several horror stories from taxpayers, innocent \nspouses, IRS employees, and those who have been the subjects of \ncriminal raids and investigations. While these are the minority of the \ncases dealt with by the IRS, they still illustrate that serious abuses \nare occurring.\n  We are not taking about appropriate enforcement of the law. We are \ntalking about heavy-handed abuses of enforcement powers. At best, such \ntactics are counterproductive; at worst, it is reprehensible behavior \nby big government. It must stop.\n  The bill before us today gives the IRS Commissioner great flexibility \nto carry out a fundamental reorganization of the agency. But, it also \nplaces the IRS under an independent, most private-sector board to \noversee the big picture of operations at the agency. These are two very \nimportant elements to creating a new culture of the IRS: responsible \nleadership and accountability.\n  I commend the new Commissioner for the steps he has taken so far to \nrectify these problems at the IRS, and I encourage him to keep going. \nAnd, I hope he will not feel constrained by ``business as usual'' \nattitudes among those who have an interest in maintaining the current \nmethods. I hope the new Commissioner will shake any dead wood out of \nthe tree.\n  But Mr. Rosotti needs to know that Congress will hold him and the \nagency accountable. And, our expectations--and the expectations of the \nAmerican people--are not hard to fathom.\n  We do not expect tax delinquents or cheats to go undetected or \nunpenalized. But, we do expect the IRS to enforce our tax laws \nappropriately. We expect the IRS to assist taxpayers to understand and \ncomply with complicated laws and regulations. We expect taxpayers to be \ntreated courteously . We expect taxpayers' questions to be answered \npromptly and their returns processed efficiently. And, we expect any \npenalties to fit the crime.\n  Today, we will vote on a bill that takes a leap forward in \neradicating a culture that has allowed corruption and abuse to occur \nover and over again and to taint the efforts of honorable IRS \nemployees. There has been a lot of talk about changing the IRS into a \nservice-oriented agency, and the bill before us goes a long way towards \ndong just that. We cannot stop there, however.\n  While customer service is an important part of the equation, we must \ngo further and address taxpayer rights. The bill before us goes one \nmore step forward and will reform the penalty system, provide taxpayer \nmore protections from unwarranted seizures, and make the IRS more \naccountable for the actions of its agents.\n  This bill goes further than the legislation passed by our \ncounterparts in the House last fall. The Senate legislation expands key \naspects to grant taxpayers additional protections. The Senate bill adds \nprotections that allow spouses to choose proportional liability, award \nattorney's fees in more cases, require that the IRS specify to an \nindividual the details of any penalty imposed and suspend interest and \nsome penalties if the IRS does not provide notice of liability within \none year after a return is filed.\n  The bill would add several provisions dealing with the due process of \ntaxpayers including a requirement that the IRS notify taxpayers 30 days \nbefore a notice of federal lien, levy, or seizure is filed; a guarantee \nthat the taxpayer has 30 days to request a hearing by IRS Appeals; and \nthe opportunity for the taxpayer to petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals decision.\n  The bill also permits an issuer of tax-exempt bonds to appeal the \ndecision of the IRS through the tax court system. This will help \nprotect the individual taxpayers from having to go to court on an \nindividual basis to fight the IRS determination that a bond issue is \nnot tax-exempt. This is extremely important to those municipalities \nthat issue these bonds. These bonds are issued for tax-exempt purposes, \nsuch as to construct schools or build hospitals and universities. This \nis a good provision to provide an avenue of appeals for these bond \nissuers.\n  The legislation before us today will fundamentally change how the IRS \nworks. It is a necessary and bold set of initiatives. But, we cannot \njust declare victory and bask in the glow of a job well done. We must \nremember how we got to this point in the first place.\n  The IRS was not born evil, and it is not an inherently bad \norganization. Rather, it has suffered from decades of neglect and \ninadequate oversight. Once we have set the agency on the road to \nrecovery and given it the tools it needs to move forward, we must \ncontinue to guide it and ensure that the agency continues down the \nright road. We must continue to responsibly exercise our oversight \nresponsibility. We must have continued hearings, reviews, and \ncooperation. Left alone, any entity with power and authority will lose \nits way. Without continued oversight and cooperation, we will soon see \nthis debate repeated on the Senate floor.\n  This legislation can be summed up in one word--accountability. For \ntoo long, the IRS and its employees have operated in an environment \nwith little or no accountability. This bill changes all that. The \nlegislation before us makes individual IRS employees accountable for \ntheir actions. It makes management more accountable for the treatment \ngiven taxpayers and other employees. Finally, it makes the agency as a \nwhole more accountable to the Congress and the American taxpayer.\n  This debate has focused on the negative--on the abuses and misdeeds \nthat are the exception and not the rule. Just as a vast majority of the \ntaxpayers are honestly trying to comply with the tax code, the vast \nmajority of IRS employees are honest and hard working individuals doing \ntheir best in a very difficult and unpopular job.\n  Yes, abuses do occur, and we must reform the system to prevent \nimproper activities. At the same time, we must make sure that we \nacknowledge those employees who are doing their jobs with competence \nand integrity. These employees are the reason that most taxpayers \ntoday, even if frustrated by the forms and irritated with the amount of \ntheir tax bill, continue to comply.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. There are some things I would like to see \nchanged. For example, I have some serious concerns about the creation \nof an accountant-client privilege in this context. I am concerned that \nwe are using the Internal Revenue Code to effectively amend the Federal \nRules of Evidence. We have a clear procedure for amending these rules \nalready set out. Changing these rules is no simple matter. It should \nonly be done through careful, deliberate evaluation of the change and \nthe effect it will have on the judicial system. It should only be done \nwith input from the Judicial Conference of the United States and \nothers.\n  Despite these misgivings, Mr. President, I want to reiterate the \nimportance of the bill before us today. The IRS touchers more taxpayers \nin more aspects of their lives than probably any other agency. It is an \nimportant bill, and we must pass it.\n  The ultimate goal of reforming the IRS is to protect both the honest \ntaxpayer trying to comply with our complex tax laws and those honest \nemployees struggling to enforce an almost incomprehensible set of tax \nlaws with integrity. The bill before us today makes significant \nprogress toward that goal.\n  I want to commend Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, and my colleagues \non the Finance Committee for seeing this bill through. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, under the leadership of Chairman Roth, \nduring this Congress the Finance Committee undertook in-depth oversight \nof the workings of the Internal Revenue Service. With a week of \nhearings last year, followed by more hearings just last\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\nweek, the Senate brought the IRS under scrutiny, and revealed a side of \nthe agency not seen before.\n  What the Committee found at these hearings was alarming. We heard \nnumerous stories of outrageous action by the IRS, including:\n   a criminal agent who sought to ``make a name'' for himself by \nfabricating charges against prominent public officials;\n   IRS supervisors who gave preferential treatment to taxpayers \nrepresented by former co-workers and to taxpayers represented by \naccounting firms where the supervisors hoped to work;\n   IRS reviewers who reversed auditors' recommended tax increases when \ntaxpayers had competent, well-heeled representation, but allowed \nsimilar recommendations to go forward when a taxpayer didn't have a \nrepresentative;\n   and IRS agents who conducted armed raids on businesses, even though \nthere was no reason whatever to suspect violence or resistance.\n  When an organization has over one hundred thousand employees, I \nsuppose it is not surprising that some people are going to make \nmistakes. However, the abuses that came to light in the Finance \nCommittee hearings struck a responsive chord with the public. From the \nmail and phone calls I received, I worry that the problems we heard \nabout are not isolated incidents, but are symptomatic of an agency with \nreal management problems.\n  The bill adopted by the Finance Committee takes several approaches to \naddress some of these problems. The measure calls for new ways of \nstructuring, managing and overseeing the agency. The bill will ease \nsome of the burdens imposed on taxpayers and gives taxpayers important \nnew rights and protections to assert in their dealings with the IRS. \nThe legislation will help assure that taxpayers understand their rights \nand that they understand how the tax collection system works. Finally, \nit makes continued oversight by Congress easier.\n  One of the most important aspects of this bill is its provision for \nindependent review of IRS actions throughout the examination and \ncollection processes. A recurring complaint heard during the hearings \nwas that the IRS serves as police, prosecutor, judge and jury. This \nlegislation attempts to address that problem by calling for increased \nreview of IRS actions and by erecting walls between the various players \nin the tax collection process to assure that those reviews are truly \nindependent and not merely a rubber-stamp approval.\n  Under this measure IRS officers will not be able to seize assets \nwithout previous independent review by their supervisors, and taxpayers \ncan even request additional review of collection efforts. To assure the \nindependence of the appeals unit reviewing proposed changes to a \nperson's tax liability, the bill prohibits the appeals officer from \nhaving ex parte contact with the tax examiner who proposed the changes. \nWhen there are allegations of misconduct, the IRS will no longer \ninvestigate itself. Instead, inspections of alleged misconduct will be \nperformed by the Treasury Department. Together with a newly independent \nTaxpayer Advocate, and a new Oversight Board composed primarily of \noutsiders, these provisions will assure that actions adverse to \ntaxpayers are not taken without first having a fresh review by an \nunbiased eye.\n  New taxpayer rights will also ensure that the IRS conducts reviews to \nmake certain that the positions the agency takes are reasonable. The \nbill expands the situations in which taxpayers can recover costs \nincurred in defending themselves against the IRS. Under this bill, if \ntaxpayers hire a lawyer or accountant to represent them before the IRS, \nand the agency takes an unjustified position that results in no change \nin tax liability, the taxpayer will be able to recover the costs \nincurred to fight the IRS, including costs incurred in administrative \nproceedings. The bill also provides that if the IRS rejects a \ntaxpayer's offer to compromise a tax deficiency, continues to pursue \nthe taxpayer, and ends up recovering less than the taxpayer's offer, \nthe taxpayer can recover costs incurred after the time of the offer.\n  The IRS has the power to destroy people's lives. These provisions \nwill assure that this power is no longer concentrated in the hands of a \nsingle person and make more employees accountable for the agency's \nactions. The bill will also help ensure that proposed actions are \nreviewed for reasonableness.\n  IRS employees will be forced to take their new responsibilities \nseriously; negligence in the exercise of their duties could be the \nbasis for a new kind of taxpayer lawsuit.\n  I want to commend Chairman Roth for his historic hearings on the IRS. \nI also want to commend him for not capitulating to calls for quick \naction on the House-passed bill, when the Finance Committee hearings \nmade it apparent that more sweeping changes were needed. I believe that \nthis bill will go far to restore public confidence in the IRS.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the able Chairman of the \nFinance Committee (Mr. Roth), and to the distinguished ranking member \n(Mr. Moynihan) for their hard work and perseverance in bringing this \nIRS Reform legislation before the full Senate.\n  For a very long time, it has been obvious that the Internal Revenue \nService has a warped view of its intended role in the lives of \nAmericans. The IRS exists, of course, not to harass any taxpayer or to \nfind new and creative ways to abuse its authority, but to serve the \nAmerican people who, each year, fill the coffers of the U.S. Treasury.\n  The recent hearings held by the Finance Committee have made it \ncrystal clear that the Internal Revenue Service is an abysmal failure \nin carrying out its mission. Frankly, I don't know whether to be more \nhorrified by out-of-control IRS agents pursuing innocent taxpayers out \nof personal spite or double-dealing senior IRS managers trying to cover \nup such malicious conduct.\n  It hardly matters which is worse, because even one abuse of taxpayer \nrights at and by the IRS is one abuse too many. So I am pleased that \nCongress is taking this modest action to make sure the worm turns. For \nthe first time in a long time, the Senate appears ready to put the \ninterests of the taxpayer above the demands of the federal bureaucracy \nfor more and more revenue.\n  And while I support this measure as a first step in the long road \ntoward a more respectful treatment of the hapless American taxpayer, I \ntrust that it is indeed only the beginning, because the root cause of \nall of the shenanigans at the IRS is the byzantine complexity of a U.S. \ntax code crying out for reform.\n  Some years ago--in March of 1982, to be exact-- I introduced my \ninitial proposal for a flat tax on income. This proposal, and other \nflat tax proposals that have followed, would eliminate the huge \nbureaucracy of the IRS--a bureaucracy whose size and scope make the \nabuses uncovered by Senator Roth and the Finance Committee as \npredictable as they are inevitable.\n  I believe in the flat tax, and so do, Mr. President, the American \npeople. A Money magazine poll released in January of this year \nindicated nearly two-thirds of Americans prefer a flat tax to our \ncurrent system. I salute my colleagues, especially my distinguished \nfriend from Alabama (Mr. Shelby), for their courage in continuing to \nmake the case for tax simplification.\n  And lest you think I'm overstating the absolute travesty that is the \nUnited State Tax Code, Mr. President, there's something that you \nand every other American should read. Dan Mitchell, one of the bright \nyoung economists who works around the corner at The Heritage \nFoundation, recently released a paper entitled ``737, 734, 941, 858 \nReasons. . . and Still Counting: Why a Flat Tax is Needed to Reform the \nIRS.''\n\n  Mr. President, I do not exaggerate in saying that the statistics \ncontained in this paper boggle the mind. Take note with me of just a \ncouple of examples Mr. Mitchell has compiled to detail the economic \ncost of the tax code:\n   The private sector spends $157 billion dollars to comply with income \ntax laws.\n   The federal government spends $13.7 billion in, yes, taxpayer money \nto collect--what else?--taxpayer money.\n   It takes an estimated 5.4 billion hours for Americans to comply with \nfederal tax forms. In fact, the IRS itself estimates that it takes \nalmost 11 hours to fill out a 1040 form.\n  Then there's the sheer amount of paperwork required every time the \nlaw changes. Mr. Mitchell reports the following:\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\n   There are 5,557,000 words in the income tax laws and regulations. \nThat's 17,000 pages of paper. And get this: 820 additional pages were \nadded to the tax code by the 1997 budget act.\n   The IRS sends out an estimated 8 billion pages of forms and \ninstructions to taxpayers annually. For my colleagues who are \nparticularly interested in the environment, they should know that \n293,760 trees were needed to supply the paper.\n  It goes on and on, Mr. President. And I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of Mr. Mitchell's paper be printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending legislation in the Senate is \nobviously not a panacea for everything that is wrong at the Internal \nRevenue Service. But, as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles \nbegins with a single step.\n  I believe this IRS reform bill is that first step, and I hope that \nits swift passage by the Senate will help spark the serious debate on \ntax policy the American people are waiting for. It is my hope--and my \nbelief--that the Senate will begin in the very near future to respond \nto Americans' desire for real tax relief and real tax simplification.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      [From the Heritage Foundation Backgrounder, April 15, 1998]\n\n737,734,941,858 Reasons...and Still Counting: Why a Flat Tax is Needed \n                           to Reform the IRS\n\n                        (By Daniel J. Mitchell)\n\n       Last year, The Heritage Foundation released a publication, \n     ``577,951,692,634 Reasons...And Counting: Why a Flat Tax Is \n     Needed to Reform the IRS.'' Since that time, calls to reform \n     the Internal Revenue Service have led to unprecedented \n     hearings in Congress and outcry among the public. In 1997, \n     however, Congress moved away from reform and approved a tax \n     bill that adds even more complexity to the tax code. Because \n     of that bill, as well as Heritage's continued research into \n     the myriad nooks and crannies of the current tax code, \n     159,783,249,224 new reasons that the Internal Revenue Code \n     should be replaced with a flat tax have come to light, \n     bringing the total number of reasons to 737,734,941,858.\n       The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) frequently is cited as \n     the most hated of all government agencies. This aversion goes \n     well beyond a simple dislike of paying taxes. Many Americans \n     feel the IRS uses its vast power capriciously to enforce a \n     tax code that is unfair and incomprehensible. Indeed, a 1997 \n     national voter survey finds that the majority of respondents \n     would prefer to undergo a root canal than be audited by the \n     IRS. And a 1990 magazine survey finds that the most \n     frightening words people could imagine hearing when they \n     answer the phone are ``This is the IRS calling.'' Although \n     Americans have every right to be upset by the oppressive tax \n     system, their anger should not be directed at the IRS. The \n     vast majority of problems with the current tax system are the \n     inevitable result of bad tax policy.\n       The way to reduce the intense popular aversion to the IRS \n     is to enact a flat tax. By wiping out all the complicated, \n     obscure, and convoluted provisions of the current tax code, a \n     flat tax will reduce compliance costs and ease the \n     uncertainty and anguish that make April 15 everyone's least \n     favorite day of the year. In the words of former IRS \n     Commissioner Shirley Peterson, who directed the agency in \n     1992, ``We have reached the point where further patchwork \n     will only complicate the problem. It is time to repeal the \n     Internal Revenue Code and start over.'' As reported in The \n     Wall Street Journal last year, ``A recent survey of 275 IRS \n     workers around the nation, done by a national IRS \n     restructuring commission headed by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska \n     and Representative Portman of Ohio, found overwhelming \n     support within the IRS for simplifying the law.''\n       As the following enumeration demonstrates, almost all the \n     reasons cited for frustration with the IRS really constitute \n     arguments against the tax laws approved by politicians over \n     the past 80 years--and for a fair, simple, flat, tax.\n\n\n                the federal government as a tax goliath\n\n       The IRS is not only the most feared of government agencies, \n     it also is one of the biggest and most expensive. The agency \n     has more employees than the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Drug Enforcement Agency \n     combined, and its budget makes it a bigger consumer of tax \n     dollars than the Departments of Commerce, State, or the \n     Interior.\n\n\n                    the numbers speak for themselves\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       12,000 = The number of additional IRS employees needed to \n     answer phone inquiries from confused taxpayers during tax \n     filing season. Because taxpayers will need to know only the \n     amount of their wages and size of their families under a flat \n     tax, additional personnel are not needed.\n       $1,000 = The hourly collection quota placed on IRS agents \n     auditing individual taxpayers in the San Francisco office. \n     Although collection quotas violate the law, the current \n     system is so complex that the IRS assumes mistakes will be \n     found on every return. Errors will be very few under a simple \n     and transparent flat tax.\n       62,000,000 = The number of lines of computer code required \n     by the IRS to manage the current tax code. A simple flat tax \n     will ease the IRS's ongoing computer problems dramatically.\n       1,420 = The number of appraisals of works of art that an \n     IRS panel performed in order to tax the assets of dead \n     people. Because double taxation under a flat tax does not \n     exist, the absurdity of having the IRS value art would \n     disappear with the death (estate) tax.\n       3,200 = The number of threats and assaults IRS agents \n     experience over a five-year period. A fair and simple tax \n     system will reduce taxpayers' frustrations dramatically.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       136,000=The number of employees at the IRS and elsewhere in \n     the government who are responsible for administering the tax \n     laws. Because the number needed is dictated by the complexity \n     of the tax code, fewer personnel will be needed under a flat \n     tax, and the downsizing of the IRS will save taxpayers a \n     significant amount of money.\n       13,700,000,000=The amount of tax money spent by the IRS and \n     other government agencies to enforce and oversee the tax \n     code. Both taxpayers and the economy will benefit from the \n     spending reductions made possible by a flat tax.\n       17,000=The number of pages of IRS laws and regulations, not \n     including tax court decisions and IRS letter rulings. This \n     page count would be reduced significantly by a flat tax.\n       5,557,000=The number of words in the income tax laws and \n     regulations. With a flat tax, there will be no need for a tax \n     code that is nearly seven times longer than the Bible.\n\n\n                         the irs paper machine\n\n       With so many employees, so much money, and such a \n     cumbersome tax code, it should come as no surprise that the \n     IRS is one of the country's biggest paper-pushers.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       820=The number of pages added to the tax code by the 1997 \n     budget act. A flat tax will slash it to a fraction of its \n     current size.\n       250=The number of pages needed to explain just one \n     paragraph in the Internal Revenue Code. A simple flat tax \n     will avoid needless IRS regulation.\n       271=The number of new regulations issued by the IRS in \n     1997. By putting an end to constant social engineering, a \n     flat tax will halt the IRS's constant rewriting of the tax \n     rules.\n       261=The number of pages of regulations needed to clarify \n     the tax code's ``arms-length standard'' for international \n     intercompany transactions.\n       569=The number of tax forms available on the IRS Web site. \n     Only two postcard-size forms will be necessary under a flat \n     tax: One for wages, salaries, and pensions, the other for \n     business income.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       31=The number of pages of fine print in the instructions \n     for filing out the ``easy'' 1996 1040EA individual tax form. \n     By contrast, individuals will need just one page of \n     instructions to fill out a flat tax postcard.\n       8,000,000,000=The number of pages in the forms and \n     instructions the IRS sends out every year. Under a flat tax, \n     the postcard-sized forms are virtually self-explanatory.\n       36=The number of times the paperwork the IRS receives would \n     circle the earth each year. Complexity and paperwork will all \n     but vanish under a simple flat tax that treats all citizens \n     equally.\n       293,760=The number of trees it takes each year to supply \n     the 8 billion pages of paper used to file income taxes in the \n     United States. A flat tax using two simple postcards \n     obviously will be more friendly to the environment.\n       1,000,000,000=The number of 1099 forms sent out each year \n     to help the IRS track taxpayers' interest and dividend \n     income. Under a flat tax, business and capital income taxes \n     will be collected at the source, thereby eliminating this \n     paperwork conundrum.\n\n\n                          the irs briar patch\n\n       Much to the chagrin of taxpayers, the IRS does not focus \n     solely on generating paperwork. Tasked with enforcing the \n     cumbersome tax code, the agency has numerous unwelcome \n     contacts with taxpayers every year.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       33,984,689=The number of civil penalties assessed by the \n     IRS in 1996. Because a flat tax will be so fair and simple, \n     the IRS will have little reason to go after taxpayers.\n       10,000=The number of properties seized by the IRS in 1996. \n     Part of this problems is caused by the government's trying to \n     take too much money from people, and part is caused by \n     complexity. A flat tax will reduce the government's take and \n     eliminate complexity.\n       750,000=The number of liens issued by the IRS against \n     taxpayers in 1996. A simple, low flat tax will result in \n     fewer fights between the government and taxpayers.\n       2,100,000=The number of IRS audits conducted in 1996. \n     Without all the complex provisions in the code under a flat \n     tax, the IRS will have few returns to audit.\n       85=The percentage of taxpayers selected by the IRS for \n     random audits who had incomes\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\n     less than $25,000. A complicated tax code benefits the \n     wealthy, who can fight back. A flat tax will be good news for \n     those with more modest incomes.\n       47=The percentage of taxpayers living in just 11 southern \n     states subject to random audits. Because audits will decline \n     dramatically under a flat tax, so will discriminatory audit \n     patterns like this one.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       10,000,000=The number of corrections notices the IRS sends \n     out each year. With a simple and fair tax system like a flat \n     tax, mistakes will become rare.\n       190,000=The number of disputes between the IRS and \n     taxpayers in 1990 that required legal action. In a flat tax \n     environment, there will be few potential areas of \n     disagreement, and legal action will become scarce.\n       3,253,000=The number of times the IRS seized bank accounts \n     or paychecks in 1992.\n       33,000,000=The number of penalty notices the IRS sent out \n     in 1994. Because a flat tax will eliminate complex parts of \n     the tax code, the number of disagreements between taxpayers \n     and the agency will plummet.\n\n\n                     Do as They Say, Not as They Do\n\n       The IRS is quite strict with taxpayers who make mistakes, \n     but the following examples illustrate that it would have a \n     hard time living up to the standards imposed on taxpayers.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       15=The number of years the IRS believes it will need to \n     modernize its computer system. A simple, flat tax will not \n     require complex computer systems.\n       1,000,000=The number of Americans who received tax forms \n     with erroneous mailing labels in 1998.\n       20=The percentage error rate at the IRS for processing \n     paper returns. Even children would be able to process \n     postcard returns under a flat tax.\n       6,400=The number of computer tapes and cartridges lost by \n     the IRS. Once a flat tax is implemented, these tapes and \n     cartridges could remain lost.\n       22=The percentage of times reporters for Money magazine \n     received inaccurate or incomplete information in 1997 when \n     calling the IRS's toll-free hot line. To file a return under \n     a flat tax, Americans will need to know only the size of \n     their families and the amount of their wages, salaries, and \n     pensions; they will not need to call the IRS.\n       40=The percentage of times Money magazine reporters \n     received wrong answers in 1997 in face-to-face visits at IRS \n     customer service offices. A flat tax will be so simple that \n     such mistakes will become almost non-existent.\n       $800,000,000=The estimated cost to update the IRS's \n     computers for the year 2000. Scrapping the tax code for a \n     flat tax will allow the government to institute a simpler \n     computer system.\n       500,000=The number of address changes made to correct the \n     master file by IRS employees each year.\n       78=The percentage of IRS audit assessments on corporations \n     that eventually are disqualified. A flat tax will replace the \n     onerous corporate tax with a simple, postcard-based system.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       8,500,000=The number of times the IRS gave the wrong answer \n     to taxpayers seeking help to comply with the tax code in 1993 \n     (taxpayers still are held responsible for errors that result \n     from bad advice from the IRS). A flat tax will be so simple \n     that taxpayers rarely--if ever--will need to call the IRS.\n       47=The percentage of calls to the IRS that resulted in \n     inaccurate information, according to a 1987 General \n     Accounting Office study. A flat tax will free IRS personnel \n     from the impossible task of deciphering the convoluted tax \n     code.\n       5,000,000=The number of correction notices the IRS sends \n     out each year that turn out to be wrong. An error rate of 50 \n     percent will be impossible under a flat tax.\n       40=The percentage of revenue that is returned when \n     taxpayers challenge penalties. Under a flat tax, penalties \n     will become rare, so fewer penalties will be assessed \n     incorrectly.\n       $500,000,000=The amount of money that taxpayers were \n     overcharged for penalties in 1993. After a flat tax goes into \n     effect, such injustice will all but disappear.\n       3,000,000=The number of women improperly fined each year \n     because they have divorced or  remarried. Taxing income at \n     the source under a flat tax will eliminate such \n     travesties.\n       10,000,000=The number of taxpayers who will receive lower \n     Social Security benefits because the IRS failed to inform the \n     Social Security Administration about tax payments. A simple \n     flat tax is likely to free enough IRS time and resources to \n     fix this problem.\n       $200,000,000,000=The amount of misstated taxpayer payments \n     and refunds on the books of the IRS. The IRS is no more able \n     to administer tax laws that defy logic than is the average \n     taxpayer. A flat tax will rectify this problem.\n       64=The percentage of its own budget for which the IRS could \n     not account in 1993, according to an audit by the U.S. \n     General Accounting Office.\n       $8,000,000,000=The amount the IRS spent to upgrade its \n     computer system unsuccessfully. Under a flat tax, this money \n     will be saved because the IRS no longer will need to track an \n     impossibly complex and unfair tax system.\n       $23,000,000,000=The total proposed price for the IRS's \n     computerization and modernization plans by 2008.\n\n\n               being compliant and miserable on april 15\n\n       Sending huge amounts of tax money to Washington, DC, is \n     never pleasant. Having to incur huge compliance costs for the \n     privilege of paying taxes, however, really rubs salt in the \n     tax wound.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       6,400,000=The number of taxpayers who visited IRS customer \n     service centers seeking answers to their tax questions in \n     1996. With a flat tax, few taxpayers will need help.\n       99,000,000=The number of taxpayers trying to comprehend the \n     tax system who called IRS hotlines in 1996. So long as a \n     taxpayer knows his income and the size of his family under a \n     flat tax, he will have nothing to worry about.\n       30 years=The number of years a dispute can last between the \n     IRS and a corporation. Even one-year disputes will be rare \n     under a flat tax.\n       8,000,000=The increase in the number of taxpayers who will \n     be subject to the alternative minimum tax by 2007. This \n     absurd provision forces taxpayers to calculate their income \n     two ways and then pay the government the higher of the two \n     amounts. It will disappear under a flat tax.\n       $134,347,500,000=The Clinton Administration's estimate of \n     private-sector compliance costs. If the defenders of the \n     status quo admit compliance costs are this high, the actual \n     costs may well be even higher.\n       653=The number of minutes the IRS estimates it takes to \n     fill out a 1040 form. A flax tax postcard can be filled out \n     in five minutes.\n       72=The number of inches of height of the stack of tax forms \n     in the Chrysler Corporation's tax return. A postcard return \n     is only a fraction of one inch in height.\n       6,000,000=The number of unanswered phone calls made to the \n     IRS in January and February 1998. Considering that answered \n     calls frequently result in mistakes, taxpayers who fail to \n     get through probably should feel lucky.\n       2,400,000=The number of phone calls to the IRS that \n     resulted in busy signals in January and February 1998. A busy \n     signal is better than a wrong answer because the IRS holds \n     taxpayers liable for mistakes even if they are following IRS \n     advice.\n       56=The percentage of calls to the IRS in 1997 that went \n     unanswered. Again, no answer is better than a wrong answer.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       $157,000,000,000=The amount spent by the private sector to \n     comply with income tax laws. Under a flat tax, these costs \n     will drop by more than 90 percent.\n       $7,240=The average compliance cost incurred by all but the \n     biggest 10 percent of corporations for every $1,000 of taxes \n     paid in 1992. The radical simplification brought about by a \n     flat tax will be a boon for small businesses that cannot \n     maintain legal and accounting staffs to comply with the tax \n     code.\n       50=The percentage of taxpayers who feel compelled to obtain \n     assistance in filling out their taxes each year.\n       5,400,000,000=The number of hours it takes Americans to \n     comply with federal tax forms. With only two postcard-sized \n     forms, compliance under a flat tax will require minutes, not \n     hours.\n       2,943,000=The number of full-time equivalent jobs spent on \n     compliance. In the flat tax world, the cost of tax compliance \n     will fall by more than 90 percent.\n       $3,055,680,000=The market value of the tax preparation firm \n     H Block, Inc., which opposes a flat tax. The \n     company's opposition is understandable because a flat tax \n     will allow anyone to fill out a tax return without paying \n     an expert.\n\n\n                even experts can't figure out the forms\n\n       Jumping through all the tax hoops might not be so painful \n     if taxpayers at least could be confident that the effort led \n     to accuracy. The ultimate insult added to their injury, \n     however, is that even ``expert'' advice is no guarantee of \n     receiving correct answers to tax code questions.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       $24,000,000,000=The difference between what corporations \n     said they owed and what the IRS said they owed in 1992--a gap \n     the government admits is due to ambiguity and complexity in \n     the code. A flat tax will eliminate the confusion embedded in \n     the current system.\n       46=The number of wrong answers Money magazine received in \n     1998 when it asked 46 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family's 1997 tax liability. Professional \n     assistance will not be necessary with a simple, flat tax.\n       $34,672=The difference in liability between the highest and \n     lowest incorrect answers among the 46 professionals who \n     failed to calculate the tax liability of Money magazine's \n     hypothetical family. Such responses will be all but \n     impossible under a flat tax.\n       $610=The amount the hypothetical family would have overpaid \n     on its 1997 taxes if it had used the answer that came closest \n     to the actual tax liability (assuming, of course that Money \n     magazine's expert had filled out the tax return correctly). \n     Any mistakes, especially large ones, will be unlikely under a \n     flat tax.\n       45=The number of professional tax preparers who came up \n     with different answers when asked by Money magazine in 1997 \n     to fill out a hypothetical family's 1996 tax return.\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\n       45=The number of professional tax preparers who came up \n     with wrong answers when asked by Money magazine in 1997 to \n     fill out a hypothetical family's 1996 tax return.\n       76=The percentage of professional tax preparers who missed \n     the right answer by more than $1,000. This kind of result \n     will be impossible under a flat tax.\n       $58,116=The difference between the lowest estimate of the \n     family's tax bill and the highest estimate in Money's survey \n     of tax professionals. Because the complexities in the tax \n     code will disappear under a flat tax, mistakes like this \n     will, too.\n       $81=The average hourly fee charged by the professional \n     preparers who came up with the 45 wrong answers. Taxpayers \n     will pay nothing to calculate their own taxes on postcards \n     under a flat tax.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       50=The number of different answers that 50 tax experts gave \n     Money magazine in 1988 when asked to estimate a hypothetical \n     family's tax liability. Under a flat tax, taxpayers will not \n     need to consult tax preparers, much less run the risk of \n     paying penalties for wrong answers.\n       50=The number of different answers Money magazine received \n     in 1989 when it asked 50 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family tax liability.\n       48=The number of wrong answers Money magazine received in \n     1990 when it asked 50 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family's tax liability.\n       49=The number of different answers Money magazine received \n     in 1991 when it asked 50 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family's tax liability.\n       50=The number of wrong answers Money magazine received in \n     1992 when it asked 50 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family's tax liability.\n       41=The number of wrong answers Money magazine received in \n     1993 when it asked 50 different tax experts to estimate a \n     hypothetical family's tax liability (9 of the original \n     volunteers did not bother even to respond).\n\n\n                      the never-ending shell game\n\n       The needless complexity of the current tax code helps \n     explain the reasons that both the IRS and private tax experts \n     frequently make mistakes. Another reason that taxpayers have \n     a problem complying with the law is that politicians have \n     made the tax code a moving target.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       824=The number of changes in the tax code accompanying the \n     1997 tax cut. A flat tax will put an end to constant social \n     engineering.\n       285=The number of new sections in the tax code created by \n     the 1997 budget act. A flat tax will eliminate most of the \n     tax code.\n       3,132=The number of pages needed by the Research Institute \n     of America to explain the changes in the tax law in 1997. \n     Flat tax postcards needed just one page of instructions.\n       11,410=The number of tax code subsection changes between \n     1981 and 1997. A flat tax will eliminate most of those \n     subsections.\n       160=The percentage increase in the stock value of tax \n     preparation firms in the three-month period during and after \n     enactment of the 1997 budget.\n       54=The number of lines on the new capital gains form, up \n     from 23 before the 1997 budget deal. Because double taxation \n     will end under a flat tax, the capital gains form will \n     disappear.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       878 = The number of times major sections of the tax code \n     were amended between 1955 and 1994. A flat tax will eliminate \n     today's confusingly complex tax code and replace it with a \n     simple system that does away with constant tinkering and \n     social engineering.\n       100 = The increase in the number of forms between 1984 and \n     1994. A flat tax will eliminate all 100 forms.\n       9,455 = The number of tax code subsections changed between \n     1981 and 1994. Under a flat tax, politicians will not be able \n     to use the tax code to micromanage economic or social \n     behavior.\n       578 = The percentage increase in the number of tax code \n     sections between 1954 and 1994 that deal with major segments \n     of tax law. Endless changes in tax law will grind to a halt \n     under a flat tax.\n       5,400 = The cumulative number of changes in tax law since \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act. Most, if not all, of these changes \n     add compliance costs to the economy--costs that a flat tax \n     will reduce substantially or eliminate.\n       $20,500,000,000 = The amount of lost income the economy \n     suffered in 1993 as a result of the economic uncertainty in \n     the business community caused by the constant manipulation of \n     the tax code. To help prevent politicians from undermining \n     business planning by constantly changing the tax laws, a flat \n     tax law should include a supermajority provision blocking \n     such tax rate increases.\n\n\n                           The Augean Stables\n\n       The problem is not the IRS, but the politicians who created \n     the incomprehensible tax code and those who refuse to reform \n     the system. Politicians also are practically the only people \n     in the country who benefit from a complex and constantly \n     changing tax code.\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       $400,000,000 = The amount of the special tax break for one \n     corporation inserted in the tax code in 1986 at the urging of \n     Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL), then chairman of the House Ways and \n     Means Committee. A flat tax will wipe out provisions for \n     special-interest groups.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       $413,072 = The average amount of political action committee \n     contributions received by members of the House of \n     Representatives tax-writing committee during the 1994 \n     election cycle. A flat tax will reduce special-interest \n     corruption and eliminate the ability of politicians to use \n     the tax code to reward friends and punish enemies.\n       12,609=The number of special-interest organizations \n     officially represented by congressional lobbyists. A flat tax \n     will wipe out all special preferences, loopholes, deductions, \n     credits, and tax shelters.\n       $3,200,000,000=The total amount earned by Washington, D.C., \n     lobbyists in 1993. By taking away the playing field for \n     special-interest tinkering, a flat tax will clean up \n     political pollution.\n       2=The number of IRS offices in Washington, D.C., made \n     available to Members of Congress and their staffs. With \n     someone else doing their taxes--free--it is little wonder \n     that Members of Congress do not understand the public support \n     for a flat tax.\n\n\n                       Why Johnny Refuses to Pay\n\n       There comes a point at which taxpayers simply give up. Some \n     are driven into the underground economy by the sheer \n     complexity of the system. Others conclude that an unfair tax \n     code has no moral legitimacy and simply refuse to comply.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       $127,000,000,000=The amount of taxes not paid as a result \n     of tax evasion. A fair, simple, flat tax will reduce tax \n     evasion.\n       10,000,000=The number of people who unlawfully do not file \n     tax returns. By reducing both the tax burden and compliance \n     costs, a flat tax will bring people out of the underground \n     economy.\n       3,500,000=The number of people who do not file who would be \n     eligible for refunds. Perhaps more than any other number, the \n     millions of people who fail to file in order to claim their \n     tax refunds reveals just how intimidating the tax code has \n     become.\n       4=The number of times a single dollar of income can be \n     taxed under the current system, counting the capital gains \n     tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax, and death \n     (estate) tax. By eliminating double taxation, a flat tax will \n     make sure the government treats all income equally and will \n     end one of the biggest causes of tax evasion and complexity \n     in the current tax code.\n       100,000=The number of Internet sites found by one search \n     engine when queried for the phrase ``tax shelter.''  Because \n     a flat tax will eliminate all discrimination in the tax code \n     and allow people to keep a greater share of their income, tax \n     shelters will almost vanish after reform.\n\n\n                            Enough is Enough\n\n       The damage caused by the current tax code, both to the \n     economy and to the body politic, is reaching crisis \n     proportions. Insulated from the effects of their own \n     handiwork, however, politicians are very likely to be the \n     last ones to understand just how indefensible the system has \n     become. Perhaps these real examples of IRS abuse will help \n     them to understand the problem:\n\n                              New Evidence\n\n       $3,500=The amount one woman was forced to pay twice, even \n     though the IRS eventually admitted the debt had been owed--\n     and paid--by her former husband.\n       $210,260=The amount the IRS tried to garnish from the wages \n     of a woman for the back taxes her husband had owed before \n     their marriage.\n       $26=The amount the IRS seized from a 6-year-old's bank \n     account because her parents owed money.\n       $70,000=The amount demanded by an IRS agent who was \n     threatening to send a couple to jail in a case that the tax \n     court subsequently dismissed because the IRS's claim ``was \n     not reasonable in fact or in law.'' \n       $50,000=The amount the IRS was forced to pay a taxpayer \n     after engaging in a vendetta against him, including putting \n     the innocent man in jail for four months.\n       $6,484,339=The amount demanded by the IRS from the family \n     of a victim of Pan Am flight 103, based on the assumption of \n     a future settlement.\n       $900,000=The amount a small businessman was fined after \n     being entrapped by his accountant, a paid informer for the \n     IRS.\n       $5,300,000=The amount the IRS paid its informants in 1993.\n       25=The percentage of households with incomes over $50,000 \n     that would pay an inaccurate assessment from the IRS rather \n     than fight.\n\n                          What We Already Knew\n\n       $46,806=The amount of tax penalty imposed on one taxpayer \n     in 1993 for an alleged underpayment of 10 cents.\n       $1,300=The number of IRS employees investigated and/or \n     disciplined for improperly viewing the tax returns of \n     friends, neighbors, and others.\n       $155=The amount of penalty imposed on a tax-payer in 1995 \n     for an alleged underpayment of 1 cent.\n       50=The percentage of top IRS managers who admitted they \n     would use their position to intimidate personal enemies.\n       $14,000=The amount allegedly owed by a day-care center that \n     was raided by armed agents, who then refused to release the \n     children until parents pledged to give the government money.\n       80 = The number of IRS agents referred for criminal \n     investigation on charges of taking kickbacks for fraudulent \n     refund checks.\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n       $3,000,000,000 = The dollar assets of Princeton/Newport, an \n     investment company that was forced into liquidation after 40 \n     armed federal agents raided the company on suspicion of tax \n     evasion--only to have the IRS later conclude that Princeton/\n     Newport actually had overpaid its taxes.\n       $10,000 = The fine imposed on one taxpayer for using a 12-\n     pitch typewriter to fill out his tax forms instead of a 10-\n     pitch typewriter.\n       109 = The number of envelopes containing unprocessed \n     information found in the trash at the IRS's Philadelphia \n     Service Center.\n       Grand Total: More than 737 billion incredible-but-true \n     reasons to simplify the tax code with a flat tax.\n\n\n                     what these numbers really mean\n\n       These horror stories and statistics are not necessarily \n     evidence that individual IRS agents are bad people, or that \n     tax administrators want to violate people's rights. Although \n     examples of unwarranted behavior are included in this \n     discussion, the key problem they illustrate is that current \n     tax law is so arbitrary and incomprehensible that even \n     government agents in charge of enforcing the law cannot make \n     sense of it.\n       The only way to address these problems is through \n     fundamental reform. A flat tax will reduce the power of the \n     IRS dramatically by eliminating the vast majority of possible \n     conflicts. In a system in which the only information \n     individuals are obligated to provide is their total income \n     and the size of their families, much of the uncertainty and \n     fear regarding paying taxes will disappear.\n       Most individuals never have to experience the greater \n     complexities of paying corporate income taxes; still, they \n     can appreciate the fact that a flat tax will generate \n     dramatic savings for business. Under a flat tax, the money \n     that businesses now spend to comply with the tax code will \n     become available instead for higher wages and increased \n     investment, thereby helping the United States to become more \n     competitive.\n       Although the key principle of a flat tax is equality, it \n     turns out that a system based on taxing all income just one \n     time at one low rate also promotes simplicity. To understand \n     the reasons that introducing a flat tax would lead to such a \n     dramatic reduction in both tax code complexity and compliance \n     costs, consider the following numbers:\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have \n     to calculate depreciation schedules.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have \n     to keep track of itemized deductions.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will need \n     to reveal their assets to the government.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will lose \n     their farms or businesses because of the death (estate) tax.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have \n     to pay a double tax on their capital gains.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have \n     to compute a phase-out of their personal exemption because \n     their incomes are too high.\n       0 = The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will be \n     subject to the alternative minimum tax--those forced to \n     calculate their tax bill two different ways and then to pay \n     the government the greater of the two amounts.\n       0=The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have to \n     pay taxes on overseas income that already was taxed by the \n     government of the country in which the income was earned.\n       0=The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will have to \n     pay taxes on dividend income that already was taxed at the \n     business level.\n       0=The number of taxpayers under a flat tax who will be \n     taxed on interest income that already was taxed at the \n     financial institution level.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Those who urge policymakers to ``fix'' the IRS should \n     realize that condemning the agency itself will not solve the \n     intractable problems of the current tax code. Furthermore, \n     enacting a ``taxpayer bill of rights'' will accomplish little \n     if provisions of the tax code that constitute the underlying \n     problem are left in place. At least two versions of a \n     ``taxpayer bill of rights'' previously enacted into law have \n     had little effect.\n       Americans rapidly are approaching the level of anger toward \n     unfair, capricious, and oppressive taxation that gave rise to \n     the American Revolution in 1776. This anger is directed at an \n     immense and impersonal government agency that often operates \n     outside the standards it imposes on taxpayers. Americans \n     should be angry, but not at the IRS: They should direct their \n     anger toward the Members of Congress responsible for enacting \n     the laws that created today's tax code.\n       The only effective way to enhance compliance and slash \n     compliance costs while protecting the rights and freedoms of \n     individual taxpayers is to scrap the current system and \n     replace it with a fair, simple, flat tax.\n\n                    CONSOLIDATED RETURN REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nan important economic development matter for the people of Ohio. \nCurrently included in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \nReform Act of 1998 is a technical correction that would attempt to \nresolve an apparent conflict that exists between consolidated return \nregulations and section 1059 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It \nis very important that this area of the tax code and regulations be \nclarified so that it does not create an impediment to the expansion of \nbusinesses in the State of Ohio and throughout the country.\n  While the technical correction that was included in the IRS reform \nbill is a good start toward resolving this conflict of the consolidated \nreturn regulations and section 1059, further clarification is needed. I \nam hopeful that as the IRS reform bill proceeds to conference that the \nconferees will take another look at the technical correction and work \ntoward correcting this conflict.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator for bringing this to my attention and I \ncan assure the Senator that we will take a look at this in conference.\n  Mr. COATS. ``The power to tax involves the power to destroy.''\n  Mr. President, this famous quote by Chief Justice John Marshall, from \nthe landmark Supreme Court case McCullough versus Maryland, rings as \ntrue today as it did in 1819. The Internal Revenue Service, through its \nunchecked powers of taxation, has been destroying the lives of honest, \nhard-working, Americans for many years. This systemic abuse has been \nwell documented in the recent oversight hearings on the IRS conducted \nby the Senate Finance Committee. I rise today to support the IRS Reform \nand Restructuring Legislation unanimously approved by the Finance \nCommittee. This bill will effectively end this agency's reckless \ndisregard of taxpayer rights.\n  We have all heard the horror stories of taxpayer mistreatment \ninflicted by the IRS. From armed IRS agents raiding innocent taxpayers \nhomes to Americans being subjected to years of harassment and \nunsubstantiated audits. A few years back one such incident of \nineptitude occurred in my own State of Indiana. One of my \nconstituents--who gave me permission to tell his story, but asked that \nI not disclose his name for fear of retribution from the IRS--was \ngetting ready to buy Christmas dinner for himself and his family. This \ngentleman was shocked to learn that he had no money in his bank \naccount. His entire savings account had been wiped clean by the IRS for \n``Back Taxes and Penalties.'' Upon calling the IRS, he was told that \nhis tax form from 1987 was missing and he had not answered any of the \nregistered letters sent to him.\n  Of course, the IRS sent the registered letters to the address he had \nlived at in 1987, not his current address--the address from which he \ncorrectly filed his taxes (and got returns) for the five subsequent \nyears!!!\n  This outrageous tale of mismanagement does not end there. A few \nmonths later--after some paper shuffling at the IRS--this gentleman was \ntold that based on the information that he provided the IRS actually \nowned him a refund of $1500!!!! However, the statute of limitations on \nrefunds had run out and he would not be getting his check. My \nconstituent was not happy with this recent development, but considered \nthe matter over. Of course, ten days later a check for $1500 arrived on \nhis doorstep. Only at the IRS!!!!\n  The stories of abuse and mismanagement have come not only from \ntaxpayers, but from IRS employees as well. Past IRS employees describe \nan agency rife with ineptitude and misconduct. They detail scenarios in \nwhich agents were told to target lower-income individuals or those of \nmodest education for audits. One agent testified that ``Abuses by the \nIRS are indicative of a pervasive disregard of law and regulations \ndesigned to achieve production goals for either management or the \nindividual agent.'' Further, auditors have testified of favoritism \nbeing extended to wealthy individuals and powerful corporations. It is \nobvious that we are dealing with an agency that is out-of-control.\n  Throughout history, tax collectors that overtaxed or abused taxpayers \nwere treated with much disdain. In ancient Egypt, a corrupt tax \ncollector who exploited the poor had his nose cut-off. During the \nFrench Revolution, tax collectors kept their noses, but lost their \nheads to the guillotine. But in America, we have a different, \ninnovative method for treating overzealous tax collectors--we reward \nthem with promotions and bonuses!! One particular corrupt agent stole \n20 cars and was\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nable to retire with full benefits!! Other agents and divisions were \nevaluated solely on whether they had achieved certain quotas. The \nmessage given from management to the agents was that the ends always \njustify the means.\n  It is disgraceful that an agency of the greatest democracy in the \nworld could have attributes that would be better associated with a \nparamilitary wing of a despotic regime. It is high time we passed this \nlegislation and urged the new commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Charles \nRossotti, to conduct a thorough house-cleaning.\n  The IRS exists to serve the American people--not the other way \naround. There must be more accountability for the IRS and more \nprotection for the taxpayer. Efficiency and honesty should be twin \ngoals for the IRS. H.R. 2676--the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998--is a first step towards achieving \nthis end.\n  Mr. President, I will end with another quote from a Supreme Court \nJustice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. This quote has substantial meaning \nin this debate because it adorns the wall of the IRS building here in \nWashington.\n  ``Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.''\n  If that is in fact the case, it is time we demand that the Internal \nRevenue Service act in a civilized manner.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nto reform the Internal Revenue Service. The Finance Committee deserves \ntremendous credit for leading the reform effort and conducting hearings \nto illustrate the tremendous concerns. The legislation will help \nrestore public confidence in a very troubled agency.\n  Last summer, the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal \nRevenue Service, under the leadership of Senator Bob Kerry and \nRepresentative Portman, issued its report to reform the agency, The \nFinance Committee conducted several days of hearings, receiving \ncompelling testimony, regarding a variety of concerns with the \nactivities of the IRS. It's clear that these problems transcend any \nsingle administration, but reflect years of neglect, improper \nincentives, inadequate training and mismanagement.\n  This legislation, along with the appointment of the agency's new \nCommissioner, Charles Rossotti, will help provide a ``fresh start'' for \nthe troubled agency.\n  I support the legislation, which adopts important reform steps:\n  Crates an IRS Oversight Board: The bill creates a new entity, the IRS \nOversight Board, drawing on private sector individuals as well as the \nTreasury Secretary, the IRS Commissioner and a representative of the \nIRS employees. The Commission will have the authority to review and \napprove major issues of policy, such as IRS strategic plans, IRS \noperations and recommend candidates for important positions, like the \nIRS Commissioner and the National Taxpayer Advocate.\n  Adopt important protection, including more disclosure to taxpayers \nand enhanced protection for the ``innocent spouse'': The bill requires \nthe IRS to better inform taxpayers about their rights, potential \nliabilities when filing joint returns, as well as the IRS process for \nauditing, appeals, collections and the like. The bill would expand the \nprotections provide to ``innocent spouses'' who find themselves liable \nfor taxes, interest, or penalties because of a spouse's action taken \nwithout their knowledge.\n  End Bureaucratic overlap: The legislation allows the IRS Commissioner \nto move forward to eliminate the current national, regional and \ndistrict office structure of the IRS. The Commissioner has proposed a \nplan to replace the antiquated 1950s structure, with a new management \nmodel, operating to serve specific groups of taxpayers. This can ensure \ngreater professionalism in the agency and more uniformity across the \nnation.\n  Strengthens and streamlines the Role of the Inspector General: The \nbill creates a new office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration. Regional and district Inspectors General would report \nto the IRS Inspector General, rather than district offices, \nstrengthening their independence and enhancing their oversight role.\n\n  Strengthens the Office of the National Taxpayer Advocate: The bill \nstrengthens the office of the National Taxpayer Advocate, to represent \nthe interests of taxpayers in the IRS policy process, proposing \nlegislation, changes in IRS practice and assisting taxpayers in \nresolving problems. The National Taxpayer Advocate is also supplemented \nby local taxpayer advocates around the country. These local advocates \nwill report to the national advocate, rather than local officials, \nwhich might undermine the independence and public credibility of the \nlocal taxpayer advocate.\n  Prepares for the future: The bill encourages more taxpayers to file \ntax returns or tax information electronically, expediting the process \nfor taxpayers and employers filing payroll tax information.\n  The bill adopts important reforms. As a previous supporter of efforts \nto strengthen taxpayers' rights, I am pleased to extend my support.\n  I acknowledge the IRS, which includes thousands of diligent, \nconscientious employees, has an extraordinarily difficult challenge. \nEach year the Service receives: nearly 210 million tax returns in 1997; \ncollects and accounts for well in excess of one trillion dollars; \ngenerates nearly 90 million refunds; and receives millions of calls, \nletters and visits from taxpayers in need of help.\n  The vast majority of these taxpayers are dealt with fairly and \neffectively, but no excuse can be made for some of the experiences and \nhorror stories described during Finance Committee hearings.\n  As Senators know, last September, the Finance Committee began to hold \na series of hearings identifying heart-rending stories from taxpayers, \nidentifying specific tax problems. One of the witnesses, Kristina Lund \nof California, described the tax problems linked to IRS enforcement \naction following her divorce. Ms. Lund was stuck with the tax bill, \nfrustrated by an unresponsive IRS, as a tax debt ballooned from $7,000 \nin 1983, to $16,000, as a result of delayed notification and confusion \nbetween Ms. Lund and her former husband. The burden of correcting the \nproblems were enormous for Ms. Lund, a newly hired bank employee \nearning approximately $15,000, and her 14 year old daughter. This bill \nincorporates some reform for the ``innocent spouse,'' preventing more \nindividuals from falling into Ms. Lund's circumstances. The bill would \nexpand the protections provided ``innocent spouses'' who find \nthemselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of actions \nby their spouse of which they did not know and had no reason to know. \nThe bill will ensure that more women are treated fairly.\n\n  I am pleased the Senate was able to add, with my support, Senator \nGraham's amendment to clarify that coercion or duress cannot void an \ninnocent spouse's claim for protection. I share Senator Graham's \nconcern with the bill, which provided that an innocent spouse, who had \nknowledge of the under-reported income, was denied ``innocent spouse'' \nprotection. Without the Graham amendment, a spouse could be coerced or \npressured to go along with a tax scam, and suffer the tax consequences \nfor years. I am pleased we could add the Graham amendment, providing an \nextra layer of protection for innocent spouses.\n  We have heard a great deal of frustration with the IRS, but Congress \ndeserves its fair share of the blame for taxpayer frustration with the \ncomplex and confusing tax code. Over the years, the IRS Tax Code has \nbecome more complicated, not less so. Despite the best of intentions, \nCongress has helped to make the taxpayers and tax collectors \nresponsibilities more difficult.\n  The Finance Committee received the testimony of the Certified Public \nAccountants, noting that from 1986 to 1997, there have been eight years \nwith significant changes to the tax laws, including the 1997 Taxpayer \nRelief Act. The witnesses noted the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which \nI supported, alone contains: 36 retroactive changes; 114 changes that \nbecame effective on August 5, 1997; 69 changes that became effective \nJanuary 1, 1998; and 5 changes that became effective on another date.\n  No wonder taxpayers and tax professionals are so confused and \nfrustrated!\n  Congress needs to be certain we are providing the IRS with the \nresources needed to get the job done. Tax professionals noted the \nTreasury Department\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nalso has a significant backlog in producing IRS regulations to provide \nguidance for taxpayers. Tax complexity increases the IRS' challenge to \nadminister the tax system fairly, and compounds the taxpayers' problems \nin meeting their tax obligations.\n  Congress also needs to ensure we are providing adequate resources to \nthe IRS, to permit adequate training and ensure the skills of the IRS \nemployees are current and up to date. During the hearings, the Finance \nCommittee listened to the testimony of Darren Larsen, a Southern \nCalifornia attorney, in which she described conduct that was simply \ncontrary to federal law. Ms. Larsen described the use of some ``on-the-\njob instructors'' who lacked an understanding of some of the legal \nfundamentals and passed their errors on to newer revenue officers. I am \nsure the vast majority of IRS enforcement officers work diligently to \nimplement the laws, but even occasional errors are unacceptable.\n  I am pleased to support the Committee's legislation. However, one \narea of reform the Committee declined to implement deals with the \n``marriage penalty.'' I will continue to follow the committee's work on \nthis issue closely, which is an important issue for women.\n  Marriage penalties arise because a couple filing a ``joint return'' \nface tax brackets and standard deductions that are less than twice the \nlevel of those for single filers. As a result, the marriage of two \nindividuals who pay taxes in the same tax bracket, receive a smaller \nstandard deduction and may be forced into a higher bracket than they \nwould if they filed their taxes as individuals. While more couples \nreceive marriage ``bonuses'' than marriage ``penalties,'' the issue \ndeserves closer review.\n  Senator Hutchison has introduced S. 1314, legislation to address this \nissue, proposing to allow married couples to file ``combined'' returns, \nin which family income is allocated to both individuals, taxing each \nspouse at the single taxpayer rate. The legislation would allow couples \nto file as either joint, single, or head-of-household. This would \neliminate those taxpayers who receive a marriage penalty, while leaving \nmarriage bonuses in place.\n  However, by getting rid of the ``marriage penalty,'' Congress could \nfind itself unfairly increasing taxes for single tax filers. Further, \nthe proposal could cause substantial revenue losses, perhaps as much as \n$40 billion per year, and would complicate the tax system. Taxpayers \nwould be required to perform tax calculations, both, as an individual \nand as a couple, choosing whichever tax was lower. In this legislation \nto simplify the tax code, Congress should be very concerned with a \nproposal which could require additional steps and additional tax \ncalculations for taxpayers.\n  I am interested in the approach taken by S. 1989, legislation \nintroduced by our colleague, Senator Ford. This approach would widen \nthe tax brackets and raise the standard deduction for joint filers to a \nlevel twice that of the single tax filer. This approach would also \neliminate the marriage penalty, while providing added tax relief for \nfamilies. I am anxious to follow the Committee's progress.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has taken very important steps to reform \nthe IRS and I am pleased to support the legislation. I have previously \nsupported efforts to provide more protection for taxpayers, including \nthe earlier ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' and this bill makes similar \nprogress. The administration also deserves support and IRS Commissioner \nRossotti also deserve our support. Taxpayers want and deserve better \ninformation and a more fair process. I am pleased to support these \nefforts to set a new course for the IRS.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. \n2676, the IRS reform bill that is now under consideration on the floor. \nThis bill, which is the product of extensive oversight hearings, is \nmuch needed and long overdue. I applaud Chairman Roth and the other \nFinance Committee members for reviewing the legislation sent to us by \nthe House, for their efforts to strengthen the bill, and for their \npersistence in moving this bill to the Senate floor.\n  As taxpayers testified at the Finance Committee hearings, the abuses \nfostered by the IRS are intolerable. Innocent taxpayers are suffering \nunder an out-of-control agency.\n  We have witnessed this problem in my own state of New Hampshire. \nShirley Barron of Derry, New Hampshire has suffered greatly since her \nhusband's death in 1996, and she claims that the IRS's collection \ntactics are the cause. The Barrons' problems with the IRS began in the \nmid-1980s when they lost an $80,000 investment. The couple's accountant \nadvised them that they could get a tax deduction, but the IRS informed \nthe Barrons two years later that they had to pay. Mrs. Barron said that \nshe and her husband were unable to pay the IRS immediately, so interest \nand penalties mounted. According to Mrs. Barron, her husband took his \nown life just after learning that creditors were to foreclose on the \ncouple's Derry home because the IRS had placed a lien on it. Even after \nMr. Barron died, the agency continued their collection efforts against \nMrs. Barron: They foreclosed on the family's Cape Cod vacation home, \nthey took her tax refunds, and they placed claims against the life \ninsurance of her late husband. The IRS recently agreed to cancel Mrs. \nBarron's entire tax debt, thus ending her long ordeal. While this is a \nwelcome development, it won't bring her husband back. No one should \nhave to go through an ordeal like that again.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee heard similarly disturbing \naccounts of IRS intimidation from agency employees. Auditors and agents \nvoiced their frustration with field office managers and high level \nmanagement. Some reported that almost no one at the agency listens to \nthem when they report discrimination or wrongdoing. For example:\n\n  Ginger Garvis, a District auditor in New York City, said that she \nuncovered a multimillion-dollar tax evasion and money-laundering case \nwhich her supervisors refused to pursue. Ms. Garvis testified that the \nIRS often forgives tax debts by large firms with the resources to fight \nback in court. Instead, it focuses on smaller companies that cannot \nfight back.\n  Michael Ayala, a thirty-year IRS employee, testified that he has \nobserved ``a broad range of misconduct by high level managers.'' He \nsaid that ``such abuses are generally known to a large percentage of \nthe IRS workforce but are perpetuated by management's intimidation and \npunishment of anyone within the agency who objects to or reports such \nmisconduct.''\n  A former IRS criminal investigation agent, Patricia Gernt, reported \nthat her supervisors did little or nothing to help her stop another IRS \nagent who tried to frame former U.S. Senator Howard Baker.\n  Perhaps for these reasons, another District auditor in New York City \ntestified: ``before there is a taxpayer victim there is first an \nemployee victim.''\n  Such an atmosphere of fear and intimidation is deplorable and must be \nstopped. The American taxpayers deserve better.\n  H.R. 2676 will help us change the culture at the IRS to which so many \nare objecting. This bill establishes many new taxpayer rights; it calls \nfor the IRS to revise its mission statement to focus on taxpayer \nservice; and it provides for increased oversight of agency activities \nby a citizens' advisory board. At the same time, the bill gives the new \nIRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, broad flexibility to better manage \nthe agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We have an historic \nopportunity to restore accountability to the IRS and change how the \nagency functions. Let us seize this opportunity by promptly passing \nH.R. 2676.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the IRS Reform Act. I \nwould like to begin by congratulating Chairman Roth for holding the \nrecent IRS hearings. The Finance Committee's historic hearing have made \nit possible for us to consider this bill, and they have made the Senate \nversion of the bill improved and stronger than the House-passed version \nof HR 2676.\n  However, I'm disappointed by the recent remarks by the Minority \nLeader, who said the Chairman's hearings were ``sensationalistic.'' \nThese hearing were not ``sensationalistic,'' but were instead about \ngetting at the truth. They exposed sensationally bad news about how a \npowerful arm of government has treated individual taxpayers. Indeed,\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\ngiven the stories that emerged, even holding these hearings was a brave \nact.\n  Without these hearings there would have been no appointment of \nWilliam Webster to review the IRS Criminal Investigation Division; no \nannouncement of a special internal task force; the public would not \nhave known that even a Senate Majority Leader is not protected from \nbizarre, apparently criminal, targeting; the bill might not have been \nas strong as it is; and, after a brief flurry of attention, the IRS \nwould assume it was safe to return to business as usual.\n  There are many causes to the problems that these hearings exposed. \nThe culture which pervades the IRS is arrogant, powerful, and a law \nunto itself--it is unaccountable to anyone else. The tax law, too, is \nto blame. After forty years of liberal Congresses encouraging and \nempowering the IRS, it seems as if their only goal is to get the money \nand that the ends justify the means. We also must not forget that \nindividual IRS agents also overstep the law. We still want to believe \nmost IRS employees are conscientious civil servants. However, the \nhearings show the IRS has not disciplined its own. In fact, the IRS \nculture has rewarded rogue activity, punished whistle blowers, and \ncarried out retribution against innocent taxpayers. The problem of \n``rogue agents'' is really more a problem of a rogue agency. Today, in \nlaw and in practice, drug dealers, child molester, and organized crime \nhave more legal rights than the average taxpayer whom the IRS suspects \nmay owe a few dollars in back taxes.\n  The IRS abuses are part of a bigger problem. There is a culture of \nbig government, growing like a cancer on the body politic for two \ngenerations, that says the money you earn isn't yours, it's the \ngovernment's; that says freedom isn't the individual's unalienable \nright, it's the government's to give or take away; that promises \ncompassion and support, but demands control and dependence. It may all \nbe relative, but it's becoming more like Big Brother and less like \nUncle Sam.\n  Now is the time to turn that tide. A Republican Congress has started \nalready. We enacted the welfare reform law of 1996, which expects \nindividual responsibility and encourages individual and community \ninitiative. We also passed the Balanced Budget and Taxpayer Relief Acts \nof 1997 which said we will put limits on the appetite of government.\n  Now we must take the next step with IRS reform. More Americans come \ninto contact with their government through the IRS than through any \nother means. This bill is the first significant step to reminding \neveryone that the taxpayer is the boss--not the IRS, not the \ngovernment.\n  But this bill is only the first step. We need continued and increased \noversight of the IRS through more hearings. From calls and letters from \nour own constituents, Senators know the first few hearings only \nscratched the surface of the tip of the iceberg. Sunlight is the best \nprotection the people have. We also need to look at more reforms, \nespecially protecting due process and privacy rights and increasing \naccountability for wrongful actions. Continued, aggressive committee \nactivity are also a must.\n  The ultimate IRS reform will be abolishing the current tax code and \nstarting over with a new, fairer system. Later this year we will take \nthe next step--voting to sunset the tax code. This would underline our \ncommitment to ending the tax code and the IRS as we know them; \nguarantee the American taxpayer we will build a new, fairer system, \nfrom the ground up; and force Congress and the President to come to \nterms on creating a new system.\n  Of course, President Clinton and others will fight to preserve the \nstatus quo. For a while, they tried to block IRS reform, but saw the \nAmerican people wouldn't stand for it. Now President Clinton wants to \ndress up as First Drum major and get out in front of the parade \nCongress started. Mr. President, we welcome your help, however belated, \nif it's sincere and substantial. But, Mr. President, at least have the \nhonesty to say, ``me, too'' instead of, ``my idea.'' President Clinton \nand his allies still say sunsetting the tax code would create \nuncertainty, but a sunset creates no more uncertainty than the status \nquo, which has perpetuated uncertainty for decades with a major new tax \nbill about every two years. Opponents don't want major tax reform--they \nlike the current code and the way it shakes down the taxpayer. They \nwill use divide and delay tactics, pretending to support reform but \nmaking sure no one proposal breaks out of the pack. But the American \npeople know better, tax reform will be debated thoroughly across the \ncountry between now and 2000.\n  Now and in the future, the American people are demanding change. They \nwant an IRS that is fair, courteous, and respects their rights of due \nprocess and privacy. Congress is committed to creating a new culture at \nthe IRS, serving the taxpayer, not treating them like a criminal class; \ntreating taxpayers with respect and dignity; pursuing criminals, not \nquotas; and upholding the Constitutional principle of ``presumed \ninnocent until proven guilty.''\n  For the future, the American people demand fundamental change--a new \ntax code that is simple, fair, efficient, and allows working Americans \nand their families to keep more of the fruits of their labors. \nRepublicans in Congress are committed to creating that completely new \nsystem.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the time has arrived to put some \naccountability and common sense into one of the most out of control \nfederal agencies in the Federal Government, the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Over the past nine months we have heard volumes of testimony \nregarding the many problems associated with the Internal Revenue \nService--lack of leadership, an unresponsive agency and abusive \nemployees. But the most important issue that we must not forget is \naccountability. No one is being held accountable at the IRS. This must \nchange.\n  If federal agencies and their employees are not held accountable for \ntheir actions, we have lost control. The American people send billions \nand billions of dollars of their hard-earned money to Washington, D.C. \neach year in taxes, to fund a government that most Americans see as too \nbig, too intrusive, and unaccountable.\n  Congress is taking a good first step at bringing accountability to \nthe IRS through the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \nAct. This legislation would create an IRS oversight board to oversee \nthe IRS in every aspect of its administration of the tax laws. The Act \nalso replaces the many levels of bureaucracy at the IRS--district \noffices, regional offices and national office--with offices that are \ntrained to handle groups with specific concerns--individual taxpayers, \nsmall business, large business and tax-exempt entities.\n  The Act also creates and enhances many taxpayer rights and \nprotections. The burden of proof in court proceedings would be reversed \nfrom the taxpayer to the IRS when the taxpayer produces credible \nevidence that is relevant. The Act extends the attorney-client \nprivilege to accountants and other tax practitioners. Finally, the Act \noverhauls the ``innocent-spouse'' relief provision. A spouse would be \nallowed to limit their tax liability for a joint-return to the spouse's \nseparate liability attributable to the spouse's income.\n  These are just a few examples of where and how the IRS Restructuring \nand Reform Act will bring the IRS back to reality. If there is \naccountability there is control.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues in support of \nthe IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is a \nvictory for taxpayers, a victory for small businesses, and a victory \nfor the American family. I applaud the work of my colleagues, Senators \nRoth, Bob Kerrey, Grassley, and others, who have demonstrated such \ndetermination, vision and leadership on this issue.\n  I believe that the average American taxpayer is fundamentally \nhonorable, willing to play by the rules and carry his or her fair share \nof public obligations. Most public servants at the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) perform their jobs responsibly. But, sadly, there are \nexceptions on both sides of this equation, and those exceptions lead to \ncontentious circumstances which must receive careful IRS management \nattention. Regrettably, that has too often not been forthcoming. Along \nwith most\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\nAmericans, I watched the recent Senate Finance Committee oversight \nhearings on the Internal Revenue Service. A number of witnesses told of \neconomic and emotional hardship at the hands of abusive IRS agents. \nUnfortunately, while the facts of a number of these cases were \nshocking, the fact that there are such cases was not surprising. During \nmy 13 years in the Senate, I have assisted many taxpayers in \nMassachusetts who have protested similar treatment by IRS employees. \nMost recently here the widow of a well-respected lawyer filed suit, \ncharging that her husband was literally hounded to death by IRS \ncollection agents. He committed suicide on Cape Cod, leaving behind a \nnote which complained that the IRS ``sits, does nothing and then \nwatches you die.''\n  While we must be careful not to presumptuously conclude that all \nproblems that arise between the taxpayers and the IRS are the result of \ninappropriate actions or demeanor by the IRS and its employees, the \nevidence indicates this is the cause with sufficient frequency that the \nCongress is compelled to address this problem. It is clear that the \nInternal Revenue Service is subject to some difficult challenges. After \ndownsizing in recent years, the remaining IRS agents are strained as \nthey try to meet the demands of increased audit and collection work. \nThe management structure within the IRS has made these problems even \nmore difficult to solve. Regardless of the reason, the abusive and \nhumiliating tactics about which we all heard during the Finance \nCommittee hearings are intolerable and must be stopped. This \nlegislation is an important step in the process of reinstituting \ncontrols at the IRS that should rectify these problems.\n  Our system of taxation is based on voluntary compliance. And we have \nthe best record of paying our taxes in the industrialized world. For at \nleast part of the last two decades, 95 percent of wage-earners in this \ncountry paid their taxes accurately and on time. And while a recent \nstudy found that nearly 12 percent of our economic output evades \ntaxation, this number is dwarfed by the noncompliance rates of our \ninternational competitors.\n  I have previously supported reform efforts that were intended to make \ntax collection fairer, and the IRS more accountable. In 1988, I \ncosponsored the Taxpayers Bill of Rights which expanded the procedural \nand disclosure rights of taxpayers when dealing with the IRS, \nprohibited the use of collection results in IRS employee evaluations, \nand banned revenue collection quotas. During the 104th Congress, I \ncosponsored the Senate version of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights II, \nwhich created the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, allowed installment \npayments of tax liabilities of less than $10,000, and imposed \nnotification and disclosure requirements on the IRS. Last year, we \nenacted the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, which imposes civil and \ncriminal penalties on Federal employees who gain unauthorized access to \ntax returns and other taxpayer information.\n  The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 \nbefore the Senate today will restructure and reorganize the Internal \nRevenue Service. It will create a new IRS Oversight Board to review and \napprove strategic plans and operational functions which are crucial to \nthe future of the agency. The Oversight Board, consisting of six \ncitizens, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of the IRS \nand a representative of the IRS employees' union, will reestablish \ncontrol of the IRS by reviewing operations and ensuring the proper \ntreatment of taxpayers by the IRS. It will shift the burden of proof \nfrom the taxpayer to the IRS in court if the taxpayer complies with the \nInternal Revenue Code and regulations, maintains required records and \ncooperates with IRS requests for information.\n  I do have some concerns that this provision could give comfort to a \nsmall number of Americans who will do anything to avoid paying their \ntaxes and may make the system of tax collection even more complicated. \nBut I think the benefits for the great majority of taxpayers who are \ntrying to do the right thing required support for the bill.\n  The bill also would allow taxpayers to sue the IRS for up to $100,000 \nin civil damages caused by negligent disregard of the law. It also \nexpands the ability of taxpayers to recover costs, including the repeal \nof the ceiling on hourly attorneys' fees.\n  Finally, it expands the protections provided to ``innocent spouses'' \nwho find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of \nactions by their spouse about which they did not know and had no reason \nto know.\n  This bill makes positive changes that will foster continued growth \nand cooperation by the American people. If we were to do nothing, and \nthe IRS were to continue on its present course, it is likely that there \nwould be a continued slide in the public's faith in the tax collection \nsystem.\n  Americans merit an efficient and a respectful government. In the \ncourse of history, we have fought for freedom from despotic \nbureaucracies. At the essence of our democracy is our right to alter \nany public institution which fails significantly to deal respectfully \nand competently with American citizens. I believe the changes this \nlegislation will make will regain the balance that has been lost in the \nrelationship of the taxpayers to the IRS while permitting the IRS to do \nthe difficult job it was created to do. That job is vital to our \ngovernment's ability to provide the essential services on which \nvirtually every American depends to some extent: Social Security \nbenefits, our armed forces, law enforcement, Medicare and Medicaid, air \ntraffic control, administration of our national parks and forests, etc. \nThis is a good bill that will help taxpayers and the IRS. I will \nsupport its passage and implementation and look forward to its results.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nlegislation before the Senate--H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and \nReform Act. I beieve it is vital that this critically-needed \nlegislation be passed by the Congress and enacted by the President as \nrapidly as possible.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been working to reform many aspects of \nthe Federal government and its programs over the past several years, \nincluding welfare, Medicare, and telecommunications laws. And now, with \nApril 15--the deadline for filing tax returns--only a few weeks past, I \ncan think of no better time for Congress to continue its reform efforts \nthan with a substantial overhaul of the IRS.\n  While reforming our tax system is an idea that has been bandied about \nfor years--and will likely continue to be a topic of great interest in \nthe months and years ahead--at the very least we have an obligation in \nthis Congress to address the abuse of our nation's citizens by the \nagency that is responsible for enforcing federal tax laws: the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Mr. President, the hearings that were conducted in the Senate Finance \nCommittee over the past nine months have provided a chilling reminder \nof how government power can run amok. Tax files are used for \ninformation on boyfriends of IRS employees. IRS managers are trained \nthat it is permissible to lie or mislead the public. Employees are \nevaluated on statistics based on seizures of personal property and \nfinances. Some business owners are allowed to make monthly payments on \ndelinquent employment taxes while others are forced into bankruptcy--\nthe decision is arbitrary and up to IRS management. And IRS agents that \nseek to report improper tactics and practices face demotion or outright \nreplacement.\n  While I wish that the horror stories told by the Finance Committee \nwitnesses were isolated incidents, the real-life stories I have heard \nfrom constituents in Maine only reinforce the fact that these problems \nare occurring nationwide.\n  Take for example the family in Lebanon, Maine, who was audited for \nthe year 1993 after they saw their convenience store, home, and all \ntheir financial records destroyed by a 1994 fire. While they originally \nhad no problem with the audit and anticipated a relatively brief \nprocess, it is now four years later and the IRS has finally just \ncompleted the 1993 audit. One can only imagine how long--and at what \ncost--the 1994 and 1995 audits they are being subjected to will last.\n  Or consider the story of a sheet metal company employee in Maine who \nwas taking money on the side for jobs--which meant that his employer \nwasn't being paid for the contracts\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nthat they thought were outstanding. As a result, when it came time for \nthe business to pay their taxes, they didn't have the funds.\n  Negotiations between the IRS and the company broke down, one thing \nled to another, and the company was behind to the point where the IRS \ntook everything from the company's bank account. The result: the \ncompany was unable to pay its employees, it was seized by the IRS, and \nit was sold at auction to cover the taxes.\n  Finally there is the waitress who, over the years, didn't pay all the \ntaxes she should have on the tips she made. She was reported, found \nguilty, and it was estimated that she owed more than $100,000 in back \ntaxes, penalties and interest payments. Fair enough, you might say, \nexcept for one twist: her husband never had a clue that his wife was \ncheating the IRS. But he's been paying the price ever since.\n  He lost his home, his vehicles, and his camp in order to help pay his \nwife's debt. In the meantime, they divorced--and to this day the wife \ndoes not work because, if she did, she would still owe the IRS. \nInstead, she has remarried and is supported by her new husband, while \nthe ex-husband remains responsible for the debt he never knew a thing \nabout.\n  Now, I'm not saying that the IRS doesn't do a good job in many--if \nnot most--cases. They have a difficult and unpopular task, and the law \nmust be enforced. The delays, unfair treatment, and--in some cases--\nimproper actions that have occurred with the IRS have undoubtedly been \nthe result of a variety of factors, and the complexity of the tax code \nonly compounds the problems for taxpayers who must interact with the \nIRS.\n  In fact, to test the difficulty of the current income tax system, \nMoney magazine had 45 different tax accountants prepare a tax return \nfor the same family--and the result was 45 different returns that \nvaried by 160 percent! When considering that there are 555 million \nwords in the tax code, 480 different tax forms, and IRS employees give \nthe wrong answers to taxpayers 30 percent of the time, it's no wonder \nthe expects can't even agree on what a taxpayer owes!\n  Therefore, although we won't be eliminating the complexity of the tax \ncode today, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering \ncomprehensive reform legislation that will attempt to end the abuse of \nalready confused taxpayers by the IRS, and ensure that the enforcer of \nthe tax law is no longer one of its greatest abusers.\n  Mr. President, this legislation--which builds on the restructuring \nbill that was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives \nthis past November--includes a variety of critical reforms that will \ndramatically improve the oversight and management of the IRS. And, most \nimportantly, the bill will make this agency more accountable to the \nvery individuals they were intended to serve: the American taxpayer.\n\n  Specifically, to improve the oversight and administration of the IRS, \nthis legislation will establish an oversight board including the IRS \nCommissioner and six members from the private sector, which would have \nbroad authority to review and approve strategic plans. In addition, it \nwill establish local taxpayer advocates in every state, and strengthen \nthe internal auditing of the agency.\n  To create a more level playing field between the IRS and taxpayers, \nthe bill will modify the practice of considering taxpayers guilty until \nthey prove their innocence by shifting the burden of proof to the IRS \nin cases where the taxpayer is cooperative in providing information. It \nwill also provide for greater taxpayer protection against interest \nassessments and penalties.\n  To streamline congressional oversight of the IRS, it provides a means \nfor ensuring that the IRS and Congress are aware of the most \ncomplicated aspects of the tax code that are generating the greatest \ncompliance problems for taxpayers, and provide clear accountability to \nspecific committees in the Congress.\n  To be more responsive to taxpayers, this legislation provides \ncritically needed relief to an ``innocent spouse'' who has no knowledge \nof the improper tax filings of his or her husband or wife; ensures that \na taxpayer who has entered into an installment agreement to settle an \noutstanding tax bill will no longer be forced to pay ``failure to pay'' \npenalties during the period of repayment--which has never made any \nsense; and gives taxpayers more time to dispute IRS claims.\n  And finally, to create a better IRS from the inside out, the bill \nprovides increased flexibility for the IRS to recruit and retain the \nbest agents possible, while establishing new performance measures that \nensure agents are not ranked based on enforcement results or \ncollections.\n  Mr. President, the issue comes down to trust. The people of this \nnation must be able to trust that their government will be fair, will \nbe discreet, will be responsive. Taxpayers should not fear the very \ninstitutions that are supposed to be serving them. We must ensure that \ngovernment works for people, not against them. We must end the abuses \nat the IRS.\n  The bill before us today will help restore taxpayer confidence in the \nsystem and rebuild the trust that has been eroded through years of \negregious abuse. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for \ncrafting and championing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues who have spoken \non the floor this week, I rise in strong support of the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998.\n  The Senate Finance Committee hearings about IRS agents and \nsupervisors that are completely out-of-control, and who sometimes try \nto set up honest taxpayers in order to advance their own careers, has \nmade it absolutely clear to every American that the structure and \nstandard operating procedures of the IRS must be corrected--which is \nexactly what this comprehensive reform legislation will accomplish.\n  This bill creates an oversight board consisting of a majority of \nprivate sector members to set IRS policy and strategy, and a new \nindependent Inspector General for Tax Administration in the Treasury \nDepartment who will be appointed by the President and confirmed by this \nSenate. The Taxpayer Advocate position, created in the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights II in 1996, is expanded into a system of local Taxpayer \nAdvocates that guarantees at least one advocate for each state in the \nunion.\n  This legislation reverses the burden of proof from the taxpayer to \nthe IRS, and allows for the awarding of attorney's fees and civil \ndamages to taxpayers when they have been wronged by the IRS. Relief is \nalso provided to ``innocent spouses'' who find themselves liable for \ntaxes incurred by their spouse during a marriage.\n  Mr. President, this is by no means a comprehensive list of the \nreforms included in this legislation--it would not be possible to \ndescribe them all in the time I have to speak today. It has, in fact, \nbeen calculated that there are over 160 reforms to the IRS included in \nthis bill--all with the goal of making the IRS more service oriented \nand friendly to American taxpayers. It is for the twin goals of IRS \nstructural reform and the protection of innocent taxpayers that I will \nbe voting in favor of this legislation.\n  Before concluding Mr. President, I must state that while I hail the \nSenate's consideration and certain passage of this IRS reform \nlegislation, I believe that it only deals with the symptoms and not \nwith the fundamental disease. The fundamental disease is the Internal \nRevenue Code written by Congress. The current code is so long, so \ncomplicated and so full of loopholes that it is literally out-of-\ncontrol.\n  To deal with the disease, Congress is going to have to deal with the \nCode. We must either dramatically simplify it or, and this is my \npreferred course of action, we must repeal the Code lock, stock and \nbarrel and start all over again. We must develop a tax system that is \nfair, easy for Americans to understand, requires far less money to \nenforce so that we can have a dramatically smaller IRS, and requires \nfar less money to comply with in fees paid to lawyers and accountants.\n  I am absolutely convinced fundamental reform of the Code should be \nthe primary goal of Congress. It is certainly the goal to which I have \ndedicated and will continue to dedicate my energy and attention.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have heard much in recent years of the \nhorrors and abuses inflicted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on \nthe\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nAmerican taxpayer. I have little cause for doubt, Mr. President, that \nthere lies a certain degree of verisimilitude in these allegations and, \nfurther, that the pending legislation represents a necessary and \noverdue effort to ameliorate these abuses. Certainly, a portion of the \ncriticism directed at the IRS has been justly earned by the officials \nand employees who administer and work at the agency. If but half of the \nconcerns raised during the Finance Committee's recent hearings on these \nIRS abuses are true, there is indeed an immediate and overwhelming need \nto reform and restructure the IRS. However, let us remember, Mr. \nPresident, that the task to which the Congress has assigned the IRS has \nnever been nor will ever be a popular one. The simple fact that few \npeople enjoy paying taxes leads logically to the presumption that they \nwill not embrace the very agency charged with collecting their taxes.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me now turn my focus to the bill \nbefore us. As reported to the Senate by the Finance Committee, H.R. \n2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998, would significantly alter the management, oversight, and basic \nstructure of the IRS as we know it. By creating an IRS Oversight Board, \nthis legislation aims to provide the strategic oversight and guidance \nthat has been deficient or lacking at the IRS in previous years. As the \nNational Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service \nconcluded in its report to the Congress last year, the ``problems \nthroughout the IRS cannot be solved without focus, consistency and \ndirection from the top. The current structure, which includes Congress, \nthe President, the Department of the Treasury, and the IRS itself, does \nnot allow the IRS to set and maintain consistent long-term strategy and \npriorities, nor to develop and execute focused plans for improvement.''\n  Clearly, the drafters of H.R. 2676 have sought to provide the very \n``focus,'' ``consistency,'' and ``direction'' that the IRS Commission \nconcluded was necessary. I hope that the nine-member Board, as \nproposed, will be able to carefully and diligently clear a new path on \nwhich the IRS can tread the challenges that the 21st Century will bring \nas a more responsive, less intrusive federal agency that works for--not \nagainst--the millions of honest American taxpayers to whom we are all \naccountable.\n\n  With regard to the composition of this Oversight Board, I voted \nagainst two amendments this morning that would have either directly or \nindirectly removed the union representative from this Board because I \nbelieve that such representation is crucial on a Board that will have \nso much influence in the actual workings of the IRS and the 100,000-odd \nactual workers who carry out its many tasks. I also opposed an \namendment to remove the Treasury Secretary from this Board because I \nbelieve that, for any such Board to be truly taken seriously and \ncommand attention, the chief executive officer of the Treasury \nDepartment--the Secretary--must be able to offer his or her unique \nperspective on various IRS issues through a position on the Board. \nFurthermore, by serving on this Board, the Treasury Secretary will help \nensure that the recommendations thus produced are not ignored or \ndisregarded by officials of the IRS.\n  Mr. President, I also want to convey my support for a number of other \nprovisions of H.R. 2676. Specifically, I applaud the provisions of the \nbill providing for a National Taxpayer Advocate and an independent \nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The former office \nshould help to better protect the interests of individual taxpayers who \nare often outmatched in their disputes with the IRS, while the latter \nwill ensure that the office with responsibility for overseeing the IRS \nis independent of the agency itself. I further support the provisions \nof this legislation calling for increased use of electronic filing in \nthe next ten years--the advent of electric filing technology cannot be \nignored as we seek to find ways to make the IRS more responsive to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, the bill contains many other taxpayer protections that \nI believe will improve the way the IRS works. However, let me express \nmy concern about a provision in the funding offset amendment agreed to \nby the Senate yesterday, without my support. Last night, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation produced calculations predicting that, while this \nprovision will raise approximately $10 billion in the next ten years \nand thus protect this bill from a PAYGO point of order, it will lose a \nnet $47 billion in revenues over the next twenty years. Clearly, this \nis an attempt to back-load the true cost of a tax provision to \ncircumvent a budgetary point of order, and I hope that it will be \ndropped in conference negotiations with the House.\n  Mr. President, my reservations about this particular provision of \nH.R. 2676 notwithstanding, I am prepared to support Senate passage of \nthis important and much-needed legislation. As the elected officials of \nthe people of the United States, it is our duty to ensure that the \nIRS--the very agency to which we have delegated authority to implement \nand enforce our constitutional prerogative to ``lay and collect'' \ntaxes--does not harass, abuse, or otherwise place unnecessary burdens \non the millions of honest, hard-working taxpayers to whom we are each \naccountable. This legislation, as a whole, represents a positive step \nin the direction of a more responsive, more accountable, and more \nefficient Internal Revenue Service that better serves the American \npeople.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I had an amendment earlier that I had \nwithdrawn that would increase the amount of oversight, or actually \ncreate in statute a requirement for annual hearings by the Finance \nCommittee, and I would prefer to merely in a colloquy with the chairman \nof the Finance Committee get this matter settled without having to put \nit into law.\n  I would like to express again my concern and interest in making \ncertain that congressional oversight is increased. I think it is a \nlittle bit like preaching to the choir here, asking this particular \nchairman to do it, but I would like to declare that I think we should \nbe having a yearly hearing hosted by the Senate's Finance Committee \nwith the IRS Commissioner, with the chair of the new oversight board \ncreated in this new law, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and the new \nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; as the four \nwitnesses. The purpose of the hearing would be to review overall \nprogress by the IRS in serving the needs of taxpayers.\n  I would simply ask as part of this colloquy whether or not the \nchairman would be willing to hold such a hearing on a yearly basis?\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska that one \nof my real concerns has been that there has not been adequate oversight \nof IRS as well as other agencies. That is one of the things that got me \nmoving a year ago, because I think, as the Senator, it is critically \nimportant that we assure the agency is functioning as the President and \nCongress intend it to function. That has not been the case with IRS.\n  So I can assure the good Senator that it is my intention to have \ncontinuing oversight hearings. I think it is important now that we are \ninvolved in this massive reorganization opportunity to change culture \nthat we do have at least once a year, if not more often, the kind of \nhearing the Senator is talking about. We are all very pleased to have \nthis new Commissioner. We think we have an individual with the type of \nqualifications and background that will really make a major change. At \nthe same time, I think it is our responsibility to continue from time \nto time to hold hearings to see if progress is being made. So I assure \nthe Senator that as long as I am chairman of the committee we will \ncontinue to do so.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I do believe in this kind of oversight where we ask \nfour key people, three of whom are new creations under this law, to \ncome and tell the oversight committee how well this\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nnew law is doing and if there is any additional changes in the law that \nare necessary.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the Senator's comments in this regard \nand will, once again, state my appreciation for the Senator's diligence \nand perseverance in making certain that IRS does the job the American \ntaxpayers want it to do.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say, as long as the two of us are members of that \ncommittee, I am sure it will happen.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2379\n\n(Purpose: To provide interest payment exemption for disaster victims in \n              the Presidentially declared disaster areas)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to send an amendment to the \ndesk that has been sponsored on our side by Senator Coverdell and also \nmy colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia. It is my understanding it has been cleared on both sides. I \nsend the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself, Mr. \n     Coverdell, Mr. Wellstone, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2379.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SECTION  . ABATEMENT OF INTEREST ON UNDERPAYMENTS BY \n                   TAXPAYERS IN PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER \n                   AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6404 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to abatements) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(h) Abatement of Interest on Underpayments by Taxpayers \n     in Presidentially Declared Disaster Areas.--\n       ``(1) In general--If the Secretary extends for any period \n     the time for filing income tax returns under section 6081 and \n     the time for paying income tax with respect to such returns \n     under section 6161 for any taxpayer located in a \n     Presidentially declared disaster area, the Secretary shall \n     abate for such period the assessment of any interest \n     prescribed under section 6601 on such income tax.\n       ``(2) Presidentially declared disaster area.--For purposes \n     of paragraph (1), the term `Presidentially declared disaster \n     area' means, with respect to any taxpayer, any area which the \n     President has determined warrants assistance by the Federal \n     Government under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to disasters declared after December 31, 1996, \n     with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1996.\n       (c) Emergency Designation.--\n       (1) For the purposes of section 252(e) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, Congress designates \n     the provisions of this section as an emergency requirement.\n       (2) The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) of this \n     section shall only take effect upon the transmittal by the \n     President to the Congress of a message designating the \n     provisions of subsections (a) and (b) as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 252(e) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to say a couple words about the \namendment and then also be joined by my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, on this amendment.\n  It is very simple. It applies to residents or individuals, or I \nshould say victims who live in disaster areas, those areas that have \nbeen declared disaster areas by a Presidential decree, either through \nflooding or tornadoes or whatever mishap it might be.\n  The basics of this amendment say that those people who have been \ngranted an extension to file their income taxes, but under current law \nthe IRS must still assess an interest payment on those taxes. This is \nadding insult to injury. These people who have no opportunity due to no \nfault of their own to file their taxes on time have been granted an \nextension period to get their taxes filed in good faith, and yet under \ncurrent law we come back and say, well, that's fine and dandy, but we \nnow have to assess you an interest on this. These individuals who are \ntrying to rebuild and repair their lives need every dollar. Every \ndollar counts.\n  So the basic part of this amendment is very simple. It is that also \nwe would, along with granting them an extension in order to file their \nincome taxes, make an exemption for interest on those tax payments as \nwell. So I hope that the Senate will consider this and give it its full \nsupport.\n  I would like now to defer to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent that Senator Cleland be \nalso listed as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to work with Senator Grams on this \namendment. I thank both the chairman of the committee, Senator Roth, \nand Senator Kerrey for all of their help. This is very important to \npeople. If you visit people in communities that have been devastated by \ntornadoes in our State, to be able to have forgiveness of interest on \nlate payment of taxes is extremely important. It seems to be a little \nthing, but it is real important to people in our State.\n  It has been a pleasure working with Senator Grams on this. I think we \nhave done well. This will help people in our State. We thank all of our \ncolleagues for their assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a good amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I concur and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2379) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend both the chairman and the \nDemocratic manager for their work on this bill over the last couple of \ndays. I commend them for all that they have done. I think we will see a \nvery strong vote as final passage is recorded this afternoon. It is \nlargely to their credit.\n  I particularly want to commend my colleague Senator Kerrey for the \ntremendous job that he has done over the course of now more than 12 \nmonths of work in an effort that has led to the point where we will \npass what has been, at times, a very controversial issue. To see the \noverwhelming vote today is a tribute to him and to the leadership that \nhe showed on the Commission and on the floor, and certainly in the \ncommittee.\n  While I have made no reservations about the difficulty many of us \nhave with regard to the offset, an offset that I hope can be addressed \nin conference, an offset that will cost the Treasury and U.S. taxpayers \nsome $46 billion--if it is possible to say ``except for that,'' I will \nsay: Except for that, this legislation is a major accomplishment that \ndeserves the support on both sides of the aisle.\n  The other day, I was visiting on the Capitol steps with a group of \nhigh school students from Spearfish, SD. When I told them the Senate \nwould vote this week on IRS reform, they actually burst into wild \napplause. That is not the usual reaction I get when I talk with people \nback home about what Congress is up to. So, today they will be pleased \nto learn that their cheers were heard and that we are changing the IRS \nas we know it.\n  Fortunately, the students didn't ask about the history of the IRS \nreform bill, because they already knew from\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\ntheir studies how a bill is supposed to become law. It might have been \ndifficult to explain why this bill has taken such an unusual route.\n  We could have and should have passed IRS reform 6 months ago. The \nHouse did. They passed it 426 to 4 last November. The IRS reform \nlegislation was the last thing we attempted to pass in the Senate last \nyear and the first bill Democrats tried to pass when we reconvened in \nJanuary. But in the last 6 months, between the time the House passed \nthe bill and now, 120 million Americans filed tax returns without the \nbenefit of the protections of this bill, 2 million taxpayers received \naudit notices, many millions more received collection notices, and not \none of them had the protections of this bill either. That is \nunfortunate and, in my view, unnecessary.\n  But that is behind us. Despite the slow road this bill has traveled, \nI am glad that we are finally able to vote on it today. So are those \nhigh school students from Spearfish, whom I talked to out on the \nCapitol steps on Tuesday. So are America's 120 million taxpayers.\n  The bill fundamentally changes the management and operation of the \nIRS. I will support this bill because it will make the IRS more \naccountable to, and respectful of, taxpayers. It will help transform \nthe culture of the IRS to make customer service a top priority, the \nsame as it is in the best-run private businesses.\n  Charles Rossotti, the new IRS Commissioner, has created a plan to do \nall of that. This bill gives him the tools he needs to carry out that \nplan and really begin shaking things up within that very troubled \nagency. This bill creates an outside board of directors for the IRS, \nwho will ensure that the agency adopts practices that restore the \nbalance of power between law-abiding taxpayers and the IRS employees. \nIt explicitly bans the use of tax collection quotas as a tool for \nevaluating the effectiveness both of individual IRS employees and of \nwhole divisions within the agency. This is a big step in the right \ndirection. From now on, tax auditors will now be judged by the quality \nof the service they provide, not the quantity of money they collect.\n\n  Make no mistake, tax cheaters cheat us all, and the IRS should \nenforce our laws to the letter. But the sort of heavyhanded tactics \nthat have been used by the IRS against some private citizens and \nbusinesses should absolutely never be tolerated. Under this bill, they \nwill not be.\n  One of the ironies about the 6-month delay is that, while we have \nmore answers about some things, we are now faced with a bigger question \nthat didn't exist back in November. Last year, the Congress made a \nstand for fiscal responsibility by enacting a plan that would balance \nthe Federal budget for the first time in 30 years. Speeches extolling \nthe virtues of fiscal restraint echoed through this Chamber. And I ask \nmy colleagues, is this bill consistent with the spirit of last year's \nhistoric balanced budget agreement? Is it consistent with our \ncommitment to use the budget surplus to save Social Security first? \nRegrettably, the answer, as I noted a moment ago, is no.\n  Since this bill left the House, its price tag has more than tripled, \nand instead of paying for the added costs, the Senate has chosen, as it \ndid so often in the days before the balanced Budget Act, to fudge it. \nThis bill plugs the deficit hole in the first 10 years by creating an \neven bigger one--an estimated $46 billion hole in the second 10 years. \nAs if this were not irresponsible enough, it creates that deficit by \nproviding a new tax break that can only be used by people making more \nthan $100,000 a year.\n  We know from recent experience how hard it is to balance the budget. \nWe know there is no free lunch. So, who is it that will end up paying \nfor this smoke-and-mirrors gimmick? The 95 percent of Americans making \nless than $100,000 a year? That is who, unfortunately, will be left \npaying that bill--the same people who are depending upon these budget \nsurpluses to preserve their Social Security and Medicare benefits in \nthe next century. This bill was supposed to be about protecting \ntaxpayers, not fleecing them when they are not looking or before they \nare even born.\n  I will vote for this bill because the IRS is in dire need of reform. \nWe have kept the new Commissioner waiting long enough for the authority \nhe needs to do the job. More to the point, we have kept the American \npeople waiting long enough for a new and better IRS. But I implore our \nconferees, don't ignore the funding problem in this bill. Fix it, so \nthat the bill provides protection for taxpayers in the fullest sense of \nthe word.\n  The American people want us to make the IRS more accountable. This \nbill will do that. At the same time, we must remember there is another \nimportant issue the American people want us to address. That is: What \nare we going to do to help families earn more money and keep more of \nthe money they earn? That is why those high school students from \nSpearfish cheered. They assumed that, by passing an IRS reform bill, we \nare doing something that will improve the financial circumstances of \nworking families. That is what the people in South Dakota and across \nthe country really want Congress to do. If we don't do that, any \n``bounce'' we get from this bill will be very short-lived.\n  Last year, we agreed on a 5-year plan to balance the Federal budget \nand at the same time invest in the citizens and the future of this \ngreat Nation. We are now in the process of crafting a budget that is \nthe first real test of our ability to live within that agreement. In \nthe coming weeks, as we debate the budget, let us keep our word on \neducation and on child care and on health care. Last year we lightened \nthe tax load on middle-class families by creating a new $500 child tax \ncredit and a $1,500 tax credit for college expenses. In the coming \nweeks, as we debate the budget, let us further that commitment to tax \nfairness, not walk away from it.\n  This year, for the first time in 30 years, we will actually have a \nbalanced Federal budget. In the coming weeks, as we debate the budget, \nlet us remember how hard it has been to eliminate the deficit and what \ngood has come from this fiscal discipline. Let us do nothing that would \nsend us back to where we were 5 years ago, when we were looking at \n$300-billion-a-year deficits for as far as the eye could see.\n  The IRS bill is long overdue, but it is only a start. What the \nAmerican people also want us to do is, they want us to provide them \nwith some assurance that if they work hard and play by the rules, they \nwill be able to make a decent life for themselves and their families. \nSo let us pass this bill. And, in what little time we have remaining in \nthis Congress, let us work together to keep the commitment we made last \nyear to the issues and the matters and the priorities that really can \nmake a difference in people's lives.\n  If we do that, the next time one of us is visiting on the steps of \nthe Capitol with some young people from our State, we will be able to \ntell them something else they can cheer a lot about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me congratulate the Democratic leader for an \nexcellent statement. I couldn't have said it better myself. He is \nright; we have an excellent piece of legislation here. The law, as we \nare proposing it, will dramatically improve the kind of service that \ntaxpayers get, make the IRS much more efficient, and give people much \nmore confidence in Government of, by, and for the people. But it does \nhave a funding flaw. I intend to vote for this bill myself. I pledge to \ndo what I can to make certain that we find a correction of that funding \nflaw.\n  Mr. President, 177,000 people, according to the Joint Tax Committee, \nwill pay $50,000.\n  These are individuals who are 70 years of age or older who make over \n$100,000 in mostly retirement income. So they have to have well over $1 \nmillion in liquid assets and earning assets that are producing that \nkind of income.\n  What they are going to do is pay $50,000 per person in order to \nconvert a current IRA that produces taxable income into an IRA that has \nno taxation on that income. What is very likely to happen is they will \nhave their estates transfer it to their heirs who will not pay tax at \nall.\n  These are not people struggling to save money. There is no social \nbenefit you can calculate here. As the distinguished Democratic leader \nsaid, it does\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nprovide $8 billion in the first 3 or 4 years. We are doing it in the \nsecond 5, so there is time to correct this problem.\n  As you get into the outyears, at the very time we are looking at the \nbaby boomers retiring, what we are going to do about Medicare and \nSocial Security, that is going to be the dominant question around here \nat that particular time. The cost of this program will widen up $2 \nbillion, $3 billion, $4 billion a year. It is one of the things that \nlooks good going in, because it looks cost free, but it certainly is \nnot.\n  I appreciate very much the distinguished Democratic leader's \nstatement. It is exactly what we need to be worried about as we head \ntowards final passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nlegislation. I compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, for having \nthe most significant oversight hearings that we have had in this \nCongress, indeed for the last several Congresses. A lot of us have said \nwe need to do better oversight, and we talked about it but we didn't do \nit. This is the case where the Finance Committee had the first serious \noversight of the IRS in our history. It is long overdue, and it \nuncovered a lot of things. It uncovered ugly examples of Government \nabuse of power, Government abuse of power which should never have \nhappened, which was exposed, and I believe with this legislation, we \nare going to help correct it and make sure it doesn't happen again.\n  I compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for those hearings. \nThose hearings were initially held in September, and then we had \nfollow-up hearings just last month. Each additional set of hearings \nkept showing abuses that were even more outlandish than the ones \nbefore, culminated by the fact that one disgruntled IRS agent actually \nhad tried to set up Senator Howard Baker, and a Congressman and a \ndistrict attorney. Unbelievable; unbelievable abuse of power. I \ncompliment our colleagues for the oversight hearings.\n  I also compliment Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley for their work \non a commission that helped give us some material to produce good \nreform. We had the hearings, and we also had legislative oversight and \nsome work done through their commission to produce recommendations for \na positive legislative overhaul. I compliment both Senator Grassley and \nSenator Kerrey for their fine work in doing that.\n  Also, I compliment our colleagues in the House. We had the hearings \nin the Senate in September, and our colleagues in the House passed IRS \nreform legislation on November 5. I disagree with my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side who said, ``We should have passed the House bill.'' \nSenator Roth and some of us said we can do better than the House, and I \nthink we have. The House bill was a giant step in the right direction, \nbut we have done a lot more than the House did. The House did not have \nlegislation to deal with innocent spouse issues, which we also had \nhearings on and which showed a lot of innocent spouses were abused by \nthe IRS system. We are correcting that in this legislation.\n  We had a hearing in Oklahoma. It was the first IRS field hearing that \nwe have had. It was one I found very interesting. We had Oklahomans who \ntestified about some of the problems they had. As a result of their \ntestimony, we made this legislation better. I will give a couple of \nexamples.\n\n  We had Lisa New, who is a young lady from Guthrie, OK, testify. She \nwas a pet groomer. She groomed pets. She was a school bus driver, and \nshe was a single mother. She owed the IRS $4,000 in 1986. She found out \nabout it and went to the IRS. She said, ``I owe you this money. I would \nlike to pay it off $100 a month.'' IRS said, ``No, we want it all \nimmediately.'' She couldn't pay it, so the IRS put a lien on her home.\n  Her debt to the IRS, as of last month, totaled about $30,000 of \ninterest and penalties on an original $4,000 debt back in 1986.\n  In this legislation, we say that penalties and interest will not \naccrue to the deficiency if the IRS does not notify the taxpayer within \n1 year. We also say the IRS will be required to adopt a liberal \nacceptance policy for offers in compromise. They clearly did not do \nthat in this case. We also say liens would not be allowed if the \noriginal tax debt was less than $5,000. So we make some changes.\n  We had another case where an individual, whom a lot of people in this \nroom might recognize--he is somewhat of a well-known Olympic athlete \ncoach--Steve Nunno. He was coach of the U.S. Olympic gymnastics team, \ncoach of Shannon Miller, a great all-American coach. He had a problem \nwith the IRS. His business grew a lot, and he was making quarterly \npayments for payroll taxes. Then his business grew some more. Suddenly, \nhe was supposed to make payroll tax payments monthly. He got a little \nbit behind. He recognized that. He said he was willing to work it out, \nand he worked it out with an agent. They signed an agreement that if he \nmakes these payments of so much per month over this period, that would \nbe acceptable.\n  Then the IRS changed agents. A new agent came in and said, ``No, we \nwant to be paid immediately, and if you don't pay up immediately, we're \ngoing to put a padlock on your business and put a lien on your \nbusiness.'' He was traveling in Europe with the U.S. Olympians and his \nteam, and he had an IRS agent threatening to close down his gymnastics \nbusiness. It is absolutely absurd. He borrowed the money. He was able \nto pay it off.\n  We put in provisions to make sure that would not happen again. We now \nsay that a taxpayer will be given the opportunity of a court hearing \nbefore liens, levies or seizures. He is going to have a chance to have \na hearing. He is going to have an appeals process. Not a single agent \nis going to be able to come in and say, ``I disagree with you; if you \ndon't pay up by''--such and such a date--``we are going to padlock your \nbusiness.'' We protect that taxpayer. We say the IRS can only seize the \ntaxpayer's business or home as a last resort.\n  Unfortunately, we found out in Oklahoma and Arkansas as a result of \nour investigation that we had seizure rates in this district about \neight times the national average, and we even found that there were \nincentives for employees to close those cases. ``We don't care if you \nseize the assets, close those cases,'' and people would receive \nfinancial benefits. We stopped that in this legislation.\n  We also say that notices to taxpayers must include the name and phone \nnumber of the IRS contact. They will know somebody to call. They are \nnot going to get the runaround and talk to 15 different agents when \nthey are trying to deal with a case. We have that in this legislation.\n  None of that, I might add, was in the House bill. None of it was in \nthe House bill. I can mention a couple others.\n  We had Dr. Jim Highfill of Ponca City testify. He is a dentist. He \nhad IRS agents come into his office and announce that he was under \ninvestigation. We put provisions in this bill that says the IRS will be \nreorganized so that small businesses will only work with IRS employees \nspecializing in small business issues. That will help solve some of \nthese problems.\n  We also say IRS employees who disclose taxpayer information, such as \nnotices of summons, will be subject to termination. The IRS agents came \ninto his office and said, ``We've got a summons for this dentist,'' in \nfront of his patients to embarrass him, to intimidate him. We now make \nthose agents subject to termination.\n  We found abuse after abuse, and we found IRS agents were not \nterminated. I will mention that most of the 102,000 IRS agents and \nemployees are outstanding civil servants, but some have abused their \npower, and they should be terminated for that abuse of power. In almost \nevery case we listened to, they were not terminated.\n  We also say that advice from a CPA to a taxpayer will be privileged \nthe same as advice from a tax attorney. I could go on.\n  We put a lot of provisions in the Senate bill that were not in the \nHouse bill. We made it better. I wouldn't say it is perfect, but I \nthink it is a lot better. There was a reason for the Senate to be a \nlittle more deliberate. It was the Senate that had the initial \nhearings. The House marked up the bill, and, again, my compliments to \nthe House. Sometimes they do things a little more\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\nquickly, but sometimes we do them a little bit better.\n  This is a more thorough bill. This is a bill that has been researched \nbetter. We are solving more problems for taxpayers in this bill.\n  Finally, at the hearings that we had in the last couple of weeks, we \nheard different cases. In Texas, there was a business that had 32 \nemployees, and 64 IRS agents raided the business. Their intent was to \nintimidate and abuse their power.\n  Or the case in Virginia Beach where an individual had a restaurant, a \ndozen or so IRS agents broke into his restaurant, his home, and his \npartner's home, broke his door down. They certainly abused their power. \nAgents who abuse their power should be terminated.\n  Or for example the investigation of Senator Baker and others, that \nwas certainly abuse power. Those people who supervised that IRS agent \nare also responsible, not just the bad apple in this case. He was \neventually terminated because he was arrested for having cocaine in his \ncar, not for the abuse of the investigation of a Senator, a \nCongressman, and a district attorney.\n  So not only should he have been disciplined, but his supervisor who \ndid not corral him, after some very honest and good employees said, \n``Wait a minute; this investigation is going too far,'' and tried to \nstop it. Their supervisors did not discipline the person who was \nresponsible. They should have been terminated. They should have felt \nthe penalties for not reining in the IRS.\n  The IRS has been out of control. In many, many cases they abuse their \npower. So this bill is going to try to rein in the IRS, make the IRS \nmore accountable to taxpayers, make sure that they understand the ``S'' \nin ``Internal Revenue Service'' stands for ``service,'' that they are \nservants, that they work for the people, not the other way around, and \nthat the people who are God-fearing and are willing to pay their taxes \nhave nothing to fear of the IRS. They may have some disputes because of \nthe complexity of the law, but if they are willing to pay their fair \nshare of taxes, they are not trying to cheat the system, they should \nnot fear the IRS gestapo-type tactics that we have heard about in \nrecent weeks.\n  So I again want to compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Kerrey, and other people, who have worked to \nput together, I think, a very good bill, a positive bill, one that will \nbe of real benefit to taxpayers and one that we can say, yes, we have \ndone something positive, and we have worked together to make it happen.\n  I am pleased that now the President is supporting this bill. I might \nmention--I look at a statement from the Washington Post dated October \n1, 1997. It says: President Clinton opposes legislative reform of the \nIRS saying, ``I believe the IRS is functioning better today than it was \n5 years ago.''\n  He was speaking in reference to the Republican reform proposals. ``We \nshould not politicize it and we should not do anything that will in any \nway call into question whether it is evenhanded or fair in the \nfuture.''\n  Originally, President Clinton was against this bill. Originally, \nSecretary Rubin was against this bill. I am glad they decided they \nwould support the House bill. I am glad they have decided they would \nsupport the Senate bill. Both are good pieces of legislation. Both need \nto pass. Both need to become law.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank the sponsors and look forward to this \nbecoming the law of the land. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I gather we are waiting for one of our additional \ncolleagues to complete one more item on this bill. I want to take the \nopportunity, if I can, to join my colleague from Oklahoma in commending \nthe chairman of the committee--I see him now entering the Chamber \nhere--and Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey, Senator \nGrassley, and others from the Finance Committee who have been involved \nin producing this piece of legislation. I think this is going to carry \noverwhelmingly, maybe even unanimously. That is something we do not do \nthat often around here. And that is a tribute to what I think more \nAmericans want to see, and that is a sense of bipartisanship on issues \nlike this.\n  This could have become highly controversial. But the fact that there \nhas been such comity between the majority and minority I think has \nallowed us to produce the kind of legislation that we will be voting on \nshortly.\n  I am going to in a minute ask for the attention of the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee because I want to raise an issue. And I will \nraise it and talk a little bit about it. Maybe he is going to go \nthrough his notes a little bit.\n\n  As our colleagues are aware, Senator Bennett of Utah and I are chair \nand vice chair of this new special committee on the year 2000 problem, \nMr. President. This is to deal with the computer glitch that now has \nreceived widespread publicity over the last number of weeks and is an \nissue that some raised several years ago in this country warning us of \nthe problem we would face if we did not take care of the problems where \non January 1, 2000, computer programs, instead of reading, ``January 1, \n2000,'' would read, ``January 1, 00,'' and that would be computed by \nmany to be ``1900,'' not ``2000.''\n  It has been estimated that costs nationally and internationally could \nrun anywhere from $300 billion to close to $2 trillion for this fix. \nBob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, has indicated that the fix at \nthat Department alone, excluding, I believe, the Internal Revenue \nService costs, is $1.4 billion just to become compliant with the year \n2000 problem by September of next year, which is when the systems ought \nto be on line to be tested for 2 or 3 months before January 1, 2000, \noccurs.\n  There is an issue here that I believe the committee has tried to \nresolve. And my colleague from Nebraska, I know, is involved in this. \nAnd Senator Moynihan, certainly, who is a member of our special \ncommittee, has also been involved in this. And that is so we don't find \nour reform efforts here running into the date problem of January 1, \n2000. I would argue that that all of the problems consumers could face \nif the IRS were not compliant by January 1, 2000 are just as critical \nin many ways as the problems we are addressing today. That effort has \nbeen made in this bill to try to make sure that does not happen. And I \ngather further from talking with Senator Bennett of Utah that \nprovisions would be included that would allow for the Joint Taxation \nCommittee to analyze what we are doing and that if, through the good \nefforts of the committee, it does not quite meet the needs, in \nconference we may have to move some dates a little bit.\n  I am not sure I am stating this very well at all. And I see the \ndistinguished--either one of my two colleagues might want to respond, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. KERREY. If the Senator would yield for a statement.\n  The Senator is exactly right. There is a tremendous problem with this \nY2K issue, and that is going to be felt by taxpayers who are not going \nto get returns. They are not going to get refunds and not going to be \nable to deal with the IRS because the computers are not going to be \nable to function unless the Y2K problem is solved. And there is no \nmargin for error; you cannot have it 99 percent, you have to have it \n100 percent, or there will be far greater problems with the IRS than \nanything our oversight hearings and the Restructuring Commission \nhearings have identified.\n  I call to the Senator's attention--in fact, I think I should read it \ninto the Record. Mr. Rossotti has, by the way, sent the Finance \nCommittee a letter. Senator Moynihan has an amendment that instructs us \nto delay some of the implementation, and I believe he is going to offer \nit later, and I think we have agreed to accept that amendment. I am not \nsure that solves the problem entirely. We have to talk to Mr. Rossotti \nabout it. But let me read to the Senator what Mr. Rossotti said today, \nthe IRS Commissioner said today, to the Ways and Means Committee. He \nsaid:\n\n       Finally, the Administration has serious concerns of the IRS \n     restructuring legislation that require changes to IRS \n     computer systems in 1998 and 1999. Mandating these changes \n     according to schedule currently in the bill would make it \n     virtually impossible for the IRS to ensure that its computer \n     systems are Year 2000 compliant by January 1, 2000, and would \n     create a genuine risk of a\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\n     catastrophic failure of the Nation's tax collection system in \n     the year 2000.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, my hope is that \nthe changes that we are going to make in a few minutes, that Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Roth and you and Senator Bennett have called to \nour attention, I hope that gets the job done.\n\n  I think in conference we are going to have to listen to Commissioner \nRossotti very, very carefully, because there is no question, if we do \nnot get this thing fixed right, the problems that will be created by \nnot being Y2K compliant will be much, much greater than any of the \nproblems we currently have with the IRS.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank immensely my colleague from Nebraska for his \ncomments. I do not know if I phrased this in the form of a question--\nsort of a statement I have made about my concerns about this.\n  I know the Senator from Delaware, Mr. President, shares these \nconcerns. And he has been working with Senator Moynihan, his ranking \nDemocrat on this committee, to try to address this. And maybe he would \ncare to comment as well as to where we stand with this.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think, I say to the distinguished Senator, that we are \nall very concerned about this problem of the year 2000. We must solve \nit. We have no alternative. We have no choice. So we are all going to \nwork to accomplish that.\n  At the same time, it is critically important that we move ahead, \nbringing about the kind of reforms we have been debating and talking \nabout this week. Neither one has to take a back seat. We want to move \nforward together. I assure you that we have been working with Senator \nMoynihan, with Commissioner Rossotti, as well as Joint Taxation. And \nSenator Moynihan will be offering an amendment that will address some \nof the concerns you are raising.\n  This is going to be an ongoing process. As time moves on, we may have \nto adjust, because we are going to make certain, as the committee with \noversight responsibility, that this agency meets its obligations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and distinguished \nchairman of the committee for that point. I say we have just begun this \nspecial committee's work. We have not even had our first meetings yet. \nThis body only authorized the expenditure of funds for this committee a \nfew weeks ago. And there are seven of our colleagues, seven of us, who \nwill serve on this select committee--four members from the majority and \nthree from the minority, with Senator Bennett of Utah chairing the \neffort.\n  We think it is an important issue that must be resolved. This \ncommittee obviously has to go forward with its reform package. And I \njust wanted to make sure we are on record here as saying this is a very \ncritical issue, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out. This is \none where you can't say we will fix it the second week in January or we \nwill fix it in February of the year 2000. The IRS will have to be \ncompliant and the Treasury will have to be compliant or we will have a \nhuge mess on our hands.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2380\n\n (Purpose: To provide effective dates which allow the Internal Revenue \nService to implement changes to the tax code and to meet the year 2000 \n                     computer conversion deadline)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if it is appropriate, I send an amendment to \nthe desk to be offered by Senator Moynihan, and I will send it on his \nbehalf. Senator Kerrey and I leave it open for others. Maybe Senator \nRoth and Senator Bennett may want to be part of it. I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Moynihan, \n     for himself, Mr. Roth, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2380.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 308, line 12, insert ``the 2nd and succeeding'' \n     before ``calendar quarters''.\n       On page 309, lines 7 and 8, strike ``the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December 31, 1999''.\n       On page 343, line 24, insert:\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     except for automated collection system actions initiated \n     before January 1, 2000.\n       On page 345, lines 6 and 7, strike ``the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December 31, 1999''.\n       On page 351, lines 13 and 14, strike ``the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December 31, 1999''.\n       On page 357, lines 6 and 7, strike ``the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December 31, 1999''.\n       On page 357, lines 9 and 10, strike ``the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December 31, 1999''.\n       On page 357, lines 16 and 17, and insert:\n       (B) December 31, 1999.\n       On page 362, lines 12 and 13, strike ``the 60th day after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act'' and insert ``December \n     31, 1999''.\n       On page 382, line 2, strike ``60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act'' and insert ``January 1, 2000''.\n       On page 383, line 14, insert ``, except that the removal of \n     any designation under subsection (a)(2)(A) shall not be \n     required to begin before January 1, 1999'' after ``Act''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the distinguished majority and minority have \nworked on this over the last number of days. I will let them speak for \nthemselves as to their endorsement of it.\n  I appreciate the chairman's efforts in this regard. I am heartened by \nhis comments that we will have to watch this, our little committee \nwill, and we will keep the Finance Committee well informed. If we \ndiscover something, we will let you know very promptly if some other \nremedial legislative action may be necessary for us to respond to this \nissue. This will be true of other committees, as well, I say. This is a \ntremendously serious issue.\n  I see my colleague from Georgia has arrived on the floor, and I know \nMembers want to move along. I am deeply grateful to the chairman and to \nthe ranking minority member and to others for allowing us to offer this \namendment. We think it will solve the problem raised here, that will \nminimize the dangers to the Treasury Department and the IRS \nnoncompliance as we push reforms forward and find a crashing of the \nsystem, which, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, would be, \nfrankly, far more injurious than any of the problems we presently have. \nAs bad as the current problems are, a total system crash would be an \nequally serious problem.\n  I will also offer some overall remarks about the bill, which the \ndistinguished manager and others have presented with us this afternoon. \nI intend to support it, and I thank them for their efforts. As soon as \nI have concluded those remarks, I will yield the floor and allow the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member here, and others, to offer \nwhatever comments they want on this amendment and thank them.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, especially Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, and Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska for bringing this bill to the floor. It takes an \nimportant step forward in the effort to protect the rights of our \nnation's taxpayers.\n  The IRS is an agency under widespread, deeply felt, and entirely \njustified criticism. In my view, the bill before us today is perhaps \none of the most critical the Senate will vote on this session.\n  It is no secret that the IRS has come under fire lately from \ntaxpayers who, in their dealings with the agency, have experienced \nanger, frustration, and despair.\n  The hearings conducted by the Senate Finance Committee have \nhighlighted some of the problems at the IRS, including shoddy \nmanagement, poor taxpayer service, and in some cases, reports of \ntaxpayer abuse by IRS employees.\n  No one likes to pay taxes, but taxes are a fact of life in a \ncivilized society. Most Americans accept that fact.\n  What really gets people, however, is when personnel at the agency \nthat collects their taxes treats them with disrespect and carelessness.\n  No one deserves such treatment.\n  I have heard from many Connecticut constituents about what they feel \nis unhelpful, unreasonable, and sometimes downright unpleasant \ntreatment by officers of the IRS.\n  I've heard stories from them about calls that aren't answered, and \nabout calls that are bounced from one person to the next, so that they \nnever find a\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\nreal answer to their questions, or receive any type of guidance or \nsupport.\n  I've heard about the nightmare of the IRS losing taxpayer's checks, \nand then charging them interest and penalties on the very funds that \nthe agency lost.\n  The list goes on and on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk \nto, the more nightmares you hear.\n  Every citizen who pays taxes has a right to be treated fairly, and \ntreated as innocent until proven liable for failing to meet their legal \nresponsibilities. Although we have taken several steps in this regard \nin the last few years, there is still more that can be done, and that \nis why I support the bill before us today.\n  This legislation aims to transform this agency into an institution \nthat provides efficient and fair service, yet still has the ability to \neffectively collect revenues.\n  The bill includes a number of important provisions to help America's \ntaxpayers.\n  First, the legislation would shift the burden of proof away from the \ntaxpayer, and expand the ability of taxpayers to recover costs and \nlitigation fees. These provisions will help ensure that the IRS \nexercises appropriate caution and consideration prior to commencing \nenforcement action against any taxpayer. For too long we've seen a \n``shoot now, ask questions later'' approach to enforcement by the IRS. \nThese provisions are designed to see that the agency does its homework \nbefore taking any action.\n  Secondly, it would establish a new IRS Oversight Board made up of six \nmembers from the private sector, the IRS Commissioner, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, and a member from an employee organization that \nrepresents a substantial number of IRS employees. This board would, \namong other things, review the operations of the IRS to ensure that our \nnation's taxpayers are properly treated.\n  Third, this bill would establish the position of the National \nTaxpayer Advocate who would have a background in customer service and \ntax law, as well as experience representing individual taxpayers to \nfurther ensure that taxpayers are treated fairly and that their rights \nare not violated. In addition, the bill would create a system of local \ntaxpayer advocates thereby making the IRS more accessible and \nresponsive to taxpayers on a local level.\n  Fourth, this legislation would provide so-called innocent spouses \nwith a measure of relief by allowing taxpayers to elect to limit their \nliability to the tax attributable to their income only. I'm sure that \nmany of my colleagues have heard stories similar to those I've heard in \nConnecticut, about people who have become financially wiped out when \nthey find themselves liable for taxes, interest, and penalties because \nof actions by their spouse of which they were unaware. The innocent \nspouse provisions wold help prevent such scenarios from occurring in \nthe future.\n  Fifth, this bill would require the IRS to provide taxpayers with \nbetter information regarding taxpayer rights, potential liabilities \nwhen filing joint returns, and the appeals and collections process, and \nwould extend the attorney-client privilege confidentiality to any \nindividual authorized to practice before the IRS, including certified \npublic accountants, and enrolled agents and actuaries.\n  This legislation also includes a number of provisions designed to \ngive the IRS Commissioner flexibility to make structural and personnel \ndecisions in order to attract expertise from the private sector, \nredesign its salary and incentive structures to reward employees who \nmeet objectives, and hold non-performing employees accountable. \nFurthermore, it requires the IRS to terminate employees for certain \nproven violations, chief of which are actions that mistreat taxpayers.\n  Finally, while this bill gives a degree of flexibility to the IRS to \nmake reforms internally, it also makes sure that there remains a \nmeasure of Congressional accountability by requiring the IRS \nCommissioner to report annually to Congress.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, the IRS is in need of dire reform and we \nmust hold it to the highest standards of efficiency and competence.\n  And, while I acknowledge and applaud the good work Commissioner \nRossotti has already put forth to turn this agency around, it is clear \nthat there is much left to be done.\n  The legislation before us today, which enjoys broad, bipartisan \nsupport, is a tremendous step forward in our effort to protect the \nrights of our nation's taxpayers, and we owe it to them to pass this \nbill favorably. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, January 1, 2000 is just over 600 days \naway. The century date change, or Y2K for short, is a matter of large \nand serious consequence. In testimony before the Senate Commerce, \nCommittee, Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward Kelley Jr. estimated \nthat U.S. businesses will spend at least $50 billion on Y2K conversion, \nwith the worldwide repair cost potentially exceeding $300 billion.\n  The century date change is also an issue of surpassing difficulty for \nthe Internal Revenue Service. IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti \nrecently stated in a USA Today interview:\n\n       The most compelling thing by far is fixing the computers so \n     they don't stop working on Jan. 1, 2000. . . . If we don't \n     fix (them), there will be 90 million people 21 months from \n     now who won't get refunds. The whole financial system of the \n     United States will come to a halt. It's very serious. It no \n     only could happen, it will happen if we don't fix it right.\n\n  In testimony before the Finance Committee last year, Linda Willis of \nthe General Accounting Office suggested that ``the IRS [may be] the \nlargest civilian year 2000 conversion, at least in the country, and \npossibly in the world.'' She also testified that the Y2K problem could \nbe ``catastrophic'' if not addressed.\n  The century date change is the highest technology priority at the \nIRS; more than 550 employees are at work on Y2K conversion-related \nactivities. The IRS will spend approximately $1 billion to become Y2K \ncompliant.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has begun to experience complications in its \nY2K conversion efforts. On January 23, the Associated Press reported \nthat ``about 1,000 taxpayers who were current in their tax installment \nagreements were suddenly declared in default,'' caused by ``an attempt \nto fix a Year 2000 issue in one of the IRS computers.''\n  In addition, last year's Taxpayer Relief Act included hundreds of \nchanges in the tax laws, requiring diversions of scarce IRS computer \nprogramming resources and causing a 3 month delay in the Agency's Y2K \nefforts.\n  The Y2K problem is more complex than it may seem. The IRS computers \nare outdated; the reprogramming must be done in obsolete computer \nlanguages that are no longer taught in schools.\n  Mr. President, it was with these challenges in mind that Senator \nKerrey and I offered this amendment to briefly delay some of the \neffective dates in the Finance Committee's IRS Restructuring \nlegislation in order to allow time for the Y2K conversion to be \ncompleted. This amendment has been drafted based on Commissioner \nRossotti's recommendations, and has been modified after consultations \nwith the Majority.\n  The amendment would delay the effective date on a list of provisions \nfrom date of enactment until after the century date change.\n  Regrettably, we were unable to reach agreement with the majority on \nadditional effective date delays that Commissioner Rossotti has \nrecommended. I fear we will come to regret this.\n  Mr. President I hope that in conference we will examine these \neffective dates again, and that we will agree to change those that risk \ninterfering with Commissioner Rossotti's Y2K conversion program. I \nthank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in order to accept this amendment--\nwhich deals with the effective dates of many of the provisions in the \nIRS Restructuring Bill.\n  As I have stated before, this legislation has three main purposes--\nfirst, to reorganize, restructure, and re-equip the IRS to make it more \ncustomer friendly in its tax-collecting mission; second, to protect \ntaxpayers from abusive practices and procedures of the IRS. And third, \nto deal with the management problem and misconduct of some IRS \nemployees.\n  In order to accomplish these goals--to bring about fundamental \nreform, we are enacting numerous provisions. Some of those provisions \nwill require the IRS to undergo significant reprogramming of its \nsystems; some of\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nthem can be accomplished with little burden.\n  I recognize that the IRS needs to continue to function at the same \ntime that it makes these important changes. The IRS also needs to deal \nwith massive computer reprogramming brought about by the century date \nchange--the so called ``year 2000 problem.''\n  It is not my intention to impose unreasonable effective dates on the \nIRS. At the same time, I recognize that sometimes we need to push the \nIRS, to prompt it to make changes. We should not simply defer to their \nassessment that they will be unable to accomplish the goals we have \nset.\n  On April 23, Commissioner Rossotti expressed his concern that the \neffective dates in our bill could severely impact the ability of the \nIRS to deal with the year 2000 computer problem. I understood his \nposition.\n  Nevertheless, I believed then, and I believe now, that justice \ndelayed is justice denied. Many of the reforms in our bill are long \noverdue. Taxpayers have already been waiting for them for a long time. \nInnocent spouses should not have to wait any longer for relief. \nTaxpayers in installment agreements should not have to wait any longer \nfor reduction of their failure to pay penalty. Taxpayers subject to IRS \naudits should not have to wait any longer for the IRS to complete its \nbusiness.\n  To find a middle ground, I asked the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to meet with representatives of the IRS in order to discuss \nthe impact of the effective dates. Joint Tax did so, and on Tuesday, \nMay 5, they provided Senator Moynihan and me with their \nrecommendations.\n  Joint Tax recommended that many of the effective dates remain the \nsame, but that some others be delayed.\n  This amendment adopts most of the recommendations made by Joint Tax. \nSpecifically, the amendment does not delay the effective date for the \nmajor taxpayer protections in the bill.\n  The amendment does not delay innocent spouse relief--in other words, \nas of the date of enactment of this bill, innocent spouses will no \nlonger suffer under the burden of paying for their spouse's tax fraud.\n  The amendment also does not delay due process for taxpayers--meaning \nthat among other things, taxpayers will receive rights of appeal and \nrights of notice before their property is seized. These are fundamental \nrights that we should get to taxpayers as soon as possible.\n  The amendment also does not delay what we have referred to as the one \nyear rule. This means that effective next tax year--1998--taxpayers \nwill know that the IRS has one year to tell them whether they owe any \nadditional tax. If the IRS is delinquent, all interest and penalties on \nthat additional tax will be suspended until the IRS gets its act \ntogether and notifies the taxpayer of the deficiency.\n  The amendment also does not delay what we refer to as cascading \npenalties. That means that taxpayers can designate which period their \ndeposits are applied to, and can avoid the situation where a taxpayer \nis making payments, but nevertheless, accruing penalties even faster.\n  I have said already, these reforms are long overdue. Our guiding \nprinciple should be rapid relief for American taxpayers--for the \nindividuals who have suffered long enough because of the practices and \nprocedures of the IRS. This bill is all about taxpayer protections. We \nshould deliver those protections to taxpayers as soon as possible.\n  I note that President Clinton recently stated that these reforms \nshould be enacted as soon as possible. I assume that he did not mean \nthat the law should go into effect two years from now.\n  Mr. President, this bill is also about changing the culture of the \nIRS. Under Chairman Rossotti's leadership, that had already begun. We \nexpect that to continue. The fact that we are accommodating some of the \nIRS' requests and delaying certain effective dates should not be taken \nas a sign that we are not serious about reforming the agency. On that \nsubject, let there be no mistake. This bill will bring about \nfundamental change at an agency that is in dire need of such change. We \nexpect the IRS to improve its service--to change its culture--to be \nmore responsive to taxpayers--at the same time that it implements its \nsystem changes.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I will accept this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I have been informed by my colleague from Utah, Senator \nBennett, chairman of the select committee of the year 2000 problem, \nwould like to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the amendment is acceptable on this side. \nIt was Senator Moynihan's amendment initially. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2380) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent when Senator Coverdell offers an \namendment regarding random audits, there be 15 minutes equally divided \nfor debate on the amendment. I further ask unanimous consent following \nthe expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nor in relation to that Coverdell amendment. Further, that no amendments \nbe in order to the Coverdell amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does this \nproposal preclude the consideration of any further amendments before \nthird reading?\n  Mr. ROTH. Senator Collins has an amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. KERREY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not object to the unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2353\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the \n             use of random audits, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I call up amendment 2353, which I believe is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for himself, Mr. Cochran, \nMr. Frist and Mr. Hagel, proposes an amendment numbered 2353.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 342, after line 24, add:\n\n     SEC. 3418. PROHIBITION OF RANDOM AUDITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7602 (relating to examination of \n     books and witnesses), as amended by section 3417, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Limitations of Authority To Examine.--\n       ``(1) Identification of purpose and basis for examination \n     required.--In taking any action under subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall identify in plain language the purpose and \n     the basis for initiating an examination in any notice of such \n     an examination to any person described in subsection (a).\n       ``(2) Random Audits prohibited.--The Secretary shall not \n     base, in whole or in part, the initiation of an examination \n     of a return under subsection (a) on the use of a \n     statistically random return selection technique from a \n     population or subpopulation.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to examinations initiated after April 29, 1998.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to be brief. This amendment \nis designed to end random audits. The IRS said they did not do them. I \nwas suspicious. GAO says they do.\n  The GAO tell us 95 percent of the random audits today are focused on \npoor\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\npeople, and there are a disproportionate number of them in the South \nand in my State. I don't believe it is the American way to have random \naudits. There is nothing in the return that suggests anything wrong and \nyet, bang, you spin a roulette wheel and out you come and they are in \nyour face. It is unconscionable that they are in the face of poor \npeople who are least equipped to deal with it.\n  The GAO says to end these random audits would deny the Federal \nGovernment a precious $2.8 million. Late this afternoon, the Joint Tax \nCommittee has said it would cause revenues of $1 billion a year.\n  This is why people are so upset with this city, the gamesmanship that \nhas to be played in order to correct something that is absolutely \nwrong. The rules are working against me tonight but I will be back. \nThis GAO report shows conclusively that something needs to be done. We \nwill have our vote tonight. In deference to everybody's time, I won't \nbelabor it.\n  I believe the Senator from Mississippi would like to speak on this \nfrom our time, and I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia brought this problem up and I had a chance to look at some of \nthe information, the GAO audit showed there are 3,000 audits of this \nkind performed each year. Of those audits, the report showed that 47 \npercent of them took place in Southern States.\n  I looked further and saw that the GAO found that there were more \nrandom audits that took place in my State of Mississippi than in all of \nthe States of New England combined. I couldn't believe that. I wondered \nwhy on Earth is that and then we find out that it is the working poor \nwho are being targeted by these random audits.\n  The numbers are just startling. Between 1994 and 1996, 94 percent of \nrandom audits were performed on individual taxpayers who earned less \nthan $25,000 per year. If you think about that, these are people who \nprobably don't normally retain a lawyer or maybe even a CPA or other \ntax advisor in the preparation of their audits.\n  So what the amendment would do, which I cosponsor with the Senator \nfrom Georgia, is to require the IRS to give notice of why they are \nconducting an audit of taxpayers like this. It raises a question of \njust obvious unfairness. On its face, it is unfair and it ought to be \nchanged.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senators from \nGeorgia and Mississippi have identified a problem, a dilemma we all \nface from time to time. We sometimes get a score back from Joint Tax \nthat seems much higher than is logical, and that is what happened in \nthis case. So there will be a point of order that will have to be urged \nagainst this amendment as a consequence of violating the pay-go \nprovisions of the Budget Act, section 202.\n  I regret that because I believe the Senators from Georgia and \nMississippi have identified a legitimate problem. I am frustrated \nmyself in not being able to deal with it in a more orderly fashion. It \nis something the Finance Committee needs to take up and hold hearings \non, ask the IRS to come and tell us what they are doing in this case.\n  It seems to me that both the Senator from Georgia and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi have identified a problem, and it is very difficult to \ndefend the IRS behavior in this case. I appreciate them bringing it to \nour attention. I regret that you find yourselves, as many of us have \nbefore, in the situation where you get a score back from the Joint Tax \nCommittee that seems, to say the least, a bit higher and that provokes, \nas a consequence, a point of order.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this \namendment, but I did want to speak in wrap-up on the bill itself, and \nalso to notify the Members of what the schedule would be. This seems \nlike a good time to do all of them because I have been inspired to want \nto speak on this amendment.\n  I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nGeorgia, and especially my colleague from Mississippi. This is totally \noutrageous that this kind of random audit is going on, and the people \nwho are getting the brunt of it are the people at the low end of the \nscale, from a poor State like my own State of Mississippi.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe we first got the inkling that this was \ngoing on at hearings last fall when we had hearings in the Finance \nCommittee, because I remember being struck by the fact that States like \nMississippi and Idaho were the ones that had a disproportionate share \nof these random audits.\n  I think a great job has been done on this bill, and there has been \nbipartisan input. But this is an unfairness that cannot be allowed to \ngo on. I am going to support this amendment. I realize it is going to \nbe difficult, under the circumstances. But I plead now with the \nchairman and the ranking member to get into this because we cannot \nallow this to continue. It is just another example of the type of thing \ngoing on at the IRS that I think Senators and the American people, \nfrankly, as a group, have been shocked to learn from the hearings that \nwe had, and as we are finding out more information. I commend the \nSenator for his amendment. I call upon the committee to do more on this \nand to work to make sure the IRS stops this kind of conduct.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, so they will have \na feel for what is going to be happening in the next few minutes, I \nbelieve this will be the last vote on an amendment. Shortly, we will be \ngoing to final passage on the IRS restructuring and reform bill--\nhopefully, within the next few minutes. That will be the last vote of \nthe day when we get to final passage. The Senate will be in session \ntomorrow for morning business speeches, confirmation of some Executive \nCalendar nominations, and the entering into of several time agreements \nwith respect to energy legislation. However, no votes will occur during \nFriday's session of the Senate.\n  On Monday, May 11, the Senate will consider a conference report, \nalong with, hopefully, at least three of the so-called high-tech bills. \nWe are working through the process now to clear those. The three we are \nlooking at on Monday are the S. 1618, an antislamming bill; S. 1260, a \nuniform standards bill; S. 1723, skilled workers legislation. The \nSenator in the Chair has been encouraging that. We are ``hotlining'' to \nget those clear.\n  However, because of a particular problem with one of our Senators who \nhas had a death in the family, we will not have any recorded votes \nduring Monday's session of the Senate. But there will be business on \nprobably at least four major items. The Senate will also begin \nconsideration of Calendar No. 345, S. 1873, the missile defense bill, \nwhich will be offered by the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate will attempt to reach a time agreement on the \nD'Amato bill regarding in-patient health care for breast cancer, and \nresume and complete action on any of the high-tech bills not completed \non Monday. Any votes ordered Monday will be postponed, to occur on \nTuesday, May 12, at approximately noon. The latter part of next week, \nwe expect to call up the DOD authorization bill.\n\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation in lining up this \nschedule. Senator Daschle has been very helpful. Also, I thank our \ncolleagues for the cooperation they have given us on the important \nlegislation that is before us. I thank Senator Roth for his determined \nleadership on this very important effort of reform and restructuring of \nthe IRS. Others were prepared to rush to judgment, but he said, no, \nthere is more to be done, there is more to know and more work that we \nneed to do on this important legislation. He persisted and he was \nright. We have learned more and we have a better bill. I appreciate the \ncooperation of Senator Moynihan. Senator Kerrey has been very much \ninvolved, and I am glad that we have reached a conclusion. The American \npeople expect this. There is no issue now. I find, when I go to my \nState, or others, nothing gets people more upset than what they have \nexperienced in dealing with the IRS.\n  Do they have an important job to do? Yes. Are there a lot of IRS \nagents who do good work and don't like the intimidation and threats and \ncoverups going on there because of the misconduct?\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\n Yes, there are good people there. But we have to stop the culture of \nintimidation, and we have to shift the burden to the IRS, away from the \ntaxpayer. We have to stop some of the payments that they are having \nthrust upon them. We have to stop a system that protects workers at IRS \nthat misbehave.\n  I think this bill will be a major step in that direction. It may not \nbe enough. This may be just the third in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. \nThere may have to be a fourth and a fifth. But the Senate, the Congress \ncannot let up. So I am pleased that we are going to bring this to a \nconclusion this afternoon. I thank all the Senators who have been \ninvolved in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Georgia have any \nfinal statements?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No.\n  Mr. KERREY. According to the Joint Tax, as a consequence of the broad \nnature of the prohibition of random audits, I believe this may end up \nbeing the language:\n\n       The Secretary shall not use, in whole or in part, in the \n     initiation and examination of a return, under subsection (a), \n     the use of a statistically random selection technique for the \n     population of subpopulation.\n\n  Random audits can work. In this case, the Senator from Georgia and \nthe Senator from Mississippi have identified a problem with random \naudits, and the problem is, if you throw them all out, it is a big \ncost--Joint Tax says a billion dollars a year. So when all time is \nyielded back, I am prepared to make a point of order against the \namendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me simply say that the incongruity \ncannot be more clear that the agency says it doesn't do random audits; \nyet, if they are prohibited, it would cost a billion dollars a year. We \nhave a problem we have to iron out here. As I said, GAO said it is $2.8 \nmillion. In deference to everybody's schedule here, I am prepared to \nrespond to the motion from the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, to be clear, so Members understand, the \nIRS uses random audits for noncompliant taxpayers. We heard this \nproblem a bit as well during the National Commission on Restructuring. \nA lot has to do with the ITC, and the effort we have had underway for \nseveral years is appropriate. But the effort that we have had to go \nafter fraud under the ITC is producing a tremendous amount of problems. \nWe regard noncompliance to be noncompliance, whether it is high income, \nmiddle income, or low income. If you have a noncompliant person in ITC, \nyou are doing a random audit. So I believe that may be the problem.\n  Again, I pledge to the Senators from Georgia and Mississippi that \nthis is something our committee needs to follow up on. It needs to \nfollow up and find out what the details are. As I said, I regret that \nat some point, when time is yielded back, I will make a budget point of \norder.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back all time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I make a budget point of order that the \namendment violates the pay-go provisions of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be laid aside and a vote occur on or in relation to the \namendment at a time to be determined by the majority manager after \nnotification of the Democratic manager, with no amendments in order.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator explain to me the \nconsequence of the unanimous consent? In other words, when will the \nvote on the motion to waive the point of order occur?\n  Mr. ROTH. We have one further amendment that I am aware of and some \nclose-up business. But then we would have the vote on the motion as the \nfinal vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I ask the manager of the bill whether \nor not this unanimous consent request would preclude raising another \namendment other than the one that the distinguished Senator from Maine \nis going to raise prior to third reading?\n  Mr. ROTH. The answer is no.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi is he referencing an amendment that was included in the \nearlier unanimous consent, or is he talking about adding an amendment \nthat was not included in the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my purpose is to raise an issue that I \ngave to the managers of the bill earlier. It relates to an amendment \nthat I proposed to offer and was hoping that the managers would be able \nto accept.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we have a problem here then, because this \nwould require a unanimous consent to add an additional amendment that \nwas not on the earlier unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request before \nthe body. The Chair asks if there is objection raised?\n  Mr. KERREY. Is the unanimous consent request to add an additional \namendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent is to set aside the \nmotion to waive for the consideration of another amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. In other words, the purpose is to stack the votes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from Maine \nnow seeks recognition.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2381\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the \n  reporting requirements in connection with the education tax credit)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Collins), for herself, and Mr. \n     DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 2381.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH EDUCATION \n                   TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Amounts to be Reported.--Subparagraph (C) of section \n     6050S(b)(2) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by inserting ``and any grant amount \n     received by such individual and processed through the \n     institution during such calendar year'' after ``calendar \n     year'',\n       (2) in clause (ii), by inserting ``by the person making \n     such return'' after ``year'', and\n       (3) in clause (iii), by inserting ``and'' at the end.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to returns required to be filed with respect to \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator DeWine and I are offering an \namendment to reduce some of the burdensome reporting requirements \nplaced on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime \nLearning Tax Credits.\n  These education tax incentives, which Congress created last year, are \nof great benefit to students and their families. Unfortunately, our \nattempt to expand educational opportunities has had the unintended \neffect of imposing a burdensome and costly reporting requirement on our \npost-secondary schools.\n  Beginning with tax year 1998, every college, university, and \nproprietary school will have to provide the IRS with an array of \ninformation that will do little, if anything, to assist in tax \ncollection. Not only will these schools have to report Social Security \nnumbers and the amount of qualified tuition and aid for each student, \nthe schools will also have to report to the IRS on the students' \nattendance status and program level.\n  But that is not all, and the reporting requirements do not stop \nthere, Mr.\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nPresident. The schools will also be required to report either a \ntaxpayer ID number or Social Security number for the person who will \nclaim the tax credit--generally a parent or a guardian--for all \nstudents who do not claim the tax credit themselves.\n  This administrative nightmare translates into real money.\n  The American Council on Education has estimated that this reporting \nrequirement will cost our colleges and universities $115 million in \n1998 and $136 million in 1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nAmerican Council on Education relating to the results of its cost \nsurvey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your leadership in \n     addressing the reporting requirements imposed on colleges and \n     universities by the education tax provisions established by \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n       The benefits of the Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits \n     to individual taxpayers and to the nation's human capital \n     will be enormous. However, the costs imposed on colleges and \n     universities to collect and report data to the federal \n     government on the estimated 25 million individuals who are \n     eligible for the credits will be exorbitant.\n       As you may recall, the higher education community formed a \n     task force comprised of campus officials and staff from nine \n     associations to analyze and document the full extent of the \n     burden these regulations pose. Chaired by James E. Morley \n     Jr., president of the National Association of College and \n     University Business Officers (NACUBO), this task force asked \n     institutions to prepare cost estimates for compliance with \n     the reporting requirements based on a standard template \n     prepared by NACUBO.\n       Our initial estimates indicate that the aggregate costs to \n     colleges and universities of complying with the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act reporting requirements will be approximately $115 \n     million for tax year 1998 and $136 million for tax year 1999. \n     The average cost of compliance increases in tax year 1999 \n     because of an increase in the number of students benefiting \n     from the tax credits.\n       When broken down on a per student basis, these costs \n     translate into $3.41 per student record for 1998, and $2.90 \n     per student record for 1999. These costs account for \n     resources required to obtain student data, file information \n     returns, integrate student data, respond to questions, and \n     for 1999, to obtain, process, and maintain information on \n     individuals certified by students as taxpayers who will claim \n     a tax credit.\n       The per student average camouflages the tremendous \n     variation in compliance costs among the nation's 6,000 \n     institutions of higher education. The per student cost is \n     estimated to be as low as $1.40 at one research university \n     and as high as $21.00 at another institution. These \n     variations are attributable to the number of students \n     enrolled and the sophistication of campus information \n     systems. The California Community College system, for \n     example, which is comprised of 107 colleges and services over \n     2.4 million students, estimates it will cost $20 million just \n     to develop a system to comply with the reporting \n     requirements. Ongoing costs of complying with the \n     requirements are estimated to be $12.6 million per year.\n       We will continue to gather information to refine these \n     estimates in the weeks ahead. Nonetheless, the preliminary \n     figures highlight the challenges colleges and universities \n     are confronting as they develop systems to comply with \n     reporting rewquiremetns introduced by the Taxpayer Relief Act \n     of 1997.\n       Thank you again for your leadership and commitment to \n     reducing this burden. We look forward to continuing to work \n     closely with you to address this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Terry W. Hartle,\n                                           Senioir Vice President.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we should not delude ourselves about who \nwill end up paying the cost and price of these requirements. \nUltimately, the cost of compliance will be shifted from the schools to \nthe students and their families. As a result, the value of the Hope \nScholarship Program and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit will be \ndiminished.\n  Mr. President, the IRS has complained that eliminating these \nreporting requirements will be too expensive, essentially arguing that \ntoo many people who are not entitled to claim the exemption will do so. \nI find this logic curious because with the other exemptions and credits \nin the code, we require the taxpayers to report the necessary \ninformation on their tax returns and maintain records of their expenses \nto support any tax credit or deduction that they claim. It seems to me \nthat the education tax credits should receive the same treatment.\n  But let's assume that the IRS is correct, Mr. President, and that the \neducation tax credits should be treated differently--if that is the \ncase, why should the burden fall on our nation's colleges and \nuniversities?\n  The fact is that the IRS already collects much of the information \nneeded to verify the validity of the tax credits.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the committee and \nthe distinguished ranking minority member to join with Senator DeWine \nand me in a request to the Joint Committee on Taxation to study this \nissue and to look specifically at what the cost would be to the IRS to \ndevelop a system to ensure compliance based on information that already \nrequires taxpayers to file. For example, taxpayers are already required \nto file the name and the Social Security for their dependents. Many \nexperts maintain that the IRS already has much of the information that \nit needs. It simply needs to modify its software to allow it to conduct \nmatches to verify the information.\n  Mr. President, it certainly is worth determining whether the cost to \nthe IRS would be less than or more than the $115 million that it will \ncost our universities and colleges each year to comply with the \npaperwork associated with these credits.\n  Mr. President, the rationale for the Hope and Lifetime Learning \ncredits was to make postsecondary education more affordable, and thus \nmore accessible to lower- and middle-income families. Unfortunately, \nwhat Congress has given with one hand it has taken away at least in \npart with its regulatory hand. It is within our power to fix this \nproblem. We should do so soon.\n  Tonight, pending the resolution of the larger issue, we can take one \nsmall step to alleviate some of the burden imposed upon our colleges \nand universities. The amendment that Senator DeWine and I are offering \nwill change the requirement for reporting the tuition and grant aid \npertaining to each student in a manner that will make it somewhat \neasier for our postsecondary institutions to comply. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has scored the cost impact of the change as being \nnegligible, but the revision will help our colleges and universities.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. I hope to have the cooperation of \nthe chairman and ranking minority member in addressing the larger \nissue.\n  Now I would like to yield to my colleague from Ohio and my cosponsor, \nSenator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to speak on behalf \nof an amendment that Senator Collins and I have introduced to H.R. \n2676, the IRS Reform bill.\n  Our amendment is common-sense legislation that will repeal certain \nreporting requirements placed upon colleges and universities under \nSection 6050 S of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Here is the problem: Current law relating to the Hope Scholarship and \nthe Lifetime Learning tax credit requires all colleges and universities \nto comply with burdensome and costly regulations. The Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997 contained a provision requiring colleges, universities and \ntrade schools to begin issuing annual reports to students and the \nInternal Revenue Service detailing the students' tuition payments in \ncase they apply for the new education tax credits. Preliminary analysis \nshows the reporting requirements will cost the 6,000 colleges in \nAmerica more than $125 million to implement, and tens of millions of \ndollars annually to maintain.\n  In realistic terms, if the new reporting requirement is not lifted \noff the backs of colleges and universities, those schools will be \nforced to raise tuition costs to cover the unfunded mandate. In effect, \nstudents and families will not benefit from the passage of the Hope \nScholarship--because the money received from the tax credit will have \nto be used to pay the higher tuition.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is simple, fair legislation that will \ngreatly benefit any persons who want to obtain an education.\n  In fact, similar legislation has already been introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Congressman Donald Manzullo (R-IL). The House \nbill is\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nsupported by a bipartisan coalition comprised of 89 Members of the \nHouse.\n  Senator Collins and I originally wanted to introduce the entire text \nof our legislation, S. 1724, as an amendment to the IRS Reform bill. \nUnder current regulations, schools are required to report information \nto the IRS on 100 percent of their students, even though only a \nminority of students are expected to be eligible for the tax credit. S. \n1724 would repeal this requirement. S. 1724 has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, the National Association of State \nUniversities and Land Grant Colleges, the American Council on \nEducation, and a bi-partisan group of 19 Senators.\n\n  However, because of concerns which have been raised, we have modified \nour amendment. While this amendment does eliminate a regulatory burden \nplaced on universities, it is only one part of what we want to \naccomplish. I want to assure everyone that is concerned about the \nincreasing costs of higher education, that we will continue to fight to \neliminate unnecessary costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support our amendment. It is \ncommon-sense, effective legislation. I also want to thank Senator Roth \nfor his leadership on this issue and I appreciate his work with us on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from Cuyahoga \nCommunity College, Columbus State, North Central Technical College, \nShawnee State University, Cleveland State University, Bowling Green \nState University, Belmont Technical College, and the Ohio Association \nof Community Colleges in support of our legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Shawnee State University,\n\n                                 Portsmouth, OH, January 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re Higher Education Reporting Relief Act of 1998.\n\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I am writing to you to solicit your \n     support of the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act of 1998 \n     which Representative Donald A. Manzullo intends to introduce \n     in Congress. This Act will repeal Section 6050S of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, which was added last year as part of \n     the Hope Scholarships and Lifetime Learning tax credits.\n       While I was very supportive of the Hope Scholarship and \n     Lifetime Learning tax credit, the burden placed on \n     universities to report the data required in Section 6050S IRC \n     to taxpayers and families increases the cost of higher \n     education, dilutes the benefit, and is unnecessary for the \n     implementation of these tax benefits.   \n       Most other tax credits and deductions do not place such a \n     data collection and reporting requirement on the provider of \n     service. This should be made a ``self-reporting'' requirement \n     subject to substantiation by records of college attendance \n     maintained by the taxpayer. For a smaller university like \n     Shawnee State, this new reporting requirement has a bigger \n     impact on our operations than some of the larger land grant \n     institutions.\n       I urge your support of Representative Manzullo's \n     legislation to relieve higher education from this burdensome \n     reporting requirement.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Clive C. Veri,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Bowling Green State University,\n\n                            Bowling Green, Ohio, February 5, 1998.\n     Hon. R. Michael DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I am writing to encourage your support \n     of the ``Higher Education Reporting Relief Act'' being \n     introduced by Representative Donald A. Manzullo (R-IL). The \n     purpose of this legislation is to repeal the portion of the \n     ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997'' requiring colleges and \n     universities to submit information to the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS). If passed, the amendment will make individuals \n     claiming education tax credits responsible for providing \n     requisite information.\n       As you may recall, the Lifetime Learning and Hope \n     Scholarship tax credits represented an important part of the \n     ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.'' However, as a result of this \n     legislation, there are new reporting requirements for Bowling \n     Green State University (BGSU) and all institutions of higher \n     education in Ohio and across the country.\n       These requirements place schools in an unfamiliar \n     intermediary position between students, tax filers and the \n     IRS and require the collection of information that schools \n     would not otherwise gather. In addition, the new reporting \n     requirements will cause BGSU to expend thousands of dollars \n     in both start up and on-going costs to comply. This \n     expenditure will place a significant burden on an already \n     limited institutional budget and detract from BGSU's primary \n     purpose--the education of citizens who seek to better \n     themselves and our country.\n       Passage of the Manzullo amendment would move the tax credit \n     reporting requirements from colleges and universities to \n     those individuals claiming the tax benefits. This system of \n     ``self-reporting'' requisite information is an approach which \n     is successful for many other tax benefits. The change will \n     facilitate enforcement by the IRS, eliminate the need for an \n     unnecessary new and costly linkage between institutions and \n     the IRS, and better serve families and students.\n       Once again, I urge your support of the ``Higher Education \n     Reporting Relief Act'' which will alleviate a potentially \n     significant financial and human resource burden on colleges \n     and universities. Thank you for your interest and attention \n     to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sidney A.

Thank you for your support of this very important \n     issue. The failure to repeal this requirement will cause many \n     colleges and universities, including Belmont Technical \n     College, to cut important services in order to fund this \n     additional mandate.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to keep higher education \n     affordable for the residents of Appalachian Ohio. If I can \n     provide information to assist with this cause, please contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John F. Clymer,\n     Interim President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Cleveland State University,\n\n                                  Cleveland, OH, February 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Last July as part of the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act of 1997, Congress passed a tax credit known as the \n     Hope Scholarship, for students in their first and second \n     years of higher education. As it currently stands, \n     Universities will be required under this law to provide new \n     and additional information on students to the U.S. Treasury \n     Department, placing us in the awkward position of middleman \n     between our students and the IRS.\n       In addition to the bad will such a requirement would create \n     between the University and our students, the law is a \n     expensive unfunded mandate on higher education. As you know, \n     unfunded mandates drive up tuition and take our attention \n     from our primary goal of educating our students.\n       We ask that you support the Higher Education Reporting \n     Relief Act of 1998, sponsored by Representative Manzullo of \n     Illinois, which would repeal section 6050S of the Internal \n     Revenue Code. Section 6050S is the section that would place \n     us in the position of data provider to the IRS. The Higher \n     Education Reporting Relief Act of 1998 will make tax returns, \n     the normal case for other tax benefits.\n       We will greatly appreciate your support of this effort and \n     hope you will keep us informed of the progress of the \n     legislation in Congress. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas A. Lynch,\n\n                                Special Assistant to the President\n     for Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Ohio Association of\n\n\n                                           Community Colleges,\n\n                                     Columbus, OH, March 11, 1998.\n     Hon. R. Michael DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Thank you very much for introducing a \n     bill to repeal the institutional reporting requirements for \n     the Hope Scholarship and Lifelong Learning Tax Credits. As \n     you know, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act (HERRA) \n     would repeal the requirements, included in the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act Congress passed last year, that higher education \n     institutions collect and report information on all eligible \n     students to the Internal Revenue Service. The bill would \n     allow taxpayers to claim the education tax credit on their \n     income tax forms, similar to the way other tax deductions are \n     now reported. If the IRS questions a taxpayer's return, then \n     the IRS could audit the taxpayer, as it does now, and require \n     the taxpayer to produce the relevant documentation (receipts \n     or canceled tuition payment checks).\n       Putting the onus on the taxpayer, rather than the \n     institution, to report on the tax credit would save colleges \n     millions of dollars, simplify the process for students \n     seeking to claim the credit, and enable colleges to expend \n     more funds on programs rather than administrative costs.\n       Your support of the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act \n     is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Terry M. Thomas,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Cuyahoga Community College,\n\n                                     Cleveland, OH, March 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Michael DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Thank you for the opportunity for two \n     of the College's trustees,\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\n     Trustee Chairperson Nadine Feighan and Trustee Stanley \n     Miller, along with the College's Executive Vice President, \n     Dr. Frank Reis, to meet with Mr. John Connelly of your \n     legislative staff on February 24, 1998 to provide you with \n     some insight into community college priorities within the \n     second session of the 105th Congress. As you know, community \n     colleges provide access to a broad spectrum of quality \n     educational opportunities and life experiences. Consistent \n     with this role, any proposed legislative language that \n     promotes the concept of open access, which is the cornerstone \n     of the community college mission, would be well received by \n     Cuyahoga Community College and, for that matter, all \n     community colleges throughout the nation.\n       Specifically, the priorities that were highlighted during \n     our recent discussion included the following:\n       Pell Grants--The Pell Grant is the foundation of federal \n     student financial aid programs, and is instrumental in \n     providing access to colleges for needy students. At Cuyahoga \n     Community College, nearly one-half of all aid ($9.5 million) \n     provides access for more than 6,000 of our students. We \n     believe that Pell Grants currently work well for community \n     college students.\n       Currently, the Administration is proposing to limit Pell \n     Grant eligibility to 150 percent of the length of a student's \n     program. We view this as a flexible access issue particularly \n     in light of many of our students being part-time requiring \n     developmental and remedial preparation before engaging in \n     degree level studies, and as such, we oppose the proposal to \n     limit eligibility during consideration of the reauthorization \n     of the Higher Education Act.\n       Cuyahoga Community College requests a Pell Grant maximum of \n     greater than $3,100, the amount requested by the \n     Administration. In response to the question raised by Mr. \n     Connelly regarding how much more the Pell Grant should be \n     raised we indicated that our preference would be to see a \n     $3,200 maximum grant level be implemented.\n       Vocational Education/Tech Prep--Community colleges are \n     requesting $120 million (a $17 million increase over FY98) \n     for the Tech Prep program, which provides for collaboration \n     between secondary and postsecondary institutions with low-\n     income students in their vocational education programs. \n     Currently, CCC is participating in the North Coast Tech Prep \n     Consortium along with area joint vocational schools. Our \n     Consortium success has earned it State performance-based \n     funding of $915,011 for FY99 when it will serve over 940 \n     students. That number is projected to double the number of \n     students served within the next few years. Not only do we \n     support the proposed increase but also would like to see the \n     Tech Prep monies kept separate from other grant monies.\n       Tax Issues Regarding HOPE and Lifelong Learning Tax \n     Credits--In general, community colleges are pleased with the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act that contains a number of tax provisions \n     that greatly expand student access to the nation's community \n     colleges. Although Cuyahoga Community College, along with \n     most of the nation's community colleges, support the HOPE and \n     Lifelong Learning tax credits, there are concerns regarding \n     the reporting requirements necessitated by the statute. \n     Therefore we support H.R. 3127 that was introduced by \n     Representative Dan Manzullo (R-IL) to repeal the reporting \n     requirements associated with the credits while maintaining \n     the financial support those tax credits would provide to \n     students.\n       Senate Provision to extend eligibility for Perkins funds to \n     proprietary schools--Currently, Perkins funds are restricted \n     to non-profit educational institutions. H.R. 1983 maintains \n     this restriction. However, S. 1186 would extend eligibility \n     for Perkins funds to proprietary institutions. Nowhere in \n     federal workforce education or higher education policy do \n     for-profit institutions directly receive federal funds. In \n     addition, expanding the universe of eligible institutions for \n     limited federal vocation education dollars will drain funding \n     for long-standing community college vocational education \n     programs. Currently, Cuyahoga Community College uses its \n     $180,000 in Perkins funds to serve approximately 175 disabled \n     vocational students. Therefore the College, as well as the \n     community colleges across the country, oppose the provision \n     to extend eligibility for Perkins funds to for-profit \n     proprietary institutions.\n       The four summary positions in this letter represent the \n     priority areas to Cuyahoga Community College. If you should \n     have any questions regarding any of these positions or for \n     that matter, the listing of College federal grants requested \n     provided to your office during our visit, please call either \n     myself or Dr. Frank Reis, Executive Vice-President, Human \n     Resources and Administration (216-987-4776). Again, thank you \n     for your advocacy efforts in the U.S. Senate on behalf of \n     Cuyahoga Community College as well as the 1,100 community \n     colleges across the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jerry Sue Thornton,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                             Columbus State Community College,\n\n                                      Columbus, OH, March 6, 1998.\n     Hon. R. Michael DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I want to thank you for taking time \n     from your busy schedule to meet with Pieter Wykoff and me to \n     discuss issues regarding the Reauthorization of the Higher \n     Education Act and the 1999 budget appropriations and tax \n     issue.\n       As we mentioned to you, the Pell grants are working well \n     for our students. However, the new reporting of the Hope \n     Scholarship tax credit is burdensome, and we do incur costs \n     to comply with all the reporting requirements. We urge you to \n     simplify this system as much as possible as it is being \n     proposed by Rep. Manzullo from Illinois.\n       Please let me know if there is any information we can \n     provide you or anything else that Columbus State can do to \n     facilitate your work. We enjoyed our visit with you and look \n     forward to seeing you again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             M. Valeriana Moeller,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              North Central Technical College,\n\n                                  Mansfield, OH, January 30, 1998.\n     Senator Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: As you are aware, with the enactment \n     of the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits, \n     institutions of higher education will be required to provide \n     extensive and detailed data to the Internal Revenue Service \n     on all currently enrolled students. While North Central \n     Technical College is a supporter of these educational tax \n     credits, the proposed reporting requirements will place an \n     overwhelming burden on its resources in order to maintain \n     compliance with the regulations.\n       Currently, NCTC, like all colleges and universities, is \n     faced with a myriad of mandated federal and state reporting \n     requirements. The addition of the Hope Scholarship and \n     Lifetime Learning tax credit program will only further \n     stretch already over-extended student and financial \n     information reporting systems. It would be terribly \n     unfortunate if colleges and universities were forced to \n     redirect resources, now aimed at providing direct services to \n     students, in order to comply with these new regulations.\n       Given the seriousness of this situation, I am asking that \n     you support the legislation ``Higher Education Reporting \n     Relief Act'' to be introduced next week by Representative \n     Donald A. Manzullo. This legislation will repeal Section \n     6050S of the Internal Revenue Code, thus alleviating \n     institutions from the responsibility of being a data provider \n     for individual students to the IRS.\n       Please be assured that, whatever the outcome of this \n     legislation, North Central Technical College will continue to \n     meet all the reporting requirements that are mandated, while \n     providing the best possible educational experiences that its \n     resources allow. However, since education is our purpose and \n     mission, I hope that the College will be able to direct its \n     resources to those that deserve them the most, our students.\n       Your consideration and support in this matter will be \n     greatly appreciated by the entire College community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Dr. Ronald E. Abrams,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me briefly state that the amendment \noffered by myself and Senator Collins fixes parts of the problem. It \ndoes not fix all of the problem. If we do not deal with the entire \nproblem, this is something that every Member of the Senate is going to \nhear about. It is going to come back and you are going to hear about it \nfrom every college and university in your State.

Mr. President, I have a reasonable amendment to this \nbill relating to a very unique ``tool of the trade'' in the fishing \nindustry of Alaska. the bill already would increase the cap for the \nvalue of tools of the trade exempted from IRS levy to $5,000, up from \n$1,250.\n  My amendment addresses a class of tools--State-issued permits that \ngive their holder the privilege to commercially harvest fish or game in \nour State.\n  The State of Alaska has never conceded that these permits are \nproperty that may be seized by IRS. Yet, the IRS seizes them, without \ngiving any consideration to the unique circumstances in Alaska, \nparticularly western Alaska.\n  In those villages, commercial fishing is the only industry. If you \ndon't have a fishing job, you do not have a job.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  When a fisherman in that area fails to pay taxes on time, the IRS \nnever gives any consideration to the fact that without the fishing \npermit, the taxpayer would have no way to pay back taxes.\n  In addition, he or she will then have no way to support their \nchildren, their family, pay child support, or buy heating oil for their \nhouse, or face other problems.\n  We do have a problem in western Alaska--the IRS estimates that \ncommercial fishermen owe over $20 million in back taxes. That is not \nmuch, nationally. But as one IRS agent visiting rural Alaska pointed \nout, they have in some cases been trying to collect taxes from people \nwho did not even know the IRS existed.\n  There are positive changes, in the bill with respect to IRS \ncollection procedures, but the language and cultural barriers, and \nisolation of vast areas of Alaska still lead to results that people in \nthe rest of the country find hard to believe.\n  Instead of exempting State permits entirely from IRS levies, I have \naccepted a compromise. Under section 3445 of the bill, the IRS will be \nrequired, before seizing the assets of a small business, to first \ndetermine that the business owner's ``other assets'' are not sufficient \nto pay the back taxes and expenses of IRS proceedings.\n  My compromise would require the IRS to consider future income from \nState-issued fish and game permits as ``other income'' in its \ndetermination before making a levy on such permits. This means the IRS \nmust consider whether the future income from the permit would allow the \nfishermen to pay the tax debt and procedural expenses before the \nmaximum time possible for repayment under law has occurred.\n  In treating these permits as an asset used in a trade or business, \nCongress does not intend to determine whether such permits are property \nor a right to property. We only mean to say that as long as the IRS \nasserts that the permits are property or a right to property, the \nholder should have the added protection of having future income \nconsidered.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 2385\n\n   (Purpose: Relating to the report ont ax complexity and low-income \n                            taxpayer clincs)\n\n       On page 375, line 11, strike the period and insert ``, \n     including volunteer income tax assistance programs, and to \n     provide funds for training and technical assistance to \n     support such clinics and programs.''\n       On page 375, line 22, strike ``or''.\n       On page 376, line 2, strike the period and insert\n     ``, or''.\n       On page 376, between lines 2 and 3, insert:\n\n       ``(III) provides tax preparation assistance and tax \n     counseling assistance to low income taxpayers, such as \n     volunteer income tax assistance programs.''\n\n       On page 376, line 20, strike ``and''.\n       On page 376, line 25, strike the period and insert ``and''.\n       On page 376, after line 25, insert:\n       ``(C) a volunteer income tax assistance program which is \n     described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section \n     501(a) and which provides tax preparation assistance and tax \n     counseling assistance to low income taxpayers.''\n       On page 377, line 9, strike ``$3,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$6,000,000''.\n       On page 377, line 11, after the end period, insert ``Not \n     more than 7.5 percent of the amount available shall be \n     allocated to training and technical assistance programs.''\n       On page 377, line 15, insert ``, except that larger grants \n     may be made for training and technical assistance programs'' \n     after ``$100,000''.\n       On page 378, line 16, insert ``(other than a clinic \n     described in paragraph (2)(C))'' after ``clinic''.\n       On page 396, strike lines 18 through 20, and insert \n     ``Finance of the Senate.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we bring these deliberations on IRS \nrestructuring to a close, I want to express my appreciation to everyone \nwho has strongly supported this necessary legislation. I am \nparticularly proud of the fact that it was unanimously supported on the \nfloor of the Senate this evening. I again want to reiterate my belief \nthat the Internal Revenue Service--with its 102,000 employees--is \nfilled with hard-working, service-oriented, honorable men and women.\n\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that the agency, itself, has too much \npower and not enough sunshine.\n  It is marked by an environment where even a few overly aggressive, \nvindictive, arrogant, or power-hungry individuals can get away with \ntrampling the rights of honest Americans. It is an environment where \nhonesty can be met by retaliation, where employees are frightened to \ncome forward to report and correct abuses, and where the taxpayer is \noften perceived as the enemy and not the customer.\n  The legislation we have passed today will go a long way towards \ncorrecting these problems. Will it do everything we would like it to \ndo? No. There needs to be a cultural shift inside the agency itself.\n  This legislation will provide a catalyst for that shift. Is this bill \na good start toward long-term reform? Absolutely.\n  This legislation will allow Commissioner Rossotti to implement the \nnecessary reforms and restructuring that need to be done to bring the \nagency into the 21st century. It is a strong bill, building on what the \nHouse passed last November. It is what the American people need to \nstrengthen fundamental protections. However, Congress must not see this \nas the be-all-and-end-all of offering taxpayers the protection and \nservice they need when it comes to the IRS.\n  We need to continue our oversight efforts. We need to make sure that \nthe provisions we have included in our legislation are taken seriously \nby the agency and embraced in the manner in which they are intended.\n  Mr. President, this thorough and comprehensive piece of legislation \nis the product of a collective effort. It represents the best work and \nthinking from both sides of the aisle.\n  I express my sincere appreciation to my colleagues, particularly \nSenator Moynihan, as well as Senators Charles Grassley and Bob Kerrey, \nboth of whom worked on the National Restructuring Commission with \nCongressman Rob Portman. I'm grateful to Chairman Archer and those on \nthe Ways and Means Committee who provided a solid foundation upon which \nwe built this legislation, and to my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee who diligently sat through our extensive oversight and \nrestructuring hearings and voted this legislation out of committee \nunanimously.\n  I am also grateful to those who have spoken so eloquently as \nproponents of this legislation here on the floor.\n  I also appreciate the hard work our staffs have put in. I'm grateful \nto our investigators--Eric Thorson, Debbie McMahon, Kathryn Quinn, \nAnita Horn, and Maureen Barry. I'm grateful to Frank Polk, Joan \nWoodward, and Mark Patterson, to Tom Roesser, Mark Prater, Sam Olchyk, \nBrig Pari, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Nick Giordano, and Ann Urban. I \nalso want to thank Jane Butterfield, Mark Blair, and Darcell Savage.\n  I believe the future will remember the work we have done here. The \nhistory of the Internal Revenue Service is marked by aggressive tax \ncollecting tactics and consequent Congressional efforts to reform the \nagency. Those reforms, however, often did not go far enough, and they \nwere not accompanied by a dedication to sincere oversight. These \nreforms, Mr. President, do go far.\n  They are the most extensive reforms ever made to balance power and \nresponsibility inside what can only be characterized as one of \nAmerica's most powerful agencies. And, as we have heard over the past \nfew days here on the floor, this Congress is dedicated to continued \noversight.\n  In closing, I am pleased to work with Senator Kerrey, the floor \nmanager for the Democrats. I think it has been a great collective \neffort.\n  Mr. KERREY. ``The barriers are crumbling; the system is working.''\n  Mr. President, those are the words of David Broder. He wrote them in \na Washington Post op-ed on October 21, 1997 as he commented on the \nprogress being made on IRS reform.\n  Mr. Broder was commenting at the time that in an increasingly \npartisan climate on Capitol Hill, the work of Representatives Portman, \nCardin, Senator Grassley, and I and how this legislation is moving \nalong was a classic example of how our democratic system can work and \nthat by ``beating the odds'' we were on the verge of giving the \nInternal Revenue Service ``the shake-up it clearly needs.''\n  Mr. President, good news comes to the American taxpayers today. The \nSenate is about to pass historic IRS reform legislation that will touch \nthe lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.\n  This is a long, detailed bill, Mr. President, but I can summarize its \nintent in a simple well known phrase: of, by and for the people. That \nis the kind of government we have--of, by and for the people. The \npremise of our effort from the beginning was that the IRS works for the \ntaxpayer, not the other way around. The impact, I hope, will be equally \nsimple. When you call the IRS, you should get a helpful voice, not a \nbusy signal. That helpful voice should have the resources to help you \nanswer the simple question: ``How much do I owe?'' If one of the rare \nbad apples in the IRS abuses a taxpayer, the Commissioner should be \nable to fire him. The vast majority of IRS employees who are capable \nand committed public\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\nservants should be empowered to do their jobs--helping the equally vast \nmajority of American taxpayers who want to comply with the law to do \nso.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral effort dates back to 1995, when Senator \nShelby and I, in our roles on the Appropriations Committee, wrote \nlanguage into the law creating the National Commission on Restructuring \nthe IRS.\n  It continued with Representative Rob Portman and Senator Grassley and \nI with our work on the commission after we issued our report in June \n1997, and moved forward again when we introduced legislation in the \nHouse, with Representative Ben Cardin, and in the Senate by July 1997.\n  It progressed to Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan when the Finance \nCommittee began our hearings in September 1997, as well as with House \nWays and Means Chairman Archer in the House. And along the way we \nreceived the critical support of Speaker Gingrich, Secretary Rubin, the \nPresident and Commissioner Rossotti.\n  I am proud to have been a part of this effort. We are a nation of \nlaws, Mr. President. As legislators we are given the charge by the \nAmerican people to write effective laws, as well as change those \nthat are not. While this debate has sometimes been contentious, in the \nend the finished product--the law that we will have written--will be an \neffective one because in the end Congress's efforts have been about \ndoing what is right and what is best.\n\n  In the beginning, many members of Congress and our commission were \nshocked to hear that before these efforts, there had been no real \nreform to the IRS in 50 years and no oversight hearings by the Senate \nFinance Committee ever.\n  That was Congress's fault.\n  During our deliberations in the Senate this week, we have been \nmindful of the fact that Congress has had a critical role in allowing \nthe IRS to become the mess we now have decided to clean up.\n  We have acknowledged that the IRS is not Sears & Roebuck--and that we \nare its Board of Directors. We write the tax laws, we are responsible \nfor the oversight and we are the ones who can make the necessary \nchanges.\n  I am not an IRS apologist. I would not have embarked on this mission \nnearly four years ago if I thought all was well with the agency. And \nwhile I always knew the IRS was acting in a damaging fashion toward \nAmerican taxpayers and in need of reform, my learning over the years \nsolidified the notion that the need for reform was dire.\n  As we move toward enacting this legislation into law, we should be \nproud of the fact that we are changing the culture at the IRS so that \nthe agency will serve taxpayers and not treat them as if it is the \nother way around, that we are giving Commissioner Rossotti the \nstatutory authority he needs to do his job effectively, that we are \ncreating legislation that will make it easier for all Americans to file \ntheir taxes and get information, that we are going to make sure the IRS \nhas the ability to do the job Congress has told them to, and that we \nare changing the way tax laws are written so that never again will a \nprovision pass without a cost analysis of compliance and \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, more Americans pay taxes than vote. The perception of \nhow our government treats us--its citizens--is rooted more in our \ncontact with the IRS than with any other U.S. agency or entity.\n  How we are treated by the IRS--and our tax laws--effects our \nperception of whether or not we believe we have a fair shot at the \nAmerican Dream and whether or not we are a government of, by and for \nthe people.\n  We have taken great strides today to change that perception.\n  I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this important and \nhistoric piece of legislation and I am very hopeful we will have a \nswift and effective conference with the House so that the President can \nsign this bill into law before June 1.\n  Mr. President, I add my thanks to the Democratic staff and the \nRepublican staff, all of whom were listed by the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. It has been a pleasure working \nwith Senator Roth. I want to also thank Congressman Rob Portman. I \nespecially thank the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, Senator \nMoynihan, for giving me the opportunity to manage this bill.\n\n\nstaff of the national commission on restructuring the internal revenue \n                                service\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the staff of \nthe National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service \nfor their devotion to the cause of reforming the IRS. We would not have \nthe strong reform legislation before us today without the hard work and \npatience of these individuals. They staffed 12 public hearings, 3 town-\nhall meetings, hundreds of hours of closed-door sessions with \nRestructuring commissioners, and interviewed many hundreds of present \nand former IRS officials, practitioner groups, and average taxpayers. \nThey drafted and redrafted many times the Commission report, ``A Vision \nfor a New IRS.''\n  But, most importantly, they worked with the many staff members and \nMembers of Congress to help facilitate the bipartisan bill that we are \nabout to vote on today. The U.S. Senate owes them a debt of gratitude \nfor their year long effort. They are: Jeffery Trinca, Chief of Staff; \nAnita Horn, Deputy Chief of Staff; Douglas Shulman, Senior Policy \nAdvisor and Chief of Staff from June to September of 1997; Charles \nLacijan, Senior Policy Advisor; Dean Zerbe, Senior Policy Advisor; \nArmando Gomez, Chief Counsel; George Guttman, Counsel; Lisa McHenry, \nDirector of Communications and Research; James Dennis, Counsel; John \nJungers, Research Assistant; Andrew Siracuse, Research Assistant; \nDamien McAndrews, Research Assistant; Margie Knowles, Office Manager; \nand Janise Haman, Secretary.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader I ask \nunanimous consent that there now be a period for the transaction of \nroutine morning business until 7:30 p.m., with Senators permitted to \nspeak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to start that morning \nbusiness, but I will first yield to Senator Warner, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 2051 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has the floor and didn't relinquish it. But I \nunderstood in the earlier request the Senator from Pennsylvania made \nthat people would be permitted to speak for 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness. The yielding of time to other Senators, I would assume, has \nto come off of that 10 minutes, if we are to follow the unanimous \nconsent agreement as laid out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). I believe the Senator from \nPennsylvania, by unanimous consent, requested that the other Senators \nbe recognized and there having been no objection at the time, it is not \nto be counted against his time.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                              the flat tax\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might comment to my colleague from \nNew Jersey, I don't intend to be very long. Perhaps it will all be \nincorporated.\n  If I may have the attention of our distinguished majority leader for \na moment, I compliment the managers of the bill that just passed, and \nthe few brief remarks I would like to make on the tax issue relate to a \nbill that I have introduced on the flat tax.\n  At the request of the distinguished majority leader, I did not press \nit a few weeks ago on the Coverdell bill, nor did I press it on the \nlegislation that has just been enacted. But I have a very strong view, \nhaving pressed for this legislation since March of 1995, the so-called \npostage card flat tax, devised by two very distinguished professors \nfrom Stanford, Hall and Rabushka, that\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\nreally this is the way we ought to go on legislation on taxation.\n  When I discussed this matter with our majority leader, he said to me \nthat there would be legislation coming down the pike soon where there \nwould be an opportunity for the flat tax to be considered. We \ninformally agreed that we would have a brief colloquy on that. I yield \nto Senator Lott, again without losing my right to the floor, for the \nbalance of 10 minutes.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania that we have discussed this on two or three occasions, and \nhe is absolutely correct; he has been cooperative and has not insisted \non offering this important amendment on a couple of bills where he \ncould have done that, because at the time it would have caused problems \nwith those bills and made it more difficult for us to finish them in a \ntimely way. This is the Senate and I think the Senator is entitled to \nbe able to offer his amendment soon. Frankly, it is an amendment that I \nfind very attractive, personally. So I would like to be able to be on \nrecord having voted for it. So I will work with the Senator to find a \nvehicle and a time that he is comfortable with later on this month, or \nin June, where this amendment can be offered and we can have a \nreasonable discussion and a vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the majority leader for those comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4521-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4522-S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR SANTORUM'S 40TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. This Sunday, May 10, 1998, the U.S. Senate will lose its \nlast 30-something Member--that is someone who is in the thirties--\nbecause our colleague, Senator Rick Santorum will turn 40.\n  Already, in a few short years, Senator Santorum has distinguished \nhimself by building a solid record of legislative achievement in both \nthe House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate.\n  As Senator Santorum passes this personal milestone, I would like to \nmake a comment or two about him. He was born on May 10, 1958, in \nWinchester, VA, the son of an Italian immigrant. In 1965, the family \nmoved to Butler, PA.\n  He had a distinguished career at Penn State, worked for Senator John \nHeinz, then moved on to the University of Pittsburgh where he earned \nhis M.B.A., and then to the Dickinson School of Law where he earned a \nJ.D.\n  He served six years as a top aide in the Pennsylvania State Senate, \nand then worked four years as an associate at the Pittsburgh law firm \nof Kirkpatrick and Lockhart.\n  In 1990, Senator Santorum took on a campaign for the Congress and \ndefeated a seventh-term incumbent at the age of 32. Then in the House \nhis legislation was very noteworthy on fiscal responsibility, health \ncare, creative medical savings accounts, which was incorporated as a \npilot project in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct of 1996. He has distinguished himself in the U.S. Senate with \nimportant legislation on welfare reform, managing debate on legislation \nbased largely on a bill which he had introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I have worked very closely with Senator Santorum on a personal basis. \nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that when Senator Santorum won \nelection in November of 1994 he ``cautiously\" invited me to accompany \nhim on a victory swing the next day in Scranton and Philadelphia.\n  The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported accurately, ``If you want me to \ngo, Rick, I'll be there.'' And then the Post-Gazette noted, ``It was \njust another display of what has become one of the more unusual U.S. \nSenate alliances and odd pairing of politicians from opposite poles in \nthe Republican Party . . .''\n  Senator Santorum and I have more in common than one might imagine.\n  We are both children of immigrants. We both appreciated the value of \neducation, and have been able to participate in the American dream \nbecause of our education. We agree on many, many items. We both support \nwelfare reform, the balanced budget, the line-item veto, and the death \npenalty. On the issue of pro-choice and pro-life, Senator Santorum and \nI try to find ways to bring people together.\n  It is a pleasure for me to salute Senator Santorum on one of the last \nremaining days of his 39 years. He will not be able to say, like Jack \nBenny, very much longer that he is 39.\n  One of the items, in closing, that I would like to note is that the \nsky is the limit for Senator Santorum, and if he decides to stay in the \nU.S. Senate, he could be elected in the year 2000, the year 2006, the \nyear 2012, the year 2018, the year 2024, the year 2030, the year 2036, \nthe year 2042, and the year 2048 and at that point would be just as old \nas our distinguished President pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond, is \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                microsoft and the department of justice\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am compelled to address the Senate this \nevening because one of our country's most dynamic, innovative, and \nsuccessful companies, Microsoft, has been the subject of an unfair and \nprejudicial target by anonymous sources in the Department of Justice.\n  I am concerned that every time I pick up a newspaper I am informed of \nnew information about the ongoing, supposedly confidential proceedings \ninvolving Microsoft and the Department of Justice. I ask only for \nfairness and that whatever verdict is derived, is argued through proper \njudicial channels and not played out through our nation's media.\n  Some of you in this Chamber may say that Microsoft can speak for \nitself, that is has a voice loud enough to be heard. To that, I answer \nthat no single voice is ever enough to speak over the Department of \nJustice and those anonymous few employees who are seemingly abusing its \nformidable power. When the integrity of such a profound legal \nproceeding is in jeopardy, however, no one should remain silent.\n  In the Antitrust Division's extended, intense scrutiny of Microsoft, \nthe company has faithfully worked to comply with each of the Division's \nrequest. Microsoft has fully cooperated with the seemingly endless \nrequests for documents and depositions of top executives. Microsoft has \noperated under the assumption that if it works with the Justice \nDepartment in a fair manner and complies with its requests, then the \nJustice Department will proceed with its investigation fairly. But, I \nquestion whether the Justice Department is indeed playing fair.\n  Over the past several months, the Antitrust Division appears to have \nrepeatedly and continually disclosed to the media information uncovered \nduring its investigation, and floated anonymous opinions regarding the \nlikelihood of a new government antitrust case against the company.\n  To me, putting America's technological leader on trial in the press--\nbefore the prosecutor even decides if a trial in our court system \nshould proceed--is wholly unfair.\n  The Justice Department's own ethics manual says that, I quote: ``It \nis the policy of the DOJ and the Antitrust Division that public out-of-\ncourt statements regarding investigations, indictment, ongoing \nlitigation, and other activities should be minimal, consistent with the \nDepartment's responsibility to keep the public informed. Because \ncharges that result in an indictment or a civil action should be argued \nand proved in court, and not in a newspaper or broadcast, public \ncomment on such charges should be limited out of fairness to the rights \nof individuals and corporations and to minimize the possibility of \nprejudicial pre-trial publicity.''\n  Based on their comments to the media, however, attorneys at the \nJustice Department apparently disagree with their own ethics manual. \nFor example in a February 9, 1998 New York Times article entitled \n``Microsoft Case May Be Prelude to Wider Antitrust Battle'' a ``senior \nJustice Department official'' who ``spoke on condition that he not be \nidentified'' said, ``licensing arrangements and the pricing of deals \nthat Microsoft strikes . . . for placement on the front screen of its \nWindows operating system or its Internet Explorer browser'' are an \n``area of antitrust concern'' for the Antitrust Division.\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n  The Wall Street Journal has apparently been given similar exclusive \ninsight into a possible case. On April 6, 1998, the Wall Street Journal \npublished an article entitled ``U.S. Closes in on Microsoft; Officials \nThink Evidence Supports a Broad Charge on Extending Monopoly.'' In it, \nthe author quotes ``people close to the probe'' who stated that \n``investigators believe they have enough evidence to bring a new \nantitrust case against Microsoft.'' Those sources are so familiar with \nthe investigation that they told the reporter that an antitrust \ncomplaint would ``repeat an existing charge that Microsoft violated a \n1995 antitrust settlement . . . extending to Windows 98 last fall's \ncharge that Microsoft uses Windows as a weapon against business \nrivals.''\n  I regret to say this, and sincerely hope I turn out to be wrong, but \nI expect that the Justice Department will deny that one of its own \nlawyers is the source ``close to the probe.'' I say ``expect'' because \nAttorney General Reno does not appear to be looking into this matter, \nnor has she informed me that the matter has been resolved. In fact, the \nPracticing Law Institute has advertised that a senior Justice \nDepartment counsel would speak about ``[the Antitrust Division position \n. . . on the ongoing Microsoft matter'' at an upcoming Intellectual \nProperty Antitrust conference currently scheduled for July 22-23, 1998.\n  Mr. President, how does this public speaking engagement by a DOJ \nattorney square with the Department of Justice's own ethics manual, \nwhich states, and I quote again, ``public out-of-court statements \nregarding investigations, indictments, ongoing litigation, and other \nactivities should be minimal?'' How does it square with the ethics \npolicy that says, ``public comment on . . . charges should be limited \nout of fairness to the rights of individuals and corporations and to \nminimize the possibility of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.'' I \nsincerely hope that DOJ staff has been advised against this by Attorney \nGeneral Reno, but I cannot be sure.\n  Just yesterday, I learned that on May 8th, Business Week plans to \npublish on its website an article with the quote, ``sources familiar \nwith the Justice Department case have laid out a detailed plan of \nattack against [Microsoft].'' Who would be able to lay out such a \ndetailed plan about the Department's expected action in the case other \nthan the DOJ itself?\n  It is of utmost importance that the Justice Department end this media \ntrial of Microsoft, and restore a thorough and fair process. Today, I \nhave again asked the Attorney General to explain her failure to resolve \nthis matter.\n  Microsoft's innovations benefit thousands of companies, employees, \nshareholders and millions of consumers. With so much innovation and \neconomic growth, and with so many jobs lying in the balance, the least \nthe Department of Justice can do if it proceeds with its investigation \nis to do so in a fair, professional and ethical manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4522-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRS REFORM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that is \ntriggered by something I read in the newspaper this morning. I saw it \nin the Washington Post and I saw it in the New York Times, a statement \nthat House Speaker Gingrich made when he held a press conference in \nwhich he criticized the Clinton administration's handling of the peace \nprocess.\n  Now, he, like any one of us in the Congress, has a right to disagree \nwith the administration on policy, but I think it is dangerous, \ndestructive, certainly demagogic, to say that ``America's strong-arm \ntactics would send a clear signal to the supporters of terrorism that \ntheir murderous actions are an effective tool in forcing concessions \nfrom Israel.''\n  That is an outrageous statement to make because it accuses President \nClinton. Further in his statement, and I quote him here:\n\n       Now it's become the Clinton administration and Arafat \n     against Israel, Gingrich said at a Capitol news conference. \n     He also released a letter he sent to President Clinton saying \n     that ``Israel must be able to decide her own security needs \n     and set her own conditions for negotiations without facing \n     coercion from the United States.'' As Israel celebrates its \n     50th anniversary, Speaker Gingrich said the Clinton \n     administration says, ``Happy birthday. Let us blackmail you \n     on behalf of Arafat.''\n\n  In his letter he gave the quote that I just read about America's \nstrong-arm tactics, sending ``a clear message that terrorism was an \nacceptable tool in forcing concessions from Israel.''\n  Mr. President, I know Israel very well. I had the good fortune over a \n3-year period to serve as chairman of the United Jewish Appeal. That is \nthe fundraising arm that helps local institutions within the Jewish \ncommunity, as well as Israel. This was over 20 years ago when Israel \nwas getting on its feet. I know lots of people there. I know many \npeople who have lost a son, lost a daughter. I know many people who \nvisit in the hospitals regularly where their children or their friends \nor their loved ones are in a condition that keeps them hospitalized \nbecause of wounds they received during the wars.\n\n  I was able to visit Israel within a couple of days after the 1973 war \nwas concluded while they were still searching for bodies on both sides, \nEgypt and Israel, in the Sinai desert, and I talked to people who \nregret so much that they are forced at times to inflict pain on their \nneighbors to protect themselves.\n  The Israelis have lost some 20,000 soldiers in wars since that \ncountry was founded--50 years. That is a short period of time. In the \nwhole of the 20th century, the United States will have lost less than \n400,000 soldiers in combat. I was in Europe during the war. I served in \nthe Army in World War II. Mr. President, 20,000 Israelis is the \nequivalent of 1 million soldiers, 1 million fighters lost in the United \nStates on a comparative basis--1 million. Could you imagine the \nheartbreak in this country that would exist if we lost a million \nsoldiers in a period of 50 years? It would tear us apart.\n  Mr. President, I make this point. I served here under President \nReagan, I served here under President Bush, and I knew President Carter \nvery well because I had tried to help them at times when I was running \na company in the computer business. They have been good friends to \nIsrael because Israel and the United States have many common \ninterests--the strength of a democracy, the ability to withstand \nadversity and come up providing freedom at all times for their \ncitizens. But there has never been a better friend in the White House \namong the four Presidents I just mentioned than President Clinton. \nPresident Clinton has approached Israel from the mind as well as the \nheart. He understands what the relationship of Israel to the civilized \nworld, to the democratic world, means. And he insists that they be \npermitted to negotiate on their own.\n  But as the President and the administration and the State Department \ntried to permit the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate their \nown terms, we were called back; we were called in to act as a go-\nbetween. I don't even want to use the term ``as a negotiator'' because \nit is up to the parties to negotiate. But we have been called on to try \nto facilitate the negotiations. And that has been the mission.\n  And so, Mr. President, I think it is outrageous that President \nClinton, that this administration be declared as someone alongside \nterrorists, encouraging Arafat, encouraging those who would destroy \nIsraelis. It is an outrage, it is demagoguery at its worst, and I don't \nthink that kind of debate ought to be used, whether it is to gain votes \nor whatever else one can gain from those kinds of statements. It \ndoesn't further the cause of peace, and it doesn't help our friendship \nwith any of the countries in the area. It is the wrong way to go.\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n  Mr. President, I believe--and I know that people in Israel believe--\nthey have to have peace because it is unlike some other parts of the \nworld where the absence of peace doesn't necessarily mean violence or \nwar. There are tense relations in many parts of the world with one \ncountry alongside the other where there is no killing between them. It \ndoesn't mean that there is affection. It doesn't mean that there is \nnecessarily diplomatic or economic pursuits between these places. But \nin that area, I think most people are convinced that if it is not \npeace, it is violence, it is war. That is a condition that every one of \nus wants to see avoided. And so I hope we can take some comfort in the \nfact that we, the United States, are trying to be helpful to all \nparties there. We have worked very hard to make sure that Israel has \nthe ability to call upon us when she needs a friend in world forums.\n  We are friendly and supportive of Egypt and Jordan and even attempt \nto try to get the Palestinian Authority to renounce parts of their \ncovenant that says they want to destroy Israel. Yes, we don't like \nthat. But to suggest, on the other hand, that President Clinton is \nsomeone who wants to send Israel a threatening message that comes from \nthe terrorist side of the equation is unfair and, again I say, \noutrageous.\n  So I hope the Israelis and the Palestinians will be able to pursue a \npeaceful discourse. No one--no one--knows what Israel needs by way of \nits security better than the people of Israel. They have to make that \ndecision. It is not going to be made in Washington, it is going to be \nmade in Jerusalem. It is going to be made between the parties, and we \nhave to let them do that, but recognize that they want us to play a \nrole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4523-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4524-S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Many out there might think that I am referring to \nthis final passage of the tax reform bill, and that is truly historic \nand very significant and allows the American people to be removed from \nthe fear of their own Government. And that is significant, but it is \nnot the most significant historical thing happening.\n  Earlier today, there was a speech in here that recognized something \nvery important that is happening. Last year, I was presiding when \nSenator Byrd gave his speech about mothers. Today, he spoke about \nmothers. On Sunday, we will be recognizing mothers. Mothers are \nprobably the most significant historical thing that happen each and \nevery day in this country. ``Mother'' has to be the world's most \nspecial word.\n  I want to add to his comments and those of Senator Thomas earlier \ntoday. Of course, the person we get to know the best--or at least, \nprobably more correctly worded, who knows us the best--is our mother. \nThat gives them a very special place in our lives. They always set \nexpectations for us. I will have to relate this in terms of my mother. \nI know it is done by mothers all over the country. I will tell you a \nlittle bit about my mother, and you can relate that to your mother and \nthe other mothers in this country who are making a difference and \nraising families.\n  My mom set expectations. It is one of those jobs of a mom. I remember \ncoming home from a PTA meeting when I was in kindergarten, and they had \ntalked about college, and from that point on she talked about ``when'' \nI went to college. They had talked about Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, MIT, so at that point she was sure I would be an engineer \nand go to MIT. But it is that expectation of college that sticks, and \nthe other expectations of mom's, for me.\n  She made deals for learning, for education. I remember once an \nencyclopedia salesman came to the house--the ``Book of Knowledge''--and \nI got to look at all those dream pages in there on all of those topics. \nI kind of pleaded with her to have an encyclopedia, and she asked me, \nif she got the encyclopedia, if I would give up comic books. This was \nin about second grade. Well, I wound up with the encyclopedia, and she \nworked hard to make sure we could pay for that encyclopedia. I still \nhave that outdated encyclopedia, and it still gives the same \nexcitement, the same feelings of mystery and adventure, that it did \nthen.\n  And mothers give time. Sometimes they give it in a formal way to \nservice organizations. My mom was a Cub Scout leader, she was my \nsister's Brownie and Girl Scout leader, and was very active in Sunday \nschool and church, and just did a lot of things that involved us. But \nall mothers give time, and a lot of times we don't think about the time \nthat they are giving when they are doing the things they are expected \nto do--organizing schedules, getting the meals together, doing the \nlaundry, sewing a button on, putting a Band-Aid on--all those little \nthings that we come to take for granted. That is time that mothers \ngive--extra time that mothers give.\n  They give encouragement. They dream those dreams for us, and then \nthey help us to fulfill them. It was my mom who encouraged me to be an \nEagle Scout. ``Encourage'' is a word for ``insist,'' I think. Without \nsome insistence, sometimes we don't get quite to the place that their \nvision includes. And they hear about other dreams and visions for each \none that we are able to accomplish, and they move us to another level \nof envisioning.\n  Of course, moms are the chief people for traditions, too. We have \noyster stew on Christmas Eve, play instruments around a Christmas tree, \nhave chicken on Sunday. In fact, to this day it isn't Sunday unless I \nget fried chicken. Nights with popcorn, playing games, listening--I am \nold enough that we used to sit down and listen to the radio together. \n``Fibber McGee and Molly'' was one of the most popular shows. Making \nsauerkraut, and canning, all of the kinds of meals that mother put \ntogether.\n  Of course, the mothers are the ones who really establish that firm \nfoundation of family. They are the ones who watch out for the parents \nand the grandparents and the kids and the grandkids, and think of the \nlittle events that are happening that ought to be special celebrations, \nand they make them special celebrations, often, by being there.\n  Of course, another part that mothers play is an educational role, \npassing on the lessons from their moms, and often in very succinct \nphrases. I have in my Washington office the mission statement that we \ncame up with by which we measure everything that is done in the office. \nIt is a series of phrases that my mom used to use when we were growing \nup, just so that we knew what we were supposed to be doing. The three \neasy rules are: Do what is right. Do your best. Treat others as you \nwant to be treated. Even here in the U.S. Senate, if it doesn't fit \nthose criteria, we are not going to do it.\n  Earlier today, Senator Thomas made some comments about my mom. I \ndeeply appreciated those. My mom was selected as Wyoming's Mother of \nthe Year this year. She is 75 years young and still involved in many \nthings, probably most principally still involved in being a mother. I \nstill get the regular lessons, the hopes, the expectations, the dreams. \nBut last weekend I got to go to Atlanta to see the special celebration \nfor the mothers of the year from each of the States in the Nation. I \nhave to tell you, that was a very spectacular collection of women who \nhave done some very unusual things, way beyond the call of duty. And \nthey do that as a celebration of all mothers and the unusual things \nthat mothers do, often without credit.\n  I have to tell you that a lady named Diane Matthews was given the \nhonor of being the Nation's Mother of the Year, and she will spend the \nnext year traveling around at her own expense, helping out mothers' \norganizations across this country to deliver a message. I wish that I \nhad the time to run through the special attributes that all of these \nwomen who were mothers of the year had. They deserve it. But, so does \nyour mother deserve some special accolades, and that is what Sunday is \ngoing to be about, making a special day of saying, ``Thanks, mom,'' and \nmaybe mentioning a few of those things that we forget to mention some \nof the times.\n  I have to tell you a little bit about this organization that does \nthis nationwide thing for promoting mothers, because that is what will \nchange this country more than what we do in this\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\nbody. Laws will not make the difference in the end--or in the \nbeginning. Mothers are there at the beginning, and they start to form \nour lives right at that point. I have to tell you that this \norganization tries to improve motherhood, something that is already \nexcellent. They know that it can be better. They know that if they work \ntogether, they can make this country better. I want to pass on to you a \nfew of the suggestions they have for the homes of America.\n  They have a pledge that mothers who join sign on to. It covers some \nvery basic things. They recognize that there are no quick fixes to \nproblems facing families, but they suggest: Pray each day. Establish \nfamily traditions; share history. Inspire respect, a sense of \nbelonging, a feeling of gratitude and responsibility. They suggest a \ndaily devotion and having a family meeting once a week. That is \nincluded with eating together as a family at least once a day for a \nchance to compare notes; play together, learn, teach and model life \nskills, such as time management; love and nurture family members; \nmonitor television viewing; promote patriotism; teach values; plan and \nspend time with your spouse; and learn the parenting skills.\n\n  They have some community goals: Reestablish the dignity and \nimportance of being a mother; encourage community-wide needs assessment \nto identify and solve problems. They recognize that the moms can see \nthe problems in the community, they can identify those needs and get \npeople busy solving them.\n  They suggest implementing a mentor mothers program: Get the mothers \nwho have some experience to help those who don't have experience yet to \nlearn what the jobs are, and that can be done in a neighborhood sort of \nway.\n  They have a number of suggestions for the neighborhood: Create a \nnurturing neighborhood; community watch and safe neighborhoods; \ncommunity cleanliness and beautification; recycling; emergency \npreparedness; gardens for the hungry; and neighborhood parties to \ncreate a sense of belonging. In this country, we have lost the sense of \nbelonging as we get so busy and wrapped up in our jobs, and that is \nsomething to which mothers will bring us back.\n  They are emphasizing family time together, mothers helping other \nmothers, sharing the peace and power of prayer and providing quilts for \nat-risk babies--they go to hospitals all over the country and give \nquilts to babies who might otherwise be at risk--and also showing the \nappreciation of the role of mothers everywhere.\n  It was a tremendous adventure to attend their convention and see all \nof the different activities in which they are involved, things we ought \nto have more people involved in all over this country.\n  I encourage everyone to make Mother's Day special this year. Mothers \nhelp us to have celebrations. They are cheerleaders for all of the \nevents of our lives. Sunday is a good day to be a cheerleader for the \nevents in their lives. Take a few moments and write down some of the \nfond memories of your mother and share those with your mother. It will \nbe a pleasant experience for both of you. After all, your mother had \nthe dreams and did the work that makes your day, today, a reality.\n  In a speech I saw once, there were some lines that go something like \nthis: For 9 long months, your mother carried you next to her heart. \nThere is nothing that you will ever be able to do that will exceed her \nsecret expectations of you. And even if your actions sink to the lowest \ndepths of human behavior, you can't possibly sink beneath the love of \nher for you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4524-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING MAY 1ST\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute's report \nfor the week ending May 1, that the U.S. imported 8,773,000 barrels of \noil each day, an increase of 667,000 barrels over the 8,106,000 \nimported daily during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.7 percent of their needs last \nweek. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent \nof its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo \nin the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's \noil supply.\n  Politicians had better give consideration to the economic calamity \nsure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our \nsupply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing \ninto the U.S.--now 8,287,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4525-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WYNN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life of \nRonald E. Wynn, who died Friday, May 1, 1998. I first met Ron as a \npatient in 1987. He bears the distinction of being the first African-\nAmerican to receive a heart transplant at Vanderbilt University Medical \nCenter, and I had the honor of performing his surgery. While our \nrelationship was initially that of doctor/patient, it later evolved \ninto something deeper. Ron's wife describes him as someone who ``always \nhad a smile on his face'' and who ``always tried to help other \npeople.'' These characteristics, along with our shared desire to \npromote the need for organ donation, caused our friendship to grow.\n  Several of my transplant patients came to me in 1987 with the idea of \nbicycling across the state of Tennessee to promote organ donation \nawareness. My initial thought was they were crazy. I told them, ``It's \none thing to go swimming and riding and jumping running around at a \ncontrolled event, where help is just around the corner. But to go \npedaling across a state with nobody around to help and no place to go \nif you get in trouble--it's not twenty-five miles, with people standing \ncheering you on; it's five hundred miles, with long stretches of \ndeserted road, and huge hills, and cars zipping past. It's too risky.'' \nRon was one of those courageous souls who sought to publicize this \nworthwhile goal by participating in this event, and he, along with \nseveral others, eventually persuaded me that it could be done in a safe \nand effective manner. Because of their influence, I, too, became an \nadvocate for this program and took an active role in publicizing and \npromoting this event. ``Transplant Bikers Across Tennessee'' became a \nphenomenal success which helped increase donor awareness across our \nstate and our country.\n  Ron's contributions to our state spanned a wide range of achievement \nand service. One of our local papers, The Tennessean, chronicled Ron's \nlife in its May 5, 1998 edition. Ron graduated from Pearl Senior High \nSchool in 1965 and from Fisk University in 1969 with a degree in \nphysics. He then continued his education by doing graduate work at Fisk \nin physics and mathematics, and put that education to practice by \nworking as a health physicist reviewing radioactive material \napplications. Ron also served as a reserve officer in the Navy and was \nthe first African-American on the amphibious assault carrier the USS \nFrancis Marion.\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\nWhile these achievements are impressive and commendable, his family \nstated that he ``will be remembered most of his generous spirit.''\n  As hard as you try not to become too attached to your patients, it \nhappens all the same. As a physician or a nurse, you will pull for \nthem, you cheer them on, you attend to their needs--physically and \nemotionally, and in the end, they make an impression on you that isn't \nerased just because the surgery is completed. Ron's passing is a great \nloss to so many people. It is also a personal loss for me. His loyalty \nto organ donor awareness is to be commended, and, as a tribute to this \nman who sought to help others who depend on organ donation for life, we \nshould carry on this work in his memory.\n  At the successful completion of the ``Transplant Bikers Across \nTennessee'' event, Ron and the other participants were engulfed by the \nmedia. Ron responded by saying, ``A lot of people have called us heroes \nthis week, but the real heroes are those people, the ones who donate \ntheir organs so that out of their tragic deaths people like me can have \na life.'' Ron will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and \ncommunity. I have made it a goal to continue efforts to increase public \nawareness and to ensure that we are doing all we can to save lives \nthrough organ donation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4525-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1872.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nextend the authority of State medicaid fraud control units to \ninvestigate and prosecute fraud in connection with Federal health care \nprograms and abuse of residents of board and care facilities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the senior citizen protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Senior \nCitizen Protection Act of 1998. The legislation aims to protect our \nnation's seniors from patient and elder abuse. The bill also protects \nour federal health care programs, most notably Medicare, from fraud.\n  In the past two years, we have made great strides against fraud and \nabuse by passing new initiatives. These initiatives include closing \nloopholes, improving coordination between Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement programs, and enhancing the powers of the Inspector General \nof the Department of Health and Human Services to combat fraud and \nrecover lost money.\n  These measures are helping, but there is another vision which I think \nwill help us stay ahead of those who endlessly scheme to defraud our \nhealth care programs. The Senior Citizen Protection Act deputizes \nMedicaid investigators and enables them to weed out fraud and abuse in \nour federal health program.\n  Currently, when a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigates a state \nMedicaid fraud case and finds a similar violation in Medicare, the Unit \ncannot investigate the Medicare infraction. Common sense will tell you \nthat an unscrupulous actor defrauding Medicaid will likely do the same \nto federal health programs.\n  In Montana, for example, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit routinely \nfinds co-existing cases of Medicaid and Medicare fraud in patient \nrecords. While the Unit has the documents right in front of them, they \ncan not pursue the Medicare abuses.\n  Federal authorities must conduct a new and separate investigation. \nUnfortunately, these violations may be too small to justify a federal \ninvestigation. The majority of health care fraud recoveries, 62%, are \nmore than a million dollars. Even more striking, only 6% of federal \nfraud recoveries are in an amount lower than $100,000. Thus, the \nFederal Government is doing a good job of weeding out the big actors in \nthe anti-fraud war, but the smaller actors--which still cost money--\ncontinue to ride scot-free.\n  That is where our legislation can help. If a fraud Unit is \ninvestigating a fraudulent doctor, for example, and finds some Medicare \nclaims that look false, currently the investigator has to call the \nInspector General's office and report their suspicions.\n  In many cases, however, they hear back from Washington that the \nclaims may be fraudulent, but the fraud is not\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\nwidespread enough to justify the expense of a federal investigation. \nUnder our legislation, the Units will now be able to wrap the Medicare \ncase into their own investigation and the Federal Government will be \nable to continue spending their resources on larger fraud operations.\n  The Senior Citizen Protection Act allows state Fraud Control Units to \ninvestigate federal violations which come to their attention during an \nexisting state Medicaid investigation. By giving the Units this \ndiscreet authority, we can take another step toward reducing fraud and \nabuse.\n  While most fraud cases are the result of overbilling, false billing, \nor a provider performing unnecessary services, almost 25% of health \ncare fraud cases are due to poor quality of care or care not provided. \nAnd that is when these problems cross over from health care fraud to \nactual patient abuse and neglect. It alarms all of us when we hear \nstories of older individuals being harmed by unscrupulous persons. What \nupsets me so much about elderly abuse is how vulnerable these victims \nare, especially since they depend so much on their health care \nproviders for actual daily activities.\n  Some Senators may have heard about the egregious case in Arizona \nwhere two defendants pled guilty to three counts of aggravated assault \nfor sexually assaulting, intimidating and abusing patients. Their \ncrimes included spitting at and kicking patients, and threatening to \ngive a pill to a patient so he would never wake up. Some patients were \nso afraid they would not eat or drink. This is a modern tragedy.\n  Other stories include incidents of physical abuse, verbal ridicule \nand mockery, and neglect, such as depriving patients of food, water and \nthe opportunity for communication.\n  Under current law, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units can only \ninvestigate and prosecute cases of elder abuse in state-funded \nfacilities. However, more and more seniors are moving into assisted \nliving and residential treatment settings that receive no state funds. \nLet me be clear: I support this trend, as it gives seniors more choices \nabout the type of long-term care they receive. I am concerned, however, \nthat assisted living facilities have little oversight to prevent \npatient neglect and abuse. Local authorities often lack the resources \nand skill to investigate health care cases.\n  In Montana, our state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit routinely receives \ncalls from local law enforcement agencies, local public health \ndepartments, and even Adult Protective Services requesting assistance \nwith elder abuse cases. However, the Fraud Unit's hands are tied; they \nlack the jurisdictional authority to offer help.\n  The Senior Citizen Protection Act will enable state Medicaid Fraud \nControl Units to investigate cases of patient abuse and neglect in \nresidential facilities that do not receive state reimbursement. \nMedicaid investigators have the experience and expertise to assist \nlocal authorities with this job. Allowing the Medicaid Fraud Control \nUnits to lend their expertise to cases in non-Medicaid facilities makes \ngood sense and is right for our seniors.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2040 the Senior \nCitizens Protection Act introduced by Senator Baucus earlier this \nmorning.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor on this important \nlegislation.\n  There are 47 federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Units across \nthe country. Since the program began in 1978, more than 8,000 cases \nhave been prosecuted. They do an excellent job.\n  Millions of dollars have been returned as a result of their work.\n  The ``Senior Citizens Protection Act of 1998'' makes two very simple \nchanges to Medicaid Fraud Control Unit authority.\n  First it gives MFCU's the authority to investigate violations in our \nfederal health programs--primarily Medicare in addition to their \ncurrent authority to investigate violations in Medicaid.\n  Secondly, the bill would enable MFCU's to investigate patient abuse \nand neglect in residential health care facilities that do not receive \nMedicaid reimbursement.\n  In short the bill has two goals: to stop health care fraud and to \nprotect vulnerable seniors.\n  As the face of long-term care changes, local authorities need the \nresources to investigate claims of patient and elder abuse.\n  Rather than create new bureaucracies, this bill allows us to build \nupon the expertise of an existing entity--the state Medicaid Fraud \nControl Units.\n  During two Aging Committee field hearings that I held in Las Vegas \nand Reno in January 1998, I heard first hand from the Nevada Attorney \nGeneral, Frankie Sue Del Papa, how important this legislation was.\n  She made it very clear to me that her Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has \nthe expertise to investigate these cases. They simply need the \nauthority.\n  The MFCU's have the know how and experience to protect seniors in \nresidential health care facilities. They merely lack the authority to \nget involved in non-Medicaid cases.\n  This legislation will give them the needed authority. That is why \nthis bill is endorsed by the National Association of Attorneys General, \nthe Department of Justice, the American Association of Retired Persons \nand the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector \nGeneral.\n  Simply put, it is the right thing to do.\n  It is unfortunate that when MFCU investigators involved in a case of \nMedicaid fraud discover evidence that this fraud may also be happening \nin the Medicare program, or other federally funded health care \nprograms, they are restricted from taking action. This bill will change \nthat.\n  Under current law, the MFCU can only investigate patient abuse in \nmedical facilities which receive Medicaid funds.\n  In 1996 and 1997, the Nevada MFCU received 120 referrals but only \nopened 20 investigations due in part to limited jurisdiction.\n  Although many of these cases are referred to local law enforcement, \nthey may never be criminally investigated or prosecuted due to lack of \nexpertise or available resources.\n  State MFCUs are able to conduct these investigations and this bill \nwill give them the needed authority.\n  In Nevada 47 nursing homes and 54 adult group homes receive Medicaid \nfunding.\n  When abuse or neglect occurs in such facilities, the state MFCU can \ninvestigate.\n  However, we also have approximately 265 residential facilities for \ngroups and 321 registered homes which could fall within the definition \nof ``board and care facilities'' set forth in this bill.\n  With the passage of this bill, seniors and other residents in these \nfacilities would be protected regardless of whether the facility \nreceives Medicaid funding or not.\n  This bill would give the state MFCU the authority to investigate \nallegations of abuse and neglect in these facilities.\n  As we collectively strive to reduce fraud and abuse in our Medicare \nand Medicaid programs, we cannot overlook any opportunity to make a \ndifference.\n  This bill is a welcome weapon in our arsenal to fight abuse.\n  I commend Senators Baucus of Montana and Graham of Florida for their \nsponsorship of this bill and Senators Mikulski, Grassley, Johnson, and \nBreaux for their original cosponsorship of this important legislation.\n  We need all the ammunition possible in the war against health care \nfraud and in assuring the protection of our nation's most vulnerable \nseniors in the spectrum of long-term care facilities.\n  The bill introduced by my colleagues today is a major step in the \nright direction.\n  I am pleased to join them in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Senior Citizens Protection Act of 1998, introduced by Senator \nBaucus. I support this legislation for two reasons--it fights fraud and \nprotects seniors.\n  Fraud and abuse pose a serious threat to Medicare and Medicaid. We \ncannot afford to tolerate any more abuse of the system. The job of \nMedicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) is to investigate and prosecute \nMedicaid fraud in state programs. MFCUs have prosecuted thousands of \ncases and recovered hundreds of thousands of Medicaid dollars. Every \ndollar saved by MFCUs is another dollar we can use to provide quality \nservice to those who need it.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n  This legislation expands the authority of Medicaid Fraud Control \nUnits in two ways. It allows MFCUs to investigate federal fraud \nviolations discovered during a state Medicaid investigation. Currently, \nMFCUs cannot investigate Medicare fraud or other federal fraud \nviolations. Under the Senior Citizens Protection Act, MFCUs will be \nable to investigate federal fraud, and return recovered funds to the \nfederal government.\n  I am firmly committed to protecting seniors from elder abuse. This \nlegislation protects seniors by authorizing to MFCUs to investigate \npatient abuse in residential health care facilities that do not receive \nMedicaid reimbursement. The number of residential facilities is \ngrowing, but local authorities often lack the resources to investigate \nelder abuse. MFCUs are already investigating elder abuse in facilities \nthat receive Medicaid funding. But under the Senior Citizens Protection \nAct, MFCUs will be able to protect all of our senior citizens living in \nresidential facilities.\n  I want to let those who depend on Medicaid and Medicare know that we \nare fighting to stop fraud and waste. We have done an outstanding job \nin protecting Medicaid-covered seniors from fraud and abuse. It is now \ntime to extend that protection to all of our senior citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 2041. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Willow \nLake Natural Treatment System Project for the reclamation and reuse of \nwater, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                      the willow lake project act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate \nin the design, planning and construction of the Willow Lake Natural \nTreatment System Project for the reclamation and reuse of water by the \ncity of Salem, Oregon. This project is an innovative approach to an \nongoing sewer overflow problem. It will not only provide environmental \nbenefits for the city and the Willamette Valley, but could also provide \nirrigation water for the local farming community.\n  This natural treatment system is one component of the city's recently \nadopted Wastewater Master Plan. Currently, the city has a combined \nsanitary sewer system. Unfortunately, each winter season during the wet \nweather, sewer overflows spill into Salem-area creeks and streams, as \nwell as the Willamette River.\n  The proposed natural treatment system, working in conjunction with \nthe city's wastewater treatment plant, will provide Salem with the \nability to meet regulatory requirements by storing and treating all \nwastewater from Salem's sewer system and significantly reducing wet \nweather sewer system overflows. The finished system will meet Oregon \nDepartment of Environmental Quality (DEQ) standards, and be fully \noperational by 2010. Although the specific site has not yet been \nselected, I am hopeful that any land needed for the project will be \nacquired on a willing buyer-willing seller basis.\n  The natural treatment system proposed includes both overland flow \ntreatment and constructed wetlands treatment. The overland flow system \nwill include grassy swales and poplar trees to provide a high level of \nwastewater treatment. The constructed wetlands will include shallow \nponds with wetland-type vegetation, and provide both treatment and \nstorage. This system will be capable of producing between 10 and 20 \nmillion gallons per day of high quality effluent during the summer \nmonths that could potentially be used as a source of irrigation water \nfor the farming community in the area. A separate feasibility study \nwill have to be conducted before a determination is made on whether to \nuse this water for irrigation purposes. Any application of this water \nwould have to be in accordance with state water quality standards and \nthe requirements of the food processing industry.\n  This bill would authorize the Secretary to participate in this \nproject under the Bureau of Reclamation's existing Title XVI water \nreuse program. This program requires a feasibility study for all \nprojects authorized, and caps the federal cost-share of the \nconstruction costs. Under the Title XVI program, the city would have \ntitle to the project, and be responsible for all operation and \nmaintenance costs.\n  This project will provide multiple benefits for the environment. It \nwill naturally treat wastewater, provide habitat for fish and wildlife, \nimprove water quality in Salem-area streams and the Willamette River, \nand reduce wintertime sewer system overflows. As water supplies tighten \nthroughout the western United States, we need to look at innovative, \ncost-effective programs such as this to reuse water as efficiently as \npossible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this legislation, and \nwill ask for its timely consideration by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the \nbill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to provide for a program to improve commercial motor \nvehicle safety in the vicinity of the borders between the United States \nand Canada and the United States and Mexico; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     the safe highways act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.\n  Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safe Highways Act.\n  This bill authorizes $20 million per year over the next five years \nfor enforcement activities to prevent unsafe foreign trucks from \nrolling across our borders under NAFTA. This bill will fund inspections \nat our borders to keep these Mexican and Canadian trucks off our roads \nunless they meet our tough truck safety standards. Our standards are \nhigher than in Mexico and Canada, and, certainly, I do not want these \ntrucks rumbling down our roads and threatening the safety of our \nfamilies.\n  Mexican trucks are already permitted to operate in limited areas in \nthe United States and, in fact, they have been doing so for two \ndecades. We can enforce these standards at the border, but it will take \ntraining and an increased effort to handle the additional traffic from \nNAFTA, so we need to step up and put this money aside. These foreign \ntrucks will soon roam more of our roads under NAFTA. We need to be \nready. This is literally a matter of life and death for American \nfamilies who share the road with these trucks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Durbin):\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\n  S. 2043. A bill to repeal the limitation on use of appropriations to \nissue rules with respect to valuation of crude oil for royalty \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                            TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today Senator Durbin and Senator Bumpers \njoin me in introducing legislation to repeal a special-interest rider \nattached to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill last week. \nRepresentatives Caroyln Maloney and George Miller are introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House.\n  This rider is a taxpayer rip-off. It blocks the Interior Department \nfrom implementing a proposed rule to ensure that oil companies pay a \nfair royalty for oil drilled on public lands. These royalties are \nshared between the federal government and the state.\n  California law requires that all royalty payments be credited \ndirectly to the State Schools Fund. So every penny the oil companies \nfail to pay is stolen directly form our state's classrooms and our \nchildren's education.\n  If allowed to stand, this special interest rider will cost American \ntaxpayers an estimated $5.5 million per month, approximately $25 \nmillion by the end of this fiscal year. California's share of this lost \nrevenue could be used to hire new teachers, help rebuild crumbling \nschools, or put dozens of computers in our classrooms.\n  When oil companies drill on public lands, they pay a royalty to the \nfederal government, which in turn sends a share of these royalties to \nthe states. The royalty is calculated as a percentage of the value of \nthe oil drilled.\n  Here is where the problem lies. The oil companies currently \nunderstate the value of the oil drilled, and as a result, they underpay \ntheir royalties. Now, and after years of study and Congressional \nprodding, the Department of the Interior has finally decided to do \nsomething about it.\n  The Department of the Interior has billed 12 major oil companies over \n$260 million for back royalty payments. It will have to sue to collect \nbecause the current system is so fraught with ambiguity.\n  To guarantee taxpayers a fair royalty payment in the future, the \nInterior Department proposed a simple and common sense solution: pay \nroyalties based on actual market prices, not estimates the oil \ncompanies themselves make up. The rule was first proposed 2\\1/2\\ years \nago. It has held 14 public workshops and published 5 separate requests \nfor industry comments. And now it has been stopped cold in the dead of \nnight.\n  This is one of the clearest examples of a special interest taxpayer \nrip-off I have ever seen. It saves the wealthiest oil companies in the \nworld millions of dollars while shortchanging taxpayers and California \nschoolchildren. What does this say about our nation's priorities? This \naction must not stand, and my colleagues and I will fight it to the \nend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2043\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON ISSUANCE OF RULES \n                   REGARDING VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL FOR ROYALTY \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 3009 of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and \n     Rescissions Act is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Levin, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2044. A bill to assist urban and rural local education agencies in \nraising the academic achievement of all of their students; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the educational opportunity zones act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to introduce President \nClinton's Education Opportunity Zones bill to strengthen urban and \nrural public schools where the need is greatest. Congress needs to do \nmore to improve teaching and learning for all students across the \nnation, and that means paying close attention to school districts and \nchildren with the greatest needs.\n\n  Too many schools now struggle with low expectations for students, \nhigh dropout rates, watered-down curricula, unqualified teachers, and \ninadequate resources. This legislation will lead to the designation of \napproximately 50 high-poverty urban and rural school districts as \n``Education Opportunity Zones,'' and help them to implement the \neffective reforms needed to turn themselves around.\n  These school districts will become models of system-wide, standards-\nbased reform for the nation. They must agree to specific benchmarks for \nimproved student achievement, lower dropout rates, and other indicators \nof success. Schools in these districts will also be eligible for \ngreater flexibility in the use of federal education funds.\n  Our goal is to increase achievement, raise standards, upgrade teacher \nskills, and strengthen ties between schools, parents, and the community \nas a whole. Under this proposal, schools can use effective reform \nmeasures such as ending social promotion, increasing accountability, \nimproving teacher recruitment and training, and providing students and \nparents with school report cards.\n  We know that this approach can work. Last fall, I visited the Harriet \nTubman Elementary School in New York City, where 95 percent of the \npupils are from low-income families. Before 1996, it was one of the \nlowest achieving schools in the city. In September, 1996, the \nprincipal, the superintendent, teachers, and parents worked together to \nreorganize the school. They put extra resources into training teachers \nto teach reading. They upgraded the curriculum to reflect high \nstandards. They created a parent resource center to increase family and \ncommunity involvement. These and other reforms worked.\n  Each day, many parents are at the school too, helping maintain \ndiscipline and at the same time expanding their own education.\n  Each morning, teachers stop their regular classwork and teach reading \nto their students for 90 minutes. Since 1996, scores on statewide \nreading exams have risen by 20 percent.\n  In Boston, under the leadership of Superintendent Tom Payzant, \nschools are making significant progress by creating new curriculum \nstandards, setting higher achievement standards, and expanding \ntechnology through public and private sector partnerships. They are \nfocusing on literacy, after-school programs, and school-to-career \nopportunities.\n  These successes are not unusual. Public schools can improve even when \nfacing the toughest odds. We need to do all we can to help such schools \nget the resources they need, so that they can implement the changes \nthey know will work and help children learn more effectively.\n  Under the Education Opportunity Zone approach, urban and rural school \ndistricts can apply for funds to implement a wide range of reforms. \nSchool districts will apply to the Secretary of Education for three-\nyear grants. The Secretary will ensure a fair distribution of grants \namong geographic regions, and among various sizes of urban and rural \nschools districts.\n  In determining the amount of each grant, the Secretary will consider \nfactors such as the scope of activities in the application, the number \nof students from poor families in the school district, the number of \nlow-performing schools in the district, and the number of low-achieving \nchildren in the district.\n  This legislation proposes funding of $200 million in fiscal year 1999 \nand $1.5 billion over the next 5 years to support these grants.\n  I commend President Clinton for developing this worthwhile \ninitiative, and I look forward to its enactment. Investing in students, \nteachers, and schools is one of the best investments America can make. \nFor schools across the nation, help can't come a minute too soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                                Findings\n\n       Sec. 2. The Congress finds as follows:\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\n       (1) Students in schools that have high concentrations of \n     poor children begin school academically behind their peers in \n     other schools and are often unable to close the gap as they \n     progress through school. In later years, these students are \n     less likely than other students to attend a college or \n     university and more likely to experience unemployment.\n       (2) Many children who attend these high-poverty schools \n     lack access to the challenging curricula, well-prepared \n     teachers, and high expectations that make better achievement \n     possible. More specifically, they are often educated in over-\n     crowded classrooms and by teachers who are assigned to teach \n     in subject areas outside their areas of certification.\n       (3) Data from the National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress consistently show large gaps between the achievement \n     of students in high-poverty schools and those in other \n     schools. High-poverty schools will face special challenges in \n     preparing their students to reach high standards of \n     performance on national and State assessments, such as \n     voluntary national tests and the assessments States are \n     developing under the Goals 2000 and ESEA, Title I programs.\n       (4) Recent reports have found that students in urban \n     districts are more likely to attend high-poverty schools; \n     more frequently taught by teachers possessing only an \n     emergency or temporary license; and less likely to score \n     above the basic level on achievement tests than are nonurban \n     students.\n       (5) High-poverty rural schools, because of their isolation, \n     small size, and low levels of resources, also face particular \n     challenges. For example, teachers in rural districts are \n     nearly twice as likely as other teachers to provide \n     instruction in three or more subjects.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these general trends, some high-poverty \n     school districts have shown that they can increase student \n     achievement, if they adopt challenging standards for all \n     children, focus on improving curriculum and instruction, \n     expand educational choice among public schools for parents \n     and students, adopt other components of systemic educational \n     reform, and hold schools, staff, and students accountable for \n     results.\n       (7) Districts that have already established the policies \n     needed to attain widespread student achievement gains, and \n     have attained those gains in some of their schools, can serve \n     as models for other districts desiring to improve the \n     academic achievement of their students. The Federal \n     Government can spur more districts in this direction by \n     providing targeted resources for urban and rural districts \n     willing to carry out solid plans for improving the \n     educational achievement of all their children.\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       Sec. 3.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain beneficiaries of the military health care system to enroll in \nFederal employees health benefits plans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                 THE IMPROVED MILITARY MEDICAL PLAN ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Improved \nMilitary Medical Plan Act, IMMPACT for short, to ensure that military \nretirees and their families will continue to be given proper medical \ncare. This past May 1, the Defense Department implemented its new \nhealth care program, known as TRICARE, in two more regions of the \ncountry, including in North Carolina. As the number of TRICARE \nenrollees increases and as the Military Health Services System is \ndownsized, military retirees will have an even harder time finding \nspace available at military facilities.\n\n  Effectively, those military retirees over 65 are left with no \nmilitary medical benefit, since they are unlikely to get into military \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, this is a far cry from the promise that our government \nmade to these retirees when they put in a full career in uniform \nrisking their lives for our freedom. They were promised medical care \nfor life, and everyone believed that it would be at base medical \nfacilities. It just is not right to renege on that promise after all \nthat these men and women have done for our country.\n  We can and must do better. IMMPACT will allow Medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees, their dependents, and their survivors to participate \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. It will also provide \na very strong incentive for the Department of Defense to ensure that \nTRICARE is offering active duty personnel and younger retirees and \ntheir families a medical benefit equivalent to the federal civilian \nprogram.\n  IMMPACT sets up a three-year demonstration. Ideally, the \ndemonstration would be conducted on a nationwide basis, but I realize \nthat such a broadly geographical demonstration could be difficult to \nmanage. So the bill directs the Administration to have as expansive a \ndemonstration as practicable, as long as at least six sites around the \ncountry are selected.\n  The IMMPACT demonstration is simple. Medicare-eligible retirees of \nthe uniformed services as well as their dependents and survivors at the \nselected demonstration sites will be able to apply for enrollment in \nthe health care plans of the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. \nEvery year, the Administration will report to Congress on the value of \nthis health care option, how many eligible beneficiaries want to \nenroll, how much the demonstration is costing, how it compares to other \nhealth care options available to the beneficiaries, to name just a few \nof the metrics.\n  The IMMPACT demonstration is only open to Medicare-eligible retirees. \nBut, as I mentioned earlier, IMMPACT provides strong incentives for the \nDepartment of Defense to make TRICARE as comprehensive as FEHBP. The \nfine men and women now serving in the Armed Services and those who went \nbefore them deserve to be treated at least as well as civilian federal \nemployee and retirees.\n  This is very important to me. We have all heard of, or even \nexperienced, health care plans where ``cost'' is a more important \nfactor than ``service.'' Two health care plans could appear equivalent \non the surface--their premiums could be about the same, they could have \nmany locations for treatment, etc. But, if one plan is more \nbureaucratic than another, or it delays payments to doctors, or it is \ntoo tight on the definition of what is a ``reasonable and customary \ncharge,'' eventually, the best doctors are going to drop out. In the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits program, civilian employees and \nretirees can opt out of a bad plan because they have a choice of many \nplans. But, in TRICARE, there is no real choice. There are no \ncompetitive pressures to keep TRICARE equivalent to the better civilian \nplans.\n  IMMPACT will fix that. Within six months after the passage of \nIMMPACT, the Administration must submit a report to Congress that sets \nforth a plan to enhance TRICARE, if necessary, so that it is at least \nas comprehensive as the plans used by civilian federal employees and \nretirees.\n  IMMPACT is independent of other demonstration programs. Some may \nargue that IMMPACT is not needed because we are running a Medicare \nSubvention demonstration. But, there is no reason why IMMPACT should \nwait for that program to be completed and evaluated. In fact, I want \nIMMPACT to be offered to the same retirees that could chose the \nMedicare Subvention plan. In this manner, we will have some clear \nmarket signals about the value of each of these options within the same \ncustomer community.\n  At the end of the IMMPACT demonstration program, the Administration \nwill advise the Congress of the need to extend the eligibility of \nparticipation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, first \nnationwide to all Medicare-eligible retirees, and then to all retirees \nor active duty personnel, if TRICARE proves to be inferior to the \ncivilian health care benefit.\n  Mr. President, some may complain that this program will increase the \nDefense Department's cost of delivering medical benefits. Perhaps it \nwill. But, I think our military men and women and their families \ndeserve a better health care program than they are being offered now. \nClearly, if we can find the money to fund our extravagances in the arts \nand entertainment, we can find funding for medical care for those who \nhave been willing to risk their own lives in defense of our liberty and \nfreedom.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support IMMPACT.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2046. A bill to ensure that Federal, State and local governments \nconsider all nongovernmental organizations on an equal basis when \nchoosing such organizations to provide assistance under certain \ngovernment programs, without impairing the religious character of any \nof the organizations, and without diminishing the religious freedom of \nbeneficiaries of assistance funded under such programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs\n\n\n              the charitable choice expansion act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for years, America's charities and \nchurches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the \ndeeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change \nbehavior and attitudes. By contrast, government social programs have \nfailed miserably in moving recipients from dependency and despair to \nresponsibility and independence.\n\n  Successful faith-based organizations now have a new opportunity to \ntransform the character of our welfare system under the ``Charitable \nChoice'' provision contained in the 1996 welfare reform law. Charitable \nChoice allows--but does not require--states to contract with \ncharitable, religious or private organizations, or to create voucher \nsystems, to deliver welfare services within the states. The provision \nrequires states to consider these organizations on an equal basis with \nother private groups once a state decides to use nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  The Charitable Choice legislation provides specific protections for \nreligious organizations when they provide services. For example, the \ngovernment cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of \nits religious\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\ncharacter. A participating faith-based organization retains its \nindependence from government, including control over the definition, \ndevelopment, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.\n  Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization \nto alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, \nicons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious \norganizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their \nemployment decisions.\n  The Charitable Choice legislation also provides specific protections \nto beneficiaries of assistance. A religious organization can't \ndiscriminate against a beneficiary on account of religion. And if a \nbeneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious \norganization, he or she has a right to an alternate provider.\n  Finally, there is a limitation on use of government funds. Federal \ncontract dollars cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or \nproselytization.\n  I would like to give a couple of examples of how the Charitable \nChoice provision of the welfare law is currently working.\n  Last fall, Payne Memorial Outreach Center, the non-profit community \ndevelopment arm of the 100-year-old Payne Memorial African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church, in Baltimore, received a $1.5 million state contract \nto launch an innovative job training and placement program. In a matter \nof only five months, over 100 welfare recipients successfully obtained \nemployment through their participation in Payne's program. A brochure \nfrom this dynamic faith-based institution describes why Payne is \nsuccessful: ``The Intensive Job Service Program reaches out in love to \nBaltimore's most disenfranchised, helping them to identify and \nstrengthen their God-given talents--releasing and developing their \nhuman possibilities.''\n  Another example of Charitable Choice at work is in Shreveport, \nLouisiana, where the ``Faith and Families'' program, under a contract \nwith the state, is running a successful job placement program. Faith \nand Families offers job-readiness classes in northwestern Louisiana, \nhelps set up job interviews, and opens doors into the workplace.\n  The program also links welfare families with faith communities. \nChurches are asked to adopt a family and provide assistance--possibly \nchild care, transportation, work experience, tutoring, and \nencouragement--that will help them make the transition from welfare to \nwork.\n  I spoke with the director of Faith and Families in Shreveport just \nlast week, and he told me that his organization has helped 400 people \nget off welfare and find jobs.\n  These examples demonstrate that under the Charitable Choice provision \nof the welfare law, caring, faith-based organizations are providing \neffective services that help individuals move from dependency to \nindependence, from despair to dignity.\n  With this in mind, today I am introducing ``The Charitable Choice \nExpansion Act of 1998,'' which expands the Charitable Choice concept to \nall federal laws which authorize the government to use non-governmental \nentities to provide services to beneficiaries with federal dollars.\n\n  The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually \nidentical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the \nwelfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions \nis that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the \noriginal provision.\n  While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the \nnew welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion \nAct applies to all federal government programs in which the government \nis authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally \nfunded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that will be \ncovered include: housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, \njuvenile services, seniors services, the Community Development Block \nGrant, the Community Services Block Grant, the Social Services Block \nGrant, abstinence education, and child welfare services.\n  The legislation does not cover elementary and secondary education \nprograms--except it does cover GED programs--or higher education \nprograms. Further, the bill does not affect the Head Start program or \nthe Child Care Development Block Grant program, both of which already \ncontain certain provisions regarding the use of religious organizations \nin delivering services under those programs.\n  We have taken measures to strengthen the bill by providing more \nprotections to both beneficiaries and religious organizations. For \nexample, the government must ensure that beneficiaries receive notice \nof their right under the bill to object to receiving services from a \nreligious organization. Additionally, religious organizations must \nsegregate their own private funds from government funding.\n  This proposal is necessary because while some areas of the law may \nnot contain discriminatory language towards religious organizations, \nmany government officials may assume wrongly that the Establishment \nClause bars religious organizations from participating as private \nproviders.\n  The Charitable Choice Expansion Act embodies existing case precedents \nto clarify to government officials and religious organizations alike \nthat it is constitutionally allowable, and even constitutionally \nrequired, to consider religious organizations on an equal basis with \nother private providers. It is my hope that these protections in the \nlaw will encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations \nto expand their services while assuring them that they will not have to \nextinguish their religious character when receiving government funds.\n  I am pleased to say that there is broad-based support for the \nCharitable Choice Expansion Act. Some of the organizations supporting \nthe concept of this legislation include Agudath Israel, American Center \nfor Law and Justice, Call to Renewal, Center for Public Justice, \nChristian Coalition, Christian Legal Society, the Coalition on Urban \nRenewal and Education, National Association of Evangelicals, the \nNational Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the Salvation Army, Teen \nChallenge International USA, and World Vision.\n  America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental organizations, \nfrom the Salvation Army to Catholic Charities, have moved people \nsuccessfully from dependency and despair to the dignity of self-\nreliance. Government alone will never cure our societal ills. We need \nto find ways to help unleash the cultural remedy administered so \neffectively by charitable and religious organizations. Allowing a \n``charitable choice'' will help transform the lives of those in need \nand unleash an effective response to today's challenges in our culture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2049. A bill to provide for payments to children's hospitals that \noperate graduate medical education programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n      the children's hospitals education and research act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit this proposal to \nprovide critical support to teaching programs at free-standing \nchildren's hospitals. I am also honored to be joined by Senators Bond, \nDurbin, Kennedy, DeWine and Moynihan on this bill.\n\n  Children's hospitals play an important role in our nation's health \ncare system. They combine high-quality clinical care, a vibrant \nteaching mission and leading pediatric biomedical research within their \nwalls. They provide specialized regional services, including complex \ncare to chronically ill children, and serve as safety-net providers to \nlow-income children.\n  Teaching is an everyday component of these hospitals' operations. \nPediatric hospitals train one-quarter of the nation's pediatricians, \nand the majority of America's pediatric specialists. Pediatric \nresidents develop the skills they need to care for our nation's \nchildren at these institutions.\n  In addition, pediatric hospitals combine the joint missions of \nteaching and research. Scientific discovery depends on the strong \nacademic focus of teaching hospitals. The teaching environment attracts \nacademics devoted to research. It attracts the volume and spectrum of \ncomplex cases needed for clinical research. And the teaching\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nmission creates the intellectual environment necessary to test the \nconventional wisdom of day-to-day health care and foster the \nquestioning that leads to breakthroughs in research. Because these \nhospitals combine research and teaching in a clinical setting, these \nbreakthroughs can be rapidly translated into patient care.\n  Children's hospitals have contributed to advances in virtually every \naspect of pediatric medicine. Thanks to research efforts at these \nhospitals, children can survive once-fatal diseases such as polio, grow \nand thrive with disabilities such as cerebral palsy, and overcome \njuvenile diabetes to become self-supporting adults.\n  Through patient care, teaching and research, these hospitals \ncontribute to our communities in many ways. However, their training \nprograms--and their ability to fulfill their critical role in America's \nhealth care system--are being gradually undermined by dwindling \nfinancial support. Maintaining a vibrant teaching and research program \nis more expensive than simply providing patient care. The nation's \nteaching hospitals have historically relied on higher payments--\npayments above the cost of clinical care itself--in order to finance \ntheir teaching programs. Today, competitive market pressures provide \nlittle incentive for private payers to contribute towards teaching \ncosts. At the same time, the increased use of managed care plans within \nthe Medicaid program has decreased the availability of teaching dollars \nthrough Medicaid. Therefore, Medicare's support for graduate medical \neducation is more important than ever.\n\n  Independent children's hospitals, however, serve an extremely small \nnumber of Medicare patients. Therefore, they do not receive Medicare \ngraduate medical education payments to support their teaching \nactivities. In 1997, Medicare provided an average of $65,000 per \nresident to all teaching hospitals, compared to an average of $230 per \nresident in total Medicare GME payments at independent children's \nhospitals.\n  This proposal will address, for the short-term, this unintended \nconsequence of current public policy. It will provide time-limited \nsupport to help children's hospitals train tomorrow's pediatricians, \ninvestigate new treatments and pursue pediatric biomedical research. It \nwill establish a four-year fund, which will provide children's \nhospitals with a Federal teaching payment equal to the national average \nper resident payment through Medicare. Total spending over four years \nwill be less than a billion dollars.\n  All American families have great dreams for their children. These \nhopes include healthy, active, happy childhoods, so they seek the best \npossible health care for their children. And when these dreams are \nthreatened by a critical illness, they seek the expertise of highly-\ntrained pediatricians and pediatric specialists, and rely on the \nresearch discoveries fostered by children's hospitals. All families \ndeserve a chance at the American dream. Through this legislation, we \nwill help children's hospitals--hospitals such as Children's Hospital \nin Omaha, Boys' Town, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Children's \nMemorial Hospital in Chicago, Children's Hospital in Boston and \nothers--train the doctors and do the research necessary to fulfill this \ndream. Through this legislation, Congress will be doing its part to \nhelp American families work towards a successful future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will address a short-term problem--\nactually a problem that is a short-term solution to a problem that we \nhave with graduate medical education for pediatricians. Pediatric \nhospitals perform a very important part of the teaching and the \ntraining of our pediatricians. But because they see very few Medicare \npatients, which is obvious, they don't receive Medicare graduate \neducation payments to support their teaching activities. What that \nmeans is there is a huge difference in Federal support across teaching \nhospitals--about $65,000 per resident in Medicare GME payments to all \nteaching hospitals, compared to an average of $230 per resident in \ntotal Medicare GME payments to independent children's hospitals.\n  It is a very big problem as we increasingly pay attention to the need \nfor good pediatric health care for our children. We have to make sure \nthat we solve this problem. This is a short-term solution.\n  I mentioned the short-term solution. The Presidential Commission on \nMedicare will be making its recommendation next year. One of its \nresponsibilities is to deal with the question of graduate medical \neducation--coming up with a solution of how we can fund it in an \nenvironment where more and more health care is going into managed care. \nThat will be an especially difficult problem for us to solve.\n  But inside of that overall problem is an even more compelling \nproblem, as I think Members will see when they look at the differential \nin reimbursement for teaching costs in pediatric hospitals versus all \nresidents nationwide.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask that the complete text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (ii) the weighted average number of full-time equivalent \n     residents in the hospital's approved medical residency \n     training programs (as determined under section 1886(h)(4) of \n     the Social Security Act) for the cost reporting period; and\n       (B) the product of--\n       (i) the per resident rate for indirect medical education, \n     as determined under paragraph (3), for the cost reporting \n     period; and\n       (ii) the number of full-time equivalent residents in the \n     hospital's approved medical residency training programs for \n     the cost reporting period.\n       (2) Per resident rate for direct medical education.--\n       (A) In general.--The per resident rate for direct medical \n     education for a hospital for a cost reporting period ending \n     in or after fiscal year 1999 is the updated rate determined \n     under subparagraph (B), as adjusted for the hospital under \n     subparagraph (C).\n       (B) Computation of updated rate.--The Secretary shall--\n       (i) compute a base national DME average per resident rate \n     equal to the average of the per resident rates computed under \n     section 1886(h)(2) of the Social Security Act for cost \n     reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1998; and\n       (ii) update such rate by the applicable percentage increase \n     determined under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of such Act for the \n     fiscal year involved.\n       (C) Adjustment for variations in labor-related costs.--The \n     Secretary shall adjust for each hospital the portion of such \n     updated rate that is related to labor and labor-related costs \n     to account for variations in wage costs in the geographic \n     area in which the hospital is located using the factor \n     determined under section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Social Security \n     Act.\n       (3) Per resident rate for indirect medical education.--\n       (A) In general.--The per resident rate for indirect medical \n     education for a hospital for a cost reporting period ending \n     in or after fiscal year 1999 is the updated amount determined \n     under subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Computation of updated amount.--The Secretary shall--\n       (i) determine, for each hospital with a graduate medical \n     education program which is paid under section 1886(d) of the \n     Social Security Act, the amount paid to that hospital \n     pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(B) of such Act\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n     for the equivalent of a full twelve-month cost reporting \n     period ending during the preceding fiscal year and divide \n     such amount by the number of full-time equivalent residents \n     participating in its approved residency programs and used to \n     calculate the amount of payment under such section in that \n     cost reporting period;\n       (ii) take the sum of the amounts determined under clause \n     (i) for all the hospitals described in such clause and divide \n     that sum by the number of hospitals so described; and\n       (iii) update the amount computed under clause (ii) for a \n     hospital by the applicable percentage increase determined \n     under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of such Act for the fiscal \n     year involved.\n       (c) Making of Payments.--\n       (1) Interim payments.--The Secretary shall estimate, before \n     the beginning of each cost reporting period for a hospital \n     for which a payment may be made under this section, the \n     amount of payment to be made under this section to the \n     hospital for such period and shall make payment of such \n     amount, in 26 equal interim installments during such period.\n       (2) Final payment.--At the end of each such period, the \n     hospital shall submit to the Secretary such information as \n     the Secretary determines to be necessary to determine the \n     final payment amount due under this section for the hospital \n     for the period. Based on such determination, the Secretary \n     shall recoup any overpayments made, or pay any balance due. \n     The final amount so determined shall be considered a final \n     intermediary determination for purposes of applying section \n     1878 of the Social Security Act and shall be subject to \n     review under that section in the same manner as the amount of \n     payment under section 1886(d) is subject to review under such \n     section.\n       (d) Limitation on Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), there are hereby \n     appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, for payments under this section for cost \n     reporting periods beginning in--\n       (A) fiscal year 1999 $100,000,000;\n       (B) fiscal year 2000, $285,000,000;\n       (C) fiscal year 2001, $285,000,000; and\n       (D) fiscal year 2002, $285,000,000.\n       (2) Carryover of excess.--If the amount of payments under \n     this section for cost reporting periods ending in fiscal year \n     1999, 2000, or 2001 is less than the amount provided under \n     this subsection for such payments for such periods, then the \n     amount available under this subsection for cost reporting \n     periods ending in the following fiscal year shall be \n     increased by the amount of such difference.\n       (e) Relation to Medicare and Medicaid Payments.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, payments under \n     this section to a hospital for a cost reporting period--\n       (1) are in lieu of any amounts otherwise payable to the \n     hospital under section 1886(h) or 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social \n     Security Act to the hospital for such cost reporting period, \n     but\n       (2) shall not affect the amounts otherwise payable to such \n     hospitals under a State medicaid plan under title XIX of such \n     Act.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Approved medical residency training program.--The term \n     ``approved medical residency training program'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 1886(h)(5)(A) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(5)(A)).\n       (2) Children's hospital.--The term ``children's hospital'' \n     means a hospital described in section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iii) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(1)(B)(iii)).\n       (3) Direct graduate medical education costs.--The term \n     ``direct graduate medical education costs'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 1886(h)(5)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(5)(C)).\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original \ncosponsor with Senator Bob Kerrey of the ``Children's Hospitals \nEducation and Research Act of 1998.'' This bill seeks to address an \nunintended inequity in federal support for graduate medical education. \nIf not addressed, this inequity will jeopardize the future of the \npediatric health care work force as well as the pediatric biomedical \nresearch enterprise for our nation's children.\n  Specifically, this bill will provide capped, time-limited, interim \ncommensurate federal funding for the nearly 60 independent children's \nteaching hospitals, including the children's hospitals in Kansas City \nand St. Louis, which are so important to the training of the nation's \nphysicians who serve children. They are equally important to the \nconduct of research to benefit children's health and health care.\n  Let me illustrate the magnitude of the inequity in federal investment \nin graduate medical attention (GME). In 1977, the federal Medicare \nprogram reimbursed teaching hospitals, on average, more than $76,000 \nfor each resident trained. In contrast, Medicare reimbursed independent \nchildren's teaching hospitals--children's hospitals that do not share a \nMedicare provider number with a larger medical institution--less than \n$400 per resident, because children's hospitals care for children, not \nthe elderly, and therefore do not serve Medicare patients, except for a \nsmall number of children with end stage renal disease.\n  Until recently, this inequity was not a problem as long as all payers \nof health care were willing to reimburse teaching hospitals enough for \ntheir patient care to cover the extra costs of GME. As the health care \nmarket has become increasingly competitive, it has become harder and \nharder for all teaching hospitals to generate patient care revenues to \nhelp cover their GME costs. But only independent children's teaching \nhospitals face these competitive pressures without the significant \nfederal GME support, which the rest of the teaching hospital community \nrelies upon.\n  This is more than a problem for the financial well-being of the \neducation programs of a small number of children's hospitals--less than \none percent of the nation's hospitals. It is a problem for our entire \npediatric workforce and pediatric research enterprise, because these \ninstitutions play such a disproportionately large role in academic \nmedicine for children. On average, their education programs are equal \nin size to the GME programs of all teaching hospitals, but they train \ntwice as many residents per bed as do other teaching hospitals.\n  As a consequence, independent children's teaching hospitals train \nabout 5 percent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and \nthe majority of many pediatric subspecialists who care for children \nwith the most complex conditions, such as children with cancer, cystic \nfibrosis, cerebral palsy, and more.\n  Recommendations to address the inequity in federal GME support for \nchildren's teaching hospitals are supported by the National Association \nof Children's Hospitals as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics \nand the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs. Last \nmonth, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote to President Clinton, \nto express support for the establishment of interim federal support for \nthe GME program of freestanding, independent children's hospitals. The \nAAP said, ``(w)e regard the education programs of independent \nchildren's hospitals as important to our pediatric workforce and \ntherefore to the future health of all children, because they educate an \nimportant proportion of the nation's pediatricians.''\n  Last year, many members of the Senate, including myself, recommended \nthat any comprehensive reform of graduate medical education financing \nshould include commensurate federal GME support for children's teaching \nhospitals. Instead of enacting GME reform, Congress directed the \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and the Medicare \nPayment Assessment Commission to prepare recommendations for the future \nof GME financing, including for children's teaching hospitals.\n  Since it will be at least another year before Congress receives those \nrecommendations and potentially several years before Congress is able \nto act on them, the ``Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act'' \nwill provide interim funding for just four years. It will be \ncommensurate to federal GME support for all teaching hospitals. \nSpecifically, the bill provides, in a capped fund, $100 million in FY \n1999 and $285 million in each of the three succeeding fiscal years, for \neligible institutions. It will be financed by general revenues, not \nMedicare HI Trust Funds.\n  I know what a critical role children's hospitals play in the ability \nof families and communities to care for all children, including \nchildren with the most complex conditions and children on families with \nthe most limited economic means. Through their education and research \nprograms, they are also devoted to serving future generations of \nchildren, too. Certainly, the children of Missouri as well as Kansas \nand Southern Illinois, depend vitally on the services and research of \nindependent children's teaching hospitals such as Children's Mercy in \nKansas City, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Cardinal Glennon \nChildren's Hospital, and the care givers they educate.\n  Children's hospitals are places of daily miracles. Healing that we \nwould\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nnever have thought possible a few years ago for children who are burn \nvictims, or trauma victims, or even cancer victims now occurs daily at \nthese hospitals. And while I am sure divine intervention plays a role \nin this healing, it is also due to the very hard work of skilled \ndoctors, nurses, and dedicated staff that is second to none. We must \ntherefore ensure that these facilities have the resources to continue \ntheir noble mission of saving children from the clutches of death and \ndisease.\n  I know trustees, and medical and executive leaders of these \ninstitutions. All are committed to controlling the cost of children's \nhealth to the best of their ability. But their future ability to \nsustain their education and research programs will also depend on \ncommensurate federal GME support for them. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting the enactment of the ``Children's Hospital Education \nand Research Act.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Bond, Senator Durbin, and Senator DeWine in \nsponsoring this legislation to assure adequate funding for resident \ntraining in independent children's teaching hospitals.\n  These hospitals, such as Children's Hospital in Boston, have 60 \npediatric training programs. They represent less than 1 percent of the \ntraining programs across the country, yet these hospitals train 5 \npercent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and the \nmajority of many pediatric subspecialist.\n  Too often today, these hospitals are hard-pressed for financial \nsupport. Medicare is the principal source of federal funds that \ncontributes to the costs of graduate medical education for most \nhospitals, but independent children's hospitals have few Medicare \npatients, since Medicare coverage for children applies only to end-\nstage kidney disease. Medicaid support is declining, as the program \nmoves more and more toward managed care.\n  No hospital in the current competitive marketplace can afford to \nshift these costs to other payers. As a result, many children's \nhospitals find it very difficult to make ends meet.\n  In 1997, all teaching hospitals relieved a $76,000 in Medicare \ngraduate medical education support for each medical resident they \ntrained, but the average independent children's teaching hospital \nreceived only $400.\n  Last year, Children's Hospital in Boston lost over $30 million on its \npatient operations. Two-thirds of this loss was directly attributable \nto the direct costs of graduate medical education. Will limited \nresources and increasing pressure to reduce patient costs, such losses \ncannot continue.\n  The academic mission of these hospitals is vital. Since its founding \nas a 20-bed hospital in 1869, Children's Hospital in Boston has become \nthe largest pediatric medical center and research facility in the \nUnited States, and an international leader in children's health. It is \nalso the primary teaching hospital for pediatrics for Harvard Medical \nSchool. For eight years in a row, it has been named the best pediatric \nhospital in the country in a nationwide physicians' survey conducted by \nU.S. News and World Report.\n  Clinicians and investigators work together at the hospital in an \nenvironment that fosters new discoveries in research and new treatments \nfor patients. Scientific breakthroughs are rapidly translated into \nbetter patient care and enhanced medical education. We must assure that \nmarket pressures to not interfere with these advances.\n  Independent children's hospitals deserve the same strong support that \nother hospitals receive for graduate medical education. The current \nlack of federal support is jeopardizing the indispensable work of these \ninstitutions and jeopardizing the next generation of leaders in \npediatrics.\n\n  Congress needed to do all it can to correct this inequity. This \nlegislation we are introducing will provide stop-gap support stabilize \nthe situation while we develop a fair long-run solution to meet the \noverall needs of all aspects of graduate medical education. I look \nforward to early action by the Senate on this important measure.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Bob \nKerrey, Bond, Kennedy, Durbin and DeWine in introducing the \n``Children's Hospital Education and Research Act of 1998.'' This \nlegislation recognizes the value of supporting medical training. it \nestablishes an interim source of funding for financing residency \ntraining expenses for free-standing children's hospitals until a \npermanent source of funding for all medical education is developed.\n  Medical education is one of America's most precious public resources. \nIt is a public good--a good from which everyone benefits, but for which \nno one is willing to pay. As a public good, explicit and dedicated \nfunding for residency training programs must be secured so that the \nUnited States will continue to lead the world in the quality of its \nhealth care system. This legislation provides for such dedicated \nfunding for residency training programs in children's hospitals.\n  I have introduced legislation--S. 21--which creates a medical \neducation trust fund to support all accredited medical schools and \nteaching hospitals. Additionally, I requested that specific language be \ninserted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 charging the National \nBipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to:\n\n       . . . make recommendations regarding the financing of \n     graduate medical education (GME), including consideration of \n     alternative broad-based sources of funding for such education \n     and funding for institutions not currently eligible for such \n     GME support that conduct approved graduate medical residency \n     programs, such as children's hospitals.\n\n  Children's hospitals have a vitally important mission providing \npatient care, medical training and research in the face of an \nincreasingly competitive health system. I am pleased to support Senator \nKerrey's bill and look forward to working with him and other members of \nthe National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare as we seek \nstable and sufficient funding for medical education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2050. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to prohibit \nmembers of the Armed Forces from entering into correctional facilities \nto present decorations to persons who commit certain crimes before \nbeing presented such decorations; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4528-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4538-S4541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE MILITARY HONORS PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nHonors Preservation Act of 1998 which will ensure that those who have \nserved this nation with distinction will not see their service medals \ndevalued by the crimes of others.\n  This bill simply states that a member of the United States armed \nforces may not enter a federal, state, or local penitentiary for the \npurpose of presenting a medal to a person incarcerated for committing a \nserious violent felony. My hope is that this bill will be seen as it is \nintended: an attempt to secure the well deserved sense of honor of \nthose who have served in our nation's armed forces. Service to our \nnation and the opportunity to receive recognition for that service is a \nduty and a privilege not to be taken lightly.\n  I decided that this legislation was necessary when I heard of the \nunbearable pain suffered by the family of Leah Schendel, a 78-year old \nwoman who was attacked in her Sacramento, California home just before \nChristmas in 1980. Mrs. Schendel was brutally beaten and sexually \nassaulted. This vicious attack caused a massive heart attack that \nkilled her. The man who perpetrated this horrific crime, Manuel \nBabbitt, was convicted and sentenced to die--he is currently sitting on \ndeath row in San Quentin Prison.\n  This past March, the suffering of Mrs. Schendel's family was renewed \nwhen they learned that the man who had so viciously brutalized their \nloved one was being honored by the United States Marine Corps, in San \nQuentin! In a ceremony at the prison, Mr. Babbitt was awarded a Purple \nHeart for injuries he suffered during the Vietnam War. For Mrs. \nSchendel's family, this medal ceremony was a slap in the face. It said \nto them that the government was more concerned with honoring a \nconvicted criminal than respecting the feelings of his victims.\n  I believe that there is no higher calling for an American than to \nserve our nation. I have worked hard to make sure that California \nveterans, who have been overlooked or fallen through the\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\ncracks of the system, get the recognition and benefits they deserve. \nHowever, I believe that someone who, in his or her post-service life, \nshows such a blatant disregard for the laws of this nation and makes a \nmockery of the high standards of the United States military should not \nbe accorded recognition.\n  Just like the right to vote, or the right to a military burial in \nArlington Cemetery, I believe anyone who has committed a heinous crime \nforfeits the right to be honored by the American people. Please join me \nin supporting this bill for the sake of Leah Schendel, and for every \nAmerican veteran who should rightly feel that they are a hero.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a task force to assess activities in \nprevious base closure rounds and to recommend improvements and \nalternatives to additional base closure rounds; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                  BASE CLOSURE TASK FORCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during this past week, I and my colleagues \nhave been working in committee on the defense authorization bill for \nthe upcoming fiscal year. We have debated a host of issues of \nsignificant import to the national security of this great nation, among \nthem the future of the BRAC process.\n  Mr. President, a decade ago, I worked with my good friend from \nGeorgia, Senator Sam Nunn, to formulate legislation that would guide \nthis nation through the base closure process. We understood then that \nthis would be a difficult and, for many communities across this \ncountry, a painful process.\n  In this decade, each of us in this chamber has come to know how \ncommunities in our states had come to rely on the military as the \nmainstay of their economic livelihood. For many communities, a base \nclosure would impart significant economic impact. In some communities a \npositive result, in others a negative impact. No two communities are \nthe same. The challenge to these communities after a base closure was \nthen to reorient their goals and to plan for continued growth and well-\nbeing, or plain survival.\n  I learned a great deal from Senator Nunn during our discussions on \nplanning for base closures. He is a man of great intellect and keen \nforesight and fully understood the possibility that this process could \nbecome politicized. Under our leadership, the committee went to great \nlengths to legislate the appropriate direction, responsibilities and \nnecessary safeguards that might preclude either the executive or \nlegislative branch from manipulating the process for political gain, \nrather than the collective gain of the national security of this \ncountry.\n  The BRAC rounds in 1991 and 1993 were basically free from challenge, \nbut 1995 was a different story--one with which we are all familiar. \nLike many of you, I was truly disappointed that we have come so far \nwith such a degree of success only to have the process, under such a \ndark cloud, break down with confidence lost.\n  So, it is under this cloud that we attempt to continue a discussion \non the necessity of future base closures. The citizens of the \nCommonwealth and my colleagues in this chamber, know my position on \nthis. Like Secretary Cohen and other experts on national security \npolicy, I believe we still have work to do to reduce base \ninfrastructure if we are to continue to meet the rising costs of \nnational security challenges of the coming millennium, particularly \nmodernization.\n  The shadow cast on the process continues to grow--seemingly unabated \nby our remarks, and probably the counsel of Secretary Cohen. I am \nseverely distressed by a recent Defense Department memo which, once \nagain, puts in question the BRAC process.\n  To get this process back on track, I am proposing legislation today \nto form a task force to revise these issues. This task force will be \ncomposed of experts chosen by both the majority and minority from both \nchambers in bipartisan spirit. The charter of the task force will be to \ninvestigate and report to the Congress by March of next year how we \nmight efficiently achieve, without manipulation, the continued \nreduction in military infrastructure.\n  I believe it is important that we assure the American people that a \nfuture base closure can be maintained in the spirit in which I and \nSenator Nunn and our colleagues on the committee has originally \nintended those few years ago. I invite members to join me on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Treasury to redesign the \n$1 bill so as to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of the \nUnited States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of Articles of the \nConstitution on the reverse side of such currency; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                        LIBERTY dollar BILL act\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Liberty \nDollar Bill Act.\n  Recently, the eighth grade students of Liberty Middle School in \nAshland, Virginia came up with an idea. The measure I introduce today \nsimply implements their vision. This bill directs the Treasury to place \non the back of the one dollar bill the actual language from the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Our founding fathers met in 1787, to write what would become the \nmodel for all modern democracies--the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n  Our Constitution is a beacon of light for the world. Shouldn't all \npeople be able to hold up our one dollar bill as a symbol of there \nfreedom of modern democracy worldwide.\n  Washington, Madison, Franklin, Hamilton and many other great \nAmericans met for four months in 1787 to ignite history's greatest \nlight of government.\n  They argued, fought, and compromised to create a lasting democracy, \nbuilt on a philosophy found in the preamble of the constitution. And \nthey protected this philosophy and these ideals by creating three \nbranches of government and divisions of power between the federal and \nstate governments found in the articles and the amendments of the \nConstitution.\n  Three of the men mentioned are on our United States currency, but not \nthe document they put their lives into--not the document they then \nasked Americans to ratify.\n  While our currency celebrates the men who first wrote the \nconstitution, it doesn't celebrate, their most noble achievement, the \nliving document that has been so ably protected while it continues to \nevolve with each new generation.\n  Shouldn't this greatest of American achievements be in the hands of \nall Americans?\n  All Presidents, likewise all public officers, swear to ``preserve, \nprotect and defend'' the constitution.\n  No country can survive if it looses its philosophical moorings. The \nfreedoms and liberties we enjoy give substance, value and meaning to \nthe laws by which we live. Our Nation's philosophy can be taken for \ngranted in the daily business of lawmaking. Yet we can hear in John F. \nKennedy's inaugural address that we do not defend America's laws, we \ndefend its philosophy--a philosophy embodied in the Constitution.\n  Seventy-five percent of Americans say that ``The Constitution is \nimportant to them, makes them proud, and is relevant to their lives.''\n  So important is this document that we built the Archives in \nWashington to house and safeguard it. Hundreds of thousands go there \neach year to see it. However, ninety-four percent of Americans don't \neven know all of the rights and freedoms found in the First Amendment.\n  Sixty-two percent of Americans can't name our three branches of \ngovernment.\n  Six hundred thousand legal immigrants come to America each year. \nOften their first sight of America is the Statute of Liberty, holding \nhigh her torch, symbolizing our light and our freedom. Many of these \nimmigrants become American citizens by the naturalization process and \nlearn more about the Constitution than many natural born citizens\n  If America's most patriotic symbol--the Constitution--were on the \nback of the one dollar bill, wouldn't we all know more about our \nGovernment? And shouldn't we?\n  Shouldn't it be where all Americans can readily read it. Shouldn't \nthe Constitution be on the back of the one dollar bill?\n  Today, I am proud to join my colleague in the House, Chairman Tom \nBliley, and introduce the companion legislation in the Senate. The \nLiberty Dollar Bill Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to \nincorporate the preamble to the Constitution of the United States, the \nBill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of the Constitution on the \nreverse side of the one dollar bill.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the students of Liberty Middle School. \nThe Constitution belongs to the people. It should be in their hands.\n  I want to commend the eighth grade students of Liberty Middle School \nand their teacher, Mr. Randy Wright for their contribution to our \nNation. I hope all my colleagues in the Senate will see the wisdom of \nthese students and join me as a cosponsor of this legislation. Let the \nnation hear that the younger generation can provide ideas that become \nthe laws of our land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Liberty Dollar Bill Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Many Americans are unaware of the provisions of the \n     Constitution of the United States, one of the most remarkable \n     and important documents in world history.\n       (2) A version of this important document, consisting of the \n     preamble, a list of the Articles, and the Bill of Rights, \n     could easily be placed on the reverse side of the $1 Federal \n     reserve note.\n       (3) The placement of this version of the Constitution on \n     the $1 Federal reserve note, a unit of currency used daily by \n     virtually all Americans, would serve to remind people of the \n     historical importance of the Constitution and its impact on \n     their lives today.\n       (4) Americans would be reminded by the preamble of the \n     blessings of liberty, by the Articles, of the framework of \n     the Government, and by the Bill of Rights, of some of the \n     historical changes to the document that forms the very core \n     of the American experience.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDESIGN OF REVERSE SIDE OF THE $1 BILL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5114 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) Liberty Dollar Bills.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In addition to the requirements of \n     subsection (b) (relating to the inclusion of the inscription \n     `In God We Trust' on all United States currency) and the \n     eighth undesignated paragraph of section 16 of the Federal \n     Reserve Act, the design of the reverse side of $1 Federal \n     reserve notes shall incorporate the preamble to the \n     Constitution of the United States, a list of the Articles of \n     the Constitution, and a list of the first 10 amendments to \n     the Constitution.\n       ``(2) Design.--Subject to paragraph (3), the preamble to \n     the Constitution of the United States, the first 10 \n     amendments to the Constitution, and the list of the Articles \n     of the Constitution shall appear on the reverse side of the \n     $1 Federal reserve note, in such form as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate.\n       ``(3) Authority of secretary.--The requirements of this \n     subsection shall not be construed as--\n       ``(A) prohibiting the inclusion of any other inscriptions \n     or material on the reverse side of the $1 Federal reserve \n     note that the Secretary may determine to be necessary or \n     appropriate; or\n       ``(B) limiting any other authority of the Secretary with \n     regard to the design of the $1 Federal reserve note, \n     including the adoption of any design features to deter the \n     counterfeiting of United States currency.''.\n       (b) Date of Application.--The amendment made by subsection \n     (a) shall apply to $1 Federal reserve notes that are first \n     placed into circulation after December 31, 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

GROSVENOR CENTER OF GEOGRAPHIC EDUCATION\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the dedication of the Gilbert M. Grosvenor Center \nof Geographic Education at Southwest Texas State University.\n  Located near the Texas Hill Country in San Marcos, Texas, Southwest \nTexas opened its doors 95 years ago to 330 students. Today, Southwest \nTexas is a major, innovative university with a growing student \npopulation of over 21,000. During its history, Southwest Texas \ngraduates have distinguished themselves in numerous career fields, \nincluding research and teaching. Today, Southwest Texas builds upon \nthis legacy of success and commitment to higher education by dedicating \nthe new Grosvenor Center.\n  The university has distinguished itself nationally in the area of \ngeographic research and education. In fact, Southwest Texas's \nDepartment of Geography and Planning has been recognized as the best \nundergraduate geography program in the nation by the Journal of \nGeography, the Association of American Geographers, and a national \nProgram Effectiveness survey. Southwest Texas has the largest geography \ndepartment in the country with 590 undergraduate and 165 graduate \nstudents.\n  Southwest Texas is the home of the Texas Alliance for Geographic \nEducation, which is one of the premier geography alliances in the \nnation, according to the National Geographic Society. The Alliance has \nmore than 5,000 teachers as members. It has sponsored numerous \ngeography institutes and workshops for educators and has led efforts to \ngenerate participation in Geography Awareness Week. The Alliance is a \nstrong supporter of the Texas Geography Bee, which is a statewide \ncompetition for young people to test their geographic knowledge before \nadvancing on to the national contest.\n  Not surprisingly, Southwest Texas has chosen to name its new Center \nfor Geographic Education after Gil Grosvenor, Chairman of the Board of \nTrustees of the National Geographic Society. With this decision, \nSouthwest Texas salutes Mr. Grosvenor's outstanding leadership in the \ndrive to improve education in the field of geography. His\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\npioneering work to advance Geography Awareness Week, the Geography Bee, \nand state geography alliances, has dramatized the need for quality \ngeography education in America's classrooms.\n  I want to commend Mr. Grosvenor for his lifetime commitment to the \nadvancement and dissemination of geographic knowledge and \nunderstanding. Under the leadership of Gil Grosvenor, National \nGeographic has done more to make geography alive and interesting than \nany other organization. We all owe Mr. Grosvenor and the National \nGeographic Society a huge debt of gratitude for their tremendous \ncontributions over the years.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of geographers from across the country will \nconverge on the Southwest Texas campus today to inaugurate the new \nCenter. Lady Bird Johnson is also an expected guest, along with elected \nofficials and many alumni from the Department of Geography and \nPlanning. In the evening, Mr. Grosvenor will serve as a special guest \nat a dinner in the ballroom of the LBJ Student Center. On Friday, Mr. \nGrosvenor will have the honor and distinction of delivering the 1st \nAnnual Grosvenor Lecture at the Alkek Library Teaching Theater on \ncampus. Mr. Grosvenor is expected to focus his address on the critical \nimportance of providing quality geography education in America's \nschools.\n  It is with great pleasure that I join in the celebration of the \ndedication of Southwest Texas's new Grosvenor Center. I congratulate \nall those involved in making this effort a reality and ensuring that \ngeography education plays an important and integral role in the \nclassrooms of today, as well as tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4547-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           L.F. ``TOW'' DIEHM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today and ask my \ncolleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family and loved \nones of one of New Mexico's most outstanding citizens, L.F. ``Tow'' \nDiehm, who died last week. Mr. Diehm leaves a proud and indelible \nlegacy for his family, profession, and community. He spent his \nprofessional life dedicated to athletics in New Mexico, and while he \nwill be missed, his reputation will live on.\n  Tow came to the University of New Mexico in 1957 and held the job of \nathletic trainer for 31 years. As friends and family will attest, Tow \nwas a man who never forgot that the young student athletes in his \ncharge were people. Throughout his 31 years, not a day went by when Tow \ndid not touch the lives of the people around him. As a gesture to Tow \nof respect and affection, the University of New Mexico named its new \nathletic complex after him when it was completed in 1997. Indeed, the \nhonors that were bestowed on Tow throughout his life were numerous: he \nis a member of the University of New Mexico Athletic Hall of Honor, the \nHelms Trainers Hall of fame, and in 1980, he became the first person, \nwho was not an athlete or a coach, ever inducted into the Albuquerque \nHall of Fame.\n  Whether generating funding for the athletic department or acting as a \nconfidante to the many student athletes he helped every day, Mr. Diehm \ndid everything in his life, personal and professional, with honor and \nintegrity. His influence on athletes, his colleagues and friends, to \nsay nothing of his family, is immeasurable. The standard of excellence \nthat he embodied will live on in each life that he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4548-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DISABLED HIKERS FROM IDAHO ATTEMPT MT.

These Idahoans are attempting to climb Mt. \nEverest. Only a handful of people have climbed the mountain over the \nyears and succeeded. Others have failed in their attempt, but very few \npeople have ever tried to climb the mountain at all. It is a challenge \nthat could mean death at every turn. For this group of Idahoans, \nhowever, the climb means life around every corner.\n  The climbers are all physically disabled. These disabled trekkers are \naffiliated with the Cooperative Wilderness Handicapped Outdoor Group at \nIdaho State University, affectionately known as HOGs. This group's \nphilosophy is, ``Hey, just because you're disabled, it doesn't mean \nthat your life is over.'' And they are proving exactly that. The \ngroup's journey is being documented on the internet, so that updates on \ntheir progress can be found frequently. On their website they write, \n``Disabled people are ignored, not really discriminated against, but \nignored. I've seen families where a relative is newly disabled and they \ndidn't let him do anything. This at first is a well-meaning attitude, \nbut later it effectively takes a disabled person's power away to make \nchoices. We're making a choice with this Everest Trek. It's going to be \nreally hard, but we are going to give it our best.''\n  Disability comes in different forms for the participants. Kyle \nPacker, an Idaho State University student of the year, has Cerebral \nPalsy. Isaac Gayfield set many Idaho State University track records. He \nnow has Degenerative Bone Disease. Tom McCurdy is an Idaho State \nUniversity student who happens to be a paraplegic. Steve DeRoche is a \nweight lifting coach and a double amputee. Sheila Brashears lost a leg \nto cancer. Carla Yustak, who has Cerebral Palsy, is an Olympic trainee \nfor cycling when she isn't climbing mountains.\n  And then there is Tom Whittaker. The founder of the CW-HOG \norganization, Tom lost his foot in an automobile accident in 1979, \nshortly after finishing his Masters degree at Idaho State University. \nAn avid outdoor adventurer, Tom felt as if his life had come to an \nend--but he overcame his disability, and then some. Now a professor of \nadventure education at Prescott College in Arizona, Tom is poised to \nbecome the first amputee to stand on the summit of Everest. While the \nrest of the team plans to end its journey upon reaching the base camp \nof the summit, Tom will travel the final stage to the peak as the sole \ndisabled participant.\n  I want to personally congratulate this group for their efforts so \nfar. They are expected to reach the base camp today and Tom is set to \nreach the summit later this month. It is indeed a defining moment for \ndisabled people in America and around the world.\n  Mr. President, let me share what was written about Tom Whittaker in \nhis online profile: ``* * * [he] reminds us, when setbacks occur in our \npersonal and professional lives, it is not the falling down, but the \ngetting back up that matters. The essence, in the heart of the American \nDream, is not money, status or power, but the freedom to dream and the \ncourage to embrace those dreams--for all people. As a people, we love \nto compete and we love to win. But more than anything, Americans \napplaud the grit and spirit it takes to get back up and finish the \nrace.''\n  In closing, I want to recognize their spirit today. It is my hope \nthat everyone who hears their message might be inspired to face and \nconquer their own challenges, and by so doing, become not only better \npersons but better Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4548-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4548-S4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate engaged in a \nparticularly important debate about the expansion of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  I particularly want to commend the leadership and dedication of my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith. Senator Smith managed this \nimportant legislation on the floor with great competence, and the \npeople of Oregon should be proud of how he handled this difficult \nassignment. Despite my colleague's persuasive efforts, however, I have \ndecided to oppose this treaty.\n  Mr. President, a new era in world affairs demands new forms of \ninternational cooperation. There is indeed a clear and immediate \nimperative to bring the new democracies of Eastern Europe into the \nfamily of freedom-loving nations.\n  What is less clear is that the best way to do this is through the new \nmilitary alliance proposed by this treaty. My reservations about this \ntreaty are\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nthree, and I would like to outline them briefly.\n  First, the treaty redefines NATO's fundamental mission from \nprotecting against a known threat into something much more nebulous. \nThe initial purpose of this alliance was to contain communism and \nstaunch the threat of the Soviet Union spreading its sphere of \ninfluence over the entire continent. With four decades of sound \nleadership, consistent vision, and unflinching strength, the alliance \nsucceeded in that endeavor, bringing the West safely through the Cold \nWar, and allowing the people of Eastern Europe to finally reassert \ntheir long-suppressed desire for freedom.\n  But what is NATO's role in a new environment, with the Soviet Union \nrelegated to history? I don't think that question has been sufficiently \ndebated, or an answer sufficiently defined, for us to be rushing into \nthis expansion. Is there really some strategic end that would be served \nby the United States pledging to treat any conflagration in the \nturbulent realm of Eastern Europe as an attack against our own \nsovereignty?\n  It may well be that there are circumstances in which the cause of \nworld peace and security would be best served by an American commitment \nto turn back an aggressor or defend a fragile democracy. But in the \nabsence of a well-defined threat or clearly articulated strategic \nmission, it is hard to see how this expansion of NATO is anything other \nthan a gamble that an institution created for one purpose is equally \nsuited for the yet-to-be-determined purposes of a new time.\n  Second, I believe that this expansion will have a deleterious effect \non our relationship with Russia. At this critical time--when what was \nonce our most formidable adversary stands at a delicate point between \nthe continued climb toward democracy and freedom on the one side, and a \nfall backwards into heavily-armed nationalism on the other--I'm \nespecially troubled that this proposed NATO expansion will push future \nRussian leaders in the wrong direction.\n  As the end of this century approaches, Russia is still in possession \nof one of the world's most powerful military arsenals. A Russia with \nreborn territorial designs on her neighbors is the greatest imaginable \npotential threat to European stability and security.\n  That is why it is so vital that we seek ratification and \nimplimentation of the START II treaty with Russia, which would actually \nreduce the size of its nuclear arsenal. The Russian Duma has so far \nrefused to take this step, but appears to be moving in that direction. \nIf they interepret this expansion, however, as a hostile gesture in \ntheir direction, they may well refuse to ratify, leaving us all less \nsafe than we might otherwise have been.\n  The United States has made tremendous strides in our relationship \nwith Russia since the fall of the Soviet system. American diplomacy now \nshould be focused on consolidating those gains, and finding ways to \nhelp Russia complete its transition to democracy. Many experts in our \nown country, as well as many of the most credible pro-Western leaders \nin Russia itself, have warned us that expanding NATO could inflame \nnationalist passions, and lead to a turning away from the path of \ndemocracy and peaceful relations. That would be the most disastrous of \nunintended consequences, and must give us pause as we consider this \nstep.\n  Third, the cost of this initiative is anyone's guess, and must compel \nus to caution as well, particularly considering that the United States \nalready pays a disproportionate share of NATO's costs. If NATO \nexpansion were vital to our national security, then our country would \nbe resolved to pay any price, in President Kennedy's timeless phrase. \nBut we live in a fundamentally different time, one in which each \ncountry's security is determined as much by the quality of its schools \nand the cleanliness of its air and water than by the might of its \narmies and navies. Committing to an expanded military alliance which \nmay entail far greater costs than the Administration has estimated \ncould diminish our ability to make the investments that will make us \nsafer and stronger.\n  The Senate had an opportunity, through the amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin, to gain a better sense of the size of this financial \ncommitment. I strongly supported that effort. Unfortunately, it did not \nprevail, and we are left with burning questions about the size of the \nfinancial commitment entailed by this treaty, and the effect that will \nhave on our ability to address those domestic priorities which make us \nstronger as a nation.\n  What is true for us is true for these struggling new democracies as \nwell. As Senator Moynihan has pointed out so wisely, these countries \nare under no immediate threat. Their most pressing challenge is the \ndevelopment of growing economies, and the institutions of democracy. \nBut if they join NATO, these struggling nations will be required to \nspend billions on the latest in military hardware instead of making \ncritically needed investments in areas that lead to long-term benefit: \ninfrastructure, education, environmental health, and many others.\n  Decades of a failed communist system left these countries in economic \nruin. I believe it is a testament to their energy and determination \nthat they are slowly overcoming this legacy and building up new, \nvibrant free market economies. We should, in the name of international \nsecurity, be doing everything possible to help them through this \ntransition.\n  I do not believe that anyone has properly assessed the impact that \njoining NATO, and making the necessary investments to participate in \nthat military alliance, will have on our Eastern European friends' \nability to continue a successful transition to market economics. And I \ndo not believe we should jump pell-mell into such an enlargement until \nwe have done so.\n  The democratization of Eastern Europe is an exciting and hopeful \ndevelopment. As a child of the Cold War, I am awed by the transitions \nwe have seen. The United States has a special responsibility to nurture \nfreedom wherever it is seeking to plant its roots. But in the final \nanalysis, it is not clear that extending NATO membership to Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic is the best way to do it.\n  In this case, the burden of proof is on the proponents. We should not \ntake so solemn a step as committing American lives to the protection of \nanother country unless we are absolutely certain, beyond any doubt, \nthat it is the wisest of possible courses. I remain unconvinced, and so \nI opposed the measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4548-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4549-S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \nRes. 223, which I introduced yesterday on behalf of myself and Senator \nStevens. Our resolution recognizes the Prince William Sound Community \nCollege and its celebration of its twentieth anniversary this Sunday, \nMay 10, 1988.\n  This is a notable milestone for the College and for the people of the \nCopper Basin Area. Prince William Sound Community College was \nestablished in 1976 as a Learning Center set up by the University of \nAlaska. It earned community college status just two years later. In \n1987, the University of Alaska merged all community colleges in the \nstate into the university system; however, due to overwhelming support \nfrom the local community of Valdez, Prince William Sound Community \nCollege remained the only individually accredited community college in \nthe University of Alaska system.\n  Today, after 20 years, the student body of the college has grown to \nnearly 2,000 students, and the college is a recognized leader in the \nUniversity of Alaska system.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Prince William Sound Community College \nfor its 20 years of exceptional service to the people of Alaska and \nlook forward to many more years of growth and contributions to the \nculture and economy of Alaska.\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator Murkowski as a co-\nsponsor of this Senate resolution commending the Prince William Sound \nCommunity College, which is located in Valdez, Alaska, as it celebrates \nits twentieth anniversary.\n  In 1971, concerned citizens of Valdez and in the neighboring town of \nCordova petitioned the University of Alaska to establish extension \noffices in each of these communities. In 1976, a Learning Center was \nestablished in this area.\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nCommunity college status was granted in 1978 and the centers officially \nbecame known as Prince William Sound Community College.\n  In 1989, the College received accreditation from the Commission on \nColleges of the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and has \nmaintained that status. Since that date, the College has established \nseveral new programs, such as the Prince William Sound Community \nCollege Theater Conference, which attracts nationally-known dramatists; \nthe Industrial Safety/Marine Response Training Department; a wellness \ncenter; and a television station.\n  The University of Alaska merged all community colleges into the \nuniversity system in 1987. Prince William Sound Community College has \nremained the only individually-accredited community college in the \nsystem because of the continuing strong support from the City of \nValdez. The University of Alaska's Board of Regents has recognized the \ngrowth and accomplishment of the College by approving several new \ndegree and certificate programs.\n  In twenty years of existence, Prince William Sound Community College \nhas developed into a recognized leader in the University of Alaska \nsystem and continues to serve Prince William Sound and the Cooper Basin \narea as a comprehensive community college intent on life-long learning.\n  I urge other Senators to help us pass this resolution to commend the \nPrince William Sound Community College for these accomplishments in \nconjunction for these accomplishments in conjunction with its 20th \nanniversity on May 10, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4549-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THANKING OUR NATION'S CORRECTIONS OFFICERS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank our \nnation's Corrections Officers for their selfless dedication to \nrehabilitating those members of our society who have strayed from the \npath of the just. I would especially like to recognize the 5,500 \nmembers of the New Jersey State Corrections Officers Association whose \ndaily work allows our children to grow in an environment unfettered by \ncriminal elements. These courageous men and women risk their lives on a \ndaily basis and deserve to be recognized for their efforts on our \nbehalf.\n  Although Corrections Officers play a critical role in safeguarding \nour communities from convicted felons, they receive very little public \nrecognition for their work. When a felon is apprehended the police \nreceive the credit for the arrest and the prosecuting attorney is \npraised for proving the felon's guilt. Juries are hailed as courageous \nand the judges imposing sentences are lauded for their commitment to \njustice. Once the trial process is completed and a felon is convicted, \nthat person goes to prison and is forgotten by mainstream society. \nHowever, Corrections Officers are not allowed to forget because they \ndeal with convicted felons on a daily basis. From rehabilitating to \nguarding those people who have forfeited their rights to live in our \ncommunities, Corrections Officers find themselves in high risk \nsituations every day.\n  In a society that believes in the fundamental importance of law and \norder, it is important to remember the people who help those principles \nflourish. By ensuring that inmates are rehabilitated before re-entering \nour communities, Corrections Officers are disciplinarians and teachers. \nThey impose the will of the people while teaching criminals about the \nneed to adhere to the law. Clearly, there are formidable obstacles to \nthese endeavors, and I am continually impressed by the way these \nofficers persevere in spite of the difficulties they encounter. In a \ncriminal justice system that places an ever increasing amount of \npressure on Corrections Officers to be infallible, they maintain a \nconsistently positive and professional attitude towards their jobs.\n  The men and women who work as Corrections Officers in our nation's \nprisons should be celebrated for their commitment to their communities. \nI am privileged to recognize their efforts and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4550-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF REVEREND TED B. COMBS\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to \nReverend Ted B. Combs who recently stepped down as Pastor of the Oak \nRidge Baptist Church. For 27 years, Reverend Combs faithfully led his \ncongregation and selflessly gave to his community. His wife, Doris, and \nhe have dedicated their lives to the service of God.\n  Oak Ridge Baptist Church is located in Wilkes County, North Carolina, \nin the western part of the state. Reverend Combs was born and raised in \nthese parts not far from the church that he would one day pastor. He \nhas been an integral part of the community since attending the local \nhigh school, Mountain View. As an adult in Wilkes County, Reverend \nCombs has served the community in numerous positions including board \nmember of the Wilkes County Nursing Home and honorary member of \nMountain View Ruritan.\n  The greatest testament, however, to Reverend Combs' stature in and \nrespect among the community is given through those that live there. \nWilkes County has a population of a little more than 60,000 citizens, \nand one would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn't speak kindly of \nReverend Combs. His work in Wilkes County has touched the lives of so \nmany.\n  I'm proud to recognize the achievement of Reverend Ted B. Combs \nbefore the United States Senate and privileged to call him a fellow \nNorth Carolinian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4550-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4550-S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MILITARY HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of my proudest honors as a United \nStates Senator is to serve as the Ranking Member on the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is in this \ncapacity that I feel I can contribute to supporting the men and women \nin our Armed Forces.\n  Last week I introduced a military health care proposal which I \nreferred to as KP Duty, as in ``Keeping Promises Duty.'' In the \nmilitary, KP stands for ``kitchen police'' which is a term for messhall \nclean up which recruits are tasked to do when they go through basic \ntraining. This KP duty I am proposing is for all of us to clean up a \ncommitment--the promises made to our servicemen and women.\n  The Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) \nincluded a Sense of the Congress Resolution which provided a finding \nthat ``many retired military personnel believe that they were promised \nlifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service.'' \nFurthermore, it expressed the sense of Congress that ``the United \nStates has incurred a moral obligation'' to provide health care to \nmembers and retired members of the Armed Services and that Congress and \nthe President should take steps to address ``the problems associated \nwith the availability of health care for such retirees within two \nyears.'' I authored that resolution, and today in year one of this two-\nyear challenge, my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, Chairman \nof the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nand I are ready to take the initial steps in fulfilling this obligation \nto our retirees.\n  In March, I hosted a military health care roundtable at Fort Gordon, \nGeorgia. The positive and supportive working relationship between the \nEisenhower Army Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Medical \nCenter in Augusta, Georgia was highlighted by the panel speakers and \naudience members. These facilities have established a sharing agreement \nwhich allows each to provide certain health care services to the \nbeneficiaries of the other. This type of joint approach has the \npotential to alleviate a significant portion of the accessibility \nproblem faced by military retirees, especially given the reduction in \nDoD medical treatment facilities. In spite of these benchmarked efforts \nin cooperative care, beneficiaries who were in the audience still \nattested to insufficient accessibility to resources to meet their \nneeds. One of the audience participants who was commenting on a health \nproblem stated, ``my life isn't the same as it was a year ago, and all \nI got was shuttled from one thing to another''.\n  In a statement I submitted last week, I discussed a legislative \ninitiative which would require the Department of Defense (DoD) and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to work toward enhancing their \ncooperative efforts in the\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\ndelivery of health care to the beneficiaries of these systems. This \ninitiative includes several elements to enhance health care \nefficiencies. It provides for a study which would determine the \ndemographics, geographic distribution and health care preferences and \nan assessment of the overall capacity of both systems to \ntreat beneficiaries. The second provision would examine existing \nstatutory, regulatory and cultural impediments that are currently \nprecluding the optimal cooperation of DoD and VA in health care \ndelivery. Finally, this initiative provides for the acceleration of \nseveral ongoing efforts such as the Electronic Transfer of Patient \nInformation and the DoD/VA Federal Pharmaceutical Steering Committee. \nThis legislative initiative was included in the Fiscal Year 1999 \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n\n  The legislation I wish to discuss today addresses the retirees who \nare aged 65 and older. The Government Accounting Office reports that of \nthe population eligible for military health care, approximately 52% are \nretirees and dependents. Seventy one percent of military retirees are \nunder the age of 65, while 29% of military retirees are aged 65 and \nolder.\n  As we consider options for improving the DoD and VA health care \nsystems, we need to be mindful of some basic facts. About 60% of \nretirees under the age of 65 live near a military treatment facility \nwhile only about 52% the retirees aged 65 and older live near such a \nfacility. About two thirds of retirees under the age of 65 use the \nmilitary health system. In comparison, only about a quarter of the \nretirees aged 65 and older use military medical facilities, and then \nonly on a space available basis and primarily for pharmacy services.\n  According to a 1994-95 survey of DoD beneficiaries, just over 40 \npercent of military retirees, regardless of age, had private health \ninsurance coverage. About a third of retirees aged 65 and older also \nreported having additional insurance to supplement their Medicare \nbenefits. This is in part, due to their belief that the military health \ncare system would take care of their needs throughout their lifetime.\n  The Military Health System has changed dramatically in recent years. \nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Warsaw Pact led to \na major reassessment of U.S. defense policy. The DoD health care system \nchanges have included the establishment of a managed care program, \nnumerous facility closures, and significant downsizing of military \nmedical staff. In the last decade, the number of military medical \npersonnel has declined by 15 percent and the number of military \nhospitals has been reduced by one-third. The Fiscal Year 1994 National \nDefense Authorization Act directed DoD to prescribe and implement a \nnationwide managed health care benefit program modeled on health \nmaintenance organization plans and in 1995, beneficiaries began \nenrolling in this new program called TRICARE. With over 8 million \nbeneficiaries, it is the largest health maintenance organization plan \nin the Nation.\n  One of the problems with TRICARE is what happens to retirees when \nthey reach the age of 65. At that point, they are no longer eligible to \nparticipate in any TRICARE option. The law currently provides for \ntransition from military health care to Medicare for these \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this is not the right solution, especially given the \nfact that Medicare does not currently reimburse the DoD for health care \nservices, although Congress recently authorized a test of this concept, \nnor does Medicare include a pharmacy benefit. In addition, as the \nmilitary begins to close and downsize military treatment facilities, \nretirees aged 65 and older are unable to obtain treatment on a space \navailable basis. These retirees are, in effect, being shut out of the \nmedical facilities promised to them.\n\n  The Medicare Subvention demonstration project that is scheduled to \nbegin enrollment in the near future will only benefit retirees who live \nnear military treatment facilities--which is only about half of all \nretirees. Those retirees living outside catchment areas won't even \nbenefit from subvention. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to \ninitiate a Veterans Affairs Subvention test. The limiting criteria of \nthese tests is that they require beneficiaries to live near the \nrespective treatment facilities. To accommodate those beneficiaries who \ndo not live near treatment facilities or within a catchment area, we \nmust explore other alternatives, including, the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program (FEHBP) option that has received so much \nattention recently.\n  There has been an overwhelming outpouring of support for offering \nFEHBP to military retirees. Although this program has achieved a \nsuccessful reputation among federal employees, it is a very costly \nalternative which deserves close scrutiny, along with other health care \noptions. I appreciate the fact that there are many advantages to FEHBP. \nFurthermore, I share the view that health care for military retirees \nshould be at least as good as the health care we in the Congress afford \nourselves.\n  However, there may be other options, or a combination of options that \nwill allow us to keep our promises with our older retirees in a \nfiscally responsible manner. The option I am about to discuss is \nincluded in the Fiscal Year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act. \nSenator Dirk Kempthorne, Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked closely on this \nissue over the past several months. Under his leadership, the Personnel \nSubcommittee held hearings on this issue which included testimony by \nthe service Surgeons Generals, the Acting Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Health Affairs, and representatives from military \nassociations. Together, we have developed a plan to assist the Nation \nin meeting our obligation to the military retirees.\n  This legislation requires demonstrations to be conducted of three \nhealth care options: the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \n(FEHBP), TRICARE Standard (which replaced the Civilian Health and \nMedical Program of the Uniformed Services or CHAMPUS), and Mail Order \nPharmacy. Two different sites will be selected for each of the \nrespective demonstrations.\n  Through FEHBP, military retirees could choose from different plan \noptions. As with active and retired federal employees, military \nretirees who enrolled would be required to pay a premium. The amount of \nthe premium would vary depending on which plan was chosen and the \ngovernment and beneficiary share in the cost of the selected plan.\n  The TRICARE Standard option would be to extend the current coverage \nbeyond age 64. Under this extension, the TRICARE Standard would serve \nas a supplemental policy to Medicare, covering most out-of-pocket costs \nnot covered by Medicare. Even though this proposal would require \nretirees to enroll in Medicare part B, retirees should experience lower \nout-of-pocket costs. Because TRICARE Standard is an established program \nwithin DoD, the existing infrastructure could be used without \nsignificant increase in administrative costs.\n\n  Finally, the Medicare program does not provide coverage for \noutpatient prescriptions, a major expense for older people, who tend to \nuse more prescription drugs. Military retirees can get prescriptions \nfilled at military treatment facility pharmacies, but these facilities \nare not readily accessible to all older retirees. Expanding this mail \norder benefit to those who do not live near military facilities and do \nnot currently have a mail order benefit would fill an important health \ncare coverage gap. This would be the third demonstration.\n  The demonstrations will be scheduled to conclude within the same time \nframe as the ongoing Medicare Subvention test, approximately January 1, \n2001, so all the test results can be simultaneously compared in \ndetermining the best option or combination of options to accommodate \nthe retirees aged 65 and older.\n  Mr. President, as you know, S. 1334, a bill to provide for a test of \nFEHBP has 60 cosponsors. We agree that FEHBP warrants further \nexamination which is why we have included it in the Committee's \nlegislative proposal. We are very committed to finding the right \nsolution to this shortcoming which is why we feel that evaluating \nseveral options is critical in this decision process.

Mr. President, President Clinton's ultimatum to Israel \nregarding proposals to withdrawal from the West Bank to secure the \npeace process is wrong and should be abandoned. What business is it of \nthe United States to give an ultimatum to a democratically elected \npeople regarding their own security interest? We should not publicly \npressure an ally to violate their own security assessment. This is not \na matter for Washington to decide, but rather for the Israeli people to \ndecide.\n  The deadline imposed on Israel by the Administration removes any \nincentive for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to negotiate. The \nUnited States should encourage direct negotiation, not dictate the \nagenda. We need to exercise patience to reach a lasting peace, not risk \nIsraeli security.\n  Mr. President, the Middle East peace process is taking place in a \ncomplex environment; caution--not irresponsible bravado--is required. \nThere is no question that everyone involved wants peace in the Middle \nEast. Yet, we must ask if our current actions are leading Israel and \nthe Palestinian people toward security and freedom, or further from it. \nPutting pressure upon the people of Israel, forcing them to violate \ntheir own security needs, works against peace.\n  The Middle East continues to be defined by suspicion, hatred, and a \ncontinuing arms race. Terrorism's presence can be felt everywhere-- in \nthe markets and in the streets and cafes. And while much of the Arab \nworld enters modernity, liberalizing economies and governments, radical \nIslamic extremism also grows. Anti-Semitism and the anti-Israeli \nrefrain has not yet ceased to be heard through the souks and bazaars of \nthe Middle East. This hatred is unfortunately a very real, very \nfrightening, part of daily existence for the Israeli people.\n  Over the past several months of bipartisan discussions and personal \ndialogue with the administration, I've concluded two things. First, \nAmerica can continue to play a vital role in the peace process, but our \nrole must be limited to mediator and facilitator. Second, in spite of \nthis administration's good intentions, the United States is currently \ntrying to lead the talks toward a false goal--the Israelis understand \nthis and resist. The President must understand that peace through \nultimatum may get him an agreement, but an agreement which may provide \na risky and false peace.\n  A lasting and secure peace represents the only worthy goal. And if \nthis means that we wait and demonstrate patience and not arrogance, \nthen we should. The U.S. will eagerly take a share of the credit for a \nsuccessful agreement, but we must remember--we do not pay the price of \nfailure. The price of failure will be paid by the Palestinian and \nIsraeli people, who will continue to live in fear of another bus \nbombing in the city center, of their children being targeted in buses \nand cafes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4552-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join those in \nthis Chamber and around the globe who have spiritually linked arms to \ncelebrate the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the State of \nIsrael. I am particularly happy to see that the people of my own \nhometown of Stamford, Connecticut have seen fit to join in the \ninternational chorus of voices commemorating this milestone.\n  After the horrors of the Holocaust, the establishment of the State of \nIsrael represented a significant turning point. The world community \ndenounced an endemic hatred that had led to the decimation of a people \nand in doing so, set the stage for the renaissance of a culture that \nhad been without a home for nearly two thousand years. The time of \ntribulation had passed and Jews were, at long last, reunited with their \nancestral homeland.\n  Israel and the Old City of Jerusalem represent both the current state \nof humanity and the heights to which we can aspire. We have been taught \nthat long ago, Israel was a gift to Abraham and his descendants, a \ntoken of thanks for his faithfulness. Since that time, Judaism, \nChristianity, and Islam have each governed this land and each religion \nhas developed a spiritual stake in the land. These religions have lived \nin neighboring and even overlapping communities for half a century, yet \npeace and security have remained elusive. We have recently begun to see \nthe first opportunities for a lasting peace. When this opportunity is \nfully realized, Israel will truly stand as both symbol and reality that \nthe forces that bind us together are far greater than the forces that \nseek to divide us.\n  The Jewish Community Center in Stamford will be holding its \ncelebration on May 17, 1998. I am happy to join them and the millions \nof others who have lifted their voices in commemoration of this very \nimportant landmark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4552-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE UNITED JEWISH FEDERATION OF STAMFORD ON ITS 25TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this month, the world's eyes are on \nthe State of Israel as it celebrates the 50th Anniversary of its \nindependence. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and \npraise the people of Israel on this historic occasion.\n  Many centuries ago, Isaiah prophesied that Israel would become ``a \nlight unto the nations.'' Today, Israel's light is shining brightly--\nnot only for its citizens, but for people throughout the world. This \nnation arose from the ashes of the Holocaust and has given the Jewish \npeople of the world a permanent homeland.\n  The modern State of Israel has faced many obstacles in its short \nlife, but it has survived them all, and in fact excelled in spite of \nthem. Its population has grown from 600,000 in 1948 to nearly 6 million \ntoday as it has absorbed waves of immigrants from all over the globe. \nIt is a vibrant democracy, with free and open elections and a free \npress. Despite a shortage of natural resources and many other \nobstacles, it has developed a thriving economy. And from this small \nnation, we have seen countless acclaimed writers, artists, and \nmusicians.\n  Israel has also shared a special relationship with the United States. \nOver the years, our nations have stood together to preserve Israel's \nsafety and security, and I want to take this opportunity to join my \nfellow Americans in pledging our continued support for this trusted \nally.\n  This is also a time of celebration for members of the American Jewish \npopulation. Festivities are being held all across the country, and in \nmy state of Connecticut, the United Jewish Federation and the Jewish \nCommunity Center of Stamford will hold a community-wide festival to \ncommemorate the 50th anniversary on Sunday, May 17th. There will \nactually be another special event in Stamford the previous Thursday.\n  On May 14th, the United Jewish Federation of Stamford will celebrate \nits 25th Anniversary. Throughout the years, the UJF has played a vital \nrole in building and maintaining a sense of unity among Stamford's \nJewish community. They have helped to promote and enrich Jewish life in \nthe area by coordinating educational, social and philanthropic \nactivities. They have also worked to defend the political and religious \nrights of the Jewish people, not only in Connecticut, but around the \nNation, in Israel, and throughout the world.\n  The UJF of Stamford's stated mission is to create a community based \non the Jewish ideal of ``tzedakah'': charity, righteousness and social \njustice. Well, I would say that their works and actions have clearly \nembodied these three principles. I want to personally thank them for \nall that they have done to strengthen and improve both their community \nand our state, and I offer my sincere congratulations to them on this \njoyous anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4552-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4552-S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the President, Vice \nPresident, and my colleagues in Congress in recognizing the significant \ncontribution of all public employees to our Nation's well-being. This \nweek,\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nfrom May 4 through May 10, is Public Service Recognition Week and today \nbegins a three-day celebration of events on the Mall designed to \nhighlight the creative, innovative and effective government programs \nserving Americans across the country.\n  I am indeed proud to bring special attention to the dedicated \nindividuals who have chosen public service as a career and who, through \nyears of hard work, have helped to contribute to our Nation's growth \nand prosperity. Their important work includes protecting our Nation, \nkeeping our food supply safe, participating in medical and scientific \nresearch, and maintaining highway and air safety.\n  The excellent service provided by Federal employees often goes \nunrecognized and it is only when these services become necessary for an \nindividual or when the services are unavailable--as we experienced just \ntwo years ago during the shutdown of the Federal government--that \npeople truly appreciate the importance of Federal employees. It is with \nthis in mind that I want to again thank and praise the millions of men \nand women in the Federal workforce who perform these important jobs \nevery day.\n  I view public service as an honorable career and a high calling, and \nI am proud that our Government has such a conscientious and highly \nqualified workforce. Despite previous attempts to undervalue the ideals \nwhich make public service rewarding and attractive to many, Federal \nemployees continue to work positively and responsibly, while \naccomplishing many vital tasks. President Kennedy once stated:\n\n       Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And \n     let every man and woman who works in any area of our nation \n     government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with \n     pride and honor in future years: 'I served the United States \n     Government in that hour of our Nation's need.\n\n  The Nation has unquestionably benefitted from the many wonderful \nachievements of Federal employees. In setting aside this week to \nacknowledge our Nation's public servants, we all have an opportunity to \ngive these employees the thanks and recognition they so greatly \ndeserve. I am very pleased to extend my appreciation to such a worthy \nan committed group of men and women and encourage them to continue in \ntheir efforts on behalf of all Americans. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4552-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WE THE PEOPLE . . .

The Citizen and the Constitution. This program, \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the \nDepartment of Education, is the most extensive educational program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.

I \nam proud to recognize the distinguished members of the class \nrepresenting New Jersey:\n  Mian Amy, Michael Carr, Daniel Cohen, Michael Cohen, Stacie Dubin, \nAndrea Feit, Naomi Finkelstein, Christian Forsythe, Hillary Gallanter, \nGina Gancheva, Heather Gershen, Brett Gursky, Denise Heitzenroder, \nRachel Katz, Terry Lin, Jonathan Meer, George Mossad, Amanda Rosen, \nJoel Pruce, Niyati Shah, Naseer Siddique, Michael Sturm, Robert \nThompson, Howard Wachtel, Ari Waldman, Jamie Yonks, Joanna Young.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, John Calimano, who \ndeserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district \ncoordinator, Robert Strangia, and the state coordinator, Evelyn \nTaraszkiewicz also contributed a significant amount of time and effort \nto help the class win the national finals.\n  I commend these constitutional experts for their great \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/07/senate-section/article/S4553-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               APPOINTMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
