Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nretiring colleague from Arkansas, Senator Dale Bumpers. Arkansas is a \nState with a small population, and it is a State where politicians of \neven opposing political parties and philosophies find their lives and \ncareers intersecting and intertwining.\n  As a high school student, I followed Dale Bumpers' meteoric rise from \nan unknown country lawyer from Charleston, AR, to the Governor of the \nState and a man who became known in Arkansas politics as the giant \nkiller, defeating such luminaries of Arkansas politics as Win \nRockefeller and J.W. Fulbright.\n  I worked for Dale's opponent in 1980, not because I was enamored by \nhis opponent, but because I was upset with some of Dale's votes. That \nhas always been the way with Dale Bumpers; you either agreed with him \npassionately or you disagreed vehemently.\n  While Dale has always been as smooth as honey, he has never tried to \nvarnish his views or dilute his positions to make them more palatable \nto the general public, whether it was the Panama Canal or the space \nstation.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that in Arkansas, political lives and \ncareers intersect frequently. In 1986, my brother Asa, then a U.S. \nattorney and now serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, ran \nagainst Senator Bumpers in his second reelection campaign.\n  I worked in Asa's campaign, and I encountered and experienced \nfirsthand the high esteem in which the people of Arkansas hold Dale \nBumpers. After Senator Bumpers won that race resoundingly, delivering a \ngood old country thumping to the Hutchinsons, I returned to my service \nin the Arkansas legislature and Asa became the State GOP chairman. We \ncontinued to follow Senator Bumpers' career from afar, occasionally \nbumping into him at events in the State.\n  In 1990, Asa ran for attorney general of Arkansas. It was a \npolitically tough, mean, even nasty race. It was hard fought and a very \nclose race. I remember one day as I was working in Asa's headquarters \nin Little Rock, Dale Bumpers walked in off the street unannounced. He \ncame by, he said, to wish us well and to say that he always respected \nus and thought well of us. I saw a side of Dale Bumpers that those who \nknow him well see all the time. He knows well that there is life beyond \nthe political arena and that politicians are, first and foremost, human \nbeings.\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n  I saw this again in 1996 when I was running for the U.S. Senate. It \nwas the closing days of a very close race. Dale and my predecessor, \nSenator David Pryor, were campaigning for my opponent in a fly-around \nof the State. I suppose Dale was returning the favor from a decade \nbefore when I was campaigning for his opponent.\n  In the closing days, my son Timothy was involved in a tragic and \nterrible automobile accident. Timothy was seriously injured, and I was \nin the hospital room, not sure whether he was going to make it or not. \nThe phone rang, and it was Dale Bumpers. He called to assure me of his \nthoughts and his prayers and to tell me that he and David were \nsuspending campaigning until it was clear that my son was going to be \nOK.\n  Dale, we will miss you around this place. I won't miss your votes, \nbut I will miss you. I will miss your stories, and I will miss your \nhumor. I will miss your eloquence, and I will miss your passion. I am \ngrateful that our Senate careers overlapped for these 2 years.

Mr. President, I have asked for this time today to \naddress two serious and interrelated concerns: One, the President's \nplans to intervene in Kosovo; and, two, the already evident crisis in \nreadiness of the U.S. military.\n  There are some who believe that these two concerns should be dealt \nwith separately. Some may argue that linking the two is merely an \nexcuse for U.S. inaction. I wish to be very clear. Developments in \nKosovo may compel the United States and our allies to intervene. \nHowever, this intervention should not be paid for by further hollowing \nout of the Armed Forces.\n  I and many of my colleagues, will not support airstrikes in Kosovo, \nand especially a ground force presence, unless the President agrees to \nsubmit a budget that addresses the related readiness and operational \ntempo requirements of the U.S. military.\n  Also, we must be careful not to believe that there is an easy or \ninexpensive long-term solution to the problems in Kosovo. The \nadministration would have us believe that NATO airstrikes will somehow \nsolve the problem. I, and many colleagues, disagree.\n  The recent massacre of ethnic Albanians in two small villages in \nKosovo has heightened awareness and condemnation of Serbian aggression. \nPowerful airstrikes and military action could send a strong and \nunambiguous message to the Serbian leader. As in Bosnia, empty threats \nof NATO action never does anything to get the job done.\n  There is good reason to be concerned about 400,000 Albanians forced \nfrom their homes as winter approaches. I am concerned. I am deeply \nconcerned about that. But I am more concerned about involving U.S. \nlives in ill-conceived military campaigns. I am deeply concerned that \nwe will be sending an already weary and overextended military into a \nsituation for which there is no quick and easy solution.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the U.S. defense budget has declined for \nthe past several years. At the same time, nontraditional deployments \nhave stretched an already extended military force to its limits. This \nis largely the result of downsizing of our force structure while \nincreasing the number and the frequency of deployments overseas for \npurposes other than a war.\n  We have been asking our Armed Forces to do more with less for several \nyears. They are finally admitting that they cannot do more with what \nthe President has given them. Yet, the administration is asking them to \nstill do more.\n  Now I and many of my colleagues wish to ask the administration one \nquestion: Will you do more? Will you ensure that readiness does not \nsuffer further? Will you stop the hollowing out of our military forces?\n  Some may think that this readiness issue isn't real. I am sure there \nare those who think that there is no crisis in readiness. Well, I \nbelieve that a few examples of the crisis in readiness are absolutely \npersuasive.\n  Here are just a few of the symptoms of this crisis:\n  One, Navy pilot retention has sunk to an all-time low of 10 percent. \nThis is the lowest in recorded history of pilot retention programs.\n  Air Force pilot retention is at 30 percent, and it is projected to \ndecline further. The Air Force is now 700 pilots short.\n  The aircraft deployed on primary, peacekeeping deployments--such as \nBosnia--are being ``cannibalized,'' meaning, they are being stripped \nfor spare parts to keep at least a few flying. It is not uncommon for \nthis to happen at a low-priority unit in the United States; however, \nallowing this to happen in the front-line deployments like Bosnia where \nwe might soon go into combat is inexcusable.\n  Aircraft carriers are being deployed with personnel slots empty. A \nrecent report has one carrier on a peacekeeping mission with a crew \nthat is lacking 1,000 persons to perform the essential tasks. In other \nwords, the United States has aircraft carriers on missions that are \nlacking about 20 percent of what is considered a full crew. How ready \nare these carriers to perform their missions?\n  We have Army units arriving for critical combat training at the \nArmy's national training center in California with mechanics and \n``mounted'' infantry simply missing. These units have junior \nnoncommissioned officers filling roles traditionally filled by senior \nexperienced noncommissioned officers.\n  This is a problem that permeates every branch of the Armed Forces. We \nsimply are not retaining the seasoned, well-trained military personnel \nand professionals. I and Senator Stevens are commissioning an important \nstudy by GAO to find out exactly why our military persons are leaving \nthe service in unprecedented numbers.\n  The troops that I personally visited in the Persian Gulf made it \nclear that morale is low there. They are tired of constantly being \nseparated from their families. I believe this separation would be \ntolerable if the operational tempo required of them were humane.\n  I believe the separation would also be eased, if they were assured \nthat their families had adequate housing and food on the table.\n  I believe the separation would be tolerable and their loyalty to the \nmilitary secure, if it weren't for the fact that they also question the \npurpose of the missions.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are failing own soldiers on all counts.\n  That brings us to the question of money. There is simply not enough \nmoney in the defense budget as it is currently projected to do \neverything that needs to be done. There is an effort underway to \nprovide emergency supplemental funding for military readiness. I \nsupport that effort. However, this will not solve the bigger problems.\n  The U.S. defense budget has been in a constant decline since 1985. In \nthe case of Bosnia, the administration has relied on Congress to \nrepeatedly supply ``emergency supplemental'' moneys to provide for a \n``contingency'' operation that started in December, 1995. We are \ncurrently supporting over 8,000 troops in Bosnia, and the President \npersists in asking us to join him in a charade that the U.S. presence \nin Bosnia is an ``unforeseen emergency.''\n  The budget shortfalls are eroding readiness, but, more importantly, \nthey\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nare contributing to a precipitous decline in the moral of the soldiers \nin uniform.\n  Mr. President, we believe it would be an unacceptable policy to send \nour troops into harm's way without addressing the scarcity of spare \nparts and relevant readiness issues that currently permeate the forces. \nOf course, I am not prepared to support the half baked, not thought \nthrough ideas that I fear are still being contemplated by this \nadministration for what currently serves as our ``policy'' in Bosnia \nand Kosovo.\n  We must send a clear signal to the administration that we will not \npaint ourselves into another Bosnia, especially without the \nadministration's assurance that our military will not once again be \nasked to do more with even less.\n  Before we commit American lives to another dangerous mission \noverseas, we must clearly define our objectives and be realistic in the \ncommitment required to achieve them. More importantly, we must give our \nmen and women in uniform sufficient assurance that their loyalty is not \na one-way street. This can only be achieved by stopping the decline in \ndefense budgets and ensuring a higher quality of life for our soldiers.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator from Texas in \nthese remarks this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to really follow on what the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico was saying, because I think he \nlaid out very well the problems that we are facing with our military \ntoday. No one questions the job our military is doing. They are doing \ntheir jobs well. But it is clear that we are losing our experienced \npeople.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico has just pointed out, we are losing \nour experienced pilots, we do not have enough parts to keep the \nairplanes running, and the Army had its worst recruiting year last year \nsince the late 1970s.\n  At the time that we are looking at mission fatigue, our troops being \noverdeployed away from their families on missions that are not security \nthreats to the United States, we are now seeing a mixed message from \nthis administration about yet expanding their responsibilities.\n  We were told in the last few weeks that NATO is contemplating \nairstrikes in Serbia. This is, of course, a terrible and tragic \nsituation in Kosovo. And, clearly, we want to try to do everything \npossible to curb atrocities that are happening and may happen in the \nfuture in Kosovo. But, Mr. President, a superpower cannot fling around \nthe world without a plan, without a thought, and have credibility.\n  I ask the question of the administration, Have we done everything we \ncan do at the bargaining table with Mr. Milosevic? Have we put every \neconomic sanction that can be put? Have we isolated this country to the \nextent that we can--as we have also tried to do with Iraq--to show this \nleader that he cannot continue to act in an irresponsible manner toward \nhuman beings in his own country and get by with it?\n  Have we done everything we can do first? If we have--and I don't \nthink we have--if the administration makes the case that we have, then, \nand only then, should we be considering other options.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to bomb another country because of a \ncivil conflict, a sovereign country that is in a civil conflict, have \nwe thought through what the exit strategy is? Have we thought through \nwhat our responsibility is going to be for doing that? I haven't seen a \nplan. I haven't seen any kind of ``after plan'' after bombing. Yes, we \nhave talked about bombing. But if we are bombing for the purpose of \nsaying to Milosevic, ``You must withdraw your police so that the \nAlbanians who live in Kosovo can come out of the hills and go into \ntheir homes,'' how is that to be enforced?\n  We have been told by administration officials that there would not be \nAmerican troops on the ground unless there is a peace agreement, \nsomething to enforce. Yet yesterday the Secretary of Defense opened the \ndoor on American troops on the ground with NATO forces. Yet we haven't \nseen a plan. We haven't seen what the American role will be. We have \ncertainly not been consulted to determine if the United States is ready \nto expand its mission in the Balkans.\n  We were told we would be out of Bosnia a year ago. We were told a \nyear and a half ago, we were told 2 years ago that our mission in \nBosnia would be complete when the parties were separated and the \nelections had been held. The parties are separated. The elections have \nbeen held. Yet American taxpayers have spent $10 billion in Bosnia, and \nthe President is now saying there is an ``unending mission'' there. He \nhas refused to put a timetable on it. This week the President has asked \nthe U.S. Congress for $2 billion more for Bosnia in a supplemental \nappropriation, as if this were an emergency. Why didn't the \nadministration put this in the budget? He says it is an unending \nmission, yet we have an emergency appropriation.\n  I conclude by saying we cannot fling ourselves around the world \nwithout a clear strategy and a clear role for the United States. I am \nlooking to the President for leadership and I haven't seen it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11644-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11645-S11647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DON'T TAMPER WITH THIS JURY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have recently read several articles in the \npress which are cause for concern. One such article appeared in the \nSunday, October 4, edition of the Washington Post, titled ``Bid to \nTrump Inquiry Shelved.''\n  The piece discussed White House efforts to produce a letter signed by \nat least 34 Democratic Senators declaring that they would not vote to \nconvict the President, should the House decide to write articles of \nimpeachment. According to the report, Minority Leader Tom Daschle has \ndiscouraged such an attempt.\n  I commend the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, for his wise and \njudicious counsel on this matter. He has done the White House, he has \ndone the President, he has done all Senators, and, indeed, the entire \nnation a great, great service.\n  I am concerned about the ugly and very partisan tone that has \nenveloped many discussions of this matter, and about the extreme \npolarization which has already occurred. The House Judiciary Committee \nhas voted to begin an impeachment inquiry. I have had nothing to say \nabout that. I don't intend to have anything to say about that. This is \nthe House's business. There is a constitutional process in place. That \nprocess has begun. The ball is in the field of the House of \nRepresentatives at this point. We here in the Senate should await the \ndecision of the House of Representatives as to whether or not articles \nof impeachment will, indeed, be formulated.\n  Senators may at some point have to sit as jurors. Let me say that \nagain. Senators may at some point have to sit as jurors in this matter \nand will be required to take an oath before they do. I read this oath \ninto the Record a few days ago. I want to read it again, because the \nSenate will shortly be going out, not to return at least until after \nthe elections, and perhaps not until the new Congress convenes in \nJanuary.\n  To repeat this oath at this point, might be well advised. The Bible \nsays, ``a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of \nsilver,'' and so I think it is a good time to repeat this oath, which \nwill be incumbent upon every Senator, should articles of impeachment \ncome to this Chamber. Here it is:\n\n       I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the \n     trial of the impeachment now pending, I will do impartial \n     justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me \n     God.\n\n  Note the word ``impartial.'' We all need to remember the solemn \nresponsibility we may be required to shoulder.\n  I would suggest by way of friendly advice to the White House, don't \ntamper with this jury. Don't tamper with this jury. I have been in \nCongress 46 years. I have been in this Senate 40 years. There are some \npeople here who take their constitutional responsibilities very \nseriously. This will not be politics as usual if articles of \nimpeachment come to this body.\n  My friendly words of advice to my colleagues are these: We may have \nto\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\nsit as jurors. Don't let it be said that we allowed ourselves to be \ntampered with, no matter who attempts the tampering, no matter how \nsubtle the attempt. How can we commit ourselves to vote for or against \narticles of impeachment without having seen them, without having heard \nthe managers on the part of the House prosecute the articles, without \nhaving heard the impeached person's lawyers and representatives or even \nthe impeached person himself make the defense? How can we as Senators, \nwho will be prospective jurors, commit ourselves at this point, or at \nany point, as to how we will vote on such articles? We cannot do it and \nlive up to the oath that we will be required to take. It is a solemn \nmatter, it is not politics as usual, and I personally will resent--and \nI hope every other Senator will personally resent--any effort on the \npart of anybody in these United States to tamper with Senators as \nprospective jurors. I will personally resent it on behalf of the Senate \nand on behalf of the Constitution. I urge all Senators to be on their \nguard.\n\n  There has been a great deal of gratuitous advice given by people on \nthe outside, and some on the inside, who know very little, probably, \nabout the history of impeachment, about the history of the Senate, \nabout responsibilities of Senators under the Constitution in such an \nevent. We don't know what the House may decide to include in articles \nof impeachment when and if they ever come to the Senate. There can be \nan inquiry by the House, yet never be any articles formulated. That is \nup to the House. But if the House decides to formulate articles of \nimpeachment, we have no choice here in the Senate but to vote up or \ndown. We can't amend such articles. We have no way of knowing what the \nHouse may consider to be an impeachable offense. An impeachable offense \ndoes not have to be an indictable offense at law.\n  So I warn Senators, and I warn those at the other end of the avenue, \nto exercise the utmost care lest somebody be unjustly prejudiced \nbecause of tongues that wag too easily and too early.\n  I also condemn the circus atmosphere which has overtaken this city. \nThere are attack dogs on both sides, on the talk shows and in the \npress, and their wild and rabid rhetoric is hardly contributing to an \natmosphere of reason or respect. I believe that everyone must stop \nplaying for advantage. And by that, I mean Republicans and Democrats \nalike; I mean people at both ends of the avenue and in between.\n  If the Senate votes on impeachment articles, that will be the most \nsolemn, the most sobering, and the most far-reaching vote that Senators \nin this body will ever cast. Voting for a declaration of war does not \ncompete with voting to convict or not to convict a President. We won't \nbe voting to convict a Federal judge and to remove that judge from \noffice. In this case, it would be the ultimate vote on the ultimate \nquestion that could ever face this Senate. So I say to my colleagues: \nBe careful.\n  Mr. President, just to illustrate how close we are to making a total \nfarce of the situation, I note that Larry Flynt, publisher of a \nmagazine called Hustler, has offered $1 million to anyone who will come \nforward with evidence of a sexual liaison with a Member of Congress or \nother high-ranking official. How much lower can we go? Now, that makes \na farce of the Constitution.\n  Such tactics and countertactics only serve to convince the people of \nthis Nation that whatever course we eventually take will amount to \nnothing more than partisan politics at its very worst. Now, we all play \npartisan politics, but this is one thing that won't bear touching with \npartisan politics on either side, Republican or Democrat. This is the \nConstitution which we have sworn that we will support and defend. One \nmay say, well, there is no impeachable offense. This is something we \ndon't know. If Senators commit themselves prematurely and then find, in \nreading the articles, that there is one article that is very, very \ndifficult to vote against, it may be your own seat that you are \nimperiling.\n  I urge all Senators, many of whom are going home to stand for \nreelection, to avoid making commitments on this matter and to resist \nlobbying attempts, no matter how subtle, and no matter who attempts to \nlobby them. We must resist pressure from all sides.\n  The people are watching. This should not, this cannot, this must not, \nbecome bad, boring, beltway ``politics as usual.'' This is a matter in \nwhich partisan politics should play no role. I say this to my \nRepublican friends as well. There is far, far too much at stake for the \nPresident, for the Presidency, for the system of separation of powers, \nfor Members of Congress, and for our country as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article from the October 4, 1998 Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 4, 1998]\n\n  Bid to Trump Inquiry Shelved--Clinton Lobbying Behind the Scenes to \n                           Avoid Impeachment\n\n                          (By John F. Harris)\n\n       Hoping to quash the congressional impeachment process in \n     its nascent stages, President Clinton in recent days \n     discussed with Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-\n     S.D.) organizing an effort to have Democratic senators sign a \n     letter declaring that none of the allegations or evidence in \n     the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation would merit impeachment, \n     according to Democratic sources.\n       Daschle discouraged the idea, which Clinton apparently \n     first heard from another Democratic senator about a week ago, \n     and for now it has been shelved.\n       But the effort illustrates the intensive behind-the-scenes \n     lobbying Clinton is doing to ensure his future in office. The \n     skepticism of Daschle and other Democrats in both the House \n     and Senate also illustrated how even lawmakers who want \n     Clinton to remain in office are placing clear limits on what \n     they will do to short-circuit the constitutional process of \n     reviewing the allegations of impeachable behavior that \n     independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr presented last month.\n       The hope, as Democrats familiar with the discussions \n     described it, was to get at least 34 Democrats--or more than \n     one-third of the Senate--to declare up front that they would \n     never vote to convict. Since two-thirds of the Senate must \n     vote to evict a president, such a letter would make a House \n     impeachment vote moot, for all practical purposes. Clinton, \n     sources said, apparently hoped that the letter could defeat \n     the gathering momentum for a full impeachment inquiry in the \n     House, which is set to authorize the process later this week.\n       ``This is an idea which was generated on the Hill which is \n     not getting much traction, because it's premature,'' said a \n     senior White House official.\n       Also yesterday, sources said U.S. District Judge Norma \n     Holloway Johnson had appointed an outside expert known as a \n     ``special master'' to help her determine whether Starr's \n     office illegally leaked grand jury material to reporters, as \n     Clinton's lawyers have complained.\n       Starr's office has denied illegal leaks, but Clinton's lead \n     private attorney, David R. Kendall, contends that the \n     independent counsel's office has been the source of grand \n     jury material whose publication was damaging to Clinton. Late \n     last month, Johnson decided instead to appoint a special \n     master, whose identity was not revealed, to conduct the \n     inquiry and report back to her.\n       Clinton's advisers have resigned themselves to the virtual \n     certainty that an impeachment inquiry will be approved by the \n     House this week, but they hope perceptions that the vote was \n     a partisan rush to judgment can turn this legal setback into \n     a political gain.\n       The House Judiciary Committee will begin its formal \n     deliberations on authorizing an impeachment inquiry Monday, \n     and is planning to vote that day or Tuesday. Democratic \n     sources in the administration and Congress said yesterday \n     they are confident a measure authorizing an open-ended \n     impeachment inquiry will pass with only Republican support, \n     over the objections of Democrats backing a more focused \n     inquiry that would be completed by Thanksgiving.\n       A day after the last major release of documents from Starr, \n     Clinton's legal and political team yesterday had focused its \n     own vote-counting efforts on the full House floor, in \n     anticipation of a vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry by \n     the end of the week.\n       On the floor, Clinton's hopes for making the case that the \n     effort against him is a partisan affair are more clouded. A \n     significant number of Democrats are prepared to vote in favor \n     of the impeachment inquiry, which many administration and \n     congressional officials say is all but certain to pass. \n     Estimates on the precise number of these Democratic defectors \n     vary widely. One Democratic source who has consulted with \n     lawmakers said lower-end scenarios would have about 20 \n     Democrats voting with the GOP. A House Democratic leadership \n     aide said the number may be as high as 50; many of these \n     lawmakers are planning to vote yes for both the Democratic \n     inquiry resolution and then, if that fails, the Republican \n     version.\n       What was striking this weekend was the passive public \n     posture of the White House. Although the Clinton \n     administration usually engages in aggressive public advocacy, \n     on the eve of a vote that is critical to Clinton's future the \n     White House was not sending its representatives on the usual \n     Sunday talk\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n     show circuit. Lawyers yesterday did nothing to expand the \n     public defense they offered Friday, when Clinton's team \n     claimed the 4,610 pages of new material released were further \n     evidence of what they said was Starr's tendency to suppress \n     exculpatory evidence.\n       The strategy of staying quiet, aides said, reflected a \n     confidence that public perceptions of the case are already \n     breaking in Clinton's favor, and that Democratic House \n     members were better positioned to make the case that the \n     process Republicans are proposing is unfair.\n       The latest release of documents ``didn't even lead the news \n     last night. There's no reason to look for opportunities to \n     elevate this story,'' one White House official said of the \n     quiet weekend. ``Not that we're uninvolved, but the ball has \n     now shifted to the congressional realm.''\n       ``Whatever was there hasn't caused a huge stir. Without any \n     revelations, it hasn't changed the perception of what we have \n     to do with the Hill and the American public. Our focus is \n     still on the resolution and the Democratic alternative and \n     how we can build on it,'' said another Clinton adviser \n     outside the White House.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their patience. I \nthank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has sought \nrecognition earlier.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me associate myself with \nthe remarks of the most distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11645-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in the midst of all the confusion and \nanxiety of the last week, we are going to be asked to vote on the \nconfirmation of three judges that I think should be looked at very \ncarefully.\n  First is the nomination of William Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Groups are in opposition due to a Law Review article \nin which he stated that judicial discretion trumps legislative \ndiscretion when a legislature fails to act.\n  Presently, Fletcher's mother is sitting on the Ninth Circuit, which \nis historically the most liberal and activist court in the United \nStates. Over the last 3 years, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth \nCircuit more than any other.\n  In a book review, about which Mr. Fletcher was questioned before the \ncommittee, he stated that political circumstances outweigh a literal \nreading of the Constitution. In short, the Constitution is what Judge \nFletcher says it is. Judge Fletcher is an extremist and should not be \nconfirmed.\n  Nomination of Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: In \nan outrageous ruling in 1997, Judge Paez ruled that an American company \ncould be liable for human rights abuses committed by their partners in \nanother country.\n  Paez has shown a bias against religious and conservative groups. In \none of the most publicized cases Paez heard as a District Judge was the \n1989 trial of Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry. Paez became upset \nwith some of the pro-life language Terry used and ``stormed off the \nbench.'' Additionally, he angrily warned the defendants that their \nBible would be confiscated if they continued to wave or consult it.\n  While a sitting District Judge, Paez gave a speech at UC-Berkeley's \nlaw school in which he called California's Proposition 209 an ``anti-\ncivil rights initiative.'' In that speech, he also said, ``legal action \nis essential'' to ``achieving the goal of diversifying the bench.'' He \ncharacterizes himself as a ``liberal.'' Judge Paez is an extremist and \nshould not be confirmed.\n  Lastly, and briefly, the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal \nCourt: While in private practice, Mr. Dyk, successfully fought the \nFCC's ban on indecent programming to protect children.\n  He has sat on the board of People for the American Way, and while \nworking as an attorney for People for the American Way, he successfully \ndefended a county school board that forced students to read materials \ntheir parents believed violated their deeply held religious beliefs. A \nmember of Mr. Dyk's legal team called the concerned parents ``somehow \nless important'' and said ``the enemy was really not'' the plaintiffs \n``but [Rev. Jerry] Falwell.''\n  I believe that Mr. Dyk is also an extremist and should not be \nconfirmed in his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11647-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11647-S11648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT OF 1998--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote against the motion to \nproceed on H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. I oppose this \nlegislation because it is inappropriate to bring down the protective \nfirewalls in U.S. financial services while a firestorm is sweeping \nglobal financial institutions. Mr. President, this is the wrong time to \nbe relaxing our protective financial services regulations.\n  I understand the intellectual argument to reform our financial \nservices. In fact, I do not dispute it. There is no doubt that the U.S. \nneeds to be competitive in the global marketplace. I would suggest to \nmy colleagues, though, that changes in the global economic picture make \nthis bill unwise. The global economic situation is vastly different now \nthan when this bill was being drafted.\n  There are a number of what I call ``yellow flashing lights'' or \nwarning signals that now is not the right time to enact this \nlegislation. Let me mention a few. Former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger recently stated in the Washington Post that no government and \nvirtually no economist predicted this global economic crisis, \nunderstood its extent or anticipated its staying power.\n  Now the United States Senate is going to rearrange the national \nfinancial landscape? We need to modernize the United States to go \nglobal? I think we need to pause and ask what does going global mean \nand do we want to go there at this time? In this current global \nenvironment of national financial collapses, IMF bailouts and hedge \nfunds rescue packages have become daily occurrences. These are the \n``yellow flashing lights'' and I believe we must proceed with caution \nto avoid rash and irrevocable changes when the savings of hard working \nfamilies and the viability of our communities could be put in serious \njeopardy.\n  Frankly, I am also concerned that the bill before us is the result of \nlast-minute deal making. The issues here are too important for hasty \ndecision-making. The decisions this bill makes affect the financial \nsecurity of average Americans who are working and saving to provide for \ntheir families, U.S. financial institutions, the American economy and \nthe global financial marketplace.\n  These are not trivial issues. We are being asked to establish a \nlegislative framework for the financial services industry for decades \nto come. These are irrevocable decisions.\n  As changes were made to accommodate this interest or that interest, I \nam concerned that we have lost sight of the overall impact of the bill \nbefore us. I am concerned that we do not know enough about what's in \nthe bill at this juncture, and what it will mean for our economic \nsecurity. In the haste to get the job done before the Congress adjourns \nfor the year, I have serious and deep reservations that changes have \nbeen made that have not been well thought out or thought through. If \nenacted, we will end up with unintended, but nevertheless, negative \nconsequences because we rushed to the finish line.\n  Advocates of this legislation always mention the free market. They \nbelieve that buyers and sellers acting in their own self-interests will \nproduce winners and losers, and bring about the best and most efficient \noutcome for banking customers. But look at what the free market has \nbrought us lately-- a global financial meltdown and hedge funds that \nare ``too big to fail''. As Kissinger suggested, indiscriminate \nglobalism has generated a world-wide assault on the concept of free \nfinancial markets. In the United States, where we used to boast about \nour well functioning capital markets, we now bail out those investors \nwho make foolish decisions.\n  One need look no further than the Long-Term Capital debacle to see \nevidence that even the brightest minds on Wall Street, acting in the \nfree market, sometimes make very poor decisions. The collapse of this \nhigh-flying hedge fund was a failure of proper supervision. As Kenneth \nGuenther explains in the Baltimore Sun, this raises serious questions \nabout our regulatory structure: ``it doesn't make sense to have too-\nbig-to-fail institutions if the regulatory structure is not up to \nregulating them.  .  .  . if the regulators\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nhave to make a choice between the safety of the financial system and \nthe free market, the financial system will win. There is no free market \nand there never will be. It's the height of hypocrisy to talk about the \nfree market in one breath and bail out Long-Term Capital . . . in the \nnext breath.'' Mr. President, I oppose this legislation because in this \nenvironment, we need more oversight and enforcement in our financial \nservices, not less.\n  Beyond these concerns that this is not the right time to enact these \nsweeping changes buttressed by the follies of the free market, I have \nother, structural concerns with the proposed changes to our financial \nservices laws.\n  First, I am concerned that if we relax the laws about who can own and \noperate financial institutions, an unhealthy concentration of financial \nresources will be the inevitable result. The savings of the many will \nbe controlled by the few. If we relax banking regulations in this \ncountry, Americans will know less about where their deposits are kept \nand about how they are being used.\n  Marylanders used to have savings accounts with local banks where the \nteller knew their name and their family. We have already seen the trend \ntoward mega-mergers, accompanied by higher fees, a decline in service, \nand the loss of neighborhood financial institutions. This bill \naccelerates that trend.\n  With a globalization of financial resources, the local bank could be \nbought by a holding company based in Thailand. Instead of the friendly \nteller, consumers will be contacting a computer operator in a country \nhalf-way around the globe through an 800 number. Their account will be \nsubject to financial risks that have nothing to do with their job, \ntheir community, or even the economy of the United States. I know \nimpersonalized globalization is not what banking customers want when we \ntalk about modernization of the financial services.\n  Second, I am concerned that complex financial and insurance products \nwill now be sold in a cluttered market by untrained individuals. \nInvestment and insurance planning for families is a very important \nprocess, one of the most important decisions a family makes. It should \nbe done with a professional who is certified and who is someone you can \ntrust. By breaking down these firewalls and allowing various companies \nto offer insurance and complex investment products, we run the risk \nthat consumers will be confused, defrauded, and treated like market \nsegments and not individuals with unique needs and goals.\n  Finally, I believe that any modernization of our financial services \nlaw should not just retain, but expand the important consumer \nprotections and community investment policies currently in place.\n  Consumers need protections and regulations to guarantee the safety of \ntheir deposits and the availability of basic banking services and \ncredit to help their communities grow. If we have a Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to protect children from flammable sleepware, I \nbelieve we should also have a strong regulatory framework to protect \nconsumers, not just investors, in the financial services marketplace.\n  A strong regulatory framework will not be provided by the Federal \nReserve, as is proposed in this legislation. I share the concerns of \nJohn Hawke, Undersecretary of the Treasury Department, that shifting \nthe regulatory power from the Office of the Controller of the Currency \nto the Federal Reserve Board is a highly questionable regulatory \nprotection. This would be like letting the bankers regulate themselves. \nThe decision making of the Federal Reserve is directly linked to the \nbanking industry that it would regulate. Bankers elect two thirds of \nthe Federal Reserves directors. It is true that the Federal Reserve is \nindependent of the administration, but it is not independent of the \nbankers and finance companies that it would regulate.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to a necessary reform of our \nfinancial services laws. But this is not the legislation and this is \nnot the time to do it. The U.S. stock market has had one of the worst \nquarters since 1990 and world leaders are currently strategizing about \nhow to stanch the global economic crisis.\n  The Congress will be back in 90 days. Hopefully, the world market \nwill be calmer, it will be after the election, and we will be able to \nstudy the lessons learned from the financial events of the past three \nmonths. For all the hard work and all the negotiating and compromise, \nnow is not the time to go forward and add more fuel to what is already \na very troubling global financial firestorm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11647-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we wind down this session, certainly \nthis body and the other body have much on their mind regarding the \nactions of the House Judiciary Committee and the whole area of an \nimpeachment inquiry. Every Member will have to speak for himself or \nherself in both bodies in deciding what they believe is or is not an \nimpeachable offense.\n  Many times we speak about what is an impeachable offense without \ndiscussing what it is not. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an excellent article written in Sunday's Washington Post by \nProfessor Sunstein, entitled ``Impeachment?'' I feel it will be \nhelpful, as his writings usually are, on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 4, 1998]\n\n                        Impeachment? The Framers\n\n                           (By Cass Sunstein)\n\n       We all now know that, under the Constitution, the president \n     can be impeached for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes \n     and Misdemeanors.'' But what did the framers intend us to \n     understand with these words? Evidence of the phrase's \n     evolution is extensive--and it strongly suggests that, if we \n     could solicit the views of the Constitution's authors, the \n     current allegations against President Clinton would not be \n     impeachable offenses.\n       When the framers met in Philadelphia during the stifling \n     summer of 1787, they were seeking not only to design a new \n     form of government, but to outline the responsibilities of \n     the president who would head the new nation. They shared a \n     commitment to disciplining public officials through a system \n     of checks and balances. But they disagreed about the precise \n     extent of presidential power and, in particular, about how, \n     if at all, the president might be removed from office. If we \n     judge by James Madison's characteristically detailed accounts \n     of the debates, this question troubled and divided the \n     members of the Constitutional Convention.\n       The initial draft of the Constitution took the form of \n     resolutions presented before the 30-odd members on June 13. \n     One read that the president could be impeached for \n     ``malpractice, or neglect of duty,'' and, on July 20, this \n     provision provoked extensive debate. The notes of Madison, \n     who was representing Virginia, show that three distinct \n     positions dominated the day's discussion. One extreme view, \n     represented by Roger Sherman of Connecticut, was that ``the \n     National Legislature should have the power to remove the \n     Executive at pleasure.'' Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, \n     Rufus King of Massachusetts and Gouvernor Morris of \n     Pennsylvania opposed, with Pinckney arguing that the \n     president ``ought not to be impeachable whilst in office.'' \n     The third position, which ultimately carried the day, was \n     that the president should be impeachable, but only for a \n     narrow category of abuses of the public trust.\n       It was George Mason of Virginia who took a lead role in \n     promoting this more moderate course. He argued that it would \n     be necessary to counter the risk that the president might \n     obtain his office by corrupting his electors. ``Shall that \n     man be above'' justice, he asked, ``who can commit the most \n     extensive injustice?'' The possibility of the new president \n     becoming a near-monarch led the key votes--above all, \n     Morris--to agree that impeachment might be permitted for (in \n     Morris's words) ``corruption & some few other offences.'' \n     Madison concurred, and Edmund Randolph of Virginia captured \n     the emerging consensus, favoring impeachment on the grounds \n     that the executive ``will have great opportunitys of abusing \n     his power; particularly in time of war when the military \n     force, and in some respects the public money, will be in his \n     hands.'' The clear trend of the discussion was toward \n     allowing a narrow impeachment power by which the president \n     could be removed only for gross abuses of public authority.\n       To Pinckney's continued protest that the separation of \n     powers should be paramount, Morris argued that ``no one would \n     say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing \n     the first-Magistrate in foreign pay without being able to \n     guard against it by displacing him.'' At the same time, \n     Morris insisted, ``we should take care to provide some mode \n     that will not make him dependent on the Legislature.'' Thus, \n     led by Morris, the framers moved toward a position that would \n     maintain the separation between president and Congress, but \n     permit the president to be removed in extreme situations.\n       A fresh draft of the Constitution's impeachment clause, \n     which emerged two weeks later on Aug. 6, permitted the \n     president to be impeached, but only for treason, bribery and \n     corruption (exemplified by the president's securing his \n     office by unlawful means). With little additional debate, \n     this provision was narrowed on Sept. 4 to ``treason and \n     bribery.'' But a short time later, the delegates took up the \n     impeachment clause anew. Mason complained that the provision \n     was too narrow, that ``maladministration'' should be added, \n     so as to include ``attempts to subvert the Constitution'' \n     that would not count as treason or bribery.\n       But Madison, the convention's most careful lawyer, insisted \n     that the term ``maladministration'' was ``so vague'' that it \n     would ``be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the \n     Senate,'' which is exactly what the framers were attempting \n     to avoid. Hence, Mason withdrew ``maladministration'' and \n     added the new terms ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors \n     against the State''--later unanimously changed to, according \n     to Madison, ``against the United States'' to ``remove \n     ambiguity.'' The phrase itself was taken from English law, \n     where it referred to a category of distinctly political \n     offenses against the state.\n       There is a further wrinkle in the clause's history. On \n     Sept. 10, the entire Constitution was referred to the \n     Committee on Style and Arrangement. When that committee's \n     version appeared two days later, the words ``against the \n     United States'' had been dropped, probably on the theory that \n     they were redundant, although we have no direct evidence. It \n     would be astonishing if this change were intended to have a \n     substantive effect, for the committee had no authority to\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\n     change the meaning of any provision, let alone the \n     impeachment clause on which the framers had converged. The \n     Constitution as a whole, including the impeachment provision, \n     was signed by the delegates and offered to the nation on \n     Sept. 17.\n       These debates support a narrow understanding of ``high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' founded on the central notions of \n     bribery and treason. The early history tends in the same \n     direction. The Virginia and Delaware constitutions, providing \n     a background for the founders' work, generally allowed \n     impeachment for acts ``by which the safety of the State may \n     be endangered.'' And considered the words of the highly \n     respected (and later Supreme Court Justice) James Iredell, \n     speaking in the North Carolina ratifying convention: ``I \n     suppose the only instances, in which the President would be \n     liable to impeachment, would be where he had received a \n     bribe, or had acted from some corrupt motive or other.'' By \n     way of explanation, Iredell referred to a situation in which \n     ``the President had received a bribe . . . from a foreign \n     power, and under the influence of that bribe, had address \n     enough with the Senate, by artifices and misrepresentations, \n     to seduce their consent of pernicious treaty.''\n       James Wilson, a convention delegate from Pennsylvania, \n     wrote similarly in his 1791 ``Lectures on Law'': ``In the \n     United States and in Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined \n     to political characters, to political crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and to political punishments.'' Another early \n     commentator went so far as to say that ``the legitimate \n     causes of impeachment . . . can have referenced only to \n     public character, and official duty . . . In general, those \n     offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person, \n     as a public officer, are not the subjects of impeachment.''\n       This history casts new light on the famous 1970 statement \n     by Gerald Ford, then a representative from Michigan, that a \n     high crime and misdemeanor ``is whatever a majority of the \n     House of Representatives considers it to be.'' In a practical \n     sense, of course, Ford was right; no court would review a \n     decision to impeach. But in a constitutional sense, he was \n     quite wrong, the framers were careful to circumscribe the \n     power of the House of Representatives by sharply limiting the \n     category of legitimately impeachable offenses.\n       The Constitution is not always read to mean what the \n     founders intended it to mean, and Madison's notes hardly \n     answer every question. But under any reasonable theory of \n     constitutional interpretation, the current allegations \n     against Clinton fall far short of the permissible grounds for \n     removing a president from office. Of course, perjury and \n     obstruction of justice could be impeachable offenses if they \n     involved, for example, lies about unlawful manipulation of \n     elections. It might even be possible to count as impeachable \n     ``corruption'' the extraction of sexual favors in return for \n     public benefits of some kind. But nothing of this kind has \n     been alleged thus far. A decision to impeach President \n     Clinton would not and should not be subject to judicial \n     review. But for those who care about the Constitution's \n     words, and the judgment of its authors, there is a good \n     argument that it would nonetheless be unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge all Members to keep in mind the \nnecessity to have a strong sense of history in whatever position they \ntake on this matter. It is not something that is done for a 30-second \nspot on an ad, nor is it something that is done to determine the fate \nof any one of us in an election whether this year or subsequent years. \nWhatever we do affects the history and the course of the greatest \ndemocracy history has ever known.\n  In that regard, I believe Members will be wise to take the time to \nread an op-ed piece written by former President Gerald Ford from the \nNew York Times on Sunday, October 4. After reading it, I was impressed \nenough to pick up the phone and call President Ford and speak to him at \nsome length.\n  I had the privilege, when I was first a Member of the Senate, of \nserving with President Ford. I got to know him then. On many occasions \nin the 20 or so years since, I have been able to be with him or talk \nwith him or seek his advice. I think what he says here is, again, very \nworthwhile. It may not be something that each Member would agree with. \nI find a great deal of merit in it. Again, President Ford speaks not \nonly of the history involved, but of the country and of his own long \nexperiences as a Member of the House. I commend every one of us to read \nPresident Ford's op-ed piece.\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 4, 1998]\n\n                        The Path Back to Dignity\n\n                          (By Gerald R. Ford)\n\n       Grand Rapids, Mich.--Almost exactly 25 years have passed \n     since Richard Nixon nominated me to replace the disgraced \n     Spiro Agnew as Vice President. In the contentious days of \n     autumn 1973, my confirmation was by no means assured. Indeed, \n     a small group of House Democrats, led by Bella Abzug, risked \n     a constitutional crisis in order to pursue their own agenda. \n     ``We can get control and keep control,'' Ms. Abzug told the \n     Speaker of the House, Carl Albert. The group hoped, \n     eventually, to replace Nixon himself with Mr. Albert.\n       The Speaker, true to form, refused to have anything to do \n     with the scheme. And so on Dec. 6, 1973, the House voted 387 \n     to 35 to confirm my nomination in accordance with the 25th \n     Amendment to the Constitution.\n       When I succeeded to the Presidency, in August 1974, my \n     immediate and overriding priority was to draw off the poison \n     that had seeped into the nation's bloodstream during two \n     years of scandal and sometimes ugly partisanship. Some \n     Americans have yet to forgive me for pardoning my \n     predecessor. In the days leading up to the hugely \n     controversial action, I didn't take a poll for guidance, but \n     I did say more than a few prayers. In the end I listened to \n     only one voice, that of my conscience. I didn't issue the \n     pardon for Nixon's sake, but for the country's.\n       A generation later, Americans once again confront the \n     specter of impeachment. From the day, last January, when the \n     Monica Lewinsky story first came to light, I have refrained \n     publicly from making any substantive comments. I have done so \n     because I haven't known enough of the facts--and because I \n     know all too well that a President's responsibilities are, at \n     the best of times, onerous. In common with the other former \n     Presidents, I have had no wish to increase those burdens. \n     Moreover, I resolved to say nothing unless my words added \n     constructively to the national discussion.\n       This much now seems clear: whether or not President Clinton \n     has broken any laws, he has broken faith with those who \n     elected him. A leader of rare gifts, one who set out to \n     change history by convincing the electorate that he and his \n     party wore the mantle of individual responsibility and \n     personal accountability, the President has since been forced \n     to take refuge in legalistic evasions, while his defenders \n     resort to the insulting mantra that ``everybody does it.''\n       The best evidence that everybody doesn't do it is the \n     genuine outrage occasioned by the President's conduct and by \n     the efforts of some White House surrogates to minimize its \n     significance or savage his critics.\n       The question confronting us, then, is not whether the \n     President has done wrong, but rather, what is an appropriate \n     form of punishment for his wrongdoing. A simple apology is \n     inadequate, and a fine would trivialize his misconduct by \n     treating it as a more question of monetary restitution.\n       At the same time, the President is not the only one who \n     stands before the bar of judgment. It has been said that \n     Washington is a town of marble and mud. Often in these past \n     few months it has seemed that we were all in danger of \n     sinking into the mire.\n       Twenty-five years after leaving it, I still consider myself \n     a man of the House. I never forget that my elevation to the \n     Presidency came about through Congressional as well as \n     constitutional mandate. My years in the White House were \n     devoted to restoring public confidence in institutions of \n     popular governance. Now as then, I care more about preserving \n     respect for those institutions than I do about the fate of \n     any individual temporarily entrusted with office.\n       This is why I think the time has come to pause and consider \n     the long-term consequences of removing this President from \n     office based on the evidence at hand. The President's \n     harisplitting legialisms, objectionable as they may be, are \n     but the foretaste of a protracted and increasingly divisive \n     debate over those deliberately imprecise words ``high crimes \n     and misdemeanors.'' The Framers, after all, dealt in eternal \n     truths, not glossy, deceit.\n       Moving with dispatch, the House Judiciary Committee should \n     be able to conclude a preliminary inquiry into possible \n     grounds for impeachment before the end of the year. Once that \n     process is completed, and barring unexpected new revelations, \n     the full House might then consider the following resolution \n     to the crisis.\n       Each year it is customary for a President to journey down \n     Pennsylvania Avenue and appear before a joint session of \n     Congress to deliver his State of the Union address. One of \n     the binding rituals of our democracy, it takes on added \n     grandeur from its surroundings--there, in that chamber where \n     so much of the American story has been written, and where the \n     ghosts of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight \n     Eisenhower call succeeding generations to account.\n       Imagine a very different kind of Presidential appearance in \n     the closing days of this year, not at the rostrum familiar to \n     viewers from moments of triumph, but in the well of the \n     House. Imagine a President receiving not an ovation from the \n     people's representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as \n     rendered by members of both parties. I emphasize: this would \n     be a rebuke, not a rebutal by the President.\n       On the contrary, by his appearance the President would \n     accept full responsibility for his actions, as well as for \n     his subsequent efforts to delay or impede the investigation \n     of them. No spinning, no semantics, no evasiveness or blaming \n     others for his plight.\n       Let all this be done without partisan exploitation or mean-\n     spiritedness. Let it be dignified, honest and, above all, \n     cleansing. The result, I believe, would be the first moment \n     of majesty in an otherwise squalid year.\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\n       Anyone who confuses this scenario with a slap on the wrist, \n     or a censure written in disappearing ink, underestimates the \n     historic impact of such a pronouncement. Nor should anyone \n     forget the power of television to foster indelible images in \n     the national memory--not unlike what happened on the solemn \n     August noontime in 1974 when I stood in the East-Room and \n     declared our long national nightmare to be over.\n       At 85, I have no personal or political agenda, nor do I \n     have any interest in ``rescuing'' Bill Clinton. But I do \n     care, passionately, about rescuing the country I love from \n     further turmoil or uncertainty.\n       More than a way out of the current mess, most. Americans \n     want a way up to something better. In the midst of a far \n     graver national crisis, Lincoln observed, ``The occasion is \n     piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the \n     occasion.'' We should remember those words in the days ahead. \n     Better yet, we should be guided by them.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, this is a letter I sent to the President \nthis morning concerning Kosovo. It reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing because of my serious \n     concern about developments in Kosovo. With a brutality that \n     would be almost unimaginable were anyone else responsible for \n     it, Slobodan Milosevic has subjected yet another innocent \n     population to the bloody carnage of ethnic cleansing. The \n     stark depravity of his actions gravely offends the basic \n     moral values of Western civilization. Moreover, the conflict \n     in Kosovo threatens the stability of Europe, as the prospects \n     are quite real that it may eventually embroil other countries \n     in the region in a larger war. More than once, the United \n     States has warned Serbia that NATO will not tolerate its \n     continued aggression against Kosovo. Serbia has ignored our \n     warnings, thereby challenging the credibility of the United \n     States, obliging us and our NATO allies to consider using \n     military force to prevent further aggression against our \n     values and interests in Kosovo.\n       Congress has reservations about such a course of action, \n     however. While I am inclined to support military action, I \n     understand the basis for my colleagues' reservations, and I \n     believe it is imperative that prior to ordering any military \n     strike on Serbia you take all necessary steps to ensure both \n     Congress and the American people that the action is \n     necessary, affordable, and designed to achieve clearly \n     defined goals.\n       First, you must state clearly the American interest in \n     resolving this terrible conflict; describe in detail the \n     facts on the ground; identify all parties responsible for \n     perpetrating the terrible atrocities committed in Kosovo \n     while making clear that Serbia is indisputably the primary \n     culprit; explain how our own security is threatened by \n     Serbian aggression and justifies risking the lives of \n     American pilots, and how the use of air power can prevent \n     further aggression. You must also define for the public what \n     will constitute the operation's success so that Americans \n     know that air strikes were launched with a realistic end game \n     in mind.\n       Second, you must convincingly explain to the American \n     people why it is that we should be involved in a conflict \n     that to many people seems to affect our interests indirectly, \n     and that should be resolved exclusively by those countries \n     most directly threatened by it--our European allies. As I am \n     sure you appreciate, Congress and the public's frustration \n     over Europe's lack of willingness to bear a greater share of \n     the burden for maintaining peace in their own backyard is at \n     an all time high, threatening the nation's consensus that our \n     leadership in NATO should remain a priority interest for the \n     United States. You could go a long way toward alleviating \n     that frustration by ensuring that any ground forces that \n     might ultimately be needed to keep the peace in Kosovo will \n     be provided by European countries alone.\n       Third, should you order air strikes you must ensure the \n     nation that they will be of sufficient magnitude to achieve \n     their objectives. I hope you will view the following \n     criticism in the constructive spirit in which it is offered. \n     In the past, your administration has too often threatened and \n     then backed down from the use of force, or authorized cruise \n     missile strikes that amounted to little more than ineffective \n     gestures intended, I suspect, to send a message to our \n     adversaries, but because of their small scale interpreted by \n     our adversaries as a lack of resolve on the part of the \n     United States to defend our interests vigorously. Your \n     administration's failure to support UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq \n     has also greatly exacerbated our adversaries' lack of respect \n     for America's resolve.\n       Finally, you should explain how you intend to find \n     additional resources to fund the operation in order to \n     alleviate well-founded Congressional anxiety regarding the \n     over-extension of U.S. military commitments at a time when \n     spending on national defense is woefully inadequate.\n       Mr. President, should you convincingly address the issues I \n     have raised, which I believe you can do, I am confident you \n     will have the support of Congress and our constituents for \n     operations against Serbia. You will certainly have mine. I \n     believe there exists a clear and compelling case for such an \n     action that Americans will accept if you avoid the mistakes \n     made in the past when your administration has attempted to \n     build public support for the use of force. I urge to give \n     these concerns your most serious consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11651-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11651-S11670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't believe we will need all 20 \nminutes. There may be other Members who want to speak on this. But I \nwill summarize this in the interest of time, because essentially what \nwe are doing here is something that has already been done in the \nSenate. It has been passed unanimously by the Senate. But it is not \nattached to legislation that has as much chance of succeeding, or at \nleast, if that legislation succeeds, we are not sure what the Senate \nhas passed is going to survive the process. It might be dropped from \nthat.\n  Let me begin by summarizing this just to refresh my colleagues' \nmemory of what we have done before.\n  This amendment exempts from the moratorium which, if this bill \npasses--and I believe it will--will be applied to any kind of a \ntaxation on the World Wide Web--my amendment simply exempts from that \nmoratorium any commercial porn site on the World Wide Web that does not \ncomply with the reasonable requirements that are incorporated in this \namendment to restrict access by children to sexually explicit material \non the site.\n  The amendment establishes specific measures that porn site \noperators--commercial porn site operators--must take to restrict \naccess. These restrictions represent standard technology already on the \nweb, and they reflect the technology and the requirements acknowledged \nby the Court as both technically and economically feasible.\n  In the Reno v. ACLU case--that is, the Court's decision that struck \ndown the indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act--the \nCourt said there were two problems with that act.\n  That act, by the way, is the one that was passed by the Senate in I \nthink a nearly unanimous vote. It was labeled the Exon-Coats amendment, \noffered in the last Congress by the Senator from Nebraska, the Democrat \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, and myself. We included in that \namendment--which passed both the House and the Senate and was endorsed \nwholeheartedly by the President and the administration but did not \nsurvive a Court challenge for two reasons:\n  One, the Court said that the restrictions had to apply only to those \nengaged in the business; that is, those commercial providers.\n  Second, it said that our standard of indecency as described in the \nmaterial not suitable for children was not acceptable, violated first \namendment concerns, and they proscribed then a standard as harmful to \nminors, or suggested that.\n  We went back and adjusted that Communications Decency Act which was \npassed by the Congress, signed into law, but rejected by the Court. We \nrevised it to comply with the Court's concerns, so that now it, we \nbelieve, will meet the constitutional standard. We have applied it \nstrictly to commercial sites. We have adopted the requirements for \nestablishing the types of technology that the commercial porn providers \nand the net can require that one will have to comply with and the other \nrequire, and we have adopted the definition of ``harmful to minors'' as \noutlined in the famous case on this issue, the Ginsberg, New York \nGinsberg case. That defined ``harmful to minors'' in a way that means \nyou have to be under 17, it has to be patently offensive as to what is \nsuitable for minors, taken as a whole lacking serious literary, \nartistic, political, and scientific value for minors and appealing to \nprurient interests.\n  This is a standard that we are all familiar with. It has been the \nstandard applied in obscenity cases now for several decades, and it is \nthe generally accepted standard. That is the standard we have put into \nthis bill.\n  So to summarize, what we are doing here is attaching to this \nlegislation, which provides a tax moratorium for users of the World \nWide Web, we are saying that that moratorium does not exist, will not \nbe available to those who use the World Wide Web for the purpose of \nproviding sexually explicit material to minors and have not put in \nplace in terms of their provision to all other users restrictions which \nare technically feasible and already used, which are economically \nfeasible, but restrictions which allow them to certify that the person \nrequesting the material is, in fact, an adult; that is, 17 years and \nolder.\n  This is exactly the language which was adopted unanimously by this \nSenate in this Congress. And so everyone here has already read it, \nunderstood it, voted for it, supported it. We are simply transferring \nit now over to this particular bill and applying it in a somewhat \ndifferent way by denying the tax exemption.\n  It is inconceivable that we would grant a massive tax perk to \ncommercial porn sites that make their smut available to children. We \nare going to give a golden egg to commercial entities on the Internet, \nor giving them a tax shelter, at least a moratorium for a tax shelter \nfor a period of time, but to think that we would give that same tax \nbreak to those who are providing obscene material to minors without \nrequiring any good-faith effort on their part to make sure that minors \ndo not have free access to this material is unthinkable. That is the \nbottom line.\n  S. 442, the underlying bill that we are talking about, holds out a \nmassive tax shelter to on-line businesses. The question is, Is the \nSenate going to extend this tax shelter to pornographers who are making \ntheir material available to every child in America.\n  People say, well, look, I mean, this is a proactive thing. Why don't \nthe parents take control and control what their child clicks into and \norders up.\n  Mr. President, I will not display this on the Senate floor because I \nthink it is obscene, and whether or not you agree it is obscene for \nadults, I think it is absolutely not only obscene but totally \ninappropriate for minors. This is material that is available free. This \nis before you click in and say I want to purchase your material or send \nme more. These are the teasers. The teasers are almost beyond \ndescription, and it is something we don't want to talk about here.\n  There is no excuse in saying, well, an 11-year-old, if he clicks in \nto find out about a school project and uses the wrong word, all it is \nis a verbal version; he has to take a proactive effort to obtain the \nmaterial. That is not true. That youngster, that child, whether they \nare in the library, whether they are in their school classroom, whether \nthey are at home, is immediately given the most graphic of images and \nthe most graphic of language as a teaser for them to go forward and \nobtain the material. We are saying that there has to be a provision \nwhereby the provider of this material puts in place reasonable \nrestrictions to assure that the person asking for the material is \nsomeone who is 17 years old or older.\n  We have complied with the Court requirements. This is language that \nhas already been adopted by the Senate, and I hope my colleagues will \nsee it in that light and support this vote that is coming up in the \nnext few moments.\n  Mr. President, I do not see any other Members on our side who are \nwishing to speak at this particular time. And I am asking how much time \nis remaining of the Senator's time and I would reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 52 minutes left under cloture.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  There was no unanimous consent time agreement on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct. It was asked, agreed to and vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from Indiana who is in his closing \ndays in this body, having made the decision not to seek reelection. A \nlot of Members, as they wind down, spend their last few days winding up \nwork and not being actively involved in the legislative process. It is \na tribute to Senator Coats that in his remaining days in this body, he \nis still very active and involved in issues he has cared deeply about. \nThis is one such issue. I commend him for this amendment. I think it is \na very creative way to advance this issue and provide some safety for \nyoung people who are being exposed today to an alarming amount of \npornography on the Internet.\n  I strongly support his amendment. Now, let me put my amendment in a \nframework for some people. My amendment is a second degree amendment, \nand really complements the Coats amendment. My amendment requires that \nInternet access providers either provide free of charge, or for a fee, \nscreening software at the time they make sales to customers. Internet \naccess providers that don't do this, as with the Coats amendment, would \nbe denied the benefits of the tax breaks in the underlying bill. This \namendment also relies on the Ginsberg definition that has been used in \nthe Coats amendment.\n  How big is this problem, people say? Let me just put it in \nperspective for you. According to Wired Magazine, there are 28,000 web \nsites worldwide that have soft- or hard-core pornography on them. And, \nfifty new web sites with such material are added to the Internet every \nsingle day--50 a day.\n  My colleague from Indiana has some material he wisely decided not to \nshow on the floor, but suffice to say, most Americans would find it \nhighly offensive, to put it mildly. The idea that this material is \navailable to children is something that ought to be a cause of alarm to \nall of us. Sadly, many of our children are unwittingly and accidentally \nexposed to such sites while surfing the web. They type in search terms \nas innocuous as ``toys''--pretty innocuous--only to find graphic images \nand language on their display terminals.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we learn \nand communicate with people. Today our children have unprecedented \naccess to educational material through the Internet. It provides \nchildren with vast opportunities to learn about art and culture and \nhistory. The possibilities are endless. It is an incredibly valuable \ntechnology for children all across this country and across the globe.\n  But as with any technology, Mr. President, this advanced technology \nalso brings with it a dark side for our children. Many of these young \npeople are browsing the net, often unaccompanied by an adult, and come \nacross material that is unsuitable, to put it mildly. It is oftentimes \nvery sexually explicit.\n  Every parent worries about strangers approaching their children in \ntheir neighborhood or on a playground at school.\n  And they teach their children how to avoid these strangers. But \ntoday, these strangers can literally enter our homes via the Internet. \nThey are only a mouse click away from our children. In our libraries \nand bookstores, we store reading material that is harmful to minors in \nareas accessible only to adults. Yet, in cyberspace, these same \nmaterials are as accessible to a child as his or her favorite bedtime \nstory. Pornographic images and sexual predators are now reaching our \nchildren, via the Internet, in the privacy and safety of their own \nhomes and classrooms. This kind of access to our children is alarming, \nand this invasion of our children's privacy and innocence is \nunconscionable.\n  Just a few weeks ago, law enforcement agents in a sting operation \napprehended 200 members of an Internet pornography ring that possessed \nand distributed sexually explicit images of children. Members of this \nring traded inappropriate images of children on the Internet. One of \nthe sites raided was in my own State of Connecticut. As I noted a \nmoment ago, there are 50 new sites a day added to the Web that contain \npornography, these sites are added to the 28,000 that already exist. \nDespite this successful operation by law enforcement agents, their raid \nonly represents the elimination of approximately four days of new \nsites.\n  We, as a nation, have an obligation to ensure that surfing the web \nremains a safe and viable option for our children. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure that they are able to learn and grow in an \nenvironment free of sexual predators and pornographic images. Clearly, \nthere is no substitute for parental supervision; yet, I think we can \nall agree that many parents know less about the Internet than their \nchildren do. Parents are convinced of the Internet's educational value, \nbut they also feel anxious about their ability to supervise their \nchildren while they use it. In my view, it is important that we \nencourage parents and children to use the Internet together. But \nclearly, it is difficult for any adult to monitor children on line all \nthe time.\n  Therefore, I believe we need to provide our parents with tools that \nwill help them to protect and to guide their children on the Internet. \nThe amendment I have offered here is a modest measure. It is not a \ncure-all by any stretch of the imagination. It is a modest idea and \njust requires that Internet access providers make screening software \navailable to customers purchasing Internet access services.\n  The amendment would allow customers to have the opportunity, as I \nsaid, to either buy or obtain free of charge, as determined by the \nprovider, screening software that permits customers to limit access to \nmaterial on the Internet that is harmful to minors. Like going to a \npharmacy and being asked if you want to buy a childproof lid for \nprescription medication, my bill will require that Internet access \nproviders ask parents whether they would like to obtain screening \nsoftware to protect them from the very kind of dangers that we see on \nthe 28,000 existing web sites and the 50 new ones that are added each \nday. This is a serious problem, and providing this kind of tool to \nparents is one way we can begin to combat the problem.\n  At any rate, I hope my colleagues will see fit to support this \namendment. It has been offered once before on the floor and passed the \nSenate overwhelmingly and, not unlike the Coats amendment, we need to \nhave it included in this bill today.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from Indiana for his fine work on many \nissues, but once again on this particular issue, and hope as well this \nsecond-degree amendment will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I am more than happy to accept the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I thank him for his tireless work on \nbehalf of children. It has been my pleasure to serve with him on both \nsides, the majority and minority, of the Children and the Families \nCommittee; under his chairmanship as ranking member, and now as \nchairman, with Senator Dodd as ranking member. He has been a tireless \nadvocate of children and addressing the particular concerns that \nchildren have to deal with, the problems they have to deal with growing \nup, and his support for this legislation and the amendment to my \namendment, which I think strengthens what we are attempting to do and \nis very reasonable, earlier offered by Senator McCain, to utilize the \nadvantages of software that allows for blocking.\n  We see this as, certainly, a useful tool. It is not a totally useful \ntool because there are a myriad of ways of defeating it. As we speak, \nthere are undoubtedly computer people far more savvy than this Senator, \nlooking for ways to bypass this and looking for ways to defeat it. But \nit is a helpful tool, and it should be available to parents to help \nthem in their efforts to protect their children from material that they \ndo not deem appropriate and that certainly is not appropriate.\n  I will be more than happy to accept the amendment. I do not know that \nwe need a rollcall vote on both. We can combine the two and I think we \nwill have a very worthwhile amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Dodd amendment, \nNo. 3780? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if my friend from Indiana and my friend \nfrom Connecticut will yield, I am not going to oppose this amendment. I \ncongratulate both of them, as they have been dedicated to raising the \nawareness of the garbage that we have on the Internet. No technology \nthat we can devise,\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nthat stays in place very long, is going to actually protect our young \nchildren from the pitfalls of the stuff that we find on there. The only \nthing that we can do, and I think both of them have done this very \nwell, is to raise the awareness of the need for adult supervision \nwhenever young people go on the Internet. That is the only way. That is \nthe only way we are going to get protection and also a public awareness \nand a public feeling that we are not going to do business with Internet \nproviders who offer this stuff.\n  We cannot protect and use this great tool called the glass highway \nand bring any integrity to it unless, No. 1, we secure it when I send a \nmessage to you. Of course, that is the encryption issue, and that is an \nissue we have to fight another day, as far as law enforcement \nsurveillance and this type of thing is concerned. But we cannot be \nlulled or rocked into a position of where we are in a basket of \ncomfort, thinking we have done the job and protected our children from \nthe pedophiles and the garbage that we find on the Internet, because \nthe Internet is going to reflect what we have in society. No matter \nwhere you go, you will find what you are looking for. It is going to be \nthere, too, just like it is downtown or any place in America.\n  So, I am not going to oppose this amendment. I do have some \nreservations about it because, No. 1, I think it is overreaching a \nlittle bit into industrial policy, as far as what we should be doing. \nBut I tell Americans, don't get comfortable in this basket of security \nbecause we have this amendment or that we have this legislation, that \nwe are still going to be susceptible to the people who prey on the \nInternet with garbage. We will never solve that problem. The only place \nit will be solved is through parents and us talking about it and \nraising the awareness that it is there. Parental supervision, \nsupervision in our schools and our libraries, that is the only way we \ndefeat this. Because basically we are decent people, that is what will \ndefeat it. That is what will finally crowd it off of there, and also \nsecure it, so maybe there will not be any room for it. I hope that \nwould be the case, also.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Indiana. I will miss him and his \nservice in the next U.S. Senate. But nobody has a more stellar record \nthan Senator Coats on these issues of family and decency in the public \nplace. I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, before my friend from Montana \nleaves the floor, I want to tell him how much I appreciate his work as \nchairman of the telecommunications subcommittee on the Commerce \nCommittee. My friend from Montana and I have had spirited discussions \nand debates on this overall issue. I understand his deeply held views, \nand I appreciate them. There is great attraction to his argument. There \nis a fine line in America between the prevention of material which is \noffensive being forced on our young people and censorship. So I \nunderstand the arguments that the Senator from Montana has made. But \nlet me say that it is a huge problem, and the Senator from Montana \nknows it as well as I do. It is a huge problem.\n  Anyone who operates the Internet today sees this proliferation of \nincredible trash that occurs, which is terribly, terribly disturbing to \nall of us--all of us on both sides of the aisle--because of the \ninfluence that it has on young Americans, not to mention older \nAmericans.\n  We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee. There was testimony that \nthere is a direct relation between pedophilia and the Internet. There \nare documented cases where pedophiles have corresponded with young \npeople on the Internet and enticed them into meeting. These stories are \nso terrible and graphic that I am reluctant to discuss them on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  It is a problem in American society when you look at the growth of \nthe Internet in America. All of us, especially those of us who serve on \nthe Commerce Committee, are aware of the incredible potential of the \nInternet, the unbelievable effects it is going to have on the Nation \nand the world. With the wiring of schools and libraries in America, for \nthe first time, every child in America, no matter whether they come \nfrom the Navajo Reservation and Chinlee High School or whether they \nattend Beverly Hills High School, are going to have access to knowledge \nand information like never before.\n  When you dial in the word ``teen'' on the Internet, or when you dial \nin the word ``nurse'' and the search engine comes up with a \nproliferation of pornography and advertisements for it, we have to try \nto address this problem.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has discussed this issue in committee \nhearings, the Senator from Oregon--all of us who are familiar with it. \nI will tell you right now, Mr. President, one of the problems is that a \nlot of us don't use the Internet like the now tens of millions of \nAmericans do, so we are not aware of this problem. And, no, none of us \nwould support censorship. No one is in favor of censorship.\n  I will tell you that when we have actual testimony before our \ncommittee by detectives who say that they go out and they find people \nwho entice young children through the Internet to meet with them and \nthen terrible things ensue, then obviously we have a problem. Recently \nin Phoenix, AZ, a young boy who was on the Internet viewing pornography \nwalked out and molested a 4-year-old child. It is a fact. It is a \ndocumented fact. Or parents in the library see pornography as they walk \nby and their children are in the library and see this.\n  I am not sure I know the answers. I don't know the answers, but I \nfirmly believe that we at least ought to make an effort to provide \nparents with the tools and institutions with the tools at least to \nfilter out some of this garbage, which brings me to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  I know of no one who is more involved in the issues of families and \nmorals and decency in America than is Senator Coats. I miss many of my \ncolleagues when they leave; some of them I don't miss. But the fact is, \nthe majority of them I do. I will miss Senator Coats because I view him \nas a moral compass around here.\n  When Senator Coats speaks on these issues, we all listen because he \nis a living example of what we want families in America to be about. \nSenator Coats has been involved in this particular effort on this piece \nof legislation for a long, long time.\n  I believe there may be some question about the bill's \nconstitutionality. Fine, we will let the courts decide that. I have \nsome questions myself. But it is a sad, but inescapable fact that \nmaterial harmful to children is pervasive on the Internet in America \ntoday. It is an indisputable fact. There is no Member of the Senate who \nis more qualified and has more credibility to address this issue than \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Montana is not going to \nseek a recorded vote on the second-degree amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut. Fairly shortly, if there is no other debate on this \namendment, we will move to a vote around noon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after adoption of the \nDodd second-degree amendment that the Senate vote at 12 noon on the \nCoats amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, I would like to reserve 1 \nminute for summation on the amendment that is being offered before the \nvote. Hopefully, I can do that before 12 o'clock. In case I can't, I \nwould like that 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I amend my unanimous consent request that the Senator \nfrom Indiana have 2 minutes prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. I want to use this \nunique opportunity to add my comments about the Senator from Indiana. I \nhave told people that I am enormously proud to serve in this body. One \nof the major reasons for that is the men and women with whom I serve, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, I think are \nthe best men and women I have been associated with in my entire life.\n  One of those is the Senator from Indiana. We became acquainted in \n1981 when we both were elected to the House of Representatives in the \nsame election, and although we perhaps have\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\nagreed and disagreed many times on many issues throughout the years, I \nhave deep admiration for Senator Coats and his family.\n  When he leaves the Senate, as is the case with so many of our \ncolleagues, the Senate will have lost a very important contributor on a \ngood many issues, this one most notable. He has been persistent on this \nissue and, as the Senator from Arizona just described, we have had \nhearings in the Commerce Committee about this issue. It desperately \nneeds attention, desperately needs a solution, and the Senator from \nIndiana has been a significant contributor in that effort. I did not \nwant to let this moment pass without sharing my respect for Senator \nCoats. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words from my \ncolleagues--the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senator from Arizona. I am also appreciative of their support \nfor this effort.\n  I don't know if any of us has a perfect answer to this. We do see the \nInternet, the World Wide Web, as one of the most extraordinary \ninvasions in the history of mankind. It can provide access to \ninformation that can revolutionize our world and provide opportunities \nfor people who heretofore have not had those opportunities for \nknowledge and for learning that are extraordinary.\n  At the same time, there is a dark side to the Internet. As with most \nnew technology, it can be used for good; it can be used for evil. \nUnfortunately, the Internet is no exception. None of us want to put \nourselves in the position of being a censor. We decry that material. We \ndon't think it sends the right kind of moral message. We wish we didn't \nhave it.\n  Yet, as a country dedicated to the freedom of speech, enshrined in \nits Constitution, we have to accept certain types of material that some \nof us consider offensive, but doesn't necessarily meet the obscenity \ntest that the Court has laid out, which is a pretty stringent test.\n  By the same token, surely--surely--we as a society can address the \nissue of how we protect the innocence of our children and whether we \ncan use reasonable means to give parents tools to protect that \ninnocence. That is what this amendment is about.\n  Software is an attempt to do that. We know from documented evidence \nthat software is only a partial solution, that it can be defeated, but \nI think it is helpful and we ought to utilize that and encourage it.\n  Beyond that, however, we need a sanction, a sanction that imposes \nsome requirements--technologically feasible requirements and \neconomically feasible requirements--on those who seek to bypass the \neffort to put any kind of restrictions on the availability of this \nmaterial to children.\n  We passed legislation earlier, the Communications Decency Act. Even \nthough the Congress and the people of America and the President \nsupported it, the Court did not support it. It struck it down. We have \ncarefully modified and changed this language in this bill that I \noffered earlier that the Senate passed to comply with those Court \nrestrictions.\n  We have made sure that it applies to minors; that the requirements \nput in place meet the Court's standard; that the language harmful to \nminors meets the Court-ordered test that was given to us years ago in \nthe Ginsberg case. We believe we have something here that not only is \nacceptable to the American people and to the Congress of the United \nStates and to the administration, but hopefully acceptable to the \nstandards imposed by the Supreme Court. So I thank my colleagues for \ntheir generous words. I thank them for their support.\n\n  The hour of 12 noon having approached, if there is any time left, I \nyield it back and hope we can go to a vote and pass this unanimously \nand send the kind of signal that we need to send, and that is that this \ncountry and this Congress is not going to stand for obscene material to \nbe pushed into children's minds through the Internet without reasonable \nrestrictions on that material.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nDodd amendment No. 3780 to the Coats amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3780) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          Vote on Amendment No. 3695, As Modified, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill was reported out of Committee \nlast week by voice vote. Because of time constraints at the end of the \nsession, we have been unable to file a committee report before offering \nit as an amendment on the Senate floor. Accordingly, I wish to take \nthis opportunity to explain the purpose and some of the important \nfeatures of the amendment.\n  In a matter of only a few months since Chairman McCain and I \nintroduced this bill last summer, we have been able to achieve a \nremarkable consensus. This is due in large part to the recognition by a \nwide range of constituencies that the issue is an important one that \nrequires prompt attention by Congress. It is due to revisions to our \noriginal bill that were worked out carefully with the participation of \nthe marketing and online industries, the Federal Trade Commission, \nprivacy groups, and first amendment organizations.\n  The goals of this legislation are: (1) to enhance parental \ninvolvement in a child's online activities in order to protect the \nprivacy of children in the online environment; (2) to enhance parental \ninvolvement to help protect the safety of children in online fora such \nas chatrooms, home pages, and pen-pal services in which children may \nmake public postings of identifying information; (3) to maintain the \nsecurity of personally identifiable information of children collected \nonline; and (4) to protect children's privacy by limiting the \ncollection of personal information from children without parental \nconsent. The legislation accomplishes these goals in a manner that \npreserves the interactivity of children's experience on the Internet \nand preserves children's access to information in this rich and \nvaluable medium.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Online Privacy \n     Protection Act of 1998.''\n     Section 202. Definitions\n       (1) Child: The amendment applies to information collected \n     from children under the age of 13.\n       (2) Operator: The amendment applies to ``operators.'' This \n     term is defined as the person or entity who both operates an \n     Internet website or online service and collects information \n     on that site either directly or through a subcontractor. This \n     definition is intended to hold responsible the entity that \n     collects the information, as well as the entity on whose \n     behalf the information is collected. This definition, \n     however, would not apply to an online service to the extent \n     that it does not collect or use the information.\n       The amendment exempts nonprofit entities that would not be \n     subject to the FTC Act. The exception for a non-profit entity \n     set forth in Section 202(2)(B) applies only to a true not-\n     for-profit and would not apply to an entity that operates for \n     its own profit or that operates in substantial part to \n     provide profits to or enhance the profitability of its \n     members.\n       (7) Parent: The term ``parent'' includes ``legal \n     guardian.''\n       (8) Personal Information: This is an online children's \n     privacy bill, and its reach is limited to information \n     collected online from a child.\n       The amendment applies to individually identifying \n     information collected online from a child. The definition \n     covers the online collection of a first and last name, \n     address including both street and city/town (unless the \n     street address alone is provided in a forum, such as a city-\n     specific site, from which the city or town is obvious), e-\n     mail address or other online contact information, phone \n     number, Social Security number, and other information that \n     the website collects online from a child and combines with \n     one of these identifiers that the website has also collected \n     online. Thus, for example, the information ``Andy from Las \n     Vegas'' would not fall within the amendment's definition of \n     personal information. In addition, the amendment authorizes \n     the FTC to determine through rulemaking whether this \n     definition should include any other identifier that permits \n     the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.\n       It is my understanding that ``contact'' of an individual \n     online is not limited to e-mail, but also includes any other \n     attempts to communicate directly with a specific, \n     identifiable individual. Anonymous, aggregate information--\n     information that cannot be linked by the operator to a \n     specific individual--is not covered by this definition.\n       (9) Verifiable Parental Consent: The amendment establishes \n     a general rule that ``verifiable parental consent'' is \n     required before a web site or online service may collect \n     information online from children, or use or disclose \n     information that it has collected online from children. The \n     amendment makes clear that parental consent need not be \n     obtained for each instance of information collection, but \n     may, with proper notice, be obtained by the operator for \n     future information collection, use and disclosure. Where \n     parental consent is required under the amendment, it means \n     any reasonable effort, taking into consideration available \n     technology, to provide the parent of a child with notice of \n     the website's information practices and to ensure that the \n     parent authorizes collection, use and disclosure, as \n     applicable, of the personal information collected from that \n     child.\n       The FTC will specify through rulemaking what is required \n     for the notice and consent to be considered adequate in light \n     of available technology. The term should be interpreted \n     flexibly, encompassing ``reasonable effort'' and ``taking \n     into consideration available technology.'' Obtaining written \n     parental consent is only one type of reasonable effort \n     authorized by this legislation. ``Available technology'' can \n     encompass other online and electronic methods of obtaining \n     parental consent. Reasonable efforts other than obtaining \n     written parental consent can satisfy the standard. For \n     example, digital signatures hold significant promise for \n     securing consent in the future, as does the World Wide Web \n     Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences. In \n     addition, I understand that the FTC will consider how \n     schools, libraries and other public institutions that \n     provide Internet access to children may accomplish the \n     goals of this Act.\n       As the term ``reasonable efforts'' indicates, this is not a \n     strict liability standard and looks to the reasonableness of \n     the efforts made by the operator to contact the parent.\n       (10) Website Directed to Children: This definition \n     encompasses a site, or that portion of a site or service, \n     which is targeted to children under age 13. The subject \n     matter, visual content, age of models, language or other \n     characteristics of the site or service, as well\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\n     as off-line advertising promoting the website, are all \n     relevant to this determination. For example, an online \n     general interest bookstore or compact disc store will not be \n     considered to be directed to children, even though children \n     visit the site. However, if the operator knows that a \n     particular visitor from whom it is collecting information is \n     a child, then it must comply with the provisions of this \n     amendment. In addition, if that site has a special area for \n     children, then that portion of the site will be considered to \n     be directed to children.\n       The amendment provides that sites or services that are not \n     otherwise directed to children should not be considered \n     directed to children solely because they refer or link users \n     to different sites that are directed to children. Thus a site \n     that is directed to a general audience, but that includes \n     hyperlinks to different sites that are directed to children, \n     would not be included in this definition but the child \n     oriented linked sites would be. By contrast, a site that is a \n     child-oriented director would be considered directed to \n     children under this standard. However, it would be \n     responsible for its own information practices, not those of \n     the sites or services to which it offers hyperlinks or \n     references.\n       (12) Online Contact Information: This term means an e-mail \n     address and other substantially similar identifiers enabling \n     direct online contact with a person.\n     Section 203. Regulation of unfair and deceptive acts and \n         practices\n       This subsection directs the FTC to promulgate regulations \n     within one year of the date of enactment prohibiting website \n     or online service operators or any person acting on their \n     behalf from violating the prohibitions of subsection (b). The \n     regulations shall apply to any operator of a website or \n     online service that collects personal information from \n     children and is directed to children, or to any operator \n     where that operator has actual knowledge that it is \n     collecting personal information from a child.\n       The regulations shall require that these operators adhere \n     to the statutory requirements set forth in Section 203(b)(1):\n       1. Notice--Operators must provide notice on their sites of \n     what personal information they are collecting online from \n     children, how they are using that information, and their \n     disclosure practices with regard to that information. Such \n     notice should be clear, prominent and understandable. \n     However, providing notice on the site alone is not sufficient \n     to comply with the other provisions of Section 202 that \n     require the operator to make reasonable efforts to provide \n     notice in obtaining verifiable parental consent, or the \n     provisions of Section 203 that require reasonable efforts to \n     give parents notice and an opportunity to refuse further use \n     or maintenance of the personal information collected from \n     their child. These provisions require that the operator make \n     reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent receives notice, \n     taking into consideration available technology.\n       2. Prior Parental Consent--As a general rule, operators \n     must obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, \n     use or disclosure of personal information collected online \n     from a child.\n       3. Disclosure and Opt Out for a Parent Who Has Provided \n     Consent: Subsection 203(b)(1)(B) creates a mechanism for a \n     parent, upon supplying proper identification, to obtain: (1) \n     disclosure of the specific types of personal information \n     collected from the child by the operator; and (2) disclosure \n     through a ``means that is reasonable under the \n     circumstances'' of the actual personal information the \n     operator has collected from that child. It would be \n     inappropriate for operators to be liable under another source \n     of law for disclosures made in a good faith effort to fulfill \n     the disclosure obligation under this subsection. Accordingly, \n     subsection 203(a)(2) provides that operators are immune from \n     liability under either federal or state law for any \n     disclosure made in good faith and following procedures that \n     are reasonable. If the FTC has not issued regulations, I \n     expect that such procedures would be judged by a court based \n     upon their reasonableness.\n       Subsection 203(b)(1)(B) also gives that parent the ability \n     to opt out of the operator's further use or maintenance in \n     retrievable form, or future online collection of information \n     from that child. The opt out of future collection operates as \n     a revocation of consent that the parent has previously given. \n     It does not prohibit the child from seeking to provide \n     information to the operator in the future, nor the operator \n     from responding to such a request by seeking (and obtaining) \n     parental consent. In addition, the opt out requirement \n     relates only to the online site or sites for which the \n     information was collected and maintained, and does not apply \n     to different sites which the operator separately maintains.\n       Subsection 203(b)(3) provides that if a parent opts out of \n     use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online \n     collection of personal information, the operator of the site \n     or service in question may terminate the service provided to \n     that child.\n       4. Curbing Inducements to Disclose Personal Information: \n     Subsection 203(b)(1)(C) prohibits operators from inducing a \n     child to disclose more personal information than reasonably \n     necessary in order to participate in a game, win a prize, or \n     engage in another activity.\n       5. Security Procedures: Subsection 203(b)(1)(D) requires \n     that an operator establish and maintain reasonable procedures \n     to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of \n     personal information collected online from children by that \n     operator.\n       Exceptions to Parental Consent: Subsection 203(b)(2) is \n     intended to ensure that children can obtain information they \n     specifically request on the Internet but only if the operator \n     follows certain specified steps to protect the child's \n     privacy. This subsection permits an operator to collect \n     online contact information from a child without prior \n     parental consent in the following circumstances: (A) \n     collecting a child's online contact information to respond on \n     a one-time basis to a specific request of the child; (B) \n     collecting a parent's or child's name and online contact \n     information to seek parental consent or to provide parental \n     notice; (C) collecting online contact information to respond \n     directly more than once to a specific request of the child \n     (e.g., subscription to an online magazine), when such \n     information is not used to contact the child beyond the scope \n     of that request; (D) the name and online contact information \n     of the child to the extent reasonably necessary to protect \n     the safety of a child participant in the site; and (E) \n     collection, use, or dissemination of such information as \n     necessary to protect the security or integrity of the site or \n     service, to take precautions against liability, to respond to \n     judicial process, or, to the extent permitted under other \n     provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement \n     agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.\n       For each of these exceptions the amendment provides \n     additional protections to ensure the privacy of the child. \n     For a one-time contact, the online contact information \n     collected may be used only to respond to the child and then \n     must not be maintained in retrievable form. In cases where \n     the site has collected the parents' online contact \n     information in order to obtain parental consent, it must not \n     maintain that information in retrievable form if the parent \n     does not respond in a reasonable period of time. Finally, if \n     the child's online contact information will be used, at the \n     child's request, to contact the child more than once, the \n     site must use reasonable means to notify parents and give \n     them the opportunity to opt out.\n       In addition, subsection (C)(ii) also allows the FTC the \n     flexibility to permit the site to recontact the child without \n     notice to the parents, but only after the FTC takes into \n     consideration the benefits to the child of access to online \n     information and services and the risks to the security and \n     privacy of the child associated with such access.\n       Paragraph (D) clarifies that websites and online services \n     offering interactive services directed to children, such as \n     monitored chatrooms and bulletin boards, that require \n     registration but do not allow the child to post personally \n     identifiable information, may request and retain the names \n     and online contact information of children participating \n     in such activities to the extent necessary to protect the \n     safety of the child. However, the company may not use such \n     information except in circumstances where the company \n     believes that the safety of a child participating on that \n     site is threatened, and the company must provide direct \n     parental notification with the opportunity for the parent \n     to opt out of retention of the information. For example, \n     there have been instances in which children have \n     threatened suicide or discussed family abuse in such fora. \n     Under these circumstances, an operator may use the name \n     and online contact information of the child in order to be \n     able to get help for the child.\n       Throughout this section, the amendment uses the term ``not \n     maintained in retrievable form.'' It is my intent in using \n     this language that information that is ``not maintained in \n     retrievable form'' be deleted from the operator's database. \n     This language simply recognizes the technical reality that \n     some information that is ``deleted'' from a database may \n     linger there in non-retrievable form.\n       Enforcement.--Subsection 203(c) provides that violations of \n     the FTC's regulations issued under this amendment shall be \n     treated as unfair or deceptive trade practices under the FTC \n     Act. As discussed below, State Attorneys General may enforce \n     violations of the FTC's rules. Under subsection 203(d), state \n     and local governments may not, however, impose liability for \n     activities or actions covered by the amendment if such \n     requirements would be inconsistent with the requirements \n     under this amendment or Commission regulations implementing \n     this amendment.\n     Section 204. Safe harbors\n       This section requires the FTC to provide incentives for \n     industry self-regulation to implement the requirements of \n     Section 203(b). Among these incentives is a safe harbor \n     through which operators may satisfy the requirements of \n     Section 203 by complying with self-regulatory guidelines that \n     are approved by the Commission under this section.\n       This section requires the Commission to make a \n     determination as to whether self-regulatory guidelines \n     submitted to it for approval meet the requirements of \n     Commission regulations issued under Section 203. The \n     Commission will issue, through rulemaking, regulations \n     setting forth procedures for the submission of self-\n     regulatory guidelines for Commission approval. The \n     regulations will require that such guidelines provide the \n     privacy protections set forth in Section 203. The Commission \n     will assess all elements of proposed self-regulatory \n     guidelines, including\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\n     enforcement mechanisms, in light of the circumstances \n     attendant to the industry or sector that the guidelines are \n     intended to govern.\n       The amendment provides that, once guidelines are approved \n     by the Commission, compliance with such guidelines shall be \n     deemed compliance with Section 203 and the regulations issued \n     thereunder.\n       The amendment requires the Commission to act upon requests \n     for approval of guidelines for safe harbor treatment within \n     180 days of the filing of such requests, including a period \n     for public notice and comment, and to set forth its \n     conclusions in writing. If the Commission denies a request \n     for safe harbor treatment or fails to act on a request within \n     180 days, the amendment provides that the party that sought \n     Commission approval may appeal to a United States district \n     court as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 706.\n     Section 205. Actions by States\n       State Attorneys General may file suit on behalf of the \n     citizens of their state in any U.S. district court of \n     jurisdiction with regard to a practice that violates the \n     FTC's regulations regarding online children's privacy \n     practices. Relief may include enjoining the practice, \n     enforcing compliance, obtaining compensation on behalf of \n     residents of the state, and other relief that the court \n     considers appropriate.\n       Before filing such an action, an attorney general must \n     provide the FTC with written notice of the action and a copy \n     of the complaint. However, if the attorney general determines \n     that prior notice is not feasible, it shall provide notice \n     and a copy of the complaint simultaneous to filing the \n     action. In these actions, state attorneys general may \n     exercise their power under state law to conduct \n     investigations, take evidence, and compel the production of \n     evidence or the appearance of witnesses.\n       After receiving notice, the FTC may intervene in the \n     action, in which case it has the right to be heard and to \n     file an appeal. Industry associations whose guidelines are \n     relied upon as a defense by any defendant to the action may \n     file as amicus curiae in proceedings under this section.\n       If the FTC has filed a pending action for violation of a \n     regulation prescribed under Section 3, no state attorney \n     general may file an action.\n     Section 206. Administration and applicability\n       FTC Enforcement: Except as otherwise provided in the \n     amendment, the FTC shall conduct enforcement proceedings. The \n     FTC shall have the same jurisdiction and enforcement \n     authority with respect to its rules under this amendment as \n     in the case of a violation of the Federal Trade Commission \n     Act, and the amendment shall not be construed to limit the \n     authority of the Commission under any other provisions of \n     law.\n       Enforcement by Other Agencies: In the case of certain \n     categories of banks, enforcement shall be carried out by the \n     Office of the Controller of the Currency; the Federal \n     Reserve Board, the Board of Directors of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union \n     Administration Board, and the Farm Credit Administration. \n     The Secretary of Transportation shall have enforcement \n     authority with regard to any domestic or foreign air \n     carrier, and the Secretary of Agriculture where certain \n     aspects of the Packers and Stockyards Act apply.\n     Section 207. Review\n       Within 5 years of the effective date for this amendment, \n     the Commission shall conduct a review of the implementation \n     of this amendment, and shall report to Congress.\n     Section 208. Effective date\n       The enforcement provisions of this amendment shall take \n     effect 18 months after the date of enactment, or the date on \n     which the FTC rules on the first safe harbor application \n     under section 204 if the FTC does not rule on the first such \n     application filed within one year after the date of \n     enactment, whichever is later. However, in no case shall the \n     effective date be later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n\n       list of supporters of children's internet privacy language\n\n       The Federal Trade Commission.\n       The Direct Marketing Association (representing 3,500 \n     domestic members).\n       GeoCities.\n       Time Warner.\n       Commercial Internet eXchange Association.\n       Disney.\n       AOL.\n       Highlights for Children.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Advertising Federation.\n       American Association of Advertising Agencies.\n       Center for Democracy & Technology.\n       Center for Media Education.\n       Viacom.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3721, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To make minor changes in the commission established by the \n                                 bill)\n\n       On page 17, beginning with line 18, strike through line 21 \n     on page 19 and insert the following:\n       (a) Establishment of Commission.--There is established a \n     commission to be known as the Advisory Commission on \n     Electronic Commerce (in this title referred to as the \n     ``Commission''). The Commission shall--\n       (1) be composed of 19 members appointed in accordance with \n     subsection (b), including the chairperson who shall be \n     selected by the members of the Commission from among \n     themselves; and\n       (2) conduct its business in accordance with the provisions \n     of this title.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commissioners shall serve for the life \n     of the Commission. The membership of the Commission shall be \n     as follows:\n       (A) 3 representatives from the Federal Government, \n     comprised of the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and the United States Trade Representative (or \n     their respective delegates).\n       (B) 8 representatives from State and local governments (one \n     such representative shall be from a State or local government \n     that does not impose a sales tax * * *) and one \n     representative shall be from a state that does not impose an \n     income tax.\n       (C) 8 representatives of the electronic commerce industry, \n     telecommunications carriers, local retail businesses, and \n     consumer groups, comprised of--\n       (i) 5 individuals appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (ii) 3 individuals appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (iii) 5 individuals appointed by the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives; and\n       (iv) 3 individuals appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n                           Amendment No. 3722\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Commission to examine model State legislation)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nnumbered 3722 be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3722.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, beginning with line 14, strike through line 2 \n     on page 25 and insert the following:\n       ``(D) an examination of model State legislation that--\n       ``(i) would provide uniform definitions of categories of \n     property, goods, service, or information subject to or exempt \n     from sales and use taxes; and\n       ``(ii) would ensure that Internet access services, online \n     services, and communications and transactions using the \n     Internet, Internet access service, or online services would \n     be treated in a tax and technologically neutral manner \n     relative to other forms of remote sales; and''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It is offered by \nmyself for Senators Gregg and Lieberman. The amendment instructs the \ncommission created in this bill to examine model state legislation and \nprovide definitions of what should be subject to or exempt from \ntaxation. Additionally, the Commission would be instructed to look \nspecifically at Internet transactions.\n  Some would like to see the scope of the commission expanded. This is \nnot necessary. The Commission may look at any form of remote sales, but \nit is not forced to.\n  This bill is about the Internet, and its potential as a new \ntechnology--but more importantly, as a medium for electronic commerce. \nThe Internet is not like the mail. It is not a monopoly. It is unlike \nanything that we have seen to date. For that reason we believe that it \nshould be protected from discriminatory taxation.\n  Mr. President, there will be some who seek to defeat this amendment \nor will offer second degree amendments to it regarding remote sales, \nspecifically mail order sales. We dealt with that subject specifically \nthe other day. My good friend from Arkansas offered an amendment to \noverturn the Quill decision regarding mail order sales. Senator Graham \nof Florida spoke in favor of the amendment. And then the Senate voted \non the matter. The amendment was defeated handily: 65-30. We don't need \nto revisit this issue again. If we do, I would hope the vote to table \nwould be the same.\n  We should let this commission do its work. We should not prejudge \nwhat they will decide or attempt to force them to examine certain \nsubjects or come to certain conclusions. That would be wrong and would \nundermine the mission of the Commission. The bi-partisan amendment \nbefore the Senate gives the commission free reign to decide what it \nbelieves is best and report such findings to the Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the McCain/Gregg/Lieberman amendment and defeat \nany second degree amendments that may be offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the McCain amendment, add the following:\n       (F) an examination of the effects of taxation, including \n     the absence of taxation, on all interstate sales \n     transactions, including transactions using the Internet, on \n     local retail businesses and on State and local governments, \n     which examination may include a review of the efforts of \n     State and local governments to collect sales and use taxes \n     owed on in-State purchases from out-of-State sellers.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi be added as \ncosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be modified by deleting the word ``local'' on line 6 of page \n1 of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is accepted.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment amends the McCain \nfirst-degree underlying amendment to allow the commission to establish \nby the Internet Tax Freedom Act a study of the effects of taxation on \ninterstate sales, or the lack thereof on retail businesses and State \nand local governments.\n  I can think of nothing more reasonable and nothing more common sense \nthan saying that the commission that we are creating should conduct a \nstudy to look at and examine the implications upon retail businesses \nand the implications upon local and State governments that this \nmoratorium and this bill would have.\n  The Senate rejected an amendment last week which would have \nimmediately authorized States to require out-of-State sellers to \ncollect sales taxes and remit them to the State in which the purchase \nwas made. My colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, offered that \namendment. I think that many of my colleagues who joined me in voting \nagainst this amendment would agree that this issue warrants further \nstudy.\n  Why not have the commission establish by this bill conduct a study \nand examine the issue that is so important to State and local \ngovernments and which is so important to local businesses that are \ntrying to survive and who are remitting those sales taxes. This issue, \nwhich is so critical, ought to be, I believe, examined and studied. For \nthe sake of small mom-and-pop businesses who find themselves in \ncompetition with Internet entities and other out-of-State sellers who \ndo not have to collect State sales taxes from out-of-State buyers, we \nshould allow the commission to study the impact that the lack of \ntaxation on these transactions has on small businesses.\n  For the sake of out-of-State sellers who do collect and remit sales \ntaxes while their competitors do not, let's allow the commission to \nstudy this issue. This is, in fact, a commission study.\n  It should be noted that Congress and Congress alone can either accept \nor eject the recommendations that the commission might make. The \nSupreme Court decided in the case of Quill v. North Dakota that States \ncannot require out-of-State sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on \ngoods purchased for use in a particular State, unless Congress \nauthorizes them to do so.\n  My amendment does not overturn Quill. I want to emphasize that. This \namendment does not overturn the Quill decision. It simply allows the \ncommission to study the implications, to study the ramifications of \nQuill on small businesses and State and local governments.\n  Electronic commerce is estimated to reach $8 billion in 1998. And by \nthe year 2002, electronic commerce is expected to reach $300 billion.\n  Let me say that the Internet is an incredible tool both for education \npurposes and business promotion. My amendment in no way is intended to \nthwart the growth of the Internet. Again, it merely says that in light \nof the incredible growth in electronic commerce that we have witnessed \nover the last 5 years and that we anticipate in the next 5 years that \nthis commission that we are about to create should have the right to \nexamine its impact on businesses serving local markets.\n  We will have an argument that my good friend from Arizona has \nargued--that this Internet Tax Freedom Act should focus solely on the \nInternet. But I argue that the Internet is a form of interstate \ncommerce just like mail order, just like catalog sales. And when we \ntalk about the impact of such interstate sales on local businesses, \nthere is no distinction between the three. We should not address this \nissue in a vacuum.\n  So the commission that is created ought to have the right to examine \nall of the implications of what we are doing and its impact upon that \nsmall businessman, that small businesswoman, that city, that county, \nthat State government, and the effect upon their revenue stream.\n  So the amendment I propose is a compromise. It is, I believe, one \nthat is worthy of support.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, let me say that I strongly support \nthe Gregg amendment. Let me say to the Senator from Arkansas, I think \nhis amendment is in the wrong place. I think it is supposed to go at \npage 25. But if we could work with him, we want to make sure that there \nis fair consideration of his amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me also say that the whole point of the Internet \nTax Freedom Act is to focus on electronic commerce. We have had, since \nthe beginning of this discussion, efforts to bring into this debate a \nvariety of other kinds of subjects, but it seems to me at a time when \nwe have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions, many of which have varied and \nsundry ideas with respect to electronic commerce and the Internet, what \nwe ought to do is stick to the subject at hand, and that is calling a \nbrief time-out to look at these issues, a time-out in which the \nInternet would be treated like everything else, by the way.\n  At various points in this debate we have heard about how we are \nestablishing a tax haven for the Internet. That is simply wrong. During \nthe moratorium, sales on the Internet would get treated just like other \nsales. It is very important now, with the extraordinary growth of the \nInternet, as our colleagues have noted, that we do this job right, \nwhich requires that we go forward with language such as that offered by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire to ensure that we focus on electronic \ncommerce.\n  By doing that, we also increase the prospects for making sure that at \nthe end of our work we have a policy that guarantees technological \nneutrality. We don't have that today in America. We have parts of the \ncountry, for example, where you get the newspaper through traditional \nmail, and you pay no tax on it. But if you read that very same \nnewspaper on line, you pay a tax. That is not technologically neutral. \nThat is what our legislation is all about. The Internet should not get \na preference, nor should the Internet be discriminated against. It \nseems to me that by adopting the Gregg amendment we will ensure that \nthe focus is on electronic commerce, No. 1; No. 2, we will have a \nchance to look at the very complicated and technical questions dealing \nwith what is close to 30,000 taxing jurisdictions, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the original Gregg amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas as a second degree to the \namendment offered by myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman, \nwhich is the underlying amendment here. I think the Senator from \nOregon, who has certainly\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\nbeen a core player in bringing this matter to the Senate, outlined the \nissue rather well by pointing out that the purpose of this moratorium \nand the commission that is created under the moratorium should be to \nreview the electronic commerce under the Internet and to pursue a path \nwhich will make that commerce more efficient.\n  This bill, this attempt to protect the Internet from arbitrary \ntaxation across the country with the 30,000 potential municipalities \nthat could assess against the Internet and thus create chaos in what is \ntruly one of the great engines of prosperity and economic \nentrepreneurship which has occurred within this century, and may be the \neconomic engine for the next century--this bill, which is an attempt to \nput a hold on that sort of tax policy which might undermine, \nfundamentally harm, the expansion of the Internet during this formative \nperiod is a good bill, but it should not be used to bootstrap other \nissues onto the question.\n  What is being attempted here is a backdoor bootstrapping of the whole \nissue of tax policy as it relates to the question of sales at distant \npoints, whether it happens to be under the Internet, cable, catalogs or \nby telephone. And another study in this area, which is the proposal \nthat is put forward by the Senator from Arkansas, is simply an attempt \nto broaden the scope of the underlying effort, which is to protect and \naddress the issues that evolve around the Internet. It is totally \ninappropriate. There is no reason we should go down that road.\n  There have been enumerable studies of this issue already. In fact, I \nhave two right here, one done by the League of Cities and the other \ndone by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. I also understand \nthere has been one done by the Governors' Association, I believe. The \nfact is, the issues which are being raised by the Senator from Arkansas \nhave been studied and studied extensively. Putting another study into \nthis bill is not going to in any way change the tenor of the debate. It \nis simply going to attempt to expand the debate into a whole separate \narena, which is inappropriate to this moratorium.\n  The bottom line of this moratorium--and I will come to that after we \nhave disposed of the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, but the \nbottom line issue here is whether or not by voting to expand the \nmoratorium and to get into areas such as the Senator from Arkansas has \nproposed we wish to dramatically expand the taxing authority of States \nand local jurisdictions and basically use this bill to become a huge \nvehicle for expansion in tax policy and expansion of taxes.\n  I do not think that most Members of this body want to do that, and we \nalready voted on this issue once with the Bumpers amendment. The vote \nwas overwhelming. This body said no, it did not want to use this \nvehicle for the purposes of creating an explosion in new taxes. And yet \nthere is another attempt being made now to do that, this time through a \nstudy. We will hear another attempt, I suspect, from the Senator from \nFlorida who will do that with his amendment to this bill and this \nunderlying amendment.\n  So I guess what it comes down to is that this body has to make a \npolicy decision: Does it want to use the Internet bill and the \nprotection of the Internet, which has been proposed through the \nmoratorium, which has been energized in large part by the Senator from \nOregon, and obviously the Senator from Arizona, and which I have \nstrongly supported, does it want to use that effort to try to protect \nthe Internet to also be an effort to grossly expand the tax laws of \nthis country and the tax policy of this country and the tax activity of \nmunicipalities and States, or do we want to stay focused on the subject \nat hand, which is how to make the Internet an efficient and effective \nplace to do business, how to keep it as a dynamic engine for \nentrepreneurship and prosperity that it has become through a moratorium \non taxes which might be assessed at the local community level?\n  Although this amendment is couched in the terms of a study, it really \ngets back to that core issue of whether or not we want to have a \nmoratorium which addresses the Internet or whether we want to use this \nmoratorium as a bootstrapping event for purposes of dramatically \nincreasing taxes and the tax collection capacity of local communities \nand States across the country.\n  I oppose this study. I think it is misdirected to be attached to this \nbill, and I would say that if you really are interested in such a \nstudy, here is one you can read. Here is another one you can read. And \nthe Governors' Association has one you can read. You don't have to pay \nfor a new one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there a time \nlimit on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time limit has been agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first let us come back to what we are \nfundamentally about. What the Internet Tax Freedom Act says is that \nthere shall be a moratorium, a pause, in the State and local \ngovernments' exercise of their otherwise legal authority to impose a \ntax on access to or transactions consummated over the Internet.\n  That is an unusual action. For the Congress of the United States to \npreempt State and local governments from their otherwise lawful \nresponsibilities to establish what they feel to be appropriate policy \nfor their citizens is an unusual act for the Congress and one which we \nshould only take after careful consideration.\n  Why should we exercise such care? Because the consequences of this \naction, of establishing a moratorium on the taxation of one form of \ncommerce as opposed to all forms of commerce, is to create or to \ncontinue a competitive disparity. In this case, it is the comparative \ndisparity between the Main Street retailer, the person who is selling \nhardware on Main Street and is legally responsible for collecting a \nsales tax from those who purchase hammers and saws, and those who buy \nthe same hammers and saws over the Internet where they are not subject \nto the requirement to pay, and the seller to collect, that same sales \ntax. That is a level of obvious inequity that we would, only under \nexception circumstances, impose.\n  Second, at a time when we are underscoring our commitment to \nfundamental activities such as law enforcement and education, we are \nabout to drive a major hole in the ability to do so of those levels of \ngovernment which have the primary responsibility for law enforcement \nand education, which are our colleagues at the State and local level. I \nwill be giving some current examples, as recently as today's newspaper, \nof the potential that we are about to open up.\n  So it would only take an extremely persuasive argument to convince \nthe Congress of the United States that it ought to inflict that \ninequality in the marketplace and the threat to the ability to deliver \nfundamental police, fire, and educational services at the local level \nas this legislation does.\n  What is that rationale? The rationale: This is a new, rapidly \nevolving technology and we need to have this pause so we can assure \nthat whatever tax policies are developed are developed with uniformity, \nwith nondiscrimination, with predictability, so as not to interfere \nwith the natural growth and evolution of this very important part of \nour commerce at the end of the 20th century that no doubt will play \neven a larger role as we go into the 21st. That is the argument for the \ndiscrimination and threat to State and local governments for which we \nare about to be asked to vote.\n  I will personally support the basic proposition of a pause. But I \nwill only do so if that pause is for a reasonable period of time, that \nperiod of time that we would consider necessary to carry out this \nreview and recommendation as to uniform, nondiscriminatory, predictable \ntax policy, and, second, that we have a commission, which is going to \nbe making this study, which will represent all of the diversity of \ninterests on this matter and will have a charter broad enough to look \nat all the questions that are relevant to establishing proper policy \nfor the Internet.\n  The argument here is a direct clash between what the Senate Finance \nCommittee found and what the authors of this amendment support. The \nlanguage which I support is the language which is in the bill that was \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee with 19 favorable votes.\n\n[[Page S11662]]\n\n  If you will look in the bill that appears on our desk, starting on \npage 22, which is the beginning of the issues to be studied, as stated \nby the Senate Finance Committee, on page 23, under paragraph (d), the \nFinance Committee, under the leadership of Senator Roth, who advocated \nthis language, states that:\n\n       . . . there will be an examination of the efforts of State \n     and local governments to collect sales and use taxes owed on \n     purchases from interstate sellers, the advantages and \n     disadvantages of authorizing State and local governments to \n     require such sellers to collect and remit such taxes, \n     particularly with respect to electronic commerce, and the \n     level of contact sufficient to permit a State or local \n     government to impose such taxes on such interstate commerce.\n\n  That is the essence of the language that the McCain-Gregg-Lieberman \namendment is going to strike.\n  Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues, is that unreasonable for a \ncommission we are going to set up to study the effects of Internet \ntaxation on State and local governments and on fairness in the \nmarketplace? Is that language unfair? I do not believe it is. The \nMcCain amendment would strike that language.\n  Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has worked very diligently on \nthis issue--and I commend him for his leadership on this matter and his \ndeep understanding of the implications of this issue--has offered a \nsecond-degree amendment to the McCain amendment which essentially \ninserts the same concept of Senator Roth's language that was in the \nFinance Committee. His amendment would provide for ``an examination of \nthe effects of taxation, including the absence of taxation on all \ninterstate sales transactions, including transactions using the \nInternet, on local retail businesses and on State and local \ngovernments, which examination may include a review of the efforts of \nState and local governments to collect sales and use taxes owed on in-\nState purchases from out-of-State sellers.''\n  That is the amendment that Senator Hutchinson has offered which I \nthink is as eminently reasonable as the language which was offered by \nSenator Roth in the Finance Committee. So I strongly support Senator \nHutchinson's very thoughtful and significant amendment and would go on \nto say that current events are underscoring the urgency of this look at \nall forms of remote sales.\n  One of the purposes of the underlying bill is to eliminate \ndiscrimination. That raises the question, Discrimination in \nrelationship to what? If we end up with a bill that says that the \ncommission cannot even look at the taxation and the effect of that \ntaxation on fairness in the marketplace and on the ability of State and \nlocal governments to support their police and fire and schools, we are \nalready guaranteeing that the commission will give us a report that, in \norder to be nondiscriminatory, the Internet should not be subject to \ntaxation. That would make it the same as catalog sales. That would be a \nresult with very serious long-term implications.\n  If, on the other hand, we are able to adopt the language that either \nwas in the underlying bill or the language that Senator Hutchinson has \noffered, then the commission is going to look at the taxation of all \nforms of remote sales and will be able to come back with a set of \npolicy regulations that will in fact meet the test of uniformity, \nnondiscrimination, and predictability, which is the whole purpose of \nthis exercise.\n  I said the issue is one that is as topical as today's paper. I refer \nyou to the Washington Post of October 7, on page C-10, which carries a \nstory, ``Publisher, Bookseller Join Forces.''\n  I will not read the whole article but let me just give you a flavor \nof what it says:\n\n       Taking direct aim at Amazon.com, publishing conglomerate \n     Bertelsmann AG said [yesterday] it will spend $200 million to \n     buy half of the online book service of Barnes & Noble.\n\n  So, what we have is a major bookseller which already has an on-line \nservice, where they are selling through the Internet as well as through \ntheir Barnes & Noble megabookstores; now they have sold half of their \non-line service to yet another publisher, the publisher who has well \nknown book houses such as Random House, Doubleday, and Bantam \nPublishing. They now together own an on-line bookselling firm which is \ngoing to try to compete with Amazon.com.\n  Why are they doing this? While still a tiny segment of the book \nretailing marketplace, on-line sales are exploding in popularity. I \nunderscore ``exploding in popularity.''\n\n       Seattle-based Amazon.com, founded three years ago, had \n     revenues of $204 million in the first six months of 1998.\n  The implications of this to the independent bookstores in Helena, MT, \nor in Concord, NH, are obvious. In addition to the other benefits of \nconvenience of the Internet, we are now going to have a situation \nwhere, if you buy a copy of your book at the Main Street independent \nbookstore, you are going to be paying the State and local sales tax, \nbut if you buy it over the Internet, you will not be paying the sales \ntax, and, thus, we are institutionalizing a significant competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  Why we would want to adopt the policy that puts the Main Street \nseller at a disadvantage to cyberspace is beyond me. It also happens to \nbe beyond a number of important organizations, whose letters I will ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record immediately after my \nremarks, beginning with the National Home Furnishings Association, \nwhich states:\n\n       The home furnishing industry has struggled with the issue \n     of whether there is an obligation for remote sellers to \n     collect and remit sales/use taxes to the state in which the \n     purchaser resides on sales of furniture, long before the \n     first sale was made on the Internet.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       In addition to the lost revenue to the state, the in-state \n     retailer is placed at a distinct disadvantage. There is, of \n     course, the differential in the customer's total cost \n     reflecting the sales/use tax. . . . Indeed, many times they \n     serve as the unwilling ``showroom'' and sales adviser for the \n     remote seller, as customers visit their store, discuss a \n     purchase with the sales staff, scribble down model numbers \n     and then call the remote seller.\n\n  That is an example of the kind of institutionalization of competitive \ndisadvantage we are about to enact.\n  I also ask to have printed immediately after my remarks a letter from \nthe Newspaper Association of America representing 1,700 newspaper \nmembers. This organization has supported the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nbut they state:\n\n       . . . I am writing to express support for your efforts to \n     amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to ensure that the \n     advisory commission examines the tax treatment of all remote \n     sales. . . . The major thrust behind the Internet Tax Freedom \n     Act is to ensure that the Internet is not subjected to \n     unfair, discriminatory and inconsistent taxes at the state \n     and local level. Proponents of the legislation--including \n     NAA--have argued that business transactions and services \n     should be treated similarly regardless of whether they are \n     offered through electronic means or through existing channels \n     of commerce. However, if the commission is not directed in \n     the legislation to examine all remote sales, a discriminatory \n     tax structure could be established that treats one form of \n     remote sales--the Internet--differently from other forms of \n     remote sales. Therefore, we believe a comprehensive approach \n     works best.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nNational Home Furnishings Association and the Newspaper Association of \nAmerica be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the second issue which is directly related \nto the first, the first being the discrimination against the local Main \nStreet sale, is the impact on the ability of local governments and \nState governments to carry out their fundamental educational, health, \nand other responsibilities. I will be a Floridian for a moment and cite \nsome of the statistics about the potential impact that an out-of-\ncontrol moratorium leading to permanent exemption from taxation of the \nInternet could have on a State such as mine.\n  In 1996, the State of Florida collected a total of $11.4 billion in \ngeneral sales tax revenue. This represented 77.3 percent of Florida's \ntax revenue generated from sales and excise taxes, excise taxes \nrepresenting $3.8 billion of that total.\n  Florida is not unique in having a high percentage of its tax revenue \ngenerated by sales and excise taxes. For instance, Nevada gets 84.3 \npercent of its total revenue from these two\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\nsources; Texas, 81 percent; South Dakota, 78.4 percent; Tennessee, 76.7 \npercent; Washington, 74.3 percent; Mississippi, 67.3 percent; Hawaii, \n61.7 percent; Arizona, 57 percent; North Dakota, 56.8 percent; and New \nMexico, 56.7 percent. They are examples of States which are heavily \ndependent on sales and excise taxes, the kind of taxes that are \ngenerated by Main Street activity.\n  Currently, mail order nationwide has sales of $100 billion to $120 \nbillion a year. That is the catalog of remote selling. This results in \nan estimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion in lost sales tax. It is \nestimated, for instance, in the State of Florida that that would \nrepresent something in excess of $200 million a year in lost sales. \nThat is, if the same sale had taken place at the local shopping mall \nthat took place over the remote sales catalog process, it would have \nbeen an additional $200 million of sales tax collected.\n  Internet sales are expected to grow by the year 2004, not to the $100 \nbillion to $120 billion of current catalog sales, but rather to $400 \nbillion to $500 billion. So Internet sales, by the year 2004, are \nexpected to be four to five times what current catalog sales are. If \n$100 billion in sales loses $3.5 billion, then the $500 billion would \nrepresent a loss of $17.5 billion. For Florida, this means there could \nbe an estimated loss of $875 million in sales tax per year as a result \nof this removing of the responsibility of the Internet seller to \ncollect the taxes on those transactions.\n  Florida's Department of Revenue states that the cost of exempted \nInternet taxation costs the State $60 million in sales tax revenue and \n$18 million for the gross receipts tax. This gross receipts tax is what \nis used to fund our school construction costs.\n  Mr. President, the impact of this on State and local governments in \ntheir ability to put an adequate number of police on the streets and an \nadequate fire defense, and particularly an adequate number of schools \nand teachers and the other support personnel necessary for their \neducational system, will be extremely vulnerable if this legislation \ngets out of control.\n  This is the amendment which I believe begins to break the dam of \nreasonability. It is reasonable to have a brief pause to look at all of \nthe implications of Internet taxation. I support that brief pause. It \nis also reasonable to look at one that is conducted by people who \nrepresent all the interests that will be affected by these decisions \nand that those persons have a charter broad enough to give us wise, \ncomprehensive policy.\n  To adopt the McCain-Gregg-Lieberman amendment, which would \nessentially say we are going to put a blindfold over our eyes and we \nwill not be able to look at those remote sales activities which are the \nmost analogous to what the potential for Internet sales would be, is, \nin my opinion, to render this legislation ineffective in terms of its \npurpose and to strengthen the doubts that some of us have that its real \npurpose is, not to have a thoughtful examination, but rather to have \nthis as the beginning of what will be a permanent bar to State and \nlocal governments' ability to manage their fiscal affairs and that the \nprincipal loser of this will be the shuttered stores along Main Street \nof the traditional seller, like the bookstore unable to compete when he \nor she has to collect the local sales tax but its competitor thousands \nof miles away does not, and will also be seen in the diminishment of \nvital public services, especially the education of our children.\n\n  So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I strongly support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas as eminently reasonable \nand consistent with the stated purpose of this legislation, and I urge \nits adoption.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                     National Home\n\n\n                                      Furnishings Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\nNHFA Concerns With Proposed Manager's Amendment to S. 442, the Internet \n                            Tax Freedom Act\n\n       The home furnishings industry has struggled with the issue \n     of whether there is an obligation for remote sellers to \n     collect and remit sales/use taxes to the state in which the \n     purchaser resides on sales of furniture, long before the \n     first sale was made on the Internet. Sales are frequently \n     made over the telephone or through the mails.\n       In addition to the lost revenue to the state, the in-state \n     retailer is placed at a distinct disadvantage. There is, of \n     course, the differential in the customer's total cost \n     reflecting the sales/use tax. However, the in-state retailer \n     also makes a significant investment in the community. Indeed, \n     many times they serve as the unwilling ``showroom'' and sales \n     adviser for the remote seller, as customers visit their \n     store, discuss a purchase with the sales staff, scribble down \n     model numbers and then call a remote seller.\n       NHFA has long sought a consistent, realistic definition of \n     what constitutes nexus for the purpose of determining the \n     sales/use tax obligation of a remote seller.\n       S. 442 imposes a moratorium on so-called telecommunication \n     taxes, and establishes a commission to examine a variety of \n     issues. Both the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees' \n     versions of the bill, as does the House bill, include \n     language authorizing the commission to examine the issue of \n     the obligation of remote sellers to collect and remit a \n     variety of taxes includes sales and use taxes. For example, \n     the Senate Finance Committee bill states: ``an examination of \n     the efforts of State and local governments to collect sales \n     and use taxes owed on purchases from interstate sellers, the \n     advantages and disadvantages of authorizing State and local \n     governments to require such sellers to collect and remit such \n     taxes, particularly with respect to electronic commerce, and \n     the level of contracts sufficient to permit a State or local \n     government to impose such taxes on such interstate \n     commerce.''\n       We have learned that a proposed manager's amendment would \n     severely limit the scope of the commission's mission and \n     strike the language allowing an examination of the broader \n     sales/use tax issue.\n       If a moratorium on telecommunication taxes is enacted, even \n     though it does not technically apply to sales/use taxes on \n     the purchase of the goods themselves, the moratorium will \n     still have a chilling impact on the collection of those \n     taxes. We thought we could live with that moratorium, in the \n     belief we would gain more in the long run, if the commission \n     could resolve once and for all, the broader issue of \n     jurisdiction over remote sellers for all tax purposes \n     including sales and use taxes. It would seem to us, if the \n     manager's amendment strips the commission of the authority to \n     examine the nexus issue, we get the worst of both worlds.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Newspaper Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                      Vienna, VA, October 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the more than 1,700 \n     newspaper members of the Newspaper Association of America \n     (NAA), I am writing to express support for your efforts to \n     amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to ensure that the \n     advisory commission examines the tax treatment of all remote \n     sales. As you are aware, we have supported and continue to \n     support enactment of the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n       The major thrust behind the Internet Tax Freedom Act is to \n     ensure that the Internet is not subjected to unfair, \n     discriminatory and inconsistent taxes at the state and local \n     level. Proponents of the legislation--including NAA--have \n     argued that business transactions and services should be \n     treated similarly regardless of whether they are offered \n     through electronic means or through existing channels of \n     commerce. However, if the commission is not directed in the \n     legislation to examine all remote sales, a discriminatory tax \n     structure could be established that treats one form of remote \n     sales--the Internet--differently from other forms of remote \n     sales. Therefore, we believe a comprehensive approach works \n     best.\n       We believe the Internet Tax Freedom Act provides a unique \n     opportunity for a thoughtful and deliberative examination of \n     a uniform tax structure for goods and services. By including \n     all remote sales in the scope of the advisory commission's \n     work, the Congress is encouraging the development of tax \n     policies that present one set of rules that will be applied \n     to all businesses. A uniform approach not only promotes \n     fairness and consistency--it's sound public policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John F. Sturm,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SANTORUM). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Gregg amendment and the \nrejection of the Hutchinson amendment. First, it is quite clear that \nthis legislation is going to, in fact, study all of the questions \nrelated to the subject this bill deals with thoroughly. Let me just \nread into the Record exactly what it says with respect to what will be \nstudied. It says:\n\n       The Commission shall conduct a thorough study of Federal, \n     State and local, and international taxation and tariff \n     treatment of transactions using the Internet and Internet \n     access and other comparable interstate or international sales \n     activities.\n\n  So it is right there at pages 21 and 22.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. In just 1 minute I will be happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\n  It is quite clear, at page 21 and page 22, that there will be ``a \nthorough study'' of the issues and that the commission will look at \n``comparable interstate or international sales activities.''\n  The question, Mr. President, and colleagues, is whether or not we are \ngoing to focus on yesterday's concerns, which are the mail-order or \ncatalog issues--and they are important ones--or are we going to look at \ntrying to come up with some sensible policies with respect to \ntomorrow's issues which essentially involve the ground rules for the \ndigital economy.\n  Somehow, those that want to look at mail-order and catalog sales feel \nthat they can resolve all of their concerns on this legislation. We \nfeel otherwise. The reason that it is so important to have the Gregg \nlanguage is that it does put the focus on electronic commerce. I and \nothers believe that if we do look at electronic commerce, and look at \nit thoughtfully, that it may, in fact, come up with some answers to \nthese other issues--mail-order and catalog questions, which are \nimportant--but if we change the focus of this bill, which is \nessentially what the Senator from Arkansas wants to do, I believe what \nis going to happen is, A, we will not get any sensible ground rules for \nelectronic commerce, nor will we deal with the issues with respect to \nmail orders.\n  The fact of the matter is that Main Street America overwhelmingly has \nendorsed this bill. We have entered into the Record the list of the \ngroups that are for it. And the reason that Main Street has endorsed \nthis legislation is that if you are a small business on a main street \nin rural Arkansas or rural Oregon, or any other part of the country \nthat is essentially rural, right now you are having a lot of difficulty \ncompeting against the Wal-Marts and the economic giants in our country.\n  The Internet is a great equalizer. By having a web page, by having \nthe ability to do business on line, that Main Street business in rural \nOregon or rural America, for the first time, has the ability, in an \ninexpensive way, to market and look at lucrative markets around the \nworld.\n  Picture, if we will, what will happen to a home-based business in \nWyoming or Arkansas or Oregon if we do nothing. There are 100,000 of \nthese home-based businesses in my State alone. They are the fastest \ngrowing part of our economy, and if we do not come up with some uniform \ntax treatment for these home-based businesses, what is going to happen \nis they will be subject to scores of different taxes all over America.\n  How is a home-based business in the State of Oregon or the State of \nArkansas going to go out and hire a battery of accountants and lawyers \nand experts to help them sort this out? They are not going to be able \nto do it. And that is why, when we had the hearings on this legislation \nin the Senate Commerce Committee, we heard from a small Tennessee \nbusiness that tried to operate through this thicket of different kinds \nof State and local rules and ended up going out of business.\n  These home-based businesses are simply not going to be able to hire \nthe battery of experts and accountants and lawyers that some of those \nwho have opposed this legislation are going to mandate on these small \nbusinesses. So I hope that we can stick to the issue in front of us. \nThat would mean going forward with the Gregg amendment and rejecting \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The Senator from Arkansas did ask me to yield, and I am happy to do \nso.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  In the early part of your remarks, you emphasized and read from the \nbill that the commission would be authorized to conduct a thorough \nstudy. You emphasized the word ``thorough.'' I think you found a couple \nplaces where the term is used. It seems you are implying they will look \nat all issues affected by this legislation and by Internet sales.\n  My question is, why, if in fact it is to be a thorough study looking \nat all issues and all the implications and ramifications of Internet \nsales on retailers and on government, why then would the Gregg \namendment exclude, in effect, say this is off the table, this is one \narea of issues you cannot look at? When the Finance Committee, by a \nvote of 19-1, said this should be included, this should be an area that \nshould be examined, this should be the purview of the commission, why \nthen, if it is to be a thorough study, would this amendment, the Gregg \namendment, exclude this particular area from study?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reclaiming my time, as I said, the debate here is over, Do \nyou want to focus on the subject of this bill, which is electronic \ncommerce--that is what the legislation does; that is what the Gregg \namendment seeks to do--or are we going to go back and study in this \nlegislation essentially yesterday's economy?\n  We believe that if you put the focus on electronic commerce--that is \nwhat the Gregg amendment does--we are going to be able to deal with the \ndigital economic issues; and we may well, in fact, come up with some \nideas and some innovative approaches that may well resolve the mail-\norder and catalog question as well.\n  My concern, and the concern of the Senator from New Hampshire, is \nthat essentially this is going to change the focus of this legislation \nto put it on the mail-order and catalog issues. There are Members of \nthe U.S. Senate who feel that mail-order and catalog sales are \ninsufficiently taxed. I am not one of them. I am one who believes that \nwe all ought to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with \ntomorrow's set of economic concerns, which involves the digital \neconomy.\n  I tell the Senator from Arkansas that as the original sponsor of this \nlegislation, I have made more than 30 separate changes to this \nlegislation in an effort to accommodate what I think are valid concerns \nwhich come from States and municipalities and others who are advocating \nthe viewpoint of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  But what I am not willing to support is essentially changing the \nfocus of this legislation. If we do that, I believe that the 100,000 \nhome-based businesses in my State, and the hundreds of thousands across \nthis country, are not going to see their concerns addressed; I think we \nwill not be taking advantage of the opportunity to look at the Internet \nissues objectively, and we will lose that focus and take it off into \nanother area which is, in my view, likely to not produce consensus with \nrespect to the mail-order or catalog issue, nor make the progress we \nneed to with respect to the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by my friend from Arkansas. This amendment addresses the issue \nthat is being changed by the Senator from New Hampshire. The second-\ndegree amendment would change things back to the way that they were.\n  We have to take a look at the Internet sales tax issue for people who \nmight be using this piece of legislation to develop huge loopholes in \nour current system. I am not talking about changing the system. I am \ntalking about preserving for those cities, towns, counties, and States \nthat rely on sales tax the ability to collect the tax they are \ncurrently getting.\n  We are talking about a 2-year moratorium. Do you know how much the \nInternet will change in a 2-year period? Right now, with the current \ntechnology in the Internet, there are ways I could eliminate every \nsingle bit of retail sales tax in the United States, every day, if this \nbill passes. And I don't think that is our intent.\n  I don't care if we have 30 amendments; if it needs 40 amendments, we \nwill have to have 40 amendments. The number of amendments has nothing \nto do with the issue that we are addressing. There are some critical \nissues here that have to be solved to keep the stability of State and \nlocal government--just the stability of it--not increase sales tax, \njust protect what is there right now.\n  We introduce these amendments because we don't think there is \nadequate protection now. An increase in catalog sales, I agree, is a \ntopic for another time. It is very important we don't build electronic \nloopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one that is \ngrowing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology \nvirtually every day. What we know as the Internet today is not what we \nwill be using by the time this report comes\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nout. More people are using it every day.\n  It is fascinating to me that one of the biggest areas of increased \nuse of the Internet is by senior citizens. It probably has something to \ndo with the quality of entertainment. If they do use computers, they \nare spending an average of 6 hours a day on the Internet. Part of that \nis purchasing; part of that is learning.\n  The stated purpose of this bill is:\n\n       To establish a national policy against state and local \n     government interference with interstate commerce on the \n     Internet or interactive computer services, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       To establish a national policy against State and local \n     government interference. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional \nresponsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I \nunderstand the desire of the bill's sponsors to protect and promote the \ngrowth of Internet commerce. Internet commerce is an exciting field. It \nhas a lot of growth potential. The new business will create millions of \nnew jobs in the coming years.\n  The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants \ndon't have to go where the people are. For people in my State, that \nmeans their products are no longer confined to a local market. They \ndon't have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big \ncity folks. They don't have to travel all the way to Asia to display \ntheir goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a \nremarkable development, and it will push more growth for small \nmanufacturers in rural America, especially in my State. We are just \nbeginning to see some of the economic potential in the Internet. It is \na valuable resource because it provides access on demand. It brings \ninformation to your fingertips when you want it and how you want it.\n  We should probably take another look at using it on the Senate floor, \nbut we need laptops for that; I will save that issue for another day.\n  Having said that, I do have concerns about the bill before the Senate \ntoday. I come to this debate having been the mayor of a small town, \nGillette, WY, for 8 years. I later served in the State house for 5 \nyears and the State senate for 5 years. Throughout my public life I \nhave always worked to reduce taxes, to return more of people's hard-\nearned wages to them.\n  I am not here to argue in favor of taxes. There were times in \nGillette when we had to make tough decisions. I was mayor during the \nboom time when the size of our town doubled in just a few years. We had \nto be very creative to be sure that our revenue sources would cover the \nnecessary public services--important services like sewer, water, curb \nand gutter, filling in potholes, shoveling snow, collecting garbage, \nmostly water. It is a tough job because the impact of your decision is \nfelt by all of your neighbors. They can look you in the eye. One of the \nbiggest problems with local government is the ``Oh, by the ways.'' You \ngo to dinner and somebody says, ``By the way, I have a little problem. \nDon't get up and solve it. Tomorrow morning will be fine.'' And \ntomorrow morning they know if you solved that problem.\n  Hardly any of those problems is solved without money. When you are \nthe mayor of a small town, you are on call 24 hours a day. You are in \nthe phone book. People can call you at night and tell you that the city \nsewer is backing up into their house. I was fascinated how they were \nalways sure that it was the city's sewer that was doing it. When they \ncall to say that the power is out, they don't want a delay before it is \nfixed. When they call to tell you a neighbor has stolen a D-8 Cat and \nis tearing up the street and driving over sports cars and mailboxes and \nripping up sprinkler systems, you have to go to work. Those are \nexciting things that happen from time to time in cities.\n\n  The point is that the government that is closest to the people is \nalso on the shortest time line to get results. I think it is the \nhardest work. I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that \nmandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of \nits citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic loopholes \nthat will take away all of their revenue. It may not seem like a big \nrestriction, it may not exceed the $50 million limit that Congress set \nin the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, but it does establish a national \npolicy against State and local government. It does take an affirmative \nstep to tie the hands of local government.\n  Congress has to be very careful when we pass a law like this. We have \nto realize the effect of all of those people living at the local \nlevel--not the Federal level. I have not met anybody who lives on the \nFederal level; they all live at the local level.\n  I am also concerned about the bill's impact on small businesses. My \nwife Diana and I owned a shoestore on Main Street, Gillette, for 28 \nyears. My wife did most of the managing on that. She greeted the \npeople, she sold the shoes, ran the cash register, swept the floor, all \nthe things that have to be done by a small business.\n  We recognize the advantage of the Internet for these small \nbusinesses, these home-based businesses that were mentioned earlier. \nYes, we understand the complications of trying to keep track of every \nkind of sales tax that is levied across the whole United States \nregardless of what kind of jurisdiction it is in. That is current law. \nThat is current collection, to some degree, particularly if you have a \npresence in the State where the product is being sold.\n  What is a ``presence'' in the State? Internet goes into absolutely \nevery State. There is now the easy capability to set up another \ncorporation in another State that does not have sales tax and still \nmake the sale local, with immediate delivery, and avoid all sales tax \nthrough the Internet. That is going to be a problem.\n  The problem with small business is, we talk about whether a business \nis 500 employees or just 150 employees. That is not the kind of small \nbusiness I am talking about. I am talking about sweeping the sidewalk, \ncarrying out the trash, filling out the myriad reams of required \nFederal paperwork. It really doesn't have much application to your \nbusiness--probably five employees or less. These are the people who \nsponsor Little League, the basketball camps, the yearbooks, and all of \nthe other things that happen in municipalities. They donate the raffle \nprizes and uniforms and they support all kinds of community activity. \nEvery kid in town comes to the local small business and asks for help. \nFortunately for America, they donate, and they donate gladly. They \nserve on the parade committees. They serve on the fair committees. They \nare the volunteers in the church and in the school and in local \ngovernment. They are not only the neighbors, they are the customers for \na small town for any retailer.\n  We buy mail-order goods often because they are cheaper; there is no \nsales tax. That is a part of the pitch that is used. That is like a 5- \nto 7- to 9-percent reduction.\n  Congress is now going to decide to prohibit local governments from \ntaxing certain businesses--easy businesses to set up, easy businesses \nto locate in a State that has no sales tax whatever. We haven't seen \nanything like this before in the history of the United States, but we \nare about to see the biggest boom in the Internet that we have ever \nseen. We need a few amendments to this bill to provide some protection \nfor the current system. I am not talking about expanding, I am talking \nabout the current system.\n  Are we going to be in the business of picking the tax winners and the \ntax losers? I am talking about the towns where the people of America \nlive. We know who the losers will be. It will be the small retailer in \nyour town, the one that you rely on to run down and pick up the \nemergency item.\n  I do support this amendment. The commission should be allowed to \nstudy all of the issues with the Internet, all of the issues related to \ntaxation. They definitely ought to be able to look at those that change \nwith the technology so that the current system of collecting revenues \nfor those towns and States can be preserved. I don't think we have all \nthe answers, or we wouldn't be asking for this bill.\n  I don't think we are going to have all the answers on the technology \nthat is going to transpire in the next 2 years. So whatever we do, we \nhave to have some amendments that will preserve the way that small \nbusiness and small towns function at the present time. This amendment \nwill help Congress to\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\nmake a decision in the future. It restores language that would be taken \nout with the Gregg amendment. It is critical for towns, small \nbusinesses, and you and me. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the second-degree \namendment for all of the reasons previously stated by the Senator from \nWyoming, the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Florida. I \nhave, beginning with the origin of this bill in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, been very concerned about exactly what the language in this \nlegislation will mean to this country, to our Main Streets, to our \nStates and local governments.\n  The issue here is a relatively simple one, and I don't need to \nrestate all of the reasons that were offered by the Senator from \nWyoming for being concerned about it. But the genesis of this bill was \nto be concerned about State and local governments applying ``punitive'' \ntax programs against Internet commerce. They were worried that this \ngrowth of the Internet and the expansion of commerce on the Internet \nwould be retarded by local governments or State governments, seeing \nthat as a big, juicy target, and apply some kind of new discriminatory \nor punitive tax regime upon it. Therefore, they said, let us at least \nhave a time-out until we understand how to impose some sort of tax \nsystem that is fair to the Internet sellers and that does not \ndiscriminate against the Internet sellers.\n  Well, the question here, then, is, if in this legislation where you \nhave a time-out, or a moratorium, and you create a commission during \nthat moratorium to investigate or evaluate all of these issues, why \nthen would you say to that commission that you can take a look at all \nof this, you can take a look at what this means with respect to \nInternet commerce, but you cannot look at the other issues; you cannot \nlook at how it relates, Internet commerce versus mail-order firms; you \ncannot look at how it relates to Internet commerce versus Main Street \nsellers? What kind of logic is that? If you are going to have a \ncommission to try to figure out how this piece fits in the puzzle, then \nmake sure all the pieces are there. That is all this second degree \nsays--make sure all the pieces are there.\n  The people who are here saying we don't want to solve this puzzle are \npeople who have a vested interest. They are here, frankly, because of \nmail-order firms and the Internet. They are saying we don't want \nanybody to look at all of this. We want a moratorium for the Internet \nover here, and over here we don't want anybody discussing mail-order \nissues.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said he and his wife had a shoestore. I \ndidn't know that. I have never been to their shoestore. I have never \nshopped in Gillette, WY, and I probably never will shop there. But the \nissue he raises is essential to this point. When he and his wife opened \nthe door in the morning and displayed shoes for sale in that store, \nthey knew a couple of things: They rented the building, they hired the \nemployees, and they bought an inventory. They opened their door and \nsaid: We are in business on Main Street in Gillette, WY. They knew that \nwhen somebody came through the door and took their shoes off and got \nfitted up and bought a brand new shiny pair of shoes, when they paid \nfor it, they had to apply the local sales tax. That is what you have to \ndo on Main Street. You are a tax collector for the local consumption \ntax in the State of Wyoming. I didn't hear him complain about that. \nThat is what they do on Main Streets all across this country. I believe \n45 States have a sales tax.\n  Another thing he and his wife knew, I am sure, and he is not here to \nanswer the question, but I am sure they knew that if someone three \nblocks away decided they were not going to go to Main Street to buy \nshoes today, they were going to buy them through a mail-order catalog, \nin most cases they will buy those through the catalog without paying a \nlocal sales tax or a State sales tax, which means that his local \nbusiness ended up being undersold by someone, perhaps by 4 percent, \nmaybe 6, or maybe even 7 or 8 percent, because the catalog seller, in \nmost cases, didn't charge the State sales tax.\n  Is that discriminatory vis-a-vis the Main Street businessperson? I \nthink it is. Of course, it is. Does it mean there is not a tax on the \ntransaction? No, there is a tax. When they mail that pair of shoes from \nthe mail-order catalog house to the person in Gillette, WY, or Fargo, \nor Bismarck, ND, the person who receives that pair of shoes has a \nresponsibility in most every State to pay a use tax. Of course, they \ndon't know that and they won't ever pay that, but that is the \nresponsibility.\n  The net result of all of this is that the Main Street folks will end \nup always being at a disadvantage with respect to taxation versus those \nwho are doing business elsewhere, those who have constructed a catalog \nand haven't hired the employees, haven't rented a place to do business, \nand they haven't hired local folks; they have just operated through a \ncatalog.\n\n  I happen to think catalog sellers are very important to this country. \nFrankly, they are wonderful marketers. I think it is wonderful for a \nlot of people in this country to be able to shop that way. There is no \nquestion about that. I think when you look at the tax issue here--\nwhether it is buying it through a catalog or going through a computer \nand getting on the Internet and buying it through a seller on the \nInternet or buying it on Main Street--there ought to be some symmetry \nhere in the tax treatment to make sure the tax treatment is not going \nto retard the growth of the business on Main Street, it is not going to \nretard the business growth of people who have catalogs and the business \nopportunities of the people on the Internet.\n  But what is being said in the underlying amendment is, let's take a \nlook at this only with respect to how it relates to the Internet, and \nyou must ignore everything else. My friend, the Senator from Oregon, \nsays, well, we want to explore everything. But, of course, this says \nyou cannot, you must not; in fact, we are going to fight to the end \nhere to see that you are unable to explore everything. That doesn't \nmake any sense to me. That is what the second-degree amendment is \nabout.\n  The Senate Finance Committee got this right. It passed a bill, came \nto the floor, created a commission and said, take a look at all of \nthis. We will have a commission that evaluates and studies all of this \nwith respect to the tax neutrality, with respect to the opportunities \nin growth, and the impact of these taxes on a wide range of commerce--\nnot just Internet commerce, but a wide range of commerce.\n  The Senate Finance Committee got it right. The underlying amendment \nnow offered by a couple of good legislators, I think for understandable \nreasons, would say that the Finance Committee is wrong; this commission \nmust not, cannot, and will not be able to study the whole range of \ncircumstances. The second degree says, no, we don't accept that; we \nwant to insert language that is effectively the language coming out of \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  I say again, as I did yesterday when the Senator from Florida was on \nthe floor, and I say it now to the Senator from Arkansas, who along \nwith the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Wyoming were primary \nsponsors of the second degree, in my judgment, they are dead right. \nThey are absolutely right on target. I hope that the Senate, \nnotwithstanding whatever curves and straightaways we find with this \nlegislation--I assume this legislation will be worked out in the coming \nhours and days and, perhaps, be passed tomorrow, and I hope it will be \npassed in a satisfactory form.\n  But one of the ways that this legislation will be made a better piece \nof legislation is to pass this second-degree amendment and restore it \nto the condition it was in when it came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. These folks spent a lot of time on tax issues in the Finance \nCommittee. I used to be on the House Ways and Means Committee in the \nother body for 10 years, and I spent a lot of time on tax issues. I \nthink the Senate Finance Committee got it right. They said, study these \nissues, evaluate them all, understand the consequences of them all, and \nthen, with that knowledge, let's make some judgments. That is the \npurpose of the time-out; that is the purpose of the moratorium.\n  I have, as the Senator from Oregon stated, spent a fair amount of \ntime\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\nwith him, and I think we have made a lot of progress on these issues.\n  My expectation is we will pass a piece of legislation that is an \nacceptable piece of legislation that has a timeout moratorium. But it \nmust, in my judgment, include this in order to really give us the \nassurance that that moratorium is used effectively by a commission that \nhas divisions to look at all of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and others and to express my support of the underlying \namendment offered in the first instance by the Senator from Arizona, \nthe chairman of the committee. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that \none.\n  I was a cosponsor of the initial legislation, one of the pieces of \nlegislation earlier in the session, along with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, which had the intention of trying to create \nsome order and predictability and a little space for this extraordinary \nnew area of economic activity, activity which has benefited so many \npeople around our country, which is to say, e-commerce over the \nInternet.\n  The aim was to say to the taxing jurisdictions, of which there are \nthousands and thousands and thousands--30,000, as a matter of fact--\npotential taxing jurisdictions which exist in the United States, catch \nyour breath, sit back, and let this new sector of our economy--Internet \ncommerce, e-commerce, which the United States is heading and which has \nbenefited so many people, which has created so many jobs--let it grow \nout of its infancy before we begin to put the teeth of the taxman into \nvarious parts of its anatomy; and let's let this commission begin to \ngrow some ground rules for the consistent and fair handling of this new \narea of economic activity.\n  The fact is today that an Internet service provider, or a merchant \nselling goods or services over the Internet, has no way of knowing in \nadvance whether a State decides to tax them. As an example, in New \nMexico, Internet access charges are subject to New Mexico gross \nreceipts taxes. In Ohio, their sales are taxed as an electronic \ninformation service; in Tennessee, it is a telecommunications service; \nin my own State of Connecticut, as a computer and data processing \nservices. Texas officials, I gather, have threatened to tax \ntransactions that go through Internet servers in its State, even if the \nbuyer and seller, in conventional terms, are not located in the State \nof Texas.\n  The uncertainty of this tax liability is real and is having what you \nwould expect--a negative, destabilizing effect on this business. Peat \nMarwick, a respected, recognized firm, just released a survey of \nindustry executives of companies that sell over the Internet. Fifty \npercent of the executives said that the current State tax ambiguities \nand conflicting tax treatment of electronic commerce among the States \nare inhibiting their companies' involvement in electronic commerce. \nNinety percent describe the current State sales tax procedures with \nregard to electronic commerce as ``overly burdensome,'' and 75 percent \nexpressed their concern that State and local tax laws will place their \ncompanies at a disadvantage. It is because the industry is in its \ninfancy.\n  A predictable legal environment is exactly what the President's \nReport on Electronic Commerce recommended that we promote \ninternationally. In fact, the administration has been sending out \nemissaries over the last year to persuade international organizations \nand individual countries to agree to create a predictable legal \nenvironment for the spread of electronic commerce. That is not only \nfair, it is good for American business, which happens to have a lead \nover business in any other countries in the effective use of the \nInternet.\n  What the underlying bill, the underlying amendment, is saying is that \nit is time that we create the same sense of predictability here in the \nUnited States that our Government is urging on countries around the \nworld. That is what this commission would do.\n  The commission is asked to draft model State legislation that creates \nuniform definitions and categories of commercial transactions on the \nInternet so that States will be using the same vocabulary when it comes \nto categorizing the tax liabilities of an Internet company, or \ntransaction--not unifying a tax rate among States, but creating a legal \nenvironment in which companies can do business.\n  The National Commission on Uniform State Legislation has been working \nfor the past 2 years on updating the treatment of Internet transactions \naccording to various State laws. But it has not looked directly at \ntaxes. This commission that would be created by this legislation would \nwork with the national commission and other groups that have already \nbeen active in trying to update laws to be certain that Internet \ncommerce is treated fairly. We would extend their work through this \ncommission in the tax arena.\n  I want to stress that the measure introduced by the distinguished \nchairman of committee, the Senator from Arizona--Senator Gregg, I, and \nothers are proud to be cosponsors--does not preclude the commission \ncreated by this legislation from considering the question of nexus or \ntaxation of remote sales. The danger in this amendment before us, the \nsecond-degree amendment, is that it singles these particular questions \nout as a requirement and thereby, I think, puts the commission in \ndanger of falling into a very dense thicket.\n  A battle has been waging for more than three decades, and taken right \nto the Supreme Court at one point, as to how remote sales by catalog-\ntelephone sales would be taxed by the 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in \nthe States in the country. In so doing, I think the amendment threatens \nwhat is and should be the focus of the commission, which is to direct \nits attention on this extraordinary new sector of commerce, Internet \ncommerce, and it runs the risk really of getting the commission so tied \nup in the thicket of remote sales that it will never really contribute \nwhat we hope it will to creating some order and predictability in e-\ncommerce.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that this commission that is created by \nthe underlying legislation may well--I think we who are its sponsors \nhope it will--create some language to reach some judgments that may in \nfact offer some counsel and help in this ongoing debate about taxation \nof remote sales, but let that happen naturally--that is my hope and \nprayer--as opposed to forcing it into the second-degree amendment in a \nway that would run the risk of destroying the underlying purpose of the \nproposal, and in that sense doing damage to Internet commerce and all \nwho both benefit from it as consumers and benefit from it because they \nwork in companies that are using it.\n  I want to mention one other matter before closing. That is this: \nThere are times when we talk about Main Street and the effect of \nInternet commerce on Main Street as if it were, one wins and one loses.\n  The reality is that e-commerce has the potential to expand the \nwinner's circle, to make more winners. I want to cite real cases from \nConnecticut which I learned about in the last 6 months to a year, and I \nthink are typical of what is happening all over the country.\n  First, let me say that a recent survey in Connecticut found that 38 \npercent of small- and medium-sized companies have a web page--almost \ntwo out of five. A little over half of those are using their web page \nto sell goods and services--right now. And 21 percent are planning to \nadd a web page next year. I am sure those numbers are going to grow \ndramatically in coming years.\n  The fact is, insofar as some folks who are in taxing jurisdictions \nand the concern of this amendment has to do with treatment of direct \nmail-order sales or phone sales, if the mail-order catalogs that I get \nat my house are any indication of what the future is, I am being truly \nencouraged, aggressively encouraged by those catalogs instead of \ncalling up, to use the Internet. So I think more and more of that kind \nof commerce will be done by e-commerce.\n  But let me give you two great examples from home about the effect \nthat the Internet is having on Main Street. A small company in old \nBroad Brook, CT, beautiful town by the water on Long Island Sound, \ncalled Stencil Ease, family-owned, 18 employees, sells stencils for \nhome decorating and crafts. It\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\nstarted a web page in 1996. They have been averaging 100 to 200 hits a \nday. Their sales increased 10 percent the first year due to the web \nsite and 20 percent the next year.\n  Here is a startling story in the second one--Coastal Tool & Supply. I \nhave been there. It is a small, family-run hardware store in Hartford, \nCT, capital city. It was threatened, interestingly, by a location \nnearby of one of the large chain hardware stores. It was having a hard \ntime. They decided to go on the Internet, in a sense to leap over the \nbig competitor down the street. I think it was Home Depot, but it \ndoesn't matter--a big competitor down the street and in a sense enter \nthe global main street and hired a very able young man, skilled in \ncomputer matters, who put their catalog essentially on the Internet. \nSales have grown almost 500 percent. They are doing more business over \nthe Internet than they are from people coming into the store.\n  So this is what the future holds, and it is a situation, if we do it \nright, where not only the big companies, but a lot of mom-and-pop \nstores and businesses are going to be able to benefit from Internet \nsales.\n  Now, as it grows, it will actually have an effect on taxing \njurisdictions, and we will naturally, in the normal order of business, \nwant to create an opportunity for equity and to protect State and local \njurisdictions that we represent. But this is not the time to do it, and \nthis amendment is not the place to do it. Let's let this commission \ndeal with the unique problems of e-commerce.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be glad to yield to my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to say that I think the Senator has made an \nespecially effective approach and tell him that hardware account he \ngave is essentially what this legislation is all about. There has been \ndiscussion about who benefits here, huge corporations and the like. The \npeople who benefit here are the 100,000 home-based businesses in my \nState, the hardware store that the Senator from Connecticut is talking \nabout.\n  The reason why that is the case is that the Internet is a great \nequalizer for those small businesses. The small businesses now that we \nare seeing in the State of the Senator from Connecticut and rural \nOregon are having great difficulty today competing against the Wal-\nMarts of the world. They do not have huge advertising budgets like Wal-\nMart. They don't have batteries of lawyers and accountants. These are \nsmall, entrepreneurial operations that now look at the Internet as a \ntool that can trampoline them into extraordinary economic opportunities \nthey have never had.\n  Without this legislation and the good work that has been done by the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from New Hampshire, if you are \na small, home-based business in Oregon or Connecticut, you may well \nface a good chunk of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions in our \ncountry looking at your business as a cash cow.\n  One of our colleagues said the threat here is the World Wide Web \nwould become the ``World Wide Wallet'' if that kind of approach went \nforward.\n  So what the Senator was talking about with respect to that hardware \nstore account is why I introduced this legislation early in 1997. That \nis the very kind of operation that I think we ought to be looking to \ngrow in the 21st century.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I heard his account of \nthe hardware store from the Cloakroom, and I think some have said--in \nfact, I heard it again today--that this was about Amazon.com or someone \nlike that. Those people are not going to be in need of this kind of \napproach. This is going to benefit the small entrepreneurs, the home-\nbased business, the kind of person the Senator from Connecticut is \ntalking about. I thank him for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments. I \nthank him for his leadership. Senator Gregg and I were happy to merge \ntogether with the work the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nArizona have done.\n  I want to end with one story the Senator from Oregon has stimulated \nin my memory when I visited that hardware store. It shows how you not \nonly jump over the big store down the block but into the global \nshopping mall.\n  One of their favorite stories--and this is not a pure market example \nbecause the particular customer I am about to refer to is from a Middle \nEastern country--is about a man who happened to work for his country's \nnational airlines, so his trip here was paid for, but he needed some \nlarge, heavy tools. He went on the Internet, found his way to the \nCoastal Tool & Supply web site, competitively priced, figured out the \nadvantage, was on a flight to New York as part of his normal work, got \noff the plane, rented a truck, drove up to Hartford, bought the tools \nthat he needed, drove back, put them on the plane, and went back to the \nMiddle East, all smart shopping and good for business.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will resist the allures of this second-\ndegree amendment and will not disrupt the noble and, I think, very \nnecessary intention of the underlying bill. We can come back some other \nday, hopefully, informed by the work of the commission created herein \nto deal with the border problems that I know concern the Senator from \nArkansas and the other cosponsors of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. I just want to make a few closing \nobservations of my perspective on this second-degree amendment and \nclarify a few things that I think are not representative at all of what \nthis second-degree amendment does.\n  May I just say also, being the Senator from the State of Arkansas and \nbeing from the hometown in which Wal-Mart stores are nationally \nheadquartered, world wide headquartered, and Wal-Mart has been \ndisparagingly mentioned several times----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Not at this time. In my office in the Dirksen \nBuilding I have a hanging portrait of the 5-&-10-cent store where Sam \nWalton started the Wal-Mart stores. There is nothing in this amendment \nthat is antientrepreneur. The fact is that Wal-Mart, with their huge \nadvertising budget, as it was alluded to, started as a little 5-&-10-\ncent store, as a mom-and-pop store in Arkansas. That is an American \nsuccess story which ought to be applauded, not disparaged. Every \nAmerican ought to have that opportunity, to have that dream. We ought \nnot with legislation undercut that little Main Street store that cannot \nbe replicated, cannot be replaced. No matter how great the Internet is, \nno matter how great catalogs are, they cannot replace that store on \nMain Street giving to the little league and supporting the local \nefforts and local initiatives.\n  A couple other things. It has been implied that somehow this \namendment, this second-degree amendment would mandate that they focus \nthe study, the commission focus their study on interstate sales. \nNothing could be further from the truth. If you look at the bill, it \nsays, and I quote, ``may include in the study *under subsection,'' may \ninclude a study of. It is, in fact, the Gregg amendment, the McCain-\nGregg amendment that excludes even their authorization to study the \nimpact, the obvious impact of remote sales including catalog, including \nInternet, all of the Internet remote sales, its impact upon small \nbusinesses and upon local and State government. It simply says ``may.'' \nIt is simply authorizing, permissive language. It is, in fact, the \nHouse bill that mandated that they study this area and its impact, \nbecause it is so obvious the impact that it could potentially have, and \nthat any study that should be done, if it is in fact to be a thorough \nstudy, must include this area.\n\n  It is the proponents of the Gregg amendment who would say what the \nFinance Committee did by a vote of 19 to 1 should be overturned. The \nFinance Committee, led by Senator Roth, included a study of these \nissues--and they should be included. They should be studied. The \nlanguage in the bill says ``thorough study.'' How can you have a \nthorough study and then delete the area of interstate sales? It puzzles \nme. How can anyone object to having a broader study that would include \nall of the various issues involved in a very complex subject?\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\n  It has been implied that somehow this second-degree amendment, which \nwould say this issue ought to be studied, is protax. My goodness, \nanybody who has ever looked at Tim Hutchinson's record in the \nstatehouse in Arkansas, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. \nSenate, would have a hard time believing this amendment I am offering \nis protax or somehow a roadmap to higher taxes. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. We are not prejudging any kind of conclusions \nor any kind of recommendations that this commission might make. And, I \nremind my colleagues, it requires a two-thirds vote of the members of \nthe commission to make any recommendation, and that is all they can \nmake, is a recommendation. The final say remains with the Congress.\n  How in the world can you say this somehow is going to lead to higher \ntaxes or somehow thwart the growth of the Internet? And that, may I \nsay, has been another mischaracterization of this amendment--that it is \nsomehow not only protax but anti-Internet.\n  We have applauded, and I applaud, the growth of the Internet. I \nquoted the statistics, from $8 billion in 1998 to the estimated $300 \nbillion in sales in the year 2002; that is a good thing. But while it \nis a good thing, we should not be so blind as to think it is not going \nto have serious consequences, serious impacts, that ought to be \nexamined in advance.\n  I support the bill. I support the timeout. I support the pause. I \nsupport the moratorium. But I also believe, if we are going to have a \nstudy, it ought to truly be a thorough study. It ought not say look at \neverything but don't look at the impact upon business, don't look at \nthe impact upon the city government or the State government. It ought \nto truly be a thorough study. You cannot deal with these issues in a \nvacuum. They are interrelated, all of these, and they need to be, in \nfact, thoroughly studied.\n  Let me just conclude by saying I thought Senator Enzi's comments were \nmoving. I, like Senator Dorgan, did not realize that he and his wife \noperated a little Main Street shoestore for over 20 years in Gillette, \nWY. I did not know that. I had a great appreciation for Senator Enzi. I \nhave a greater appreciation now. But I think also that, as he paid \nthose sales taxes day in and day out, as he made the struggles that any \nsmall business person makes in order to stay in existence, as he \ncontributed to the Little League, as he contributed to the United Way, \nas he did everything that only a physical entity actually being right \nthere in the community can do--irreplaceable--that we need to consider \nthem, we need to think about them, as we pass this needed legislation.\n  I believe if they will simply look at the language of the second-\ndegree amendment restoring what the Finance Committee did by a 19-to-1 \nvote and saying this is an area that ought to be examined, ought to be \nlooked at, then I think my colleagues will realize that in fact it does \nmake good sense and they will support it. I ask for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment does not say anything about \nwhat to do or not to do. What we are talking about here is whether the \ncommission should say we should overturn the Quill decision. That is \nwhat we get down to, if we want to get through all the rhetoric and \nlanguage about this. We don't think the Quill decision should be \noverturned. Obviously, the proponents of the amendment do, and that \nreally is, to a significant degree, what this amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for about 2 \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to withhold for 2 minutes before I make \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished manager very much.\n  Mr. President, this is really a strange scenario for me. I have \nfought for years to allow States to do exactly what the Supreme Court, \nin the Quill decision, said we had the right to do, and that was to \nallow States to make mail order houses collect sales taxes on \nmerchandise being shipped into our respective States. That is what the \nSupreme Court said. We would not be overturning the Quill decision. We \nwould simply be taking advantage of what the Supreme Court said we had \na right to do: Remove the interstate commerce clause as a burden and \nallow the States, 45 of whom have sales taxes on merchandise from out \nof State--allow those States who have passed those laws to implement \nthem. They cannot be implemented. We are saying we do not care what \nkind of laws you pass at the State level, we are not going to allow you \nto implement them.\n  Last week we once again killed my amendment to allow states to \nmandate that remote sellers collect the taxes they ought to. Yesterday, \nthe Senate decided that we cannot even make Internet sellers alert \nconsumers to the fact that there is a sales tax in the State. We cannot \neven tell them to alert people to the fact that somebody may knock on \ntheir door from their state revenue department and try to collect the \nunpaid use tax. Think about that. Mr. President, 45 States have a sales \ntax and we voted yesterday not to even require Internet sellers to tell \nconsumers there may be a tax on their purchases.\n  Now we come here today saying we cannot even study it. My God, how \nfar are we going to go?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Arizona.

Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, en \nbloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes amendments \n     numbered 3732 and 3733, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3732\n\n           (Purpose: To modify the duties of the Commission)\n\n       On page 22, line 2, strike ``interstate'' and insert \n     ``instrastate, interstate''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3733\n\n           (Purpose: To modify the report of the Commission)\n\n       On page 25, line 12, insert ``Any recommendation agreed to \n     by the Commission shall be tax and technologically neutral \n     and apply to all forms of remote commerce.'' after ``this \n     title.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. These have been accepted by both sides. I know of no \nfurther debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (No. 3732 and No. 3733), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are now down to basically two issues \nabout which the Senator from Wyoming, the Senator from North Dakota, \nand the Senator from Oregon are deeply concerned. We are negotiating \nthose. We hope we can get an agreement on those so that we can finish \nup on this legislation. If not, we will probably have votes on those \ntwo issues. But we have resolved the remaining amendments, except for \nthose two. There is more than one amendment associated with those two \nissues. But if we can get that agreement within the next half hour or \nso, I think we can move to final passage. I thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his cooperation with this difficult issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is also my hope that in a relatively \nshort period of time we will be able to resolve the remaining issues. \nWe have made a lot of progress on the bill. I will say again that the \nSenator from Arizona has done an excellent job, and the Senator from \nOregon and others have pushed very hard to get us to this point. There \nare other significant issues, but I expect to get them resolved in \nrelatively short order. I hope we will make the final progress \nnecessary on this piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are working on a unanimous consent \nagreement now that we hope we can get approved, which would allow us to \nget to a conclusion and a final vote on the Internet tax freedom bill. \nI commend all who have been involved, including Senators McCain, Dorgan \nand Wyden. I believe we can actually get to a conclusion. There has \nbeen the possibility that it would be tangled up in other matters, but \nI think maybe we have an agreement that will allow us to complete that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11651-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 505, and that \nthe Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is this the \ncopyright bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't want to object, but I have been asked about \nclearing this. Maybe a couple of us have questions about this. If the \nmajority leader will withhold for about 15 minutes so we might be able \nto clear it up, we would appreciate it.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is a reasonable request. I will withhold on that. I \nhad believed that we cleared it with both sides of the aisle, but some \nMembers may not have had a chance to check on it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take the blame for that. I assumed it had \nbeen cleared. The Senator from Connecticut said he had an issue, so if \nthe majority leader will give us a few minutes to see if we can work it \nout.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will do that.\n  Let me just say again that I hope we can get this cleared because it \nlooks like, after a lot of hard and good work by a number of Senators--\nSenator Hatch worked very hard on this--that we are now in the position \nof being able to move the music licensing issue, the copyright bill, \nthe international property issue, the international treaty; those are \nthree major achievements that I thought a week ago we probably could \nnot get done. They are all interrelated, actually. I hope we can get \nclearance to move forward on these issues. This is a reasonable \nrequest, and I withhold the unanimous consent request at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Mississippi yield to \nme for a moment on this?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Mississippi is right. He has been working \nvery hard with both sides of the aisle to clear the items he has \nmentioned. As he knows, we have been working very hard, as well. These \nare extraordinarily complex pieces of legislation. Unfortunately, the \nmore complex they are, the more like a Rubik's Cube they are. I think \nwe are extremely close, and we will continue to work with him. I \ncompliment him on his efforts to help work these out.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, I say that I appreciate the help from Senator Leahy, \nand I also urge that we do this as soon as we can, because, as you \nknow, at this late stage of the game, sometimes people come in with \nunrelated issues that start causing problems. Let's do it as quickly as \nwe can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11670-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11670-S11672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OBJECTION TO 2-HOUR TIME AGREEMENT ON S.J. RES. 40\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief on this. There was \nanother unanimous consent request just now to which the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Nebraska objected. I join in that objection. The \nSenator from Nebraska is a distinguished veteran. In fact, he is the \nonly person I have ever served with in either body that has been \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He is a servant of his \ncountry in every sense of the word.\n  Mr. President, the reason we were objecting is not that people would \nhesitate to vote on this, but a 2-hour proposal is not realistic. We \nare dealing here with a proposal to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States. That is something that, as Madison put it, should be \nreserved for ``certain great and extraordinary occasions.''\n  This is a serious issue--one deserving of our full attention, our \nmost thoughtful consideration, and our most serious debate. Instead, we \nare asked to consider this at the most hectic time of\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\nthe entire legislative calendar--at the end of a session when the \nattention of Senators quite properly is focused on passing the \nnecessary appropriations bills so that we will not once again shut down \nthe Federal Government. This is inappropriate timing. I might say that \nit is entirely unnecessary.\n  This amendment was reported by the Judiciary Committee on June 24, \nover 3 months ago. The committee report was sent to the Senate on \nSeptember 1, over a month ago. This amendment could have been brought \nup at any time.\n  I ask, why is it being proposed to be brought up now? It would be \nnothing less than irresponsible for us to consider it in the short, \nhectic time line that is available. As if this matter could be made \nworse, we are asked to consider it not only during 2 hours of debate, \nbut also when one of our most distinguished colleagues, also a \ndistinguished veteran of World War II and of the Korean conflict, \nSenator Glenn, necessarily is absent on a dangerous and important \nproject on behalf of the Nation.\n  Frankly--I don't want to interrupt the conversation going on to the \nright of me, Mr. President. So I will withhold for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we please have order on the Senate floor?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  No one has fought harder for the flag than John Glenn. No one has \nfought harder than he to protect the Bill of Rights. It shocks and \nreally offends me that the proponents of this amendment would take \nadvantage of his absence to debate this proposal as he embarks once \nagain in harm's way in the service of the United States.\n  I am astounded to have something as important as an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States called up at this late date in the \nsession. We are less than a week away from adjournment. We have \nimportant work to do--work that cannot wait. And to call this up seems \neven less responsible when you consider the restraint of some of our \nother Members.\n  This is not the only constitutional amendment pending before the \nCongress. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, have worked long and hard on an amendment \nto the Constitution to deal with the rights of victims of crime. While \nI have not supported that amendment and very much am for a statutory \napproach to that important issue, I know that it was propounded in a \nresponsible fashion. Both Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein came to the \nfloor just a few days ago, on September 28, to acknowledge that as much \nas they support the amendment, there simply is not time left in the \nsession to consider it properly.\n  The Senator from Arizona made this point: ``It has been very \ndifficult in the waning days of the session to get floor time to take \nup even the most mundane of bills, because the Senate is very much \nconcentrated on getting the appropriations bills passed so that we can \nfund the Government.'' He went on to note: ``We understood that for \nsomething as important as amending the Constitution we want to do it \nright. The last thing Senator Feinstein and I would ever do is hurry an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution to try to push this through without \nan adequate debate without giving everyone an opportunity to have their \nsay.''\n  The last thing we would ever do, as these two distinguished Senators \nsaid, is to hurry an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Frankly, that \nshould be the last thing any U.S. Senator should do--Republican or \nDemocrat. But to ask to consider an amendment to the Constitution that \nwould for the first time in our history cut back on the First Amendment \nand to propose that the Senate do so under a 2-hour time agreement \nwould be just that. It comes across as just politics.\n  The sponsor of this amendment, the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah, told reporters last Friday that he did not have the votes to win \nit, that this amendment was not going to pass. If it is not going to \npass, why are we even being asked to bring it up as a constitutional \namendment in these waning days? It is because it is not a question of \npassing this amendment that the request is being made. It is to get \nsome material for a campaign commercial. It is for a sound bite, for \n30-second attack ads, politics at its worst. It has less to do with \npassing an amendment than with avoiding things that we should be doing, \nlike HMO reform, or protecting the Social Security system, or \nprotecting veterans' health care.\n  In the closing days of a session, where Congress has not passed a \nbudget, which was required to be passed by April 15, where both sides \nflirt with the idea of what might happen with another Government \nshutdown, we should be completing the matters that must be completed \nthis week.\n  Obviously, there will be amendments that may come up from all sides \nfor political points. But the one place that should be off limits for \nsuch political points is the Constitution of the United States--this \nshort and powerful document that holds the greatest democracy history \nhas ever known together. We should not trivialize it by talking about a \n2-hour debate to amend it.\n  Mr. President, even as we speak here today, this Congress is facing a \nmajor test of our Constitution just down the hall in the other body. \nThis is a test that no matter how one looks at it, no matter what \nposition one takes, whether that of special prosecutor Starr, that of \nthe President, or that of anybody else, the American people, no matter \nhow they feel about this, have some sense that the bedrock of our \ncountry is our Constitution, and somehow the Constitution, if upheld by \n535 people, men and women who are sworn in a most solemn oath to uphold \nthat Constitution, that somehow the Constitution will pull us through.\n  Mr. President, having said that, I believe that no matter how much \npolitics may or may not get played, that in the end the American people \nwill be justified in relying on us and the Constitution. But we do not \ngive them hopes in that if we in turn trivialize the Constitution.\n  At one time this year, I am told, there were over 100 amendments \nfiled in the Congress to the Constitution--over 100 amendments. Somehow \nsome feel that Congress should be considering over 100 amendments and \nasking this great country to consider 100 amendments to its \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, the genius of our Constitution and the reason why this \ndemocracy has been able to survive is that we have been very careful \nabout amending it--extremely careful about amending it, because we like \nthe integrity of it, the consistency of it, and in some ways the \ncomfort of a Constitution that we know so well.\n  So we should never hurry through an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. We should never try to push one through without an \nadequate debate. We should never try to do it without giving everyone \nan opportunity to have their say. Especially today, Mr. President, with \nthe crisis the country faces, we of all people--the Members of the U.S. \nSenate--should make it very clear to the country that we revere the \nConstitution, and that, whatever else we may get involved in with \nregard to politics, the Constitution will not be part of that.\n  There are over a quarter billion Americans--over a quarter of a \nbillion Americans. Only 100 of us get the opportunity to serve in this \nChamber at any time. The seat I now hold, in the last 58 years only two \nVermonters have held this seat. I am one of the two in 58 years. It is \na great privilege. Frankly, it is one that humbles me every day when I \ncome to work. I still feel the same thrill coming up this Hill and \ncoming into this Chamber as I felt when I was a day away from being a \n34-year-old prosecutor in Vermont and was the junior-most Member of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Part of that thrill is to know that it is a rare opportunity, a rare \nprivilege, an honor that I have never been absolutely sure I deserve, \nbut one I cherish, given to me by the people of Vermont to represent \nthem and to speak as one of the 100 voices for this country, in full \nknowledge that there will be somebody else outstanding at this seat who \nwill also represent my State of Vermont and the United States. But I \nhope that they will carry with them the same reverence for the \nConstitution that I feel I carry. There will be times to amend the \nConstitution. We did it after the tragic death of President Kennedy to \nallow for the succession of a Vice President. Time showed the necessity \nfor it and the American public\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\ncame together and knew the need for it.\n\n  But let us make it very clear how we feel about the Constitution and \nthe Bill of Rights, as the 100 who hold this responsibility, so that \nthe American people know that if we are going to change our \nConstitution, we will do it with real debate and real consideration, \nand all 100 of us will be able to stand up on this floor and vote.\n  Now, the entire Senate has known--in fact, the Nation has known--for \nweeks that Senator Glenn would be unavailable this week, and certainly \nthat alone would be a reason not to bring this up now. Senator Glenn is \none of the most distinguished Americans of all time. He obviously \nshould have a chance to vote on this. So I am glad the Senator from \nNebraska has lodged the objection he did. I concur with it. I have \nvoted on this proposed constitutional amendment before. I am not afraid \nto do so again. But the First Amendment, the Constitution, the Bill of \nRights deserve more than cursory attention.\n  Let us all make it clear to the people of this country that the \nConstitution stands first and foremost. We serve here only for the time \nour States allow us to serve. The Constitution predated us and will be \nhere after us.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader once again in the Chamber, \nand so I will yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11670-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 505\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Without objection----\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am told there is one other Senator who \nstill has a question on this, and I would tell my friend from \nMississippi that as a result of that, while I have no objection to this \nunanimous consent agreement, and I will be supporting the bill and have \nworked hard on the bill, there is an objection over here and I will \nhave to lodge an objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will withhold the unanimous consent request, but I would \nonce again like to urge my colleagues to agree to this. This is a very \nimportant bill that work has been done on for a period of months, and \nit also is connected to the music licensing issue which has been worked \nout. It has been extremely tedious, working with all the interested \nparties, but they have been responsible, they have agreed, and I want \nto commend and thank all of those who worked with us and helped us \nreach agreement with music licensing, including the Restaurant \nAssociation, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the \nwriters who have been involved in this music issue, including BMI and \nASCAP and others. They have all given more than they wanted to, but I \nthink we have come to a reasonable agreement. And then also, it is \nconnected to the treaty with regard to intellectual property.\n  So I will withhold at this time, but I hope Senators will not begin \nputting a hold on this very important legislation because of unrelated \nissues that we probably are going to get resolved in the next 2 days \nanyway.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, I \nhave worked on each one of these pieces of legislation so much. There \nare times when I have attempted to pull out what little bit of hair I \nhave left, and, frankly, I hope we can move this. I will personally go \nto anybody who is lodging objection to see what I can do to clear it \nup, because I absolutely concur with the Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, that this is \nsomething which should be moved forward; we want to move it forward. I \nhope I can tell the distinguished majority leader within a few minutes \nwe do have it cleared.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted that the Senate is finally \nconsidering the Copyright Term Extension Act.\n  Copyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the \nenergy of artistic creativity into publicly available art and \nentertainment. Historically, government's role has been to encourage \ncreativity and innovation by protecting rights that create incentives \nfor such activity through copyright.\n  On July 1, 1995, the European Union issued a directive to its member \ncountries mandating a copyright term of 20 years longer than the term \nin the U.S. As a result, the E.U. will not have to guard American works \nbeyond the American term limit, whereas European works will have 20 \nyears more security and revenues in the marketplace.\n  The songwriter Carlos Santana put it eloquently in his statement \nsubmitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee three years ago on this \nsubject, ``As an American songwriter whose works are performed \nthroughout the world, I find it unacceptable that I am accorded \ninferior copyright protection in the world marketplace.''\n  His reasons are as relevant today as the day he made that statement. \nThe 1998 Report on Copyright Industries in the U.S. Economy issued by \nthe International Intellectual Property Alliance indicates just how \nimportant the U.S. copyright industries are today to American jobs and \nthe economy and, therefore, how important it is for the U.S. to give \nits copyright industries at least the level of protection that is \nenjoyed by European Union industries.\n  The Report indicates that from the years 1977 through 1996, the U.S. \ncopyright industries' share of the gross national product grew more \nthan twice as fast as the remainder of the economy. During those same \n20 years, job growth in core copyright industries was nearly three \ntimes the employment growth in the economy as a whole. These statistics \nunderscore why it is so important that we finally pass this legislation \ntoday.\n  I cosponsored the original Senate copyright term legislation, the \nCopyright Term Extension Act of 1995, S. 483. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on that bill on September 20, 1995. At that \nhearing, we heard the testimony of Marybeth Peters, Register of \nCopyrights, and Bruce Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and \nCommissioner of the Patent and\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\nTrademark Office. We also heard testimony of Jack Valenti, President \nand CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, Alan Menken, a \ncomposer and lyricist, Patrick Alger, President of the Nashville \nSongwriters Association International, and Peter Jaszi, Professor at \nAmerican University, Washington, College of Law. That bill was \nfavorably reported to the Senate, and the Committee filed its report, \nSenate Report No. 104-315, on May 23, 1996.\n  Alert to the possibility that copyright term extension could impose \nunintended costs, I, along with Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Brown and \nSimpson, asked Marybeth Peters, Register of Copyrights, and Daniel \nMulhollan, Director of Congressional Research Service, to conduct a \nstudy and issue a report to Congress on the financial implications of \ncopyright term extension. The Congressional Research Service issued its \nreport on February 17, 1998, and the Copyright Office issued its report \nFebruary 23, 1998.\n  This Congress, I introduced the Copyright Term Extension Act, S. 505, \non March 20, 1997, along with Senators Hatch, D'Amato, Thompson, \nAbraham and Feinstein. Despite the merits of passing copyright term \nextension legislation, the bill has been held hostage to other matters \nfar too long. In the global world of the next century, competition in \nthe realm of intellectual property will reach a ferocity even more \nruthless than it is today. Congress should equip American creators with \na full measure of protection for their copyrighted works, else U.S. \nintellectual property owners are reduced in their reach and their \neffectiveness. I am therefore pleased that the Senate is finally \nconsidering the Copyright Term Extension Act, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nenacting this legislation to extend the period of copyright protection \nfor an additional twenty years. This extension is needed to coordinate \nthe term of copyright for our creative authors and artists with their \nEuropean counterparts.\n  The principles of copyright are established in the Constitution. They \nreflect our enduring belief that our nation prospers when it advances \nknowledge, understanding and the arts. As President Kennedy said, \n``There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, \nbetween achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of \nPericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was \nalso the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth was also the \nage of Shakespeare.''\n  Effective copyright protection is an important national priority. If \nthe United States is to continue its leadership in world of ideas and \ncreativity, we must continue to provide a climate that encourages \nAmerica's authors, artists, inventors and composers and the important \nwork that they do.\n  The pending legislation also includes an important compromise on the \nmusic licensing issue that has prevented adoption of copyright term \nlegislation until now. I am pleased that agreement has been reached \nbetween the business and the music licensing communities so that \nmusical authors and composers can enjoy an appropriate return from \ntheir creative achievements.\n  Finally, the bill also includes an important reference to the current \nnegotiations between the film industry and its guilds. It is gratifying \nthat negotiations will be taking place on the appropriate division of \nresiduals from the earliest films, and I hope that the negotiations \nwill be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides on this important \nissue of fairness.\n  Overall, I commend the bipartisan cooperation that has produced this \nworthwhile legislation. Our cultural heritage will be strengthened by \nthis measure, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I wish to express my support for S. \n505, the Copyright Term Extension Act, as amended. I wish to thank the \nMajority Leader, Senator Hatch, and others in the Senate for their \ncommitment to this important issue. I also wish to thank Speaker \nGingrich, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and others in the House for their \nhard work in this regard.\n  This bill will greatly benefit the American copyright community by \nmaking our copyright term protections consistent with Europe. At the \nsame time, it provides meaningful relief to small businesses, including \nrestaurants, hair salons, and many other establishments, regarding \nlicensing fees for broadcast music. It exempts eating and drinking \nestablishments to a certain square footage and other establishments to \na certain square footage of a lesser degree. It also creates a fairer \nvenue for rate dispute resolution through the circuit court venue.\n  It is also my understanding that nothing in Section 512(4) of the \nCopyright Act, as amended by the bill, is intended to change the burden \nof proof with respect to rates or fees under applicable consent \ndecrees, which places the burden of showing a reasonable rate or fee on \nthe performing rights society.\n  The agreement is not nearly as extensive as S. 28, the Fairness in \nMusical Licensing Act, which I introduced at the start of this \nCongress. However, this legislation represents a fair compromise to \nthis important and complex issue of National significance. I am pleased \nthat we have reached this resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to lay \non the table be agreed to, and any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3782) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 505), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n                   TITLE I--COPYRIGHT TERM EXTENSION\n\n     SEC. 101.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me comment on what is going on here \nfor the benefit of my colleagues. We have agreed on the language \nconcerning the grandfathering of this legislation, which was important.\n  Now we have resolved all matters with the exception of whether the \nmoratorium should last for 3 or 4 years. My amendment, after we accept \nthe grandfather language from the Senator from North Dakota, will be to \nhave the moratorium expire at the end of 4 years, for which there will \nprobably be a recorded vote, after which it is most likely--although we \nhave to check with both sides about further debate--we will have \ncompleted the amending process of the germane amendments that were on \nthe bill and we will be very close to final passage of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 3719, as modified.\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3779, as modified, to amendment No. 3719.\n\n  The amendments (No. 3719, as modified, and No. 3779, as modified) are \nas follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3719, as modified\n\n    (Purpose: To make minor and technical changes in the moratorium \n                               provision)\n\n       On page 16, beginning with line 23, strike through line 15 \n     on page 17, and insert the following:\n       (a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision thereof \n     shall impose any of the following taxes during the period \n     beginning on October 1, 1998, and ending 3 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act:\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\n       (1) Taxes on Internet access, unless such tax was generally \n     imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998; and\n       (2) Multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce.\n       (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.--\n     Except as provided in this section, nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to modify, impair, or supersede, or authorize \n     the modification, impairment, or superseding of, any State or \n     local law pertaining to taxation that is otherwise \n     permissible by or under the Constitution of the United States \n     or other Federal law and in effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Liabilities and Pending Cases.--Nothing in this Act \n     affects liability for taxes accrued and enforced before the \n     date of enactment of this Act, nor does this Act affect \n     ongoing litigation relating to such taxes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3779, as modified\n\n       On page 2, after line 14, add the following:\n       (d) Definition of Generally Imposed and Actually \n     Enforced.--For purposes of this section, a tax has been \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998, if, before that date, the tax was authorized by statute \n     and either--\n       (1) a provider of Internet access services had a reasonable \n     opportunity to know by virtue of a rule or other public \n     proclamation made by the appropriate administrative agency of \n     the State or political subdivision thereof, that such agency \n     has interpreted and applied such tax to Internet access \n     services; or\n       (2) a State or political subdivision thereof generally \n     collected such tax on charges for Internet access.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I don't know if there is any debate on \nthe Dorgan second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the second-degree amendment to the \nfirst-degree amendment that was offered by the Senator from Arizona is \nan amendment that has been worked out over a period of several days \ndealing with the grandfather clause. It is something that I think \nrepresents a workable solution which improves the legislation. It would \nbe my hope that the Senate would approve it.\n  I do want to point out that the amendment that was referred to by \nSenator McCain would be an amendment dealing with the length of the \nmoratorium. My understanding is that the passage of the first-degree \nand second-degree amendments would leave in place a 3-year moratorium \nwith respect to this legislation. The Senator from Arizona would then \noffer an amendment, and I believe there would be a recorded vote after \nsome debate on that amendment, that would propose that the 3-year \nmoratorium be extended to 4 years, and the Senate then would make a \njudgment on that question.\n  I offer that by way of explanation of what is happening here. I hope \nthe Senate will approve by voice vote the first- and second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (No. 3779, as modified, and No. 3719, as modified, as \namended) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 3783 To Amendment No. 3719, As Modified, as Amended\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3783 to amendment No. 3719, as modified and amended.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On line 5, strike ``3'' and insert ``4''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. As I explained earlier, this will be a simple vote on \nwhether the moratorium should last for 3 years or 4 years. I am sorry \nwe have to have a recorded vote on it since we were able to reach \nagreement on far more contentious issues surrounding this legislation. \nThere will be some debate and discussion on this amendment.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3678, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the other day the Senate adopted \namendment No. 3678, which had technical and drafting errors. I ask \nunanimous consent that the modification of the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3678), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following new title:\n\n     SEC. ____01.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3783\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me try to describe briefly for the \nSenate where we are with respect to the important issue coming up now \non the length of the moratorium. As Chairman McCain and my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, noted, the two issues we have been trying to deal with, \nthe question of grandfathering in existing States and localities and \nthe length of the moratorium are linked, and we think we have a fair \nprocess in place now for resolving the two important issues.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues why I think it is important that \nwe go with the McCain amendment on the length of the moratorium. The \nlegislation, when I introduced it in March of 1997, did not specify how \nlong the moratorium should last. When we considered it in the Senate \nCommerce Committee, after a very lengthy debate and, in effect, taking \na break for 5 or 6 months after the hearings were held to try to work \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle, the Senate Commerce Committee \nvoted out legislation that set in place a 6-year moratorium.\n  As Senators know, the Finance Committee then went forward with its \nlegislation and imposed a 2-year moratorium. In a sense, this \nmoratorium isn't even the most accurate way to describe it because even \nduring this period Internet transactions were treated exactly like any \nother transaction. We have heard discussion of how, in some way, the \nlegislation would create some sort of special tax haven for the \nInternet, and that is simply not the case. Internet transactions would \nbe treated just like any other.\n  The reason the McCain amendment with respect to the length of the \nmoratorium is important is not just because it is a compromise--4 \nyears--between the Commerce Committee bill and the Finance Committee \nbill, but I think it is going to take that long in order to deal with \nthese issues in a thoughtful way. They are complicated questions. It is \nvery clear that if, for example, someone orders fruit from Harry and \nDavid's in Medford, OR, uses America Online in Virginia to make the \norder, pays for it with a bank card in California, and ships it to a \ncousin in Boston, this transaction could affect scores and scores of \nlocal jurisdictions, as well as a number of States. So we do want \nsufficient time to sort out these issues.\n  Under the amendment that will be first offered by Senator McCain and \nmyself, there would be a two-step process. First, the commission \nstudies the issues and makes its recommendations to the Congress. \nSecond, the recommendation must be implemented. Our concern is that a \nnumber of State legislatures do not meet every year; mine is one. You \nare going to need the McCain-Wyden amendment with respect to the \nmoratorium in order to make sure that you have sufficient time for both \nthe study of these issues and recommendations to the Congress, as well \nas an adequate amount of time for legislative bodies to consider them.\n  So we felt that the amendment we were offering not only was a fair \ncompromise between what was passed in the Senate Commerce Committee \noverwhelmingly and what was passed in the Senate Finance Committee, but \nin terms of the actual logistics of State legislative sessions, we \nbelieve the amendment that we will be offering with respect to the \nlength of the moratorium is a critical one.\n  The fact of the matter is, when you have in the vicinity of 30,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions--and that is the number in our country--you have \nthe prospect of different taxing jurisdictions in States and localities \nthat all see the Internet as the golden goose; you have the real \nprospect that policies could be adopted that would cause great damage \nto the Internet's development and cause that golden goose to lay far \nfewer eggs.\n  What we are trying to do in this legislation is to restore a balance \nwith respect to the moratorium. We think it is a fair compromise \nbetween what the two committees dealt with here in the U.S. Senate, and \nat the same time we think it is an approach that will give adequate \ntime for the States and localities to deal with the recommendations \nthat are made while making sure that businesses aren't confused and, in \na number of instances, paralyzed by discriminatory and multiple \ntaxation about which they are already expressing concerns.\n  I think we have made a considerable amount of headway. As I have said \nin a couple of instances when I came to the floor, if you look at the \nlegislation that the Presiding Officer heard discussed in the Commerce \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n\nearly in 1997 and the legislation that is before the Senate now, it is \nclear that there have been many, many changes, over 30. Those are \nchanges that were made specifically to try to deal with the legitimate \nconcerns of States and localities that are concerned about their \nrevenue prospects with respect to the digital economy.\n  We have tried to be fair. We had a number of votes on the floor of \nthe Senate. There were several which I thought would have done great \ndamage to the philosophy of what we are trying to do in this \nlegislation. There were others raised with respect to ensuring the fair \nanalysis of a variety of issues and participation on the commission \nwhere, clearly, Senators have tried very hard to work together.\n  The issue that is coming up now with respect to the length of the \nmoratorium is critical. When I introduced this legislation last year, \nthere was no end date on the moratorium. The reason there was not is \nthat it was our view that if ever there was something that ought to be \ntreated as interstate commerce, it was the Internet. The Internet is \nglobal; it knows no boundaries. It is not something that ought to be \nbalkanized in the 21st century into kind of a toll-riddled freeway \nwhere it will be very hard to tap the potential of the Internet.\n  We should make no mistake about it. The great potential for the \nInternet is for those individuals, such as those in rural America and \ninner cities, senior citizens, handicapped individuals, many of them \noperating home-based businesses, who with sensible governmental \npolicies will be able to, in my view, make a very decent living in the \nglobal economy. But the prerequisite of having those kinds of \nopportunities will be policies that allow the Internet to flourish. \nThose policies should neither be discriminatory against the Internet \nnor should they be preferential.\n  I have heard various Senators say over the last few days that in some \nway this legislation would ensure preferential treatment for the \nInternet. It would do nothing of the sort. It would say very \nspecifically that Internet sales ought to be treated just like \neverything else. If you pay a specific tax by buying the goods in a \njurisdiction in the traditional way, by walking into a retail store, \nunder this legislation, even with the moratorium, you pay exactly the \nsame tax if you order those goods over the Internet--exactly the same \ntax. There is nothing preferential, nothing discriminatory.\n  In a little bit we will have that first vote on the amendment that \nChairman McCain and I offered together with respect to the length of \nthe moratorium. It will ensure that we have enough time to study the \nvarious issues with respect to electronic commerce and make \nrecommendations, and it will give adequate time to have those \nrecommendations implemented by the localities and the States. There are \na number of States that do not meet every year, for example, with their \nlegislatures. They would not have adequate time under the shorter \nversion of the moratorium.\n  Madam President, and colleagues, we will have those votes before too \nlong. I thank the various Senators who have weighed in with myself and \nChairman McCain, both today and over the last few days. This has been a \ngood debate. And it is only the beginning of our discussions on the \nground rules for the digital economy.\n  This presents a whole new set of questions for the U.S. Senate. When \nwe look at traditional commerce, even with the Senate Commerce \nCommittee of 40 or 50 years ago, we were talking about moving goods \nfrom point A to point B. There was a role for traditional business. \nThere was a role for labor unions and various other key economic \nsectors such as the transportation sector. That has changed now in many \nrespects, because information--in effect, goods and services--can move \non the Internet in a flash of light. So we need sensible policies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support that first amendment that Chairman \nMcCain and I are offering with respect to the length of the moratorium. \nIt will ensure that States and localities have an adequate amount of \ntime to act after the recommendations of the commission to go forward. \nIt is a true compromise. The Senate Commerce Committee passed \nlegislation that called for a moratorium of 6 years after my original \nbill with Chairman McCain, which had no end date at all. The Senate \nFinance Committee bill was 2 years. We are going forward with 4. That \nwould give the States an opportunity to act in a thoughtful way.\n  I hope on that first vote the Senate will support the McCain-Wyden \namendment with respect to the length of the moratorium.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge the advocates of the 3-year \nmoratorium to come to the floor and help us explore this very complex \nissue as to whether we are going to have a 3-year or a 4-year \nmoratorium. I know it is a subject that is complex in detail. However, \nwe would like to complete the debate on this very complicated issue \nthat we were unable to resolve with our friends on the other side of \nthis issue.\n  Again, I find it remarkable that we were able to work out grandfather \nlanguage, and about 15 other amendments. But somehow this one is worthy \nof a vote as to whether a moratorium is 3 or 4 years.\n  I can't add a lot to what the distinguished Senator from Oregon just \nsaid, except to say that I hope we can minimize the debate. But I say \nto those who are the 3-year advocates to come over and make their case, \nbecause as soon as Senator Dorgan comes back we would like to move on \nthat amendment, because I believe that, following Senator Murkowski's \nmotion on the underlying amendment, we can move to final passage on \nthis bill.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon would like to dispense of this \nlegislation but not nearly so much as I would.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman for all of his patience.\n  I think it would be helpful, and perhaps the chairman would lay it \nout, to know that through this discussion there has been an effort to \nlink the grandfather provision effort to make sure that States and \nlocalities that already have laws on the books are protected and to \nlink that to the moratorium so that there would be an effort to be fair \nto both sides. I think the Senator has been very fair, and perhaps the \nSenator could elaborate a little bit on some of the challenges with \nrespect to that grandfather debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator repeat his question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am sorry. The fact is the grandfathering provision and \nthe moratorium really are linked, and I think that the Senator has been \nvery fair to both sides with respect to this discussion, and to the \nextent that there are greater protections for grandfathering and more \njurisdiction protected that obviously affects the discussion about the \nlength of the moratorium. I think the Senator struck a fair balance, \nand I think it would be helpful if the Senator could take the Senate \nthrough those discussions a bit.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me some time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The reality is that the original legislation as proposed by the \nSenator from Oregon had no grandfathering. It had no time limit. This \nlegislation received overwhelming support both in the committee and, \nvery frankly, throughout the country, and gradually, interestingly \nenough, many Governors who would experience, in the view of some, a \nloss of revenue came on board this legislation--the Governor of \nCalifornia, the Governor of Texas, the Governor of New York, and many \nother Governors, but practically every Governor of every major State.\n  Along those lines, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from the distinguished Governor of Virginia, Mr. Gilmore, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\n\n\n\n                                      Commonwealth of Virginia\n\n                                 Richmond, VA, September 25, 1998.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am very pleased the Senate will soon \n     vote on the Internet Tax Freedom Act (S. 442).\n       Since its introduction last year, I have been--and continue \n     to be--in strong support of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \n     Your work on this important legislation goes hand in hand \n     with the compromise agreement reached by the Commerce and \n     Judiciary Committees in the House of Representatives. Both \n     Committees as well as the full House passed the bill \n     unanimously after well reasoned compromise from all those \n     concerned.\n       As you know, the Internet is one of our most valuable and \n     fastest-growing resources, presenting enormous potential to \n     revolutionize both global and domestic commerce. But this \n     incredible tool currently faces some significant obstacles \n     with respect to state and local taxation. With more than \n     30,000 state and local taxing jurisdictions in the United \n     States, Internet development is in danger of being stifled by \n     a maze of inconsistent, unfair, and burdensome taxing \n     regimes.\n       There are currently thousands of Internet companies, which \n     can be found in every state in the nation. They are small but \n     important vehicles of economic development and are unfairly \n     assessed taxes based on interpretations of existing tax law \n     written well before the establishment of the Internet. \n     Because of the importance of these businesses, the substance \n     of the act should do what its title suggests.\n       The Internet Tax Freedom Act is important to our state \n     economies, to online consumers, and to the future success of \n     electronic commerce. This legislation places a temporary \n     moratorium on certain taxes so that an appropriate, non-\n     discriminatory Internet tax policy can be developed and \n     implemented by policymakers at all levels.\n       For these reasons, I urge the enactment of the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act this year and look forward to working with you \n     and the Congress to ensure our nation remains the undisputed \n     leader in cutting edge technology industries.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             James S. Gilmore III,\n                                             Governor of Virginia.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Gilmore says:\n\n       I am very pleased the Senate will soon vote on the Internet \n     Tax Reform Act, S. 442.\n\n  Not as pleased as I am. He says in his concluding paragraph:\n\n       For these reasons, I urge the enactment of the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act this year and look forward to working with you \n     and the Congress to ensure our Nation remains the undisputed \n     leader in cutting edge technology industries.\n\n  So another Governor and a very important one, the Governor of \nVirginia, has weighed in in favor of this legislation.\n  I believe the fact that we were willing to agree to certain \ngrandfathering provisions was very helpful in moving this process \nforward, but I also think that it made an argument for a 4-year \nmoratorium. Again, when it came out of the committee, it was 6 years \noriginally and now the Finance Committee reduced it to 2. We think that \n4 years is obviously a reasonable compromise.\n  So again I urge the 3-year moratorium advocates to come to the floor \nso we could have vigorous debate on that issue and a vote sometime \naround 4:45, with the agreement of the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3727\n\n (Purpose: To include legislative recommendations in the commission's \n                                report.)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know of no opposition to the amendment \n3727 by Senator Enzi, and I therefore call up the amendment and ask \nthat it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking that the pending \namendment be laid aside?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside for the Enzi amendment 3727.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the Enzi amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Enzi, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3727.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 25, beginning on line 10, strike ``a report \n     reflecting the results'' and insert the following: ``for its \n     consideration a report reflecting the results, including such \n     legislative recommendations as required to address the \n     findings''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for his \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3718, as modified\n\n       (Purpose: To revise the definitions of the terms ``tax,'' \n``telecommunications service,'' and ``tax on internet access,'' as used \n                              in the bill)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, I send an amendment \nto the desk, No. 3718, as modified, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside and the \nclerk will report the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona, [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden proposes an amendment numbered 3718, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, beginning with line 20, strike through line 19 \n     on page 30 and insert the following:\n       (8) Tax.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``tax'' means--\n       (i) any charge imposed by any governmental entity for the \n     purpose of generating revenues for governmental purposes, and \n     is not a fee imposed for a specific privilege, service, or \n     benefit conferred; or\n       (ii) the imposition on a seller of an obligation to collect \n     and to remit to a governmental entity any sales or use tax \n     imposed on a buyer by a governmental entity.\n       (B) Exception.--Such term does not include any franchise \n     fee or similar fee imposed by a State or local franchising \n     authority, pursuant to section 622 or 653 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 542, 573), or any other \n     fee related to obligations or telecommunications carriers \n     under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n       (9) Telecommunications service.--The term \n     ``telecommunications service'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 3(46) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 153(56)) and includes communications services (as \n     defined in section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986).\n       (10) Tax on internet access.--The term ``tax on Internet \n     access'' means a tax on Internet access, including the \n     enforcement or application of any new or preexisting tax on \n     the sale or use of Internet services.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has sent up a different version. \nDid the Senator want to modify it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As modified, 3718 as modified. I sent up a modified \nversion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3718), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while he is on the floor, I thank the \nSenator from Wyoming for his involvement in this issue. He won a \nsignificant victory. I believe that his knowledge of this issue and \nthis technology is very helpful not only on this issue, but we will be \naddressing numerous other issues regarding these emerging technologies \nin the future and I appreciate his participation. We look forward to \nworking with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Oregon for their cooperation and the careful work they \nhave done on the bill with the acceptance of the amendments that I and \na number of other people worked on. I appreciate that. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\nproceed for 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk very briefly about the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the meeting that took place in \nWashington yesterday and today and will be taking place this week.\n  The eyes of the world are on Washington this week where the major \ninternational financial institutions search for answers to the most \nserious international economic crisis in years. As the world's most \nsuccessful economy at the moment, the United States bears, in my view, \nan unavoidable responsibility, and that responsibility is to lead--lead \nin a search for answers to this crisis.\n  But as last year's Asian financial turmoil has evolved into a global \nfinancial crisis, to my great disappointment, the House of \nRepresentatives persists in what I must say--and I realize it is a \nstrong word--in its irresponsible refusal to approve funding for the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  Twice this year the U.S. Senate has overwhelmingly supported the so-\ncalled U.S. quota, our share of a larger capital reserve for the IMF to \npull threatened countries back from the brink of economic collapse. And \ntwice this year, the House of Representatives has refused to provide \nthe resources--at no cost to the American taxpayer--that the IMF needs \nto contain this widening crisis.\n  As President Clinton, Secretary Rubin, and our representatives to the \ninternational financial institutions in Washington this week urge their \ncounterparts from the rest of the world to join us in controlling the \ncrisis, the response that we are hearing is: ``Show us the money.''\n  There was a movie out that won an Academy Award, and in that movie, \nthey said, ``Show me the money.'' We have our Secretary of the Treasury \nand our President constituting an American plea for the rest of the \nworld to act responsibly, and they are being told, ``Show us the \nmoney.'' I want to point out that even if these other countries ante up \ntheir share, the IMF cannot take any action, absent us putting in our \nshare, because you need an 85-percent vote.\n  Try as they might, how can we expect our leadership to lead the rest \nof the world with the albatross of the House's irresponsibility hung \nsquarely around their necks? By failing to provide full funding of our \nparticipation in the IMF, we undercut our credibility and our \nauthority, the credibility and the authority of the world's \nindispensable economic leader, in the most serious international \neconomic crisis, at least of my generation and the Presiding Officer's.\n  Go down to these meetings, Mr. President--and I suggest this to all \nmy colleagues--and the first thing you will hear from both our \nrepresentatives and their counterparts from around the world is the \ncomplaint that the U.S. Congress is holding up one of the key elements \nthey need to construct a response to the current crisis: the funds to \nprotect vulnerable economies from financial collapse.\n  Every State in the Union--from States as far away as Washington and \nDelaware--every State in the Union has been hit by the decline in our \nagricultural and manufacturing exports because of the collapse of major \nmarkets for American goods around the world.\n  In my own State of Delaware, exports to Asia are down 20 percent \ncompared to last year. That translates into jobs--Delaware jobs. The \ncrisis that began last year in Asia has spiraled around the planet to \nRussia, a nuclear power facing economic and political collapse, and on \nto our closest trading partners in Latin America.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that \nwithout the resources to support Brazil and other countries threatened \nby the wild swings of international capital flows, countries as \nimportant to us as Mexico, our third largest trading partner, could be \nthe next to fall. And yet, in my view--and I realize some may disagree, \neven those who voted with me on funding of IMF in the Senate--in my \nview, the House continues to play politics with our obligation to the \nonly international institution in the position to attempt to control \nthe spread of economic meltdown.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues in the House to come to their \nsenses, to match the Senate in action and provide the U.S. share for \nthe IMF quota increase. Time is running out, Mr. President. I hope what \nI read in the papers--what we all read in the papers--that the \nleadership in the House is about to release this money, about to vote \nfor it, is true, because time is running out and there will be a price \nto pay for inaction.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I withhold the request suggesting the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11680-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11680-S11681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OZONE LAYER\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my time left in the Senate is very brief. \nI have--I don't know--3, 4, at the most 5 days left of active duty on \nthe Senate floor. I read a story in the paper this morning that gives \nme some satisfaction at least about some of the things I have done \nsince I came here.\n  As I have said on the floor many times, there isn't anything as \ngratifying to a Senator as being able to stand on the floor and say, \n``I told you so.''\n  When I first came here, I had read a story in some science magazine \nabout two young physicists at the University of California at Irvine \nwho had developed a theory that chlorofluorocarbons--a gas, normally \nfound in aerosols and freon, which we use in our air conditioners and \nrefrigerators--that these chlorofluorocarbons that we sprayed on our \nhair in the morning were wafting up into the stratosphere over a period \nof 12 to 15 years and destroying the ozone layer.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I thought ``ozone'' was a town in \nJohnson County, AR, which indeed it is. As a matter of fact I spoke at \nthe high school graduation at Ozone last year. Nevertheless, this \ntheory about something we were doing rather mindlessly that had almost \ncataclysmic consequences for the future intrigued me.\n  I had been put on the Space Committee when I came here. I did not ask \nfor the Space Committee--it was a spacey committee. We abolished it a \ncouple years after I came here, but I asked the chairman, Senator Moss \nof Utah, if I could hold some hearings on this theory and invite some \natmospheric scientists to come in and testify. And he said, ``I have no \nobjection to that.'' Just ad hoc hearings. I certainly was not chairman \nof the subcommittee or anything else. I had just gotten here. He said, \n``I don't mind you doing that, but you need to get a Republican to sit \nwith you in these hearings.'' So I recruited my good friend, Senator \nDomenici, from New Mexico.\n  Senator Domenici and I held nine hearings over a period of about 6 \nmonths. We had the best atmospheric scientists in the United States \ncoming in and testifying--Dr. Rowland and Dr. Molina.\n  In those hearings, we probably had an average of 15 people in the \naudience. We had a television camera show up only once. When we \nfinished, Senator Domenici did not feel quite as strongly as I did \nabout abolishing the manufacturing of CFCs immediately, and so Senator \nPackwood and I took it on and brought it to the floor of the Senate to \nabolish the manufacturing of CFCs.\n  The chemical lobbyists in that lobby, through that door, were so \nthick I could hardly get to the floor to vote. And as I recall, we got \na whopping 33 votes. I was arguing that if we were to cut off all \nmanufacturing of CFCs right now, we still had 12 to 15 years of damage \ncoming because that is how long it took from the time you sprayed your \nhair the morning we voted for it to get there and start destroying \nozone.\n  You know all the arguments: This is untested; unproved; and we need \nto ``study'' it. That is the way you kill things around here--study it. \nAnd so that is the end of the story in 1975.\n  In 1985, the National Academy of Sciences, who we had assigned to do \nthe study--10 years later--discovered that there was a developing hole \nin the\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\nozone layer over Antarctica. And almost every year since then that \nozone hole has grown bigger and bigger and bigger. We have phased out \nthe manufacturing of CFCs--we do not use it anymore to spray our hair \nwith; and we have substitutes for air-conditioning and refrigeration. \nNevertheless, if you saw the Post this morning, the current estimates \nare that the ozone hole is deeper and wider than it has ever been, and \nhas been growing almost every year since 1975 when we first discovered \nit.\n  The good news is, while scientists were shocked by the size of the \nozone hole in their current study, they still believe that it can be \nstabilized by the year 2050. Well, let's hope so, because if it isn't, \nwe can anticipate 300,000 additional cases of skin cancer.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The ozone layer protects us from the ultraviolet rays of \nthe Sun. The hole that we have already caused is going to cause \nthousands and thousands of cases of skin cancer before we even begin to \nstabilize the ozone layer.\n  Mr. President, I tell that little story with some satisfaction, \nbecause I daresay there are not many Senators who fought as many losing \nbattles in the U.S. Senate as I have. So the only reason I tell that \nstory is to let people know that sometimes when you cast unpopular \nvotes you will be proven right. A lot of Senators get beat before they \never get a chance to be proven right.\n  I voted against more constitutional amendments than any Senator in \nthe U.S. Senate. I am proud of every one of them. Rest assured, if they \nbring the flag desecration amendment up again, I will be happy to vote \nagainst that, too, for reasons I will not belabor now.\n  I see my good friend from Nevada wanting to speak. And I want to \nfollow him on the matter pending before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Arkansas, the mere fact that you \nlose the vote on the floor does not mean that you lose the issue. And I \nsay to my friend, I have been on the floor on the Senator's side, \njoining him on a number of causes which we have won and which we have \nlost; and I have been his adversary on a number of issues. I only wish \nthat everyone had the Senator's demeanor, his ability and his sense of \nfairness. We would be a much better Senate, a much better country.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11680-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11681-S11682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESCRIPTION CONTRACEPTION EQUITY AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the distinct honors I have had is \njoining with the senior Senator from Maine in legislation that passed \nunanimously in this body and passed by an overwhelming margin in the \nHouse. It was an amendment we placed in the Treasury-Postal Service \nbill. It was a bill that we had introduced on the floor.\n  On this occasion, we decided to limit it just to Federal employees, \nwhich we did. We were elated that we were able to make great strides on \nthis issue about which we felt so strongly. And we were contemplating \nthe day when this bill would be signed and become law, because \ncertainly it should. It passed over here unanimously; passed the House \nby an overwhelming margin.\n  I cannot speak for my colleague from Maine, but I am sure she feels \njust as disappointed as I am that this bill was stripped during the \nconference of the Treasury-Postal Service bill for really no reason. \nThere was no debate among the conferees. It was just taken from the \nbill.\n  It would be easy for me to be partisan here and say this is some \ncabal by the Republicans. The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, \nthis bill had bipartisan support. It was not a Democratic bill; it was \nnot a Democratic amendment. It was not a Republican bill, a Republican \namendment.\n  So I am here to complain about the process. This should not have \nhappened. I am not going to point fingers as to why it happened, but it \nhappened. I am tremendously disappointed.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about a bill that the senior \nSenator from Maine and I have been working on for over a year, a bill \nthat has 35 cosponsors in the Senate. It is a bill that recognizes that \neach year in this country there are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies. \nForty-four percent of those pregnancies wind up with abortion. We find \nthat insurance companies' health care providers routinely pay for \nabortions, vasectomies, tubal ligations, but they don't pay for the \nsimple contraceptives that are approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. There are only five. They don't pay for them.\n\n  We are saying it should be done. Women pay almost 70 percent more for \nhealth care than men. It seems unusual that when Viagra came out there \nwas a mad rush to make sure that there was insurance coverage and every \nother kind of coverage for Viagra. We said at that time, the Senator \nfrom Maine and I, shouldn't we recognize the fact that women pay more, \nthat insurance companies and health maintenance agencies do not pay for \ncontraceptives and they should? We would save huge amounts of money. We \nwould have healthier mothers and healthier babies. But it doesn't \nappear we are going to have it this year.\n  Our bill, called the Prescription Contraceptive Fairness Act, would \napply this to Federal health care plans. There are 374 different health \ncare plans under the Federal system that would cover these pills or the \nother four devices. It would save money.\n  It was killed in conference based upon some illusion that it had \nsomething to do with abortion. It has nothing to do with abortion. In \nfact, it would cut down on abortions. We are not forcing anyone to use \ncontraceptives if they don't want to. We think they should be made \navailable.\n  I was on a talk show. A woman called in and said, ``I'm pregnant with \nour third child. I'm a diabetic. I would prefer I were not pregnant. \nI'm going to carry the baby to term but it could endanger my health. I \nhope the baby is healthy. My husband's insurance company does not cover \ncontraceptives, and as a result of that, I'm pregnant because the stuff \nwe used doesn't work very well.'' There are a multitude of stories just \nlike this. Remember, there are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in \nour country every year. Not every 10 years--every year.\n  I am embarrassed this was stripped from the bill for some reason that \nis not justifiable. The Federal Government serves as a role model for \nother employers across the Nation. This would have been a great start. \nIt has received support from the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists. We have received little static from the insurance \ncompanies. Why? It creates an even playing field. If they all have to \ndo the same thing, it doesn't hurt anyone. In the long run, people in \nthe plans would save money.\n  Individuals who led the effort to strip this historic amendment from \nthis Treasury-Postal Service bill are ignoring the will of both the \nHouse and the Senate. The House voted in favor of this amendment in \nJuly; the Senate accepted our amendment in July, also. I don't think it \nis fair. I think these individuals who feel they have the authority to \nignore the decision already made in both Houses should consider why \nthey did this. They had no good reason to do it. It has nothing to do \nwith abortion, which is supposedly the reason it was done.\n  Politics aside, the real losers in this battle are the 1.2 million \nwomen covered under the FEHBP system who will continue to be denied the \nquality in health care coverage they deserve. People who fought behind \nclosed doors to strip this amendment from the bill are using the anti-\nabortion statement as a defense. That is wrong. They shouldn't do that. \nThis argument is unfounded.\n  As I said, this bill would lead to healthier mothers, healthier \nbabies, and lower health care costs for all Americans. This legislation \ndoesn't require any woman to use contraceptives, but it gives them a \nchoice.\n  I see my colleague on the floor. It has been an honor for me to work \nwith her on this legislation. She has been the driving force in getting \nthis legislation to the point we thought we were.\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\n  I will yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11681-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11682-S11688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3783\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the McCain amendment \nNo. 3783 to amendment No. 3719.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the McCain second-\ndegree amendment which would extend the moratorium on States taxing \nInternet transactions from 3 years to 4. The Finance Committee had \nknocked it back to 2 years. We thought that was a reasonable length of \ntime, given that we allowed 15 months to restructure the IRS; 18 months \nin getting the Medicare Commission to do its work. We believed that 2 \nyears was a reasonable period of time. I was willing to go along with \nan extension of that from 2 years to 3. To go to 4 years is just much \ntoo long a time.\n  This is an issue where the Federal Government is intervening, saying \nthe States can't raise taxes in a certain way. This is, in my judgment, \nwithout precedent.\n  I am willing to support this piece of legislation. I am willing to \nprovide this moratorium so we can reach an understanding of how we will \ntax these transactions. But to allow 4 years--when we allow \napproximately 15 months in getting a commission to restructure the IRS, \nand 18 months in getting Medicare, Mr. President--is an unreasonable \nlength of time.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the McCain amendment. We have \nbeen contacted by our Governors who are actually asking us to go along \nwith the Finance Committee, which was 2 years. As I said, I'm willing \nto support a compromise to 3 years, but 4 years, given the amount of \ntime we have allowed for some things that are more complicated than \nthis, it is unreasonable and too lengthy a period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I agree mostly with what the Senator from \nNebraska said. I prefer a 2-year moratorium.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska stated, earlier this year, we passed a \nbill to reform the Internal Revenue Service. That legislation arose \nfrom the IRS Commission, which had a mere 15 statutory months to take a \ntop to bottom look at, and make recommendations on, how to restructure \nthe IRS. The entire commission process plus the legislating process \nresulted in a bill the President signed in just a shade over two years.\n  The point I am trying to make is this: Fair taxation of the Internet \nis not more complicated than restructuring the IRS. The bill to which \nthe two amendments presently pending are offered, is a bill that \nprovides a 2-year moratorium. Two years is enough. To allow any more \ntime would do nothing but prove that the U.S. Senate is knuckling under \nto the Internet industry.\n  I see my good friend from Florida on the floor. He and I were both \nGovernors. The Governors signed off on 2 years and now here is a letter \nsaying they hope we will compromise on 3 years. ``Do not adopt,'' they \nsay, ``the 4 year moratorium. Accept the compromise of 3 years.''\n  I can tell you, Senator, if I were still Governor of my State, I \nwould be squealing like a pig under a gate. Here a significant \npercentage of the State's entire tax base is being eroded, literally \ndestroyed, by remote sellers, and the Internet industry and the \nGovernors say let's compromise at 3 years. We are willing not to tax \nthe Internet for a 3-year period. Think about that. In 3 years' time \nthe estimates are that sales over the Internet will be $300 billion. We \nknow that catalog sales right now are in excess of $100 billion.\n  The States are saying they are willing to forgo their right to tax \nthe Internet for 3 years. If there were no catalog sales, if there were \nno Internet, $400 billion worth of goods would be sold by Main Street \nmerchants in America on which they would pay a 4, 5, 6, or 7 percent \nsales tax to support their community schools, their fire departments, \ntheir police departments, their landfills, paving their streets and \neverything else that cities have to do.\n  Yes, if I were still Governor, trying to raise teachers' salaries, \ntrying to making better schools, trying to increase the size of the \npolice department and reduce crime in my community, if I were charged \nwith the responsibility as mayor or Governor and had the responsibility \nof our children, our environment, all of those things, I would never \nsit still. I would never sit still for allowing these people to escape \ntaxation. It has been a mystery to me for 7 years, as I have fought to \ntry to give the States the right--not the mandate, but the right--to \nmake remote sellers collect sales taxes. There are only 7,500 of them. \nThe bill I offered would only affect 675 of them. We exempted everybody \nthat did less than $3 million in business a year. I have been soundly \ndefeated each time I have tried to correct this problem. And as I leave \nthe U.S. Senate after 24 years, it is a mystery to me. Why do people \nvote to allow the tax bases in their States to be eroded when their \nGovernors and their mayors and local officials are scrounging for money \nto improve schools and everything else?\n\n  My State has a sales and use tax on all mail-order sales coming into \nmy State. Do you know how much we collect on it? Zero. Do you know why? \nBecause the tax is on the purchaser. I promise you there is not 1 in \n10,000 people in the State of Arkansas that even know that the tax \nexists. Of course, they don't pay it. Literally millions of dollars of \ngoods come into my State every year on which not one cent of tax is \ncollected, even though it is owed. But it is owed by the person who \nbought the merchandise, and he or she doesn't even know the tax exists.\n  When we try to say to the States--Senator Graham, Senator Dorgan and \nmyself--that we are going to help you, we want to honor what you are \ntrying to do, they have all championed my bill. They haven't been very \neffective, but the Governors and mayors have all championed my \nlegislation every year I have offered it. But the U.S. Senators sit up \nhere, with all their arrogance, and say to their legislatures, \nGovernors and mayors: We don't care what you want, we will decide what \nyou get. For 7 years, so far, and much longer than that, we have said \nyou get nothing. We are not going to let you tax mail-order sales. So \nquit talking about it. You might as well quit talking about it. I think \n30 or 35 votes is my high-water mark in trying to address what I \nconsider a terrible problem.\n  The Presiding Officer heard me talk a while ago about how the first \nthing I did when I came here was to try to stop the manufacturing of \nCFCs that are destroying our ozone. We all know the ozone is being \nsystematically destroyed, but back then we had to study it. It was just \na theory. As I said, the best way to kill something in the U.S. Senate \nis to say let's study it. If you want to never hear of something again, \nget an amendment adopted that says, no, you can't do that anymore, you \nhave to study it.\n  That is what we are doing here. We are saying to the mayors and \nGovernors and legislatures of our respective States--45 of the 50 \nStates already have a tax, but it is on the consumer and nobody knows \nit, and they are desperate. The reason I mention that again is because \nI will be sitting down in Arkansas, or someplace, a few years from now \nand this thing will crescendo and will reach a level where the Senate \nwon't have any choice but to deal with it and to give the States that \nright, because if they don't their schools are going to start \ncrumbling, their police departments are going to go to pot, as are \ntheir fire departments.\n  Did you see in the paper this morning where Amazon.com's stock is \nselling for over $100 a share, and they haven't made a nickel profit \nyet? It is estimated they are selling two-thirds of all the books sold \nover the Internet, and their sales are growing exponentially. I have a \nlot of friends that never buy a book from a local bookstore anymore. \nThey buy it over the Internet. Not only do they get a little discount, \nthey pay no sales tax on it. So this morning's paper says Amazon.com \nhas become so terrific and so powerful that a publishing house is \nbuying Barnes & Noble's on-line system. They have a third and \nAmazon.com has two-thirds. The publishing house knows that they are\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\ngoing to be put out of business if they don't get with the program, \nbecause Amazon.com is going to be selling all the books in the country. \nSo they are buying Barnes & Noble's on-line book service.\n  That is good for the consumers, but it is terrible for State and \nlocal government. Yesterday afternoon, I offered an amendment to say at \nleast make the Internet state that the merchandise you buy may be \nsubject to local taxation. You think about that. Senator Dorgan voted \nwith me, Senator Graham voted with me, and we got 27 votes. They don't \neven want the people to know that there is a sales tax on which the \npurchaser is liable.\n  Then, this morning, we finally won a little battle. There was an \namendment here that I could not believe that said you can't study this \nissue. Think of that. Normally you use studies to kill things. This \nmorning, we get an amendment saying you can't even study it. I am \ntelling you, I don't know what the Internet and these mail-order \ncatalog houses have on the Senate, but it must be something. Larry \nFlynt ought to be offering a million dollars to find out the answer to \nthat one. So here we are standing around debating an issue, the merits \nof which are not even in question. Everybody knows that we ought not to \nbe giving a free ride to the to people who are selling merchandise by \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars over the Internet and eroding the \ntax base of almost every State in the Nation. I am for computers; I am \nfor technology, but I am not for allowing them to destroy the tax base \nof the states.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from \nArkansas, and I am reminded again why we are going to miss him when he \nis gone. He fights hard for the things he feels strongly about, and \nthis has been one of them for many years.\n  This vote coming up, probably in 20 minutes, is a very simple vote. \nThis issue started with the notion that people said, gee, we must do \nsomething here to provide a shield so that nobody would impose punitive \ntaxes on the Internet and retard the growth of the Internet. Lord, have \nyou ever seen anything grow like the Internet and Internet commerce? \nThat is mushrooming so fast you can't get your arms around it. And they \nare saying we have to be sure that we protect them.\n  Well, in the matter of protecting them, they have created a \nmoratorium on the ability of State and local governments to impose \ntaxes. The vote that we are going to have in a moment is regarding how \nlong that moratorium is going to last. The committee on which I serve \nreported a bill out that said let's have a moratorium for 6 years. I \ndidn't vote for that. The House of Representatives said let's have a \nmoratorium for 3 years. The Senate Finance Committee said let's have a \nmoratorium for 2 years. The underlying bill will now say 3 years. The \namendment we are going to vote on says no, that is not enough; we need \na 4-year moratorium. The Senator from Arkansas will be fishing in \nArkansas, and at the end of 4 years we will have folks--I guarantee \nit--who will stand here on the floor of the Senate, and they will say, \n``We have got to have an extender. We have to extend this moratorium.'' \nHow long? Another 4 years. How about permanently? Make it a permanent \nextender. That is exactly what is going to happen.\n\n  We ought to decide as a Senate 3 years--no more. And at the end of 3 \nyears we are done. If we can't figure it out by the end of 3 years, \nthere is something wrong with us.\n  I ask the Senator from Arkansas. Does he agree that this ought not be \na circumstance where we create a tax system that says, ``Oh, by the \nway. We will favor folks doing this over a computer,'' which means we \nwill penalize the folks that hire the folks on Main Street who rent the \nbuilding, put the inventory in, open their door early in the morning, \nand hold themselves open for business. And we say to them that we will \npenalize them because the other folks don't have to comply with the tax \nlaws when they come in and compete with them.\n  That is what this fight is about. The amendment here is going to be 4 \nyears or 3 years. There will be a lot of folks who come to the well of \nthe Senate and say, ``What is the issue?'' The issue is that for every, \nI assume, 4 years, or for every 3 years. But what does good sense tell \nus ought to be the case here? Three years maximum, and then no more. \nThen let's have a tax system that is fair to everybody regardless of \nhow they are selling--off the Internet, catalogs, or Main Street. Let's \nbe fair with respect to this tax system of ours.\n  Let me conclude by saying I worked on this issue when I was in the \nHouse of Representatives on the Ways and Means Committee for 10 years. \nI know what the problem is. You start talking about this issue, and the \nfirst thing you know you have a million friends--not friends. You get a \nmillion postcards, because everybody who buys from a catalog seller is \ntold to send a postcard to this person, or that person, and they are \ntold that person is trying to increase your tax. Of course, that is not \ntrue. Nobody is talking about any additional taxes. There is no \nincrease in tax. This is a different issue--the moratorium. So you get \na million cards out there, or 10 million cards that affects all of the \ninterests that are voting.\n  Mr. President, again, let me say to the Senator from Arkansas that \nhis dedication to this issue is important, and he will leave a long and \nlasting impact on the Senate. I think the most immediate impact and the \nmost immediate presentation now is a good vote so we can at least turn \nback the 10 years. I think that would be a good public service.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, my good friend, has been a steadfast ally with me in this \nbattle for many, many years, because the State of North Dakota took \nthis case to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said we are \nreversing ourselves in previous decisions. If the Congress wants to \ngive the right to the States to collect this tax, they can now do it. \nBut Congress has to do it. Congress has steadfastly refused to do what \nthe Supreme Court told them they had the authority to do.\n  I will be sitting down in Arkansas fishing 3 years from now, and I \nassume that is probably the number of years we are going to adopt in a \nfew minutes. I am not going to vote for it. I am not going to vote for \n4 years. I am not going to vote for the bill either. It has a 2-year \nmoratorium. As far as I am concerned, that is enough.\n  But having said that, I will be down there fishing. I will be \nwatching C-SPAN. I will smile to myself when somebody gets up as though \nit is the most original idea that was ever created, and says, ``Mr. \nPresident, I send an amendment to the desk that would create a \ncommission to study taxation of the Internet. We have had 3 years to \nstudy it, but we are really not quite finished and we don't know what \nhavoc this is going to create. We need to get the National Academy of \nSciences, the Council of Economic Advisers, or the GAO. We need \nsomebody to study this a while longer.'' They will buy it again. I can \ntell you that 3 years from now the makeup of this place will not change \nthat much. They will buy it again, and we will extend it again. But \njust like the ozone layer, the time will come when everybody knows that \nyou can't do it anymore, because the States and the cities can't afford \nto let this go any longer. They are barely making ends meet the way it \nis. That is the way it goes. If you do not learn anything in 24 years \nhere, you will learn the way the game is played.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to take a firm stand on an \nissue that I felt strongly about for so many years. As I say, I don't \nintend to vote for a second-degree amendment which would take it to 4 \nyears. I don't intend to vote for the second-degree amendment that will \ntake us to 3 years. The bill, as it came out of committee and came to \nthis floor provided for a 2-year study. That is too long. They don't \nneed 2 years. I am going to vote for the bill because 2 years is much \ntoo long anyway.\n  I don't believe there ought to be a tax exemption for anybody who is \ncompeting with Main Street merchants.\n  Let me add one further thing. The Senator from North Dakota piqued my \nmemory on this. Outside of being the entire Charleston South Franklin \nCounty Bar Association, I was also a Main Street merchant. I can tell \nyou\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\neven then, 40 years ago, my biggest competitor was the catalog. I \ndetested it. I was a Main Street merchant having to organize the \nChristmas parade, be president of the Chamber of Commerce, and trying \nto attract industry into town so we could create a few jobs. I paid \nsales tax on every dime I sold, all of which went for the schools of \nour State and our city, which went to the police department, which went \nto the fire department, which went to help us pave our streets, take \ncare of our landfill, dispose of our garbage.\n  Those are the things that Main Street merchants do in this country. \nWe are saying to them and the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses--NFIB. I don't want to get started on them. As far as I am \nconcerned, they represent big business, and not small business. But I \nthink they are for this bill. It is the most damaging thing to Main \nStreet merchants I can imagine. I know. I used to be one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 5:30 be equally divided for debate on the pending McCain-Wyden \namendment, and at the conclusion of the debate the Senate proceed to \nvote on or in relationship to the amendment.\n  I further ask that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, is there currently a limitation on debate \non this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I object to the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona controls the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Florida what he \nwants.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want just--Mr. President, I would also settle----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair did not hear the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What time agreement will the Senator from Florida agree \nto?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to complete my remarks, and then we will \nconsider what will be an appropriate time limitation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I go back to the same point that I have made on two or \nthree occasions in the debate of this legislation. That is to remind us \nwhat we are doing. We are doing quite an exceptional thing. We are \ntelling to 50 States and multiple local jurisdictions that their legal \nauthority to establish what is the appropriate fiscal policy for their \ncitizens is going to be preempted. We are telling them for this purpose \nthat they will be precluded from exercising a judgment that they might \notherwise feel is in the interest of their residents and citizens.\n  We are doing this in order to provide a pause, a time-out, a brief \nperiod in which to sort out the application of public policy, \nparticularly as it relates to tax policy, and the new technology of the \nInternet.\n  I think that we ought to accept the fact that the presumption should \nbe that that preemption of our brethren at the State and local level \nshould be respectfully as brief as possible. We should not easily or \nexcessively indulge in this kind of behavior, particularly when the \nconsequences of this behavior are so obvious and perverse.\n  I have used the analogy, and I will use it again, of what we are \ndoing to that Main Street merchant, as if to say that Main Street had a \nnorth side and a south side. On the north side, all the people who come \nto buy their hardware, their clothes, their shoes would be responsible \nfor paying the legislated State and local sales tax, and they would be \nresponsible for collecting it and then remitting it back to the \nappropriate tax collection authorities. That is not adding a new tax; \nthat is the administration of a tax which the democratic processes in \nLittle Rock or Tallahassee or Salem or any other State capital have \nprescribed as a means of funding the essential responsibilities of \nlocal and State government. We are saying that on the north side that \ncollection has to take place. But on the south side, which is a virtual \nsouth side because it doesn't really exist other than in cyberspace, \nbecause it is reached through the Internet, there is not such a \nresponsibility to collect on exactly the same hardware, shoes and \nclothing that we now ask the north side merchant to collect.\n  That is a fundamentally unfair proposition. We would be shocked and \nappalled if someone were to suggest that as a de novo proposition. But \nthat is what we are doing with this Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  The second consequence that we are accepting as a result of this \nlegislation is that we are about to drive a major hole into the ability \nof local governments and States to finance their most basic \nresponsibility--police who secure our neighborhoods, fire officials who \nprotect us in times of emergency, and most specifically our schools. I \nwill talk in a moment about what has happened to education during this \n105th Congress, but I suggest that of all the things we have done or we \nhave not done, the most important education bill that we are going to \nconsider in 1998 is the one that is before us today.\n  Now, the question that I ask, and I hope that we receive a response, \nis why 4 years? I was reticent to object to the unanimous consent to \ncall for a vote at 5:30, but I felt that we ought to allow enough time \nfor the proponents of the 4 years to make the strongest case they could \nto overcome what I think should be the very strong presumption against \nmaking this moratorium excessive, against lengthening by an unnecessary \nday, week, month or year the time in which we will allow this \nunfairness in the marketplace and this threat to the ability of State \nand local governments to carry out their fundamental functions to \nremain in existence.\n  Let's talk about what had been some appropriate times for major \ntasks. Well, we find in Genesis, chapter 1 and chapter 2, that God \ncreated Heaven and Earth in 7 days: ``In the beginning, God created the \nHeaven and the Earth, and the Earth was without form and void and \ndarkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved \nupon the face of the waters.'' And 6 days later Earth, the oceans, the \nmountains, the valleys, the streams, all of the fishes, the animals, \nand finally man and woman themselves had been created by God--in 7 \ndays, according to Genesis, chapter 1 and 2. And yet it is going to \ntake us 48 months to figure out what the appropriate tax policy should \nbe for bits and bytes and all of the terminology of the Internet.\n  We have some more recent examples that have already been cited. \nSenator Kerrey said the commission which was responsible for looking at \nthe Internal Revenue Service, clearly one of the most complex agencies \nadministering one of the most complex set of laws that man has ever \nknown, was able to conduct its work in 15 months--3 months less than \nits original charter, and its work was so good that it formed the basis \nof the Congress this year enacting the most significant reform of the \nInternal Revenue Service since it was created. So the fact that they \nhad an 18-month charter to accomplish this very complicated task did \nnot degrade the quality of the ultimate recommendations and the \nreceptivity of Congress to those recommendations.\n  We have currently at work a commission studying Medicare. That \ncommission, which was created by this Congress in 1997, was given 18 \nmonths to do its work. Medicare is one of the largest and most complex \nprograms that this Congress has ever created. It serves to finance the \nhealth care of over 35 million Americans. It is a significant part of a \nhealth care industry which represents approximately one-seventh of our \ngross domestic product. We decided that 18 months was the appropriate \ntime to study the complex Medicare system, and yet it is going to take \nus 4 years, according to this amendment, to decide what should be the \nappropriate way for the State of North Carolina to levy taxes on \nInternet activities that affect the citizens of the State of North \nCarolina.\n  The almost absurdity of this 4-year period leads one to suspect--and \nwe are not by nature a suspicious, certainly\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n\nnot a cynical people, but to suspect--that there are motivations here \nother than allowing a sufficient amount of time, the amount of time \nthat we normally anticipate would be required to get a undergraduate \ndegree from one of our great colleges or universities, why it would \ntake 4 years in order to study this issue.\n  Let me suggest what I think some of the motivations might be. One is \nthat it is going to provide an extended period of freedom from taxation \nduring which there will be new technological applications of the \nInternet which will have the effect of further widening the gap between \nMain Street and cyberspace and further exposing local and State \ngovernment to an erosion of their tax base.\n  I spoke yesterday about the new technology of Internet telephony, \nusing the Internet as the means of making long distance telephone calls \nrather than the traditional line system that we use today. The effect \nof that is going to be that that Internet telephony will now escape \nboth Federal as well as State taxation for the period of this \nmoratorium.\n  I read a statement yesterday by a research group which estimated that \nby early in the next century potentially 10 percent or more of long \ndistance telephone calls would be made through Internet telephony.\n  A second reason for the 4 years might be to develop a political \ncoalition. There are going to be a lot of folks who are going to find \nit is awfully nice and convenient to not collect this tax. It is \nawfully nice to have your sales explode, as it was stated that \nAmazon.com's book sales are exploding. They surely ought to explode. \nThey have a 6- or 7-percent market advantage over that independent \nbookseller in Fayetteville, AR. They ought to beat the pants off the \nbookseller. And now we have the situation where the publishers, not \ngoing through any intermediary, are going to be selling directly on \nline. That is great for the American consumer. They are going to have \naccess to a lot of literature and other books at a very attractive \nprice, but the price that society is going to pay is imbalance in the \ncommercial marketplace and a degradation of our police, fire and \neducational services.\n  We, also, as a consequence of this, are going to frustrate local \nchoice. I said this morning that the morning newspaper was filled with \narticles which are relevant to this debate. This is one that might be \nof particular interest to our good friend from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers, in which there is, apparently in Arkansas today, an effort \nbeing made--and, by the polls, a pretty effective effort--to repeal the \nproperty tax in Arkansas and to substitute for the property tax a \nsignificant increase in the sales tax. It appears on page A-3 of the \nWashington Post of October 7 under the headline, ``Grass-roots Group \nTakes Aim At Arkansas Property Tax.''\n  I don't know whether this is a good idea or bad idea, for Arkansas to \nbe suggesting this. Apparently the Governor and a lot of other folks \nthink it is a bad idea. But I think we might agree, whether the idea is \ngood or bad, that it ought to be an Arkansas idea, as to how Arkansas \nwants to organize its State and local taxation. We are about to say in \nthis bill that we are going to make it more difficult for States to \nhave that range of choice. As we erode the base upon which the sales \ntax is applied, the opportunity for States to do what Arkansas is \nconsidering, substituting sales for property tax, is going to be much \nmore difficult because there will be less to substitute with.\n  So we are embarked along a path which is not just a temporary one but \nhas the potential of driving a permanent wedge between the Federal \nGovernment and States as we rather casually preempt their traditional \npolitical choices of how to organize their tax base.\n  But those consequences, I think, pale in terms of the final one to \nwhich I have already alluded. That is that this is the most important \neducation bill of 1998.\n  Mr. President, 1998 started with a lot of enthusiasm for education. \nThe President in his State of the Union talked about reducing class \nsize, particularly in the primary grades, so that children would not \nhave to go to excessively overcrowded classrooms. That was an issue \nthat struck home directly to me.\n  My third daughter, Suzanne Gibson, was a wonderful kindergarten \nteacher. The last year she taught kindergarten at a new elementary \nschool in Miami, Dade County, FL, there were 38 students in her class--\n38 students in a kindergarten class. My daughter is a wonderful \nteacher. She now is the mother of triplets, so she is getting to apply \nwhat she learned with those 38 students in her class, but I defy anyone \nto educate thirty-eight 5-year-olds. You may provide custodial services \nbut you do not educate thirty-eight 5-year-olds.\n  So we started this year in Washington with a hope and some \nexpectation that the Federal Government might reach out in a hand of \nfriendship and partnership to States and school districts and millions \nof young boys and girls, and help them with their educational needs. We \ndid not pass the bill that would have allocated an additional 100,000 \nteachers with Federal assistance in order to reduce class size at the \nprimary grades. Although we had a good experience with a similar action \nwith community police, where we are helping to finance 100,000 \ncommunity police in a very positive contribution to enhance law \nenforcement, we did not do that as it relates to primary education.\n  Then the President had another proposal for the Congress to assist in \nhelping school districts be able to build enough schools and maintain \nthe old schools so that we could have the classrooms that would be \nrequired to significantly reduce class size, particularly in the \nprimary grades. We did not pass that bill either.\n  So, now on the 7th of October, with some 2, 3, or 4 days left in this \nsession, we are coming to the most important education bill we are \ngoing to pass. What is it going to do? Is it going to help States and \nlocal school districts carry out their most important responsibility? \nNo. What it is going to do is to undercut their existing revenue and \nmake it even more difficult to even keep class sizes down to the 38-to-\n1 level in the kindergarten of Miami, Dade County, FL.\n  So, I believe there is absolutely no justification for making this \nmoratorium a day longer than is required to carry out what is a fairly \nstraightforward task. This certainly is no reason to argue it is going \nto take 4 years, but I look forward to the argumentation that maybe \nwill persuade me as to why 4 years are required for this task when God \ncreated Heaven and Earth in 7 days and we reformed the IRS in 15 \nmonths.\n  Mr. President, I want to vote for this bill because I believe that \nthere is a persuasive argument that a brief moratorium, with the time \nused by an intelligent group of people who represent all the interests \ninvolved, and against a charter which allows them to look at all the \nrelevant improvements, could play a useful purpose. But I could not \nsupport a 4-year moratorium, with all the pernicious effects it would \nhave, without any contribution to a greater understanding of the issues \ninvolved in Internet taxation.\n  So, I urge defeat of this amendment. I urge adoption of the position \ntaken, thoughtfully, by the Senate Finance Committee, which was for a \n2-year study. If that is the provision, I will support this \nlegislation. Otherwise, I fear for the consequences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \nremaining 10 minutes equally divided between the Senator from Florida \nand the Senator from Oregon, and that following that there be a vote on \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the McCain-Wyden amendment is, of course, a \ncompromise. The bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee was \na 6-year bill. The bill that came out of the Finance Committee was a 2-\nyear bill. So there was an effort to bring the parties together around \n4 years. But that is not what is really important. What is really \nimportant is the timetable that is going to be essential to do this job \nright.\n  Mr. President, 18 months after the date of enactment, the commission \nis going to make its recommendations--May of 2000. The moratorium under \nthe\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\nfinance bill ends in October of 2000. That means that there is less \nthan 6 months to act on the recommendation before the timeout would \nend. Some States, a number, have legislatures that are not meeting in \nthe year 2000. I am sure my friend and colleague, Senator Graham, would \nbe interested in knowing that Arkansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, \nNevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, North Dakota, and Vermont all \nhave legislatures that do not meet every year. So we are going to have \na situation, it seems to me, where there will be essentially no time in \norder for a legislature to thoughtfully look at these issues.\n  The Senator from Florida says that Chairman McCain and I are ramming \nthis bill through the U.S. Senate. We have worked on it, now, for 18 \nmonths. We have made more than 30 separate changes in an effort to try \nto address the concerns of the Senator from Florida. There has been \ndiscussion about how this would create a tax haven on the Internet. Let \nus be very clear about what happens during the moratorium. If a person \nwalks into a store and purchases a sweater in a jurisdiction where \nthere is a 5 percent sales tax, if they order that sweater over the \nInternet, they pay exactly the same tax, exactly the same fee--\ntechnological neutrality.\n  The Senator from Florida says that the apocalypse is at hand because \nthere is going to be a huge reduction in revenue at the State level. \nWhen we began this bill with legislation that was much more \nencompassing than the one we are considering now, the Congressional \nBudget Office could not even initially score it. It then came back with \na projection of less than $30 million.\n  Nothing is being preempted here. The States and localities are \nallowed to treat the Internet just as they would treat anything else.\n  At the end of the day, the kinds of people who will benefit from this \nare the senior citizens in Florida, for example, the home-based \nbusinesses in Oregon, people who are trying to use the Internet as a \nway to advance the chance to build a small business and particularly \nsee the Internet as a great equalizer.\n  They are not going to be in a position, those home-based businesses, \nto compete with the corporate giants. But if we create across this \ncountry a crazy quilt of State and local taxes where each jurisdiction \ngoes off and does its own thing, it is going to be very difficult for \nthose entrepreneurs, senior citizens, handicapped and disabled people \nto go out and hire the accountants and lawyers that would be necessary \nto carry out the vision of the Senator from Florida of the Internet. \nWhat we need to do is come up with some sensible policies, and it is \ngoing to take some time.\n  If somebody from Florida, for example, orders Harry and David's fruit \nin Medford, OR, using America Online in Virginia, pays for it with a \nbank card in California, and ships it to their cousin in New York, we \nare talking about a completely different kind of commerce than we have \nseen in the past. Let us take the time to do it right. Without the \namendment that the Senator from Arizona and I are offering--\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator has the floor and \nhas approximately 35 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Without the amendment that the Senator from Arizona and I are \noffering, all of those legislatures that I mentioned specifically, \nwhich we talked about initially more than an hour ago, are going to \nhave to act immediately in order to carry out the spirit of this \ncommission. I can't believe that is what the Senate wants, and I am \nvery hopeful that the Senators will join groups like the National \nRetail Federation, the Information Industry Association, the Home \nBusiness Association, and scores of other small business groups \nsupporting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes for \nthe purpose of a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 5 minutes \nallotted to him. Does he wish to have the additional 2 minutes \nallocated to the Senator from Oregon to be used for questions?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oregon has 2 \nminutes for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Oregon, in the \neffort to describe the equality of treatment, he used the example that \nif a person went into a local bookstore and bought a book, they would \npay and the bookstore seller would be responsible for collecting and \nremitting the appropriate State and local sales tax.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will yield for an answer, if that is \ncurrent policy in that State. I know that the Senator from Florida is \nvery anxious to resolve mail-order and catalog sales tax questions. The \nbill does not resolve that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The answer to that question is yes, the merchant would be \nresponsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax.\n  If the same sale were made on Amazon.com, would Amazon.com be \nresponsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Certainly that would be the case if it was done instate \nwhere you had a current policy with respect to sales tax. But if it \napplies to other States, if other States have a particular tax policy, \nif they do business involving the Internet, we apply exactly the same \nrule.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If a person in Florida has a sales and use tax, could it \nrequire Amazon.com to collect from a Florida resident, who ordered a \nbook in Seattle, the Florida sales tax?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am not up on Florida's policy, but we do not do anything \ndifferent with respect to the Internet than we do in any other area. \nThe hearing record in the Commerce Committee--I will be glad to share \nit because I cited many of those examples--and the Finance Committee \nmakes it very clear that the Internet gets no preference, the Internet \nsuffers no discrimination, and that is the point of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The answer is no, that the discrimination is the fact, \nthat currently the local Main Street merchant is required to collect \nthe tax, but the distant remote Internet seller is not, and we are \nabout to make that a 4-year institutionalized--\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 1 additional \nminute. I want to engage him in a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield another minute for the question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I say to my friend from Florida, what you described is \nyour desire--and I know it is sincere--to overturn the Quill decision. \nWhat we are saying in this bill is that we are trying to deal with a \ndifferent set of economic issues, and if we don't deal with these \nquestions of Internet policy now, I and the Senator from Arizona submit \nthat we will be dealing, just as we are now with the mail-order \nquestions, with these issues with respect to the Internet. Let us try \nto get out in front of these issues facing the digital economy rather \nthan duplicating the mistakes we made with respect to mail-order and \ncatalog sales.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In answer to the question, the Quill opinion gave to the \nCongress the responsibility to authorize the States to require the \ndistant seller to collect and remit the tax. Thus far, as Senator \nBumpers' long, valiant, but thus far unsuccessful attempts illustrate, \nCongress has been unwilling to do so. I suggest that indicates what is \nthe likely political result of this new issue of how we are going to \ntax the Internet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida has an additional 3 minutes 20 seconds if he wishes to use that \nat this time. Is the Senator prepared to yield back his time?\n  The Senator from Florida has 2 minutes remaining. Does he wish to \nyield back his time?\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have no extended remarks. I still don't \nthink we have heard the answer to the question of why does it take 4 \nyears to do this study. The fact is that when this report is available, \nwhatever time, the principal recipient of that report will not be the \nindividual 50 State legislatures, it is going to be us, because in \norder to implement the recommendations that would allow States to hold \nthe distant seller responsible for collection, we know it is going to \nrequire action by the U.S. Congress.\n  We are in session just about all the time. So whatever date we set \nfor this report to be submitted, we will likely be here, or close to \nbeing here, to receive it and to commence the process to deal with it.\n  I still have not heard any rationale as to why we should continue \nbeyond the minimal time necessary for the inequity of the Main Street \nmerchant and the vulnerability of State and local governments' capacity \nto finance their police, fire, and schools that an extended moratorium \nimplies.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida still has 1 minute 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remainder of time has been yielded back or \nused on both sides.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McCain \namendment No. 3783. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) and the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 15 \nminutes, with 10 minutes on this side, controlled by the Senator from \nAlaska, and 5 minutes controlled by the Senator from North Dakota, that \nno second-degree amendments be in order, and immediately following \nthat, there be a vote on the Murkowski tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question will first come on the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Murkowski will be \nseeking to table the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I repeat the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I didn't hear the request. Can I hear it \nagain?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is that there be 15 minutes on a Murkowski tabling \nmotion, with 10 minutes under the control of the Senator from Alaska, 5 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from North Dakota, with no \nintervening second-degree amendments, immediately followed by a vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I rise in opposition to the amendment \nbeing offered to grandfather existing taxes on Internet services.\n  This amendment undermines the fundamental integrity of the underlying \nbill because all state and local taxing jurisdictions would not be \nunder the exact same moratorium. It rewards those states and \nmunicipalities that raced to set up discriminatory taxes on Internet \nservices and places them in a better position to raise revenue than \nthose states that have chosen not to act.\n  More importantly, it sets the precedent that some states, but not all \nstates, can levy taxes that harm interstate commerce. This amendment \nmakes the Internet Tax Moratorium a piece-meal moratorium, not a real \nmoratorium.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider why we are considering this Internet \ntax moratorium. As all of us recognize, the Internet is a massive \nglobal network that spans not only every state in the Union, but \ninternational borders. As the Commerce committee found, Internet access \nservices are inherently a matter of interstate and foreign commerce \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. In fact, it has \nbeen estimated that if the Congress does not make a policy decision \nregarding taxation of Internet services, more than 30,000 separate \ntaxing jurisdictions within the United States could establish their own \ntaxes on Internet transactions.\n  Because of the chaos that would ensue, we have decided to place a \nhalt on Internet taxes and allow a commission to study this issue and \nmake recommendations to the Congress. Yet the amendment that the \nSenator from Oregon proposes would reward those jurisdictions that have \nalready decided to tax Internet services. Why should we grandfather \nthose jurisdictions?\n  If it is appropriate for states and localities to impose taxes on \nInternet services than all states should be permitted to adopt such \ntaxes. Alaska should be given that opportunity just as much as North \nDakota and South Dakota. But under the Internet Tax Moratorium \nlegislation, my state does not have that option but the Dakotas can \ncontinue their taxes because they adopted those taxes prior to this \nmoratorium.\n  And if it is not appropriate for states and localities to impose \ntaxes on Internet services, than not states nor localities should be \npermitted to adopt these taxes.\n  I believe this amendment is not only discriminatory but undermines \nthe fundamental idea underlying this bill. As I noted earlier, the \nInternet is inherently about Interstate Commerce and we in Congress are \nabout to make a decision that no local taxes should be imposed on \nInternet services until Congress receives the Commission's \nrecommendations. I believe we should make this moratorium uniform, not \npiece-meal as the Senator from Oregon proposes.\n  Otherwise, we are encouraging every state in the union to rush to the \nstate legislature every time a new technology comes along and adopt a \ntaxing scheme on the new technology, secure\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\nin the knowledge that should Congress decide to impose a moratorium on \nsuch a new tax, that state's taxes will be grandfathered.\n  Moreover, there is no rational basis to grandfather these state and \nlocal taxes on what everyone agrees is interstate commerce. We have \nasked a Commission of experts to make recommendations regarding \nInternet taxes. Although I cannot pre-judge what the Commission will \nrecommend, it is probable that the Commission will make three \nrecommendations. It will make a decision that state and local taxation \nof Internet services are appropriate or inappropriate. It may decide \nthat some taxes, such as taxes on ``pipeline'' services like Erols or \nvalue-added online services like America Online are appropriate but \nthat taxes on interstate product sales on the Internet are \ninappropriate.\n  What is certain is that the Commission will not recommend that the \nonly Internet taxes that are appropriate are those that are levied by \nthe states that are proposed to be grandfathered. That would make no \nsense and would probably be unconstitutional. For that reason alone, we \nshould not permit this grandfather.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important reasons I believe we should \nnot grandfather any of the Internet taxes is because a decision we make \non grandfathering will send a signal to our trading partners that if \nthey adopt taxes on Internet commerce today, those taxes will likely be \ngrandfathered if and when an international agreement on taxation of \nInternet commerce is reached in the future.\n  Why shouldn't Brazil or Germany or Canada establish taxes today on \nInternet commerce and then claim that since these taxes were adopted \nprior to an international agreement, they should be grandfathered just \nlike the United States grandfathered similar taxes?\n  Mr. President, there is ample precedent for such a scenario. Many of \nthe tariff and non-tariff barriers that the United States has \nconfronted in the past 50 years have covered practices that were \ninsulated by the original GATT grandfathering rules that were adopted \nmore than 50 years ago. In fact, there have been a number of instances \nwhere our foreign trading partners have used the GATT grandfather \nclause to defend measures that would otherwise violate our GATT rights. \nA number of those involved foreign tax regimes.\n  For example, the European Union relied on the GATT grandfather clause \nto defend their system of territorial taxation and income shifting \nrules that clearly constituted an illegal export subsidy. Similarly, \nBrazil used the grandfather clause to defend internal taxes of general \napplication (i.e., sales taxes) that discriminated against goods \nimported from other GATT members. And Canada relied on the grandfather \nclause to defend its interprovincial restrictions on the sale of beer \nand other malt beverages, which included discriminatory charges on \nimports of competing products from the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Internet as a means of communication and commerce \nis in its infancy. Commerce on the Internet is projected to grow by \nseveral thousand percent in the next five years. And who stands to \nbenefit the most from that growth? Companies based in the United States \nwill be the largest beneficiaries. I think there can be no doubt about \nthat.\n  We in the United States invented the Internet. We have been the first \ncountry to begin to exploit its benefits. We are leading the world in \nInternet commerce and the world is watching everything we do and trying \nto figure out how to prevent American domination of this new medium.\n  One way to slow American domination of the Internet is for foreign \ncountries to begin to establish taxing regimes on products and \ninformation generated from the United States. It is not hard to imagine \nour foreign trading partners developing taxing schemes designed to \nprotect their domestic manufacturers from competition from more \nefficient American competitors selling in their country via the \nInternet. Nor is it difficult to imagine that some of the more \nrepressive regimes in the world might want to come up with punitive \naccess taxes that functionally prevent their citizens from reading \nAmerican on-line newspapers and magazines. In the name of ``cultural \nsovereignty,'' I can imagine that some countries will adopt special \ntaxing regimes to restrict access to Internet web pages that are in \nEnglish.\n  Mr. President, the precedent we set by grandfathering Internet taxes \ncurrently in place will be closely watched by our trading partners. \nThey will follow our model because the United States has established \nall of the standards and protocols for the Internet.\n  We should send a message to our trading partners that we will not \ngrandfather any taxes on Internet commerce. Unless we do that, I fear \nthat when our negotiators sit down and attempt to negotiate away \ndiscriminatory foreign taxes on Internet services, our foreign trading \npartners will use the grandfather model in this bill as a reason their \ntaxing regime should be maintained in place. That is surely not the \nprecedent we want to set.\n  Finally, Mr. President, if we table this amendment we will ultimately \nnot be voting on whether the moratorium should be three years or four \nyears. The Senate has already spoken on this issue and if the \ngrandfathering amendment is tabled, the Chairman of the Committee will \ncertainly offer another amendment that we can accept that will extend \nthe moratorium for four years.\n  I move to table the amendment on grandfathering state Internet taxes.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment which would allow \nsome states to tax the Internet but not others. The moratorium on \nInternet taxation must be uniform, applying equally to all states and \nall local taxing jurisdictions without exception.\n  Congress is taking an extraordinary, though not unprecedented, step \nin preempting a taxing power of the states. The people of the United \nStates, through the Constitution, charge Congress with the \nresponsibility of ensuring that states do not interfere with interstate \ncommerce. This power is rarely exercised in the context of taxation, \nand is a power that we take very seriously.\n  Use of this extraordinary power is required to prevent the heavy \nhands of government from stifling the economic growth potential of \nInternet commerce. We have now just a glimpse of the future of \ncommerce, and a complete revolution in the way people transact business \nis within sight. We are on the threshold of exciting times, in which \ninformation about products will move quicker and farther than ever \nimagined, in which the elderly, the handicapped, and people living in \nremote rural areas can participate in world markets without ever \nleaving their homes. A moratorium is necessary to prevent the taxing \nauthorities of 50 states, over 6,000 localities, and the federal \ngovernment from taking near-sighted actions that jeopardize this future \nof commerce.\n  A threat to interstate commerce so severe as to require a national \nmoratorium cannot be tolerated in any state. If Congress were to \ngrandfather those states that have already imposed Internet taxes, we \nwould be setting a terrible precedent. This ``Early Bird Special'' \nexception gives states the incentive to rush to impose new taxes on new \ntechnologies. This is not the kind of race we want to encourage.\n  And if Congress can impose a moratorium on some states but not \nothers, will future Congresses attempt to disadvantage individual \nstates in this manner? The defenders of a grandfather clause cast their \nargument as one of states' rights. But establishing the principle that \na moratorium must apply equally to all states protect states from \nunwarranted infringements upon their power, by preventing the federal \ngovernment from isolating a minority of states for adverse treatment. \nAnd I should also point out that states do not have the right to \ninterfere with interstate commerce--the power to regulate interstate \ncommerce was delegated to the national government, not retained by the \nstates.\n  The United States should set a strong example and preempt all \nInternet taxes until a rational, national approach to Internet taxation \nis developed. If we fail to do so, we undermine attempts to persuade \nour trading partners that barriers to global electronic commerce should \nbe removed. We have the opportunity to lead the world in the area of \nInternet commerce, and we should make our cause the cause of freedom.\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the efforts by the \nSenator from Alaska. My understanding is that he is seeking to table \nthe underlying first-degree amendment, the McCain amendment. The McCain \namendment includes the grandfather provision which preserves the \nexisting Internet access taxes. In my judgment, this makes the \nmoratorium a forward-looking moratorium, and will not preempt existing \ntaxes.\n  It also deals with State and local taxing authorities by including a \nState and local tax savings provision, which makes it clear that no \nother State or local tax will be affected. In other words, it protects \nagainst the unintended consequences that may well occur unless we have \nthat savings clause.\n  I really think that it is important that we not support the motion \noffered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The third provision I want to mention in the first-degree amendment \nthat he is attempting to table is a provision ensuring that this \nmoratorium will not affect any pending or existing liabilities. \nCurrently there are companies that may have failed to pay some taxes \nthat would have a current liability under current valid existing laws, \nand we would not want this moratorium to have the unintended \nconsequence of interrupting those liabilities either.\n  As I understand it, we have a first-degree amendment, and now a \nmotion to table that. I hope that the motion to table will not prevail. \nI will vote against it. I will be, by that vote, supporting the \nunderlying first-degree McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  the PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

It would be my intention when all time is yielded to ask \nfor the yeas and nays. Excuse me, Mr. President. It would be my \nintention to move to table the pending amendment when all time is \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the convenience of Senators who have plans this \nevening and were told that we would have a vote, I would ask unanimous \nconsent that further proceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we obviously have a problem. The Senator \nfrom Florida is insisting on a point of order that will basically gut \nthis legislation. I want to go ahead and vote on the Murkowski \namendment. If the Senator from Florida wants to destroy this bill, \nwhich is supported by literally everyone except him, he is free to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All time has expired?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Point of personal privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am sorry, my good friend from Arizona \nhas on several previous occasions made statements that have become, I \nthink, excessively personal and not factually correct.\n  I am prepared to vote on this bill right now, and I will vote for the \nbill in its current form. What the issue is, is offering an amendment \nthat I question as to its germanity to this bill and that I might raise \na point of order on that germanity. I don't consider that to be an \ninappropriate or even a particularly hostile act. That is a matter of \nthe rules of the Senate. It either is or is not germane in this \npostcloture environment.\n  I do not accept the characterization that I am, in some malicious \nway, standing in the way of the bill. I am perfectly prepared to vote \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me say for my colleagues \nwhere we are on this bill.\n  We believe that we had an agreement that there would be this vote on \nthe Murkowski amendment to table, and then we would proceed to adopt a \npreviously agreed to amendment that had been agreed to by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota who has been managing the bill and others that have \nbeen involved in the legislation. Apparently, that was not agreed to by \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\nfrom Florida who intends to at least at this time challenge on the \nissue of germaneness the amendment that the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe Senator from Oregon, I, the Senator from Wyoming, and others had \nagreed to, which has to do with the definition of what are \ndiscriminatory taxes.\n  This, obviously, germane point of order would carry, or there is a \nlikelihood that it would. That would reduce the effectiveness or the \nimpact of this bill to the point where it would be nearly meaningless.\n  The Senator from Florida has told me that he will work overnight with \nus and with others to try to craft some agreement or relook at the \nentire issue. I hope that he will do so.\n  After the vote at 11 tomorrow on VA-HUD, I will then propose \namendment No. 3711. At that time, if the Senator from Florida still \nwishes to, obviously he can challenge the amendment on point of order \nconcerning whether the amendment is germane or not.\n  Mr. President, I think everybody realizes how important this \nlegislation is. I would very much hate to see it derailed at this point \nin time.\n  But the amendment, 3711, is vital to this legislation. Some may ask \nwhy we didn't propose it earlier. That is because it was part of a \npackage of negotiation that we were in with the Senator from North \nDakota, and others.\n  I respect the right of the Senator from Florida to object on \ngermaneness grounds. That is his right as a Senator. I do not challenge \nthat.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nOregon without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief, I say to the chairman and \ncolleagues. The hour is late.\n  All we seek to do is to have technological neutrality. We are not \ngoing to tax catalogs. We also don't want to tax web sites. That is all \nthis is about--preventing that kind of discriminatory tax.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these things happen as we consider \nlegislation. There are very strongly held views on this issue, \nespecially by the Senator from Florida who, as a former Governor, \nunderstands the impact of these issues on his State. I understand that \nand appreciate that. But I want to be clear that my interpretation and \nthat of the Senator from Oregon and the proponents of this legislation \nare that if we do not allow the amendment 3711, then the legislation \nitself would be rendered largely meaningless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11688-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11691-S11692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be \na period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Government Paperwork Elimination Act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 2107, the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act, a bill I introduced in April \nalong with Senators Wyden, McCain and Reed. This bill has been added as \nan amendment to the Internet Tax Freedom Act and I want to thank \nSenators McCain and Hollings and Senator Thompson, for taking the time \nand effort to work with me in advancing this legislation. Without their \nactive support and participation, this bill would not have progressed \nas far as it has.\n  This bill amends the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to allow for the \nuse of electronic submission of Federal forms to the Federal government \nwith the use of an electronic signature within five years from the date \nof enactment. It is intended to bring the federal government into the \nelectronic age, in the process saving American individuals and \ncompanies millions of dollars and hundreds of hours currently wasted on \ngovernment paperwork.\n  The bill also includes provisions to protect the private sector and \nensure a level playing field for companies competing in the development \nof electronic signature technologies. It mandates that regulations \npromulgated by the Office of Management and Budget and the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration be compatible with \nstandards and technologies used commercially. This will ensure that no \none industry or technology receives favorable consideration.\n  The bill also requires Federal agencies to accept multiple methods of \nelectronic submission if the agency expects to receive 50,000 or more \nelectronic submittals of a particular form. This requirement will \nensure that no single electronic signature technology is permitted to \nunfairly dominate the market.\n  This legislation also takes several steps to help the public feel \nmore secure in the use of electronic signatures. If people are going to \nsend money or share private information with the government, they must \nbe secure in the knowledge that their information and finances are \nadequately protected. For this reason, my bill requires that electronic \nsignatures be as reliable as necessary for any given transaction. If a \nperson is requesting information of a public nature, a secure \nelectronic signature will not be necessary. If, however, an individual \nis submitting forms which contain personal, medical or financial \ninformation, adequate security is imperative and will be available.\n  This is not the only provision providing for personal security, \nhowever. Senator Leahy joined me to help establish a threshold for \nprivacy protection in this bill. The language developed by Senator \nLeahy and I will ensure that information submitted by an individual can \nonly be used to facilitate the electronic transfer of information \nunless it has the prior consent of the individual.\n  Also included is a provision establishing legal standing for \nelectronically submitted documents. Such legal authority is necessary \nto attach the same importance to electronically signed documents as is \nattached to physically signed documents. Without this provision, \nelectronic submission of sensitive documents would be impossible.\n  Finally, Mr. President the Government Paperwork Elimination Act \nrequires that Federal agencies send individuals an electronic \nacknowledgement of their submission when it is received. Such \nacknowledgements are standard when conducting commerce online. A \nsimilar acknowledgement by Federal agencies will provide piece-of-mind \nfor individuals which conduct electronic business with the government.\n  As much as individuals will benefit from this legislation, so too \nwill American businesses. By providing companies with the option of \nelectronic filing and storage, this bill will reduce the paperwork \nburden imposed by government on commerce and the American economy. It \nwill allow businesses to move from printed forms they must fill out \nusing typewriters or handwriting to digitally-based forms that can be \nfilled out using a word processor. The savings in time, storage and \npostage will be enormous. One company, computer maker Hewlett-Packard, \nestimates that the section of this bill permitting companies to \ndownload copies of regulatory forms to be filed and stored digitally \nrather than physically will, by itself, save that company $1-2 billion \nper year.\n  Efficiency in the federal government itself will also be enhanced by \nthis legislation. By forcing Government bureaucracies to enter the \ndigital information age we will force them to streamline their \nprocedures and enhance their ability to maintain accurate, accessible \nrecords. This should result in significant cost savings for the federal \ngovernment as well as increased efficiency and enhanced customer \nservice.\n  Each and every year, Mr. President, Americans spend 6.6 billion hours \nsimply filling out, documenting and handling government paperwork. This \nhuge loss of time and money constitutes a significant drain on our \neconomy and we must bring it under control. The easier and more \nconvenient we make it for American businesses to comply with paperwork \nand reporting requirements, the better job they will do of meeting \nthese requirements, and the better job they will do of creating jobs \nand wealth for our country. That is why we need this legislation.\n  The information age is no longer new, Mr. President. We are in the \nmidst of a revolution in the way people do business and maintain \nrecords. This legislation will force Washington to catch up with these \ndevelopments, and\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\nrelease our businesses from the drag of an obsolete bureaucracy as they \npursue further innovations. The result will be a nation and a people \nthat is more prosperous, more free and more able to spend time on more \nrewarding pursuits.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for their support and \nurge the House to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11691-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMERCIAL SPACE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy regarding a provision of the Commercial Space Act of 1998. It \nis my understanding that Section 202(b)(6) of the Land Remote Sensing \nPolicy Act of 1992, which requires any company receiving a license to \noperate a remote sensing system to ``notify the Secretary [of Commerce] \nof any agreement the licensee intends to enter with a foreign nation,'' \nis amended by the Commercial Space Act of 1998 by inserting the words \n``significant or substantial'' after ``Secretary of any.'' This is \nintended to limit the agreements which are reported to the Department \nof Commerce. As you know, the Congress has acted in the past to limit \nimagery of Israel. I would like to clarify that any agreement or \ncontract permitting any imaging of Israel using commercially available, \nsatellite-based remote sensing technology would fall under the \ndefinition of ``significant or substantial.'' Is this the Chairman's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. It is certainly my intention that \nany agreement permitting the imaging of Israel using commercially \navailable, satellite-based remote sensing technology will continue to \nbe reported to the United States government for review. The Congress \nhas indicated that it viewed imaging of Israel to be a significant \nmatter, and the intent of this legislation is to make sure that any \nagreement that could lead to imaging Israel will be reported.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President. Today I address an issue of extreme \nimportance to both citizens of the United States, and people around the \nglobe.\n  It is not often that we have the opportunity to help those in other \ncountries and Americans at the same time. I believe that one of these \noccasions presents itself now.\n  In every area of the world, there are men, women and children in \ndesperate need of food. Some of them are refugees from wars and other \nforms of political violence. Some of them are displaced because \ndroughts or floods have interfered with their ability to grow food and \ndestroyed their homes. Others are simply too poor to be able to afford \nthe tools and seeds necessary to plant crops.\n  This year has been particularly difficult in a variety of places. \nMost recently, hurricane Georges has ravaged the Caribbean. Nations \nsuch as Haiti, where the population is barely able to feed itself, and \nthe Dominican Republic have been heavily damaged by the storm's \nonslaught.\n  Countries in Eastern Europe are experiencing food shortages. Winter \nis coming to Kosovo, where the Serbian Special Police and Yugoslavian \narmy continue a terrorist policy that has destroyed more that three \nhundred villages, and driven more than 300,000 ethnic Albanians from \ntheir homes, with an estimated 50,000 forced into forests and \nmountains. With good reason, these people are afraid to return to the \nvillages which have been destroyed and vandalized by the Serbian army. \nThey have left the only means they have of supporting themselves \nbehind. As a result, if we in the international community do not help \nthem, they will not be able to feed themselves.\n  Russia faces a sharp decrease in agricultural production, due to \ndrought and other poor weather conditions. Approximately twenty-five \npercent of farmland was damaged. Consequently, this year's harvest will \nbe Russia's worst in four decades. Collective farms have harvested only \na little over half the amount of grain in this year's harvest as they \ndid in 1997. The potato crop, one of Russia's staples, is down \nsignificantly due to potato blight.\n  The Asian economic crisis is having a significant impact on the \nability of those states to feed themselves. Indonesia, with its current \nfinancial turmoil is in need of food. Asian countries which normally \nimport American commodities are unable to do so this year, exacerbating \nour farmers' woes.\n  The situation in North Korea remains grave. Floods, droughts and \nother natural disasters in the past four years have left many without \nthe ability to feed themselves. Malnutrition and related diseases are \ncommon throughout the land. One million people have died in North Korea \nover the past two years.\n  Due to climactic conditions and political unrest, there are many in \nneed in Africa. In Sudan alone, experts have indicated that as many as \n2.6 million people may go hungry. Mozambique is facing a food crisis \nwhich will affect 300,000 people until April of next year. In the \nnorthern portions of Sierra Leone, thousands of internally displaced \npeople will face hunger, if not starvation, unless they are provided \nwith aid.\n  Here in the United States we face a challenge of a different sort. \nFar from suffering from a lack of food, American farmers are producing \nan abundance. Unfortunately, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to \ndecline 4.6 percent from projected 1998 levels, mainly because of the \ncollapse of global markets.\n  One third of the family farmers in this country may go out of \nbusiness in the next several years, with net farm income projected to \ndecrease by $7.5 billion in 1998. We have the food. All we are lacking \nis strong markets to buy what we are producing.\n  Common sense tells us that it is time to bring together our \noversupply of domestic agricultural products and the growing \ninternational need for food aid. One way to do that is to increase \nshipments of U.S. agricultural products to countries in need.\n  In July of this year, the President took steps to do just that, \ncreating the Food Aid Initiative. This initiative directs the \nDepartment of Agriculture to purchase 80 million bushels of grain for \ndistribution to poor countries overseas. The Secretary of Agriculture \nannounced the first disbursement of wheat and wheat flour under the \nInitiative to the World Food Program on September 15th. I applaud the \nAdministration's creation of this Initiative. The potential of this \nprogram in combination with other U.S. food assistance programs to \nprovide relief to hungry people is great, and I support the President's \nefforts.\n  However, we can and should do more. To begin with, the list of \ncountries that the administration has targeted through the Initiative \nshould be expanded. Last week I wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Brian Atwood, the \nAdministrator of the Agency of International Development. In those \nletters, I indicated among other things, that threatened food shortages \nin Kosovo and Russia must not go unaddressed.\n  Not only must we be sure that more countries are being given much \nneeded food, we must be assured that those who are hungry are actually \nreceiving the food. Unfortunately, in some instances, access to food \ndonations is prevented by people in needy nations who either want the \nfood themselves, wish to profit from victims of famine or wish to \ncontrol the needy population by denying them life's most basic \nnecessities.\n  In addition to donating to more countries, we should donate more \nfood. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, in the \nUnited States today there is a surplus of 6.3 million metric tons or \n233 million bushels of wheat. There are several programs through which \nwe can help solve both our domestic and our international problems.\n  The first is the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of \n1954, commonly referred to as P.L. 480, Food for Peace. This \nlegislation contains three food aid titles. Title One's objective is to \nmake it easier for lesser developed countries to buy American \ncommodities. To this end, commodities are sold to certain countries for \nUS dollars on concessional credit terms.\n  Title Two is the Emergency and Private Assistance Programs. This is\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\nwhere the bulk of our humanitarian donations in the form of food aid \ncome from. This year Title Two was funded at the level that the \npresident requested. Unfortunately, given the number of humanitarian \ndisasters that we are currently facing, this may not be enough. It is \nmy hope that the President will ask for more money for this program.\n  Title Three is the Food for Development Program, under which \ngovernment to government grants are provided to support the long-term \ndevelopment efforts of those countries that are attempting improve \ntheir economic outlooks.\n  The second program through which we can help address the domestic and \noverseas challenges we are facing is Section 416(b) of the Agricultural \nAct of 1949. Through Section 416(b), commodities held by the \nCommodities Credit Corporation can be donated overseas. This is the \nprogram through which the President ordered the purchase of $250 \nmillion of wheat in July.\n  The Food for Progress Act of 1985 is the third program the United \nStates can utilize to address both the American farm crises and dire \ninternational need. Food for Progress provides commodities either \npurchased with funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, or through \nP.L. 480 or Section 416(b), as donations to countries that are \ncommitting to the increase of free enterprise practices in their \nagricultural sectors.\n  I strongly support an aggressive funding of these programs, and have \nurged the administration to be aggressive in its requests to the \nCongress as it evaluates the increasing needs overseas and the \nopportunity to assist our farmers here at home. If we diligently pursue \nall of our options through current law, I believe that we can help \nalleviate two very significant and pressing problems. The overabundance \nof agricultural commodities plaguing American farmers, and the lack of \nfood for starving millions abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress consider the full range of resources \nand programs at our disposal to help end the dilemma facing the farmers \nof our nation. Implementing a solution to this problem will require \nthat we use all of the creativity and energy that we have. Every day \nbrings us closer to real crises not only in our farm economy, but also \nin countries important to our national interest.\n  Such aid is not only clearly in our interest. It would reflect our \nhighest values by preventing the widespread hunger and suffering of \nmen, women and children who had no hand in the tragedies that have \nbefallen their countries.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to give this issue prompt and serious \nattention. I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11692-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11693-S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EDWARD PFEIFER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently a publication from St. Michael's \nCollege in Winooski Park, Colchester, VT, profiled Professor Edward \nPfeifer. Dr. Pfeifer is referred to as ``Historian Ed Pfeifer, '43.'' I \nhave always thought of Ed Pfeifer as the special mentor I had in \ncollege and the man who did so much to shape my thinking and my life \nafter college.\n  He was the kind of professor who not only helped you learn, but \ntaught you to want to learn. He would find students he could mentor and \nintroduce them to the joys of learning. Fortunately, I was one of those \nstudents and I have benefited from his help every day since.\n  Ed and his wife, Joan, are now retired in Vermont. One of the great \npleasures Marcelle and I have is when we end up in the same place with \nthem, ranging from events at St. Michael's, to meeting in the grocery \nstore near our own home in Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from St. \nMichael's Founders Hall, September 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From St. Michael's Founders Hall, Sept., 1998]\n\n                        Historian Ed Pfeifer '43\n\n                            (By Buff Lindau)\n\n       Nine-year old Eileen Gadue had to write an essay explaining \n     why she needed a new trunk to take her sneakers, swim suit, \n     tennis racket, and other belongings to summer camp. She \n     didn't know it, but she had Ed Pfeifer to thank.\n       Eileen's parents, Mark and Marjorie Gadue '79, of \n     Colchester, Vt., were both students of SMC Emeritus Professor \n     of History Edward Pfeifer '43 in the 1970's. They have shaped \n     their lives and their children's lives on Pfeifer's patient \n     insistence on developing ideas, supporting those ideas, \n     researching to back them, and working carefully with language \n     to clarify and defend the ideas.\n       After the fifth draft of her essay and repeated discussions \n     with Dad, Eileen got the new trunk.\n       ``He taught us life skills and we teach our kids as we \n     learned from him,'' said Marjorie. ``He was someone who made \n     a real difference.'' All his students say that Dr. Pfeifer \n     taught reading, thinking, debating, clear defending of ideas, \n     and taught with a hard to define skill that included quiet \n     patience, kindness, and intellectual rigor.\n       Mark Gadue graduated as a history major from Saint \n     Michael's in 1979 and almost headed to get his Ph.D., but \n     entered the family dry cleaning business instead.\n       Pfeifer students Gary Kulik '67, Joseph Constance '76, \n     Francis MacDonnell '81, Gayle Brunelle '81, and Jonathan Bean \n     '84 were inspired to aim for the professorial ranks as a \n     result of their experience in Pfeifer's classroom. ``I took a \n     number of years off after college, but he influenced me to go \n     back to graduate school and I am ultimately following in his \n     footsteps,'' said Bean, who was unanimously voted in May to \n     receive early tenure as a history professor at Southern \n     Illinois University. Bean, who took at least 10 courses with \n     Pfeifer, models his teaching on Pfeifer's style of \n     methodically eliciting student response. Bean is the author \n     of Beyond the Broker State: Federal Policies Toward Small \n     Business, 1936-1961.\n       Pfeifer says it was his goal to get a response from \n     students about the historical material they were studying, \n     ``something that was their own comment that reflected their \n     own evaluation.'' But the magic of Pfeifer as a teacher \n     resides in the method and manner he brought to the classroom \n     to get the students engaged, to elicit their response.\n       To Fran MacDonnell, a teacher who earned his master's in \n     history at Marquette and his Ph.D. at Harvard, ``Dr. Pfeifer \n     is in the handful of teachers that you admire and like to \n     imitate and that you owe a lot to. ``He had three, one-year \n     appointments teaching history at Yale University, and now he \n     and his wife live in Lexington, Va., where she teaches and he \n     finishes his second book--a study of white southerners who \n     fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. (His first \n     book is titled Insidious Foes: The Axis Fifth Column and the \n     American Home Front.) ``I can think of no greater legacy than \n     the one Ed Pfeifer gave his students--I mean Professor \n     Pfeifer taught my dad'' (Dr. Kenneth MacDonnell '57 a Boston \n     physician), MacDonnell said. He gave his students the drive \n     to think independently, and confidence in expressing their \n     thoughts.\n       Pfeifer was a master Socratic teacher, which meant using \n     the Q & A method to guide the student, leaving room for \n     different opinions and approaches and calling for \n     conclusions from the student. ``That is the hardest kind \n     of teaching, yet the one with the most rewards for the \n     student,'' MacDonnell said, who aspires to Pfeifer's \n     method.\n       Joe Constance concurs, ``Dr. Pfeifer was probably the \n     finest practitioner of the Socratic method that you'll ever \n     find as a teacher--getting the student to arrive at the \n     answer,'' and encouraging you as you progressed. Constance \n     says Pfeifer also inspired him to pursue the intellectual \n     life; he earned a master's in history at UVM and a library \n     degree at SUNY Albany. Constance is now library director and \n     political science professor at St. Anselm College, and is \n     pursuing his Ph.D. in political science at Boston University.\n       ``I asked Dr. Pfeifer a question in class one morning about \n     a trade agreement between Peru and Bolivia and he didn't know \n     the answer,'' Constance related. ``That afternoon I found a \n     note in my mailbox from him with the answer to the question--\n     I've never been so impressed with a teacher before or \n     after.''\n       Pfeifer's students all describe him as extremely kind and \n     concerned about them as individuals. They suggest that his \n     influence creeps up on you quietly and takes strong hold, \n     rather than hammering you. He was a model teacher and \n     scholar, one student said; fairness, balance, objectivity \n     characterized him. But there was humor--droll, quiet, dry--\n     but a key element in his make-up that emerged unexpectedly.\n       In 1986 Edward Pfeifer retired with his wife Joan Sheehey \n     Pfeifer to Cabot, Vt. He says he now has time to keep up with \n     his four children, chase after his grandchildren and mow lots \n     of grass. Because his teaching touched many who have gone on \n     to become teachers, Dr. Pfeifer's legacy multiplies beyond \n     his own classroom into the lives of students in university \n     classrooms from New Hampshire to Illinois to California. Ed's \n     son and daughter are graduates: John '85 and Justine '84 who \n     is married to Frank Landry '82. His brother, Charles '43 is \n     deceased.\n\n\n                         edward pfeifer profile\n\n       Pfeifer graduated from Saint Michael's in 1943 with a \n     degree in English, and served in WWII in the U.S. Navy, 1943-\n     46. He earned a master's in American civilization from Brown \n     University in 1948 and then joined the SMC English \n     department.

He rejoined the SMC history \n     department in 1956, and created the interdisciplinary \n     American studies major.\n       Pfeifer was vice president for academic affairs and dean of \n     the College from 1969 to 1974, and was awarded the first SMC \n     faculty appreciation award ever given, in 1966. He received \n     the award again in 1967 and 1982. Pfeifer retired in 1986 and \n     the SMC yearbook was dedicated in his name, yearbook editor, \n     Linda Robitaille '86 said, ``He was kind to his students, he \n     awed us, he was remarkably concerned with helping us learn.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11693-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROBERT LANCTOT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my very good friend, Robert Lanctot, died \nafter a courageous bout with cancer. Bob, and his wife Betty, were two \nvery special friends of my wife and I.\n  When I first ran for the Senate in 1974, Bob helped me in an area of \nthe state where no Democrat could ever expect to get votes. Everybody \ntold him I couldn't win, but he persevered and not only did I win, but \nwent on in subsequent elections to carry the area significantly. I have \nalways felt that a large part of that was do to Bob Lanctot.\n  Notwithstanding our close friendship, Bob never requested anything \nfor himself or his family from me. He did, however, continuously speak \nout for those people who did not have a strong voice in Washington. He \ntruly believed in helping working families and those who have always \nmade our state and our country strong. We have lost a special \nVermonter, and I ask unanimous consent that the obituary from the \nCaledonia' Record be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Caledonian-Record, Sept. 21, 1998]\n\n       Lanctot: Robert ``Bob'' L.

He \n     married Betty L. Farnham; together they raised six children. \n     Betty predeceased him, Sept. 12, 1996, and the oldest son \n     Robert predeceased his mother in January of 1996.\n       Bob was a great believer in the rights of the common \n     worker. He was president of the Northeast Kingdom Labor \n     Council for a number of years, served as vice president of \n     the state labor council, and was a very active member of \n     local 5518. He was the delegate to the state labor convention \n     for the last 25 years and was recognized by the Vermont State \n     labor council AFL-CIO for his significant contributions to \n     that organization, the labor movement and Vermont working \n     families. Bob was a working Vermonter, retiring from Vermont \n     America in 1982.\n       Bob was a strong Democrat. He was an active and valuable \n     member of the Caledonia County Democratic committee. He held \n     many positions over the years with the Vermont State \n     Democratic Party, including the platform committee, and most \n     recently served on the state executive board.\n       He was a veteran of World War II and a member of Sheridan \n     Council 421 Knights of Columbus.

During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign \noil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now \n7,925,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $110,870,750 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11694-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the Department of Justice confirms that in \nthe United States there was a rape for every 270 women, a robbery for \nevery 240 women and an assault for every 29 women in 1994. (In the \nthree year period from 1992-94, the number of violent crimes committed \nagainst our wives, sisters, mothers, and daughters totaled nearly 14 \nmillion.)\n  In response to statistics like these, the women of the National Rifle \nAssociation created the ``Refuse to be a Victim'' program five years \nago. The basic premise of the program can be summed up by an old \nsaying--an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The course \nteaches women not to live in fear of threats, but rather, to respect \nlikely threats and prepare to avoid or effectively respond to them.\n  The centerpiece of the ``Refuse to be a Victim'' program is a three-\nhour public service safety seminar designed by, taught by, and \npresented to women in order to help them protect themselves. Since its \ninception, this common sense safety and self-defense program has been \npresented in 35 states and the District of Columbia. More than 600 \ninstructors, including 9 in North Carolina, have trained and empowered \nthousands of women to protect themselves and their families.\n  Mr. President, the course equips women with the tools they need to \ndesign their own personal safety strategy. By increasing awareness of \ndangerous situations and providing knowledge of self-protection \ntechniques and crime-fighting and personal safety resources, the \nprogram maximizes its participants ability to successfully avoid or, in \nthe worst case, survive an attack.\n  The program features practical but frequently overlooked advice on \nhome security such as the installation of effective lock and security \nsystems, planting ``defensive'' shrubbery around windows, and keeping a \ncellular phone by the bedside in case an intruder disables your home \nphone. It also provides information on how to avoid being a victim of a \ncar-jacker as well as the proper and safe use of personal safety\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\ndevices such as alarms, sprays, stun guns and firearms.\n  For those unable to attend a seminar personally, the program has \ndistributed more than 200,000 of the informative ``42 Strategies for \nPersonal Safety'' brochures nationwide.\n  Mr. President, the women of the NRA are to be commended for the \ndevelopment of this important program. The contributions of the \n``Refuse to be a Victim'' program are indeed impressive. This program \nis a fine example of the type of pro-active safety and security \ntraining that the National Rifle Association has long provided to our \ncitizens. I hope that women in every part of our great nation will \nconsider participating in this outstanding program and, in so doing, \njoin the more than ten thousand women who have already benefited from \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11694-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11695-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., the message from the House of Representatives, \ndelivered by Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the \nHouse disagrees to the amendment to the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4276) \nmaking appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \nState, the Judiciary, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1999, and for other purposes, and agrees to the \nconference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses thereon; and appoints Mr. Rogers, Mr. Kolbe, Mr. Taylor of North \nCarolina, Mr. Regula, Mr. Latham, Mr. Livingston, Mr. Young of Florida, \nMr. Mollohan, Mr. Skaggs, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Obey as the managers of \nthe conference on the part of the House.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 4:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate\n\n       H.R. 1794.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to restore \nmilitary retirement benefits that were reduced by the Military \nRetirement Reform Act of 1986; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n         MILITARY RETIREMENT READINESS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I called the Senate's \nattention to several issues in the military that are contributing to \nproblems in recruiting and retention of key, midcareer military \npersonnel. Briefly, those issues were as follows:\n  We are asking the military, significantly smaller than it was during \nthe cold war, to operate and deploy much more frequently.\n  We are asking the military to deploy on missions that may not be in \nthe vital national interest of this Nation.\n  We are not paying servicemen and women a salary that is comparable to \nthe pay they could get outside the military for the same skills.\n  We are not providing quality health care for the families of the \nmilitary, and we have not provided the promised health care for the \nretired members of the military.\n  We are not providing quality housing to all military families.\n  And we are not providing a retirement program that is adequate to \njustify a career commitment to the arduous lifestyle and the difficult \nfamily separations that are necessary in military life.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to address military \nretirement. The bill that I am introducing repeals the Military Reform \nRetirement Act of 1986, also known as REDUX. This experiment in the \nmilitary retirement system was introduced in 1986 with the intended \npurpose--and it was a good one--of encouraging members of the military \nto stay longer than the popular career of 20 years.\n  The service chiefs now say that retirement is one of the top reasons \nthat our men and women are leaving the service. The Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, listed it among the most \npressing problems facing the military in retaining key people. The \nSecretary of Defense has voiced very similar concerns.\n  Pay is being addressed slowly, including a 3.6 percent pay raise in \nthis defense appropriations bill.\n  The Department of Defense is working on housing issues that may solve \nthe problems. Problems with the health care programs are very complex \nand multilayered and requires detailed study to solve. The issue of the \nhigh rate of deployments and the quality of\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nmissions rests at the feet of the administration and this Congress and \nare now the subject of policy debate.\n  Congress must address, however, the issue of retirement. We must show \nthe men and women of our armed services that we are listening to their \nconcerns and that we deeply care about them, their families and the \ncommitment they make to the defense of this Nation.\n  While the purpose of this bill is to repeal the 1986 retirement \nprogram, I want to emphasize it is not the final solution to the \nmilitary's retirement problem. I urge the Department of Defense to \nstart a comprehensive study--I think they are--and to examine all \ncreative options to solve the recruitment and retention problems that \nnow face the military.\n  The repeal of REDUX is only but one option. There may be others. I \nknow that private industry has many creative retirement programs that \nmay serve as part of a final solution. The civilian sector of the \nFederal Government has long experience in retirement programs. Whatever \ncourse we end up taking, the bottom line must be a retirement program \nthat is perceived as fair and adequate by our service men and women.\n  The fundamental job of the Federal Government is to provide for the \nsecurity of the Nation. That security begins and ends with people. It \nis clear that they are sending a strong message that we are letting \nthem down. We are not providing adequately for their welfare and their \npostmilitary life.\n  So providing better benefits for members of the military will pay \ndividends for national security. And, Mr. President, it is the right \nthing to do. We owe it to our military men and women who are making the \npersonal and family sacrifices to do such an important job. They do an \noutstanding job under the most difficult of circumstances. It is not \ntoo much to ask that we provide adequate support for them and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on October 1, 1999, and shall apply with respect to \n     retired or retainer pay accruing for months beginning on or \n     after that date.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to support and cosponsor the \nlegislation that Senator Roberts introduced earlier today that \nreinstates the 50 percent retirement ``earned benefit'' plan for men \nand women in the military who retire with 20 years of military service. \nI also implore the Senate leadership to act quickly on this legislation \nand move for its swift passage before the 105th Congress adjourns for \nthe year.\n  Times have changed since 1986. Our economy has prospered, producing \nhistorically high levels of employment and resulting in the emergence \nof a very difficult recruiting and retention environment for the armed \nservices. Maintaining a top-quality force requires a military personnel \nsystem that has the flexibility to react quickly to the dynamics of the \ncivilian market, and the leadership and confidence to follow through \nwith critical personnel decisions rather than neglecting them out of \nfiscal opportunism. Regrettably, this year, first, second, and third-\nterm enlisted retention, pilot and mid-grade officer retention, and \nrecruiting are all short of the goal for each of the services.\n  Recruiting and retaining quality individuals requires pay scales that \nadjust to meet prevailing rates rather than fall 14 percent behind \ncomparable civilian pay. It requires adequate funding for recruiting. \nIt requires proper promotion rates--not promotion boards that take five \nmonths to process reports of promotion boards, as is the case with the \nNavy. It requires proper living conditions and morale, welfare and \nrecreation services. It also requires reasonable tours of duty, a \nhigher quality of civilian leadership, and ``role models'' within the \nleadership who are seen to take service members' quality-of-life \nconcerns to heart.\n  Reinstatement of the 50 percent retirement plan for career military \nmen and women would serve as an important signal of resolve to our \nservice members that the United States Congress is aware of the \nshortfall in benefits for those who wear the uniform of their country \nand is acting to improve those benefits. Last week, the Senate Armed \nServices Committee heard directly from the Joint Chiefs that restoring \nretirement benefits is a requirement for recruiting and retaining the \nqualified individuals we rely on to defend this nation.\n  General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated \nclearly that fixing the military retirement system is a top \nrecommendation for restoring the readiness of our armed forces. Army \nChief of Staff General Reimer has written to me that\n\n       . . .the retirement package we have offered our soldiers \n     entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 \n     percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's \n     reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one \n     retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We \n     need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten \n     them.\n\n  The military medical health care system, particularly the TRICARE \nprogram, has been described by Service\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\nChiefs as falling far short of what is warranted and needed. We cannot \nignore the erosion of retirement and health care benefits, and the \nresultant impact on retention and readiness. General Reimer writes,\n\n       ``The loss in medical benefits when a retiree turns 65 is \n     particularly bothersome to our soldiers who are making career \n     decisions.''\n\n  From the Service Chiefs' answers, it is highly questionable whether \nwe are meeting any of these requirements. On the contrary, it is clear \nthat there is much work to be done.\n  Finally, it is demoralizing to the men and women we send into harm's \nway, and is incomprehensible to the American people, who expect a well-\ntrained and well-equipped force, to witness as many as 25,000 military \npersonnel and their families on food stamps. One tax provision that I \nhave tried to reverse this year excludes uniformed men and women in the \nmilitary from beneficial tax treatment on the profits resulting from \nthe sale of their homes. We order servicemembers to move from place to \nplace, but we do not afford them the same tax treatment as other U.S. \ncitizens. Should this issue have been permitted to exist for so many \nyears?\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to neglect this array of personnel \nconcerns. Let us begin by acting immediately to restore the higher \nearned benefit plan for retired service members. Senator Roberts has \noffered critical legislation to help reverse the diminishing retention \nrates that cripple our Armed Services and ultimately diminish their \nability to execute our National Military Strategy. On behalf of all men \nand women who have honorably dedicated their careers to serving this \ncountry in uniform, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2566. A bill to provide Coastal Impact Assistance to State and \nlocal governments, to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act \nAmendments of 1978, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, \nthe Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act, and the Federal Aid in \nWildlife Restoration Act (commonly referred to as the Pittman-Robertson \nAct) to establish a fund to meet the outdoor conservation and \nrecreation needs of the American people, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         reinvestment and environmental restoration act of 1998\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague from \nLouisiana Senator Breaux, a cosponsor on this measure, as well as \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Lott, Senator D'Amato, Senator Cleland, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Cochran, Senator Sessions and Senator Mikulski \nas cosponsors of this measure, and also thank the many leaders on the \nHouse side that are today introducing this bill on the House side.\n  Surely, with the time so short, we will not be considering this bill \nin this session, but we plan for a very lively debate as the 106th \nCongress meets in January on this very important piece of environmental \nlegislation for our country.\n  I will take a few minutes to outline in a highlighted form what this \nbill will attempt to do, something that we have worked on, a group of \nus, earnestly and very excitedly for the last year. Then my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Breaux, will say a few words about the bill.\n  This is the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act of 1998. \nIt is going to attempt to take 50 percent of the moneys that are now \nflowing into the Federal Treasury from offshore oil and gas revenues--\nwhich have been very significant; $120 billion since 1955--and \nredistribute those revenues in a smarter way, in a better way, and in a \nway that our country can be proud of.\n  We are going to ask that 27 percent of those revenues be distributed \nto coastal States for coastal conservation impact assistance, 16 \npercent to fund more fully the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and 7 \npercent to fund the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Act. These \nare the major titles of this bill. Let me very briefly hit on each one.\n  I am from Louisiana, a State that has supported, proudly supported, \noil and gas drilling and exploration. It has created many jobs in our \nState. We try to do it in a more environmentally sensitive way each and \nevery year, and every decade we make tremendous progress. Other States \nlike Texas, Mississippi, and to a certain degree, Alabama, although not \nas much, and Alaska, join in that effort.\n  There are many States that do not have drilling and many States that \nhave a moratorium on drilling. This bill is not a pro-drilling bill or \nanti-drilling bill. The purpose is to say that the production of those \nresources off the shores of our States, although they are offshore, \nhave tremendous impact--both positive and negative--on the States that \nhost drilling.\n  Louisiana has contributed since the 1950s over 90 percent of these \nrevenues that I spoke about, the $120 billion, and we have gotten less \nthan 1 percent back. It is time to correct that inequity. That is what \nthe first title of this bill does. It says to Louisiana, thank you for \nyour commitment to our energy security and for the way that you have \ncontributed to this oil and gas drilling. We believe that some of this \nmoney should go back to help your State and the coastal areas to shore \nup our wetlands and to reinvest in our environment. That is Title I of \nthis bill. It will distribute funds to all coastal States, whether they \nhave drilling or not.\n  As I said, there are no incentives; there are no disincentives. It is \na revenue-sharing bill to all the coastal States. These revenues are \ncollected from a nonrenewable resource. One day these oil and gas wells \nwill be dried up. It might be 10 years from now or 20 years from now, \nbut some day they will be dried up, and we want to make sure that a \nportion of this money is reinvested back into our States for \nenvironmental infrastructure and wetland conservation so that we have \nsomething to show for it.\n  The second part of this bill amends the Land and Water Conservation \nAct in an attempt to restore this fund, or to more fully fund it. I \nwill ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excerpt \nfrom an editorial from the New York Times on this subject.\n  I will read the first short paragraph of this editorial.\n\n       More than 30 years ago, Congress passed a quiet little \n     environmental program that offered great promise to future \n     generations of Americans. Conceived under Dwight Eisenhower, \n     proposed by John F. Kennedy and signed into law by Lyndon \n     Johnson, the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund was \n     designed to provide a steady revenue stream to preserve \n     ``irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and unique \n     recreational value.'' Royalties from offshore oil and gas \n     leases would provide the money, giving the program an \n     interesting symmetry. Dollars raised from depleting one \n     natural resource would be used to protect another.\n\n  The problem is, this promise was never fulfilled. That is what the \nsecond title of this bill will do. It seeks to make this promise real \nfor our families, for our children, and for the next generation. It \nwill take, as I said, 16 percent of these revenues to almost fully fund \nthe State side and the Federal side of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. It will provide a reliable and steady stream of revenue to do \njust that.\n  Let me share with you that on the Federal side in only 6 out of the \nlast 33 years have we really lived up to the promise that we made to \nthe land and water conservation side. On the State side, the funding \nrecord has been even more dismal. Only 1 year out of 33 years since \nthis Land and Water Conservation Fund was enacted did we live up to \nthat promise. So title II happens to fully restore funding so that we \ncan plan and count on these moneys to help expand our parks and our \nrecreation for our children and families in rural and urban areas \naround this great country.\n  Finally, title III is a new title, a new chapter, but an attempt to \nsort of weave together some of the attempts by my colleague, Senator \nBreaux, and others to improve the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration \nAct. I believe it makes little sense to spend all of our money in this \narea on the back end, after species have become endangered. Then we \nhave problems not only\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\nwith the species in question but with property rights. We have \nquestions with economies that can be very negatively affected when \nindustries have to move out or can't proceed because of this.\n  So we believe it is time to start investing some money on the front \nend. That is what this title does--helping species, helping States to \ngive educational and technical assistance to stop these species from \nbecoming endangered, and therefore saving the taxpayers a lot of money \nand local economies a lot of anguish, and to give some much-needed \nrevenue to our State wildlife agencies around this country.\n  So those are generally the titles of the bill.\n  I just want to say that it is high time that we live up to the \npromise made 30 years ago, and we can do that by more wisely spending \nthis money. It makes no sense to take 100 percent of these revenues and \nspend them on Federal operating expenses that have nothing to do with \nour environment, or with this promise that was made, or with our \ninvestments in future generations. It is time not just for Louisiana, \nTexas, Alaska, and Mississippi, who have contributed so much to this \nindustry, but also it is high time for all of our States to benefit in \na more direct way than they are currently. This is a wiser fiscal \npolicy, it is a much wiser environmental policy, and it most certainly \nis an idea whose time has come.\n  To reiterate, the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act of \n1998 will go farther than any legislation to date to make good on \npromises that were made to the people of this country decades ago. In \naddition, it will begin to right a wrong endured by oil and gas \nproducing states for over 50 years, particularly for the states along \nthe Gulf of Mexico, and my state of Louisiana.\n  The Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act first provides a \nguaranteed source of funding equal to twenty-seven percent of all Outer \nContinental Shelf revenues for Coastal Impact Assistance to states to \noffset the impacts of offshore oil and gas activity, as well as to non-\nproducing states for environmental purposes. This funding goes directly \nto States and local governments for improvements in air and water \nquality, fish and wildlife habitat, wetlands, or other coastal \nresources, including shoreline protection and coastal restoration. \nThese revenues to coastal states will help offset a range of costs \nunique to maintaining a coastal zone. The formula is based on \npopulation, coastline and proximity to production.\n  Second, the bill provides a permanent stream of revenue for the State \nand Federal sides of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, as well as \nfor the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. Under the bill, \nfunding to the LWCF becomes automatic at sixteen percent of annual \nrevenues. Receiving just under half this amount, the state side of LWCF \nwill provide funds to state and local governments for land acquisition, \nurban conservation and recreation projects, all under the discretion of \nstate and local authorities. Since its enactment in 1965, the LWCF \nstate grant program has funded more than 37,000 park and recreation \nprojects throughout the nation, including in Louisiana the Joe Brown \nPark Development in New Orleans, the Baton Rouge Animal Exhibit, the \nVeterans Memorial Park in Point Barre and the Northwestern State \nUniversity Recreation Complex in Natchitoches. The Urban Parks program \nwould enable cities and towns to focus on the needs of its populations \nwithin our more densely inhabited areas with fewer greenspaces, \nplaygrounds and soccer fields for our youth. Stable funding, not \nsubject to appropriations, will provide greater revenue certainty to \nstate and local planning authorities.\n  A stable baseline will be established for Federal land acquisition \nthrough the LWCF at a level higher than the historical average over the \npast decade. Federal LWCF will receive just under half of the amount in \nthis title of the bill. And, nothing in this bill will preclude \nadditional Federal LWCF funds to be sought through the annual \nappropriations process. Some very worthy national projects that have \nreceived funding in the past include the Atchafalaya National Wildlife \nRefuge in Louisiana, the Mississippi Sandhill Crane Wildlife Refuge, \nthe Cape Cod National Seashore, Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota \nand the Sterling Forest in New Jersey. Federal LWCF dollars will be \nused for land acquisition in areas which have been and will be \nauthorized by Congress. The bill will restore Congressional intent with \nrespect to the LWCF, the goal of which is to share a significant \nportion of revenues from offshore development with the states to \nprovide for protection and public use of the natural environment.\n  Finally, the wildlife conservation and restoration provision includes \nguaranteed funding of seven percent of annual OCS revenues for wildlife \nhabitat protection, conservation education and de-listing of endangered \nspecies. Moreover, this funding may be used by states for habitat \npreservation and land acquisition of wintering habitat for important \nspecies, therefore preventing listings under the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  While we are proud of the accomplishment represented by the \nintroduction of this bill, I feel compelled to mention other interests \nthat are not included in the legislation, but for which I maintain a \nstrong level of support and commitment. The National Historic \nPreservation Fund is an important authorized use for Outer Continental \nShelf revenues. In fact, I introduced legislation earlier this year to \nreauthorize the fund for its continued viability and vitality. We see \nthe Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act as a starting point \nfor debate and consideration of additional issues. I would like to work \nwith proponents of historic preservation over the course of the year to \nsee their needs addressed in the future. This would include similar \nconsideration for Historic Battlefield Preservation, which is important \nto other members in this body. I also wish to work with other groups to \naddress their concerns about other provisions in the bill having to do \nwith formulas. Indeed, this is a measure that should enjoy broad \nsupport, and I want to continue to work with groups to that end.\n  Mr. President, all three portions of the bill will effectively free \nup State resources which in turn may then be used for other pressing \nlocal needs. The Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act is a \nperfect opportunity to reinvest in our nation's renewable resources for \nthe benefit of our children's future and our grandchildren's future. It \nis an idea whose time has come. I urge my colleagues to carefully \nconsider this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I thank Chairman Murkowski, and I thank the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, for all of their help in making this legislation \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and New York Times editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record]\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 16, 1997]\n\n                      Revive the Conservation Fund\n\n       More than 30 years ago, Congress passed a quiet little \n     environmental program that offered great promise to future \n     generations of Americans. Conceived under Dwight Eisenhower, \n     proposed by John F. Kennedy and signed into law by Lyndon \n     Johnson, the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund was \n     designed to provide a steady revenue stream to preserve \n     ``irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and unique \n     recreational value.'' Royalties from offshore oil and gas \n     leases would provide the money, giving the program an \n     interesting symmetry. Dollars raised from depleting one \n     natural resource would be used to protect another.\n       Since its inception, the fund has helped acquire seven \n     million acres of national and state parkland and develop \n     37,000 recreation projects. Its notable triumphs include the \n     Cape Cod National Seashore, the New Jersey Pinelands National \n     Reserve and Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota. But the \n     program fell apart during the Reagan Administration and has \n     yet to recover. Of the $900 million that has flowed to the \n     fund from oil and gas royalties each year since 1980, \n     Congress has seen fit to appropriate only a third, and in \n     some years far less. The rest has simply disappeared into the \n     Treasury, allocated for deficit reduction.\n       The biggest losers have been the states. Over time, \n     appropriations have been split about evenly between Federal \n     and state conservation projects. But for two years running, \n     not a dime has gone to the states--again for budgetary \n     reasons. This has been hard on New York, which needs Federal \n     help to buy valuable open space threatened by development in \n     the Adirondacks and elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n       Now, quite suddenly, this legislative stepchild has \n     acquired a bunch of new friends. As part of the recent budget \n     deal, Republican leaders agreed to add $700 million to the \n     $166 million that President Clinton has requested for the new \n     fiscal year. The Republicans had been getting heat from \n     governors back home and saw a chance to polish their \n     environmental image. For his part, Mr. Clinton needed about \n     $315 million to complete two important Federal purchases, \n     both strongly supported by this page--$65 million to develop \n     on his pledge to buy the New World Mine on the edge of \n     Yellowstone National Park, the rest to acquire the Headwaters \n     Redwood Grove in California from a private lumber company.\n       That would still leave several hundred million dollars for \n     other Federal projects and for the states--but only if the \n     House and Senate appropriations committees honor the outlines \n     of the budget deal and commit to sizable share of the money \n     to state projects. State officials have been descending upon \n     Washington in recent days to plead their cased. Gov. George \n     Pataki has written every member of Congress and, last week, \n     the New York State Parks Commissioner, Bernadette Castro, \n     testified at hearings convened by Senator Frank Murkowski of \n     Alaska.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana and \ncongratulate her for all the effort she has put forth in bringing this \nlegislation to this point.\n  I have been in Congress for a long time--something like 26 years now, \nin the House and in this body--and I have never really seen a first-\nterm Member who has been so dedicated to a major legislative effort as \nhas the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, in bringing this \nlegislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Many Members, on their \nfirst day, have come in and introduced a bill, issued a press release, \nand then forgotten about it. This has been an effort by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, of very carefully prodding and very \ncarefully studying and working with Members on both sides of the aisle \nto put together a bipartisan coalition to bring this legislation to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  While this is brought to the floor of the Senate in the last days of \nthis session, we all know that there will be another day. The \ngroundwork that she has laid in putting this package and this coalition \ntogether is going to be here in the next Congress. So in the next \nCongress we will start not from scratch but from the groundwork that \nshe has laid in bringing this legislation to the point it is today.\n  I congratulate her for the way she has done it. It is something that \nI have not seen by a new Member of the Congress in all of the years \nthat I have been here. It is a major accomplishment on her part. I am \nvery pleased to participate in it.\n  Just a brief word on the legislation. I think it is a fair thing to \ndo. Many non-coastal States have Federal property, owned 100 percent by \nthe Federal Government, within their borders. When minerals are \nextracted or oil and gas are found on those Federal lands, the State in \nwhich those lands are located gets as much as 50 percent of the \nrevenue. Coastal States, however, get nothing. That is clearly not \nfair. Offshore mineral development operations have a major impact on \ncoastal Louisiana. These operations impact our roads, bridges and other \ninfrastructure, our freshwater supply, our housing and other vital \npublic resources. It is only fair that there be a reasonable sharing of \nthose revenues with states that bear these kinds of burdens. The impact \ncoastal states suffer is a burden borne for the good of the whole \ncountry and, without it, the whole country would suffer.\n  Therefore, to share in a true partnership with the coastal States is \ncertainly something that this Congress should favorably consider, and I \nthink that we will because of what the Senator has been able to do in a \nbipartisan fashion. So while it is late this year, it is early for next \nyear. The work that she has done this year will pay off next year.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nLandrieu and Lott, to introduce the Reinvestment and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 1998.\n  This important piece of legislation remedies a tremendous inequity in \nthe distribution of revenues generated by offshore oil and gas \nproduction by directing that a portion of those moneys be allocated to \ncoastal States and communities who shoulder the responsibility for \nenergy development activity off their coastlines. It also provides a \nsecure funding source for state recreation and wildlife conservation \nprograms.\n  The OCS Impact Assistance portion of this bill is similar to \nlegislation I have introduced in prior Congresses and is an issue I \nhave worked on for my entire Senate career.\n  Title 1 of the bill directs that a portion of the revenues generated \nfrom oil and natural gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf--or \nOCS--be returned to coastal States and communities that share the \nburdens of exploration and production off their coastlines.\n  Offshore oil and gas production generates $3 to $4 billion in \nrevenues annually for the U.S. Treasury. Yet, unlike mineral receipts \nfrom onshore Federal lands, OCS oil and gas revenues are not directly \nreturned to the States in which production occurs.\n  This legislation remedies this disparity. States and communities that \nbear the responsibilities for offshore oil and gas production will \nshare in its benefits.\n  This legislation would, for the first time, share revenues generated \nby OCS oil and gas activities with counties, parishes and boroughs--the \nlocal governmental entities most directly affected--and State \ngovernments.\n  The bill also acknowledges that all coastal States, including those \nStates bordering the Great Lakes, have unique needs and directs that a \nportion of OCS revenues be shared with these States, even if no OCS \nproduction occurs off their coasts.\n  Coastal States and communities can use OCS Impact Assistance funds on \neverything from environmental programs, to coastal and marine \nconservation efforts, to new infrastructure requirements.\n  In Alaska, local communities could use OCS funds to participate in \nthe environmental planning process required by Federal laws before OCS \ndevelopment occurs.\n  Other rural coastal communities in Alaska will use the money for \nsanitation improvements. While still others, like Unalakleet, will use \nthe money to construct sea walls and breakwaters or beach \nrehabilitation--efforts which will combat the impacts of coastal \nerosion.\n  This is money that will be used, day-in and day-out, to improve the \nquality of life on coastal State residents--money which comes from oil \nand gas production.\n  Further, as the Federal OCS program expands in Alaska, this \nlegislation will mean even more revenues to the State, boroughs and \nlocal communities.\n  This is a true investment in the future.\n  As Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I know all \ntoo well that offshore oil and gas production is a lightning rod for \nenvironmental groups who will go to great lengths to disparage an \nactivity that is vital to the long-term energy and economic security of \nthis country.\n  These groups will likely say that this bill creates incentives for \noffshore oil and gas production because a factor in the distribution \nformula is a State's proximity to OCS production.\n  Let us remember, this is an impact assistance bill--revenue sharing, \nif you will.\n  States only will have impacts if they have production. The States \nwith production, obviously, have greater needs and are most deserving \nof a larger share of OCS revenues.\n  Mr. President, let me also remind everyone, that OCS production only \noccurs off the coasts of 6 States--yet the bill shares OCS revenues \nwith 34 States.\n  There are 28 coastal States that will get a share of OCS revenues \nwhich have no OCS production. In fact, in all areas except the Gulf of \nMexico and Alaska there is a moratorium prohibiting any new OCS \nproduction.\n  It is in the long-term best interest of this country to support \nresponsible and sustainable development of nonrenewable resources.\n  We now import more than 50 percent of our domestic petroleum \nrequirements and the Department of Energy's Information Administration \npredicts, in ten years, America will be at least 64 percent dependent \non foreign oil.\n  OCS development will play an important role in offsetting even \ngreater dependence on foreign energy.\n  The OCS accounts for 24 percent of this Nation's natural gas \nproduction\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nand 14 percent of its oil production. We need to ensure that the OCS \ncontinues to meet our future domestic energy needs.\n  I firmly believe that the Federal Government needs to do all it can \nto pursue and encourage further technological advances in OCS \nexploration and production.\n  These technological achievements have and will continue to result in \nnew OCS production having an unparalleled record of excellence on \nenvironmental and safety issues.\n  Additional technological advances with appropriate incentives will \nfurther improve new resource recovery and therefore increase revenues \nto the Treasury for the benefit of all Americans who enjoy programs \nfunded by OCS money.\n  I will do all I can to ensure a healthy OCS program, including new \nOCS development in the Arctic.\n  A number of challenges face new developments in this area--I am \nconfident that we can work through them all.\n  History has shown us that in the Arctic, and in other OCS areas, \ndevelopment and the environmental protection are compatible.\n  This bill also takes a portion of the revenues received by the \nFederal Government from OCS development and invests it in conservation \nand wildlife programs.\n  Thus, Titles II and III of the bill share OCS revenues with all \nStates for such purposes.\n  Title II of this bill provides a secure source of funding for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF was established over three \ndecades ago to provide Federal money for State and Federal land \nacquisition and help meet Americans' recreation needs.\n  Over thirty years ago, Congress had the foresight to recognize the \never growing need of the American public for parks and recreation \nfacilities with the passage of the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nAct.\n  That landmark piece of legislation was premised on the belief that \nrevenues earned from the depletion of a nonrenewable resource need to \nbe reinvested in a renewable resource for the benefit of future \ngenerations.\n  This rationale is as valid today as it was in the mid-1960's.\n  To accomplish this goal, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act \ndirects that revenues earned from offshore oil and gas production \nshould be spent on the acquisition of Federal recreation lands by the \nland management agencies.\n  The act also creates a state-side matching grant program.\n  The state-side matching grant program provides 50-50 matching grants \nto States and local communities for the acquisition and construction of \npark and recreation facilities.\n  The state-side program has a truly unique legacy in the history of \nAmerican conservation by providing the States with a leadership role in \nthe provision of recreation opportunities.\n  Through the 1995 fiscal year, over 3.2 billion in Federal dollars \nhave been leveraged to fund over 37,000 State and local park and \nrecreation projects.\n  Yet, despite these successes, the President had not requested any \nmoney for the state-side program for the last 4 years.\n  This is a program supported by this Nation's mayors, Governors, and \nthe recreation community.\n  The state-side matching grant should not have to justify annually its \nexistence with congressional appropriators.\n  Title II makes this program self-sufficient and provides secure \nfunding from OCS revenues.\n  Title III of this bill provides funding for State fish and wildlife \nconservation programs.\n  In Alaska, with its unparalleled natural beauty, fishing and hunting \nare two of the most popular forms of outdoor recreation.\n  The bill directs that a portion of OCS revenues should go to the \nStates for wildlife purposes.\n  The money would be distributed through the Pittman-Robertson program \nadministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Services.\n  With the inclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of money available for \nState fish and game programs would nearly double.\n  This is a no-tax alternative to the Teaming with Wildlife proposal.\n  States will be able to use these monies to increase fish and wildlife \npopulations and improve fish and wildlife habitat.\n  States also could use the money for wildlife education programs.\n  I am proud of this proposal which is a win-win for the oil and gas \nindustry, the States, environmental and conservation groups, and all \nAmericans.\n  This bill will ensure not only that Coastal States have money to \naddress the effects of OCS-activities but that all States have funds \nnecessary to provide outdoor recreation and conservation resources for \nall of us today to enjoy.\n  As we end the 105th Congress, I can pledge, as Chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, that the enactment of this bill will \nbe one of my highest priorities next year.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ncolleagues, Senators Landrieu and Murkowski, in introducing the \nReinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act.\n  Mr. President, since the inception of the oil and gas program on the \nOuter Continental Shelf (OCS), states and coastal communities have \nsought a greater share of the benefits from development. And why \nshouldn't they? These communities provide the infrastructure, public \nservices, manpower and support industries necessary to sustain this \ndevelopment.\n  Currently, the majority of OCS revenues are funneled into the Federal \nTreasury where they are used to pay for various federal programs and to \nreduce the deficit. While funding programs and reducing the deficit are \ncertainly important, I believe that some percentage of the revenues \nshould be reinvested in that which makes them possible.\n  Our bill does that. The Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration \nAct diverts one-half of the OCS revenues from the Federal Treasury to \ncoastal states and communities for a multitude of programs: air and \nwater quality monitoring, wetlands protection, coastal restoration and \nshoreline protection, land acquisition, infrastructure, public service \nneeds, state park and recreation programs and wildlife conservation.\n  This bill allows states and communities to use these funds in \nwhatever manner they deem appropriate. In Pascagoula, for example, \nauthorities might choose to restore and secure the shoreline where \nyears of sea traffic have taken their toll. Further north in Vancleave, \nthey may choose instead to refurbish the roads and bridges that carry \nthe heavy machinery coming and going from the coast. This bill provides \na framework within which these localities can make the right decisions \nfor their citizens and environment.\n  Mr. President, I have been working on this issue for many, many \nyears. As a coast dweller myself, I know the impact that the oil and \ngas industry can have on communities and the importance of reinvestment \nin these areas. This is not to say that the industry mistreats the \nstates; on the contrary, they work very hard to comply with stringent \nenvironmental regulations and to take care of the community as best \nthey can. The OCS Policy Committee said in 1993 that, despite the oil \nindustry's best efforts, ``OCS development still can affect community \ninfrastructure, social services and the environment in ways that cause \nconcerns among residents of the coastal states and communities.''\n  I know that there is no way to totally eliminate this impact on \ncoastal communities. I also know that, while the benefits of a healthy \nOCS program are felt nationally, the infrastructure, environmental and \nsocial costs are felt locally. Our bill would put money back into the \ncommunities that need it most.\n  It would also put money back into the environmental resources of the \narea. Exploration for non-renewable resources and stewardship of \ncoastal resources are not mutually exclusive, but must be carefully \nbalanced for both to be sustained. It is important that our wetlands, \nfisheries and water resources are taken into consideration and afforded \nadequate protection.\n  In addition to propping up the states and coastal communities, our \nbill also provides funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n(LWCF). Over 30 years ago, Congress set up this fund to address the \nAmerican public's\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\ndesire for more parks and recreational facilities. This bill makes the \nprogram self-sufficient, providing secure funding from the OCS \nrevenues. This is an investment in our future--our land, our resources \nand our recreational enjoyment.\n  Mr. President, our bill makes yet another investment with these OCS \nrevenues--an investment in fish and wildlife programs. With the \ninclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of money available for state \nprograms would nearly double. This is money that can be used to \nincrease populations and improve habitat for fish and wildlife. It \ncould even be used for wildlife education programs.\n  Mr. President, this bill was carefully crafted to strike a balance \nbetween the needs and interests of the oil and gas industry, the \nstates, and the environmental and conservation groups. It's a good \npackage that will benefit all Americans, not just those who live and \nwork in coastal areas. It will benefit hunters and anglers. It will \nbenefit bird watchers and campers. It will benefit all Americans who \ntake solace in the fact that the oil industry is taking care of the \ncommunities that support it.\n  I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues and look forward to \nadvancing this important legislation in the 106th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2567. A bill to ensure that any entity owned, operated, or \ncontrolled by the People's Liberation Army or the People's Armed Police \nof the People's Republic of China does not conduct certain business \nwith United States persons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n    trading with the people's republic of china military act of 1998\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill \nthat would bar firms owned by China's People's Liberation Army and \nPeople's Armed Police from operating in the United States and prohibit \nthe import into the United States of products made by these firms or \nthe export of products to these firms. It would also prohibit extension \nof credit to or ownership interest in Chinese military companies. The \nbill contains an exemption for humanitarian aid, waiving these \nprohibitions if the President determines that a transaction involves \nitems intended to relieve human suffering such as food, medicine or \nemergency supplies.\n  My bill is based in part on H.R. 4433 introduced in the House on \nAugust 6, 1998 by Representatives Gephardt, Bonior, and Pelosi, who I \nwant to commend for taking this bold and important human rights \ninitiative.\n  Before I get into the key question of why I'm introducing this bill, \nI would like to touch on the question of the extent of PLA and People's \nArmed Police commercial relations with the United States. To begin \nwith, I should stress that there is uncertainty about the extent and \nnature of activities of companies linked to Chinese military and \nsecurity forces in the United States. For example, a Rand study last \nyear estimated that there are ``between 20-30 PLA-affiliated companies \noperating in the United States, although there are certainly more that \nhave not yet been identified.'' It added that one of the major \nobstacles to identifying these companies is that they ``often \nconsciously disguise their military background by using offshore \nholding companies and unfamiliar names.''\n  Nevertheless, while there is much we don't know, there is some hard \ndata available on PLA and People's Armed Police business dealings with \nthe United States. In June, 1997 the AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Services \nTrades Department issued a report providing a wealth of detailed \ninformation on these business dealings. The report, based on extensive \nresearch, found twelve companies incorporated in the United States \nowned by the People's Armed Police and various elements of the PLA, \nincluding the General Staff Department and the Navy. In addition, the \nreport cited seven PLA companies that had been dissolved after their \nofficials had been accused of smuggling AK-47's into the United States \nin 1996--an episode I will discuss later. For each company, the report \nprovided addresses and dates of incorporation, and for some companies \nthe names of registered agents, officers, and directors.\n  The AFL-CIO report also provided detailed data on the exports to the \nUnited States of twenty-five People's Armed Police and PLA companies \nduring 1996. The companies included not only major PLA components such \nas the General Staff and General Logistics Departments, but also some \nowned by various PLA military regions. All told, these companies \nexported 34 million pounds of products to the United States, including \nfurniture, chemicals, rain gear, toys, sport rifles, aircraft engines, \nand fish. According to an AFL-CIO official, PLA companies were the \nlargest exporters of fish for U.S. fast-food restaurants. Finally, the \nreport contained a listing of U.S. companies that had purchased these \nproducts. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nlast November, an AFL-CIO official pointed out that several well-known \nU.S. concerns had purchased products directly from PLA companies.\n  While it is not illegal for the People's Armed Police and PLA \ncompanies to operate in the United States, on at least one occasion a \nmajor PLA company participated in a clearly illegal activity. In May, \n1996, federal law enforcement agencies carried out a sting operation \nconnected with seizure of 2,000 fully automatic AK-47 weapons from \nChina. Since 1994 Chinese gun exports to the United States have been \nillegal and this was the largest seizure of fully automatic weapons in \nU.S. history. One of the two Chinese companies involved, Poly \nTechnologies, is the most successful PLA-controlled company. Poly is \nrun by China's princelings, family members of top Chinese civilian and \nmilitary leaders. Poly's president is the late Deng Xiaoping's son-in-\nlaw and a retired PLA Major General. The Chairman of Poly is the son of \nthe late Wang Zhen, who was China's vice-president and a retired \nGeneral. While China experts doubt there was high-level collusion in \nthe smuggling of AK-47's, a federal law enforcement officer noted that \nthose involved were ``in a position to deliver substantial arms and are \nnot low-level flunkies.''\n  Mr. President, I now want to turn to the key question of why I \ndecided to introduce this bill. Why is there a need for such \nlegislation? Because companies owned by the PLA--the Chinese \nGovernment's main and indispensable instrument of repression--are \npermitted to operate in the United States. Because the American people \nare unwittingly purchasing products exported to the United States by \ncompanies owned by the PLA and the People's Armed Police. Because the \nAmerican people would be outraged--as deeply outraged as I am--if they \nknew they were subsidizing those responsible for massacring students, \nworkers, and other demonstrators for democracy in Tiananmen Square on \nJune 4, 1989, those who have occupied Tibet for almost 50 years, \nbrutally oppressing its people and seeking to erase their unique, \ncultural, linguistic, and religious heritage. And because they would be \noutraged--as deeply outraged as I am, that their government is not only \ndoing nothing to stop this, but is opposing efforts to end PLA and \nPeople's Armed Police profit-making in the United States.\n  Mr. President, you may well ask what is the People's Armed Police. \nThe People's Armed Police, who are under the operational control of the \nPLA, are an internal security force of over 1 million troops, one of \nwhose main purposes is to suppress the legitimate protests of the \nChinese people. For example, the People's Armed Police is often used to \nquash the peaceful protests of Chinese workers.\n  Last year the People's Armed Police was used to brutally break up \nprotests by thousands of laid-off state enterprise workers in Sichuan \nprovince. Hundreds of these workers, who took to the streets because \ncompany officials embezzled their unemployment compensation, were \nreportedly beaten by the People's Armed Police and several \n``instigators'' were arrested. Chinese officials were said to have \nordered hospitals not to treat wounded demonstrators, comparing them to \n``counterrevolutionary thugs'' who ``rioted'' at Tiananmen in June \n1989. What were the laid-off workers seeking that provoked such a \nvicious crackdown by the People's Armed Police? Just that the \ngovernment provide them with the subsistence they are entitled to and \nthat corrupt company officials be punished.\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\n  How can we continue to subsidize the thugs who repress Chinese \nworkers?\n  The People's Armed Police also man the guard towers of the Laogai, \nChina's massive forced labor camp system--the largest in the world. The \nLaogai is China's version of the Soviet gulag. The Laogai is comprised \nof more than 1,100 forced labor camps, with an estimated population of \n6 to 8 million prisoners. Prisoners are overworked, denied medical \ntreatment and tortured.\n  How can we continue to subsidize those who guard slave laborers?\n  The People's Armed Police and the PLA are the key agents of \nrepression in Tibet. The People's Armed Police have been filmed in \nLhasa, the capital of Tibet, beating monks and nuns peacefully \ndemonstrating for their rights. This past May, the People's Armed \nPolice and PLA soldiers reportedly fired on 150 Tibetan political \nprisoners who staged a demonstration in Tibet's main prison and the \npolice later stormed the prison and arrested the demonstrators. Chinese \nofficials were apparently offended when the political prisoners flew a \nTibetan national flag during the demonstration.\n  How can we continue to subsidize those who deny Tibetans fundamental \nfreedoms, beat and torture them, and seek to destroy their unique \nculture and religion?\n  Mr. President, this is shameful and it must be stopped. Would we have \nallowed Stalin's NKVD or Hitler's SS to subsidize their heinous \nactivities by running profit-making entities in the United States and \nexporting goods to us and buying goods from us? Of course not. Why then \ndo we allow the likes of the PLA and the People's Armed Police to \nprofit from commercial relations with us and why does the \nAdministration oppose efforts to put an end to this?\n  Mr. President, the Administration in the past has justified the \nunjustifiable by arguing that imposing sanctions on PLA and People's \nArmed Police companies would be an ``impossible task'' for U.S. law \nenforcement agencies, risk retaliation against major U.S. exporters, \nand harm our efforts to develop a military-to-military dialog and \nrelationship with China.\n  While I believe these arguments don't hold water, they have been \novertaken by events. In July, President Jiang Zemin ordered the PLA and \nthe People's Armed Police to end the ``commercial activities'' of their \nsubordinate units. There are some questions about the extent to which \nJiang's orders will be carried out and over what time-frame. Tai Ming \nCheung, a noted expert on China's military, foresees some shrinkage of \nthe military-business complex, but predicts that it will ``remain \npowerful and more focused.'' Some China experts estimate that as much \nas one-third of total defense spending derive from profits from PLA \nbusinesses and it would obviously be difficult for the government to \ncompensate the military for loss of this funding stream.\n  Be this as it may, the fact remains that it is now Chinese government \npolicy to end the commercial activities of the PLA and the People's \nArmed Police. I believe that the Senate should do all we can to help \nBeijing by passing my bill, which seeks to cut U.S. commercial ties \nwith the PLA and the People's Armed Police and to end their business \nactivities in the United States. Since we would be cooperating with \nJiang's policies, the Administration can no longer point to alleged \nharmful effects on our military-to-military dialog or Chinese \nretaliation against U.S. exporters. Moreover, we would have reason to \nexpect that the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies to implement \nthe sanctions contained in this bill would be enhanced since PLA and \nPeople's Armed Police business activities would be illegal both in \nChina and the United States. Jiang Zemin presumably would have \nincentives to end or at least circumscribe Chinese military and police \nbusiness dealings with and in the United States and, perhaps, even \ncooperate with U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n  While no one can predict how successful Jiang will be in eliminating \nor even in cutting back China's military-business complex, we must act \nto end U.S. subsidies to those who beat, torture, and imprison those \nwho bravely fight for freedom and democracy. By contributing to PLA and \nPeople's Armed Police coffers we act in complicity with those who \nrepress workers, run slave labor camps, crush religious freedom, quash \nTibetans and other minorities seeking to preserve their identity \nculture and religion. We betray those who laid down their lives at \nTiananmen Square, inspired by American principles of democracy and \nindividual rights and we betray those brave dissidents who rot in \nChinese jails or toil in forced labor camps, whose only crime was to \nfight for the ideals all Americans hold dear. It is time to end this \ncomplicity, end these betrayals of our friends.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trading With the People's \n     Republic of China Military Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Liberation Army is the principal \n     instrument of repression within the People's Republic of \n     China and is responsible for massacring an unknown number of \n     students, workers, and other demonstrators for democracy in \n     Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.\n       (2) The People's Liberation Army is responsible for \n     occupying Tibet since 1950 and implementing the official \n     policy of the People's Republic of China to eliminate the \n     unique cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage of the \n     Tibetan people.\n       (3) The People's Liberation Army has operational control of \n     the People's Armed Police, an internal security force of over \n     1,000,000 troops, whose primary purpose is to suppress the \n     legitimate protests of the Chinese people.\n       (4) The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive \n     effort to modernize its military capabilities.\n       (5) The People's Liberation Army owns and operates hundreds \n     of companies and thousands of factories the profits from \n     which in some measure are used to support military \n     activities.\n       (6) Companies owned by the People's Liberation Army and the \n     People's Armed Police export to the United States such \n     products as toys, clothing, frozen fish, lighting fixtures, \n     garlic, glassware, yarn, footwear, chemicals, machinery, \n     metal products, furniture, decorations, gloves, tents, and \n     tools.\n       (7) Companies owned by the People's Liberation Army and the \n     People's Armed Police regularly solicit investment in joint \n     ventures with United States companies.\n       (8) The People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed \n     Police have established at least 23 different companies in \n     the United States over the past decade.\n       (9) The people of the United States are unaware that \n     certain products they purchase in retail stores are produced \n     by companies owned and operated by the People's Liberation \n     Army or the People's Armed Police.\n       (10) The purchase of these products by United States \n     consumers places them in the position of unwittingly \n     subsidizing the operations of the People's Liberation Army \n     and the People's Armed Police.\n       (11) The Government of the People's Republic of China, with \n     the assistance of the People's Liberation Army and the \n     People's Armed Police, continues to deny its citizens basic \n     human rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights, persecutes those who seek to freely practice their \n     religion, and denies workers the right to establish free and \n     independent trade unions.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     prohibit any entity owned, operated, or controlled by the \n     People's Liberation Army or the People's Armed Police from \n     operating in the United States or from conducting certain \n     business with persons subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the exclusion from gross income for foster care payments shall \nalso apply to payments by qualifying placement agencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  exclusion for foster care payments to apply payments by qualifying \n                          placements agencies\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \neliminate unnecessary distinctions drawn by the Internal Revenue Code \nfor the tax treatment of payments received by families and individuals \nwho open their homes to care for foster children and adults. Currently, \nthe law allows an exclusion from income for foster care payments \nreceived by some providers, while denying eligibility for the exclusion \nto other foster care providers.\n  My bill expands the law's exclusion of foster care payments. Under my \nbill, foster care payments to providers made by placement agencies that \ncontract with, or are licensed by, State or local governments will be \neligible for the exclusion, regardless of the age of the individual in \nfoster care. This bill is a companion to H.R. 3991, introduced by \nCongressman Jim Bunning of Kentucky. By simplifying the tax treatment \nof foster care payments, the bill will remove the inequities and \nuncertainties inherent in the current tax treatment of foster care \npayments.\n  Under current law, foster care providers are permitted to deduct \nexpenditures made while caring for foster individuals. Providers must \nmaintain detailed records to substantiate these deductions. In lieu of \nthis detailed record keeping, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code \nallows certain foster care providers to exclude from income the \npayments they receive to care for foster care. Eligibility for this \nexclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age \nof the person in foster care; the type of foster care placement agency; \nand the source of the foster care payments.\n  For children under age 19 in foster care, section 131 permits \nproviders to exclude payments when a State (or one of its political \nsubdivisions) or a charitable tax-exempt placement agency places the \nindividual in foster care and makes the foster care payments. For \npersons age 19 and older, section 131 permits providers to exclude \nfoster care payments only when a State (or one of its political \nsubdivisions) places the individual and makes the payments.\n  This bill will simplify these anachronistic tax rules by expanding \nthe tax code's exclusion to include foster care payments for all \npersons in foster care, regardless of age, even if the foster care \nplacement is made by a foster care placement agency and even if foster \ncare payments are received through a foster care placement agency, \nrather than directly from a State (or one of its political \nsubdivisions). To ensure appropriate oversight, the bill requires that \nthe placement agency be either licensed by, or under contract with, a \nState or a political subdivision thereof.\n  Increasingly, State and local governments are relying on private \nagencies to arrange for foster care services for children and adults. \nWhile foster care for children has been in existence for decades, \nfoster care for adults is a more recent phenomenon. Sometimes referred \nto as ``host homes'' or ``developmental homes,'' adult foster care \nfacilities have proven to be an effective alternative to institutional \ncare for adults with disabilities. My home State of Vermont, at the \nforefront of efforts to develop individualized alternatives to \ninstitutional care, authorizes local developmental service providers to \nact as placement agencies and to contract with families willing to \nprovide foster care in their homes. The tax law's disparate tax \ntreatment of foster care payments, however, impedes alternative \narrangements. Persons providing foster care for individuals placed in \ntheir homes by the government can exclude foster care payments from \nincome. For providers receiving payments from private agencies, \nhowever, the exclusion is not available (unless the individual in \nfoster care is under age 19 and the placement agency is a nonprofit \norganization). These rules discourage families willing to provide \nfoster care in their homes to persons placed by private placement \nagencies, thus reducing the availability of care alternatives. Because \nof the complexity of the current law, providers often receive \nconflicting advice from tax professionals regarding the proper tax \ntreatment of foster care payments they receive.\n  Mr. President, this bill will advance the development of family-based \nfoster care services, a highly valued alternative to \ninstitutionalization. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise along with my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, in introducing a critically important \npiece of legislation that will ensure fair treatment for individuals \nand families who provide invaluable care to foster children and adults.\n  Presently, foster care providers are permitted to deduct expenditures \nmade while caring for foster individuals if detailed expense records \nare maintained to support such deductions.\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nHowever, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code permits certain \nfoster care providers to exclude, from taxable income, payments they \nreceive to care for foster individuals. Who specifically is available \nfor this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three \nfactors: the age of the individual receiving foster care services, the \ntype of foster care placement agency, and the source of the foster care \npayments.\n  Section 131 presently permits foster care providers to exclude \npayments from taxable income only when a state, or one of its political \ndivisions, or a charitable tax exempt placement agency places the \nindividual and makes the foster care payments for children under 19 \nyears of age. However, for adults over the age of 19, section 131 \npermits foster providers to exclude payments from taxable income only \nwhen a State, or one of its divisisions, places the individual and \nprovides the foster care payments.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we remove the inequities and needless \ncomplexities of the current system. States and localities across the \ncountry are increasingly relying on private agencies to arrange for \nfoster care services for both children and adults. However, some foster \ncare providers are understandably reluctant to contract with private \nplacement agencies because current law requires such providers to \ninclude foster care payments as taxable income. In contrast, current \nlaw permits providers who care for foster individuals placed in their \nhomes by government agencies to exclude such payments from taxable \nincome. Current law, therefore, discourages families from providing \nfoster care on behalf of private placement agencies, thereby reducing \nbadly-needed foster care opportunities for individuals requiring \nassistance.\n  The bill Senator Jeffords and I introduce today will greatly simplify \nthe outdated tax rules applicable to foster care payments. Under our \nlegislation, foster care providers would be able to avoid onerous \nrecord keeping by excluding from income any foster care payment \nreceived regardless of the age of the individual receiving foster care \nservices, the type of agency that placed the individual, or the source \nof foster care payments. To ensure appropriate oversight, this bill \nwill require the placement agency to be licensed either by, or under \ncontract with, a state or one or its political divisions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation accomplishes what current law does \nnot--consistent and fair treatment of families and individuals who open \ntheir homes and their hearts to foster children and adults.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2570. A bill entitled the ``Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act \nof 1998''; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             long-term care patient protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term Care \nPatient Protection Act of 1998, along with Senators Reid and Feinstein. \nI am pleased to introduce this legislation on behalf of the \nAdministration.\n  Recently, the Department of Health & Human Services Office of \nInspector General issued a report describing how easy it is for people \nwith abusive and criminal backgrounds to find work in nursing homes. On \nSeptember 14th, the Senate Aging Committee held hearings on this \ndisturbing problem, where we heard horrifying stories of elderly \npatients being abused by the very people who are charged with their \ncare. While the vast majority of nursing home workers are dedicated and \nprofessional, even one instance of abuse is inexcusable. This should \nnot be happening in a single nursing home in America.\n  Senator Reid and I have already introduced legislation, the Patient \nAbuse Prevention Act, to require background checks for health care \nworkers. Those with prior abusive and criminal backgrounds would be \nprohibited from working in patient care. I am pleased that the \nAdministration has also recognized the importance of addressing this \nproblem, and I have been glad to work with them in this effort. While \nthe bill we introduce today on the Administration's behalf is not \nperfect, I believe it is another important step in our efforts to pass \nstrong patient protections.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43 percent of Americans \nover the age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number \nof people needing long-term care services will continue to increase as \nthe Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of nursing homes do an \nexcellent job in caring for their patients, but it only takes a few \nabusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should be a healing \nenvironment.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with \ncriminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, \nand have subsequently abused patients in their care. Just last year, \nthe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this \nproblem. This past March, The Wall Street Journal published an article \ndescribing the difficulties we face in tracking known abusers.\n  These news stories are only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, it \nis just far too easy for a worker with a history of abuse to find \nemployment and prey on the most vulnerable patients. The OIG report \nfound that 5 percent of nursing home employees in Maryland and Illinois \nhad prior criminal records. And it also found that between 15-20 \npercent of those convicted of patient abuse had prior criminal records. \nIt is just too easy for known abusers to find work in health care and \ncontinue to prey on patients.\n  Why is this the case? Because current state and national safeguards \nare inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required \nto maintain registries of abusive nurse aides. But nurse aides are not \nthe only workers involved in abuse, and other workers are not tracked \nat all. Even worse, there is no system to coordinate information about \nabusive nurse aides between States. A known abuser in Iowa would have \nlittle trouble moving to Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients \nthere.\n  In addition, there is no Federal requirement that nursing homes \nconduct a criminal background check on prospective employees. People \nwith violent criminal backgrounds--people who have already been found \nguilty of murder, rape, and assault--could easily get a job in a \nnursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being \ndiscovered.\n  The Administration's bill that we introduce today builds upon the \nextensive work that Senator Reid and I have done to address this issue, \nand incorporates some new ideas as well.\n  First, this legislation will create a National Registry of abusive \nnursing home employees. States will be required to submit information \nfrom their current State registries to the National Registry. Nursing \nhomes will be required to check the National Registry before hiring a \nprospective worker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of abuse \nwill be prohibited from working in nursing homes.\n  Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to prevent people \nwith criminal backgrounds from working in nursing homes. If the \nNational Registry does not include information about the prospective \nworker, the nursing home is then required to contact the state to \ninitiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for patient abuse or a \nrelevant violent crime would bar that applicant from working in nursing \nhomes.\n  Let me be clear: I realize that this legislation is not perfect. I \nhave significant concerns about several unresolved issues that I \nbelieve must be addressed. We must continue to work on minimizing costs \nand determine a fair and reasonable way to distribute those costs. We \nmust ensure that the system is efficient and effective, with a quick \nturnaround time and accurate information for providers. And I believe \nthat we must apply these requirements to other health care settings \nbesides nursing homes. It would do little good to ban these people from \nworking in nursing homes, and still permit them to work in home health \ncare.\n  Senator Reid and I have worked for a long time with patient \nadvocates, the nursing home and home health industries, and law \nenforcement officials to address these issues. I have been very \nheartened by their enthusiasm and willingness to work with us in this \neffort. It is in all of our best interests to pass legislation that is \nstrong, workable, and enforceable.\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\n  Despite the unresolved issues I have mentioned, I am introducing the \nAdministration's legislation today because I believe it will provide a \nstrong incentive for everyone to stay at the table and resolve these \nissues. All of us--the President, Congress, health care professionals \nand consumer advocates--we all share the common goal of protecting \npatients from abuse, neglect and maltreatment. We must keep working \ntogether to create a viable national system that will prevent abusive \nworkers from working with patients.\n  Although the remaining days of this Congress are few, we all need to \ncome together once again to reach consensus on the remaining issues and \nprepare to move this process forward. This legislation gives us an \nopportunity to act now. I look forward to continuing our work on this \nissue, and I welcome comments and suggestions for improving the bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most \nnursing homes and their staff provide the highest quality care. \nHowever, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get rid of \nthe few that don't. When a patient checks into a nursing home, they \nshould not have to give up their right to be free from abuse, neglect, \nor mistreatment. They should not have to worry about dying from \nmalnutrition and dehydration.\n  Our nation's seniors made our country what it is today. Before we \ncross that bridge to the next century that we have all heard so much \nabout, we must make sure we treat the people that brought us this far \nwith the dignity, care, and respect they deserve. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and the administration in this effort to \nprotect patients. Our Nation's seniors and disabled deserve nothing \nless than our full attention to this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record.]\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nKohl, in introducing the ``Long Term Care Patient Protection Act of \n1998''. This legislation represents our latest step in a series of \nefforts to institute greater protections for nursing home residents.\n  Over the past year, Senator Kohl and I, along with our colleagues on \nthe Senate Special Committee on Aging, have worked to ensure that \nseniors are not placed in the hands of criminals in nursing homes. The \ndisturbing problem of nursing home abuse by workers with a violent or \ncriminal history was brought to our attention just over a year ago. \nShortly thereafter, Senator Kohl, Grassley, and I introduced S. 1122, \n``The Patient Abuse Prevention Act.'' This measure would require \ncriminal background checks for potential long-term care facility \nworkers and would create a national registry of abusive health care \nworkers.\n  This past July, Senator Kohl and I sponsored an amendment that would \nauthorize nursing homes and home health agencies to use the FBI \ncriminal background check system. This amendment is an important step \ntowards our goal of mandatory background checks, and I am proud to \nreport that this language was included in the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Bill.\n  Upon our request, the Senate Special Committee and Aging dedicated a \nhearing to the issue of criminal background checks for long-term care \nworkers. At this time, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services released a report entitling, \n``Safeguarding Long Term Care Residents''. The year-long investigation \nby the OIG spanning facilities across the country produced the very \nrecommendations Senator Kohl and I have been advocating for over a \nyear. Specifically, the OIG concurred with our proposal to develop \ncriminal background checks, and to create a national registry for \nnursing facility employees. Their findings were consistent with our \nposition that a criminal background check system could help weed out \npotential employees with a history of abuse and prevent them from \nworking with patients.\n  Recently, President Clinton acknowledged the need for tough \nlegislative and administrative actions to improve the quality of \nnursing homes. Using our original legislation as a guide, the \nAdministration drafted a proposal to address the crucial issue of \ncriminal background checks for nursing home workers. I am pleased that \nthe Administration has recognized the need for criminal background \nchecks and has modeled its initiative after our legislation. I am \nintroducing the ``Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998'' on \nbehalf of the Administration because it builds on our extensive work in \nthis area and represents an important step in the right direction.\n  The ``Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998'' would create a \nnational registry of abusive workers. Further, the bill would expand \nthe existing State nurse aide registries to include substantiated \nfindings of abuse by all nursing facility employees, not just nurse \naides. States would be required to submit any existing or newly \nacquired information contained in the State registries to the national \nregistry of abusive workers. This provision is crucial because it would \nensure that once an employee is added to the national registry, the \noffender will not be able to simply cross state lines and find \nemployment in another nursing home where he may continue to prey on \nvulnerable seniors.\n  Another important portion of the bill outlines the process by which \nnursing homes must screen prospective employees. According to this \nlegislation, all nursing homes must first initiate a search of the \nnational registry of abusive workers. In cases where the prospective \nemployee is not listed on the registry, the nursing home would be \nrequired to conduct a State and national criminal background check on \nthe individual through the Federal Bureau of Investigations.\n  Finally, nursing homes would be required to report to the State any \ninstance in which the facility determines that an employee has \ncommittee an act of resident neglect, abuse, or theft of a resident's \nproperty during the course of employment. The OIG at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services reported that 46 percent of facilities \nbelieve that incidents of abuse are under-reported. This provision \nwould ensure that offenders are reported and added to the national \nregistry before they have the opportunity to strike again.\n  One of the most difficult times for any individual or family is when \nthey must make the decision to rely upon the support and services of a \nlong-term care facility. Families should not have to live with the fear \nthat their loved one is being left in the hands of an individual with a \ncriminal record. No one should have to endure the pain and outrage of \nlearning that their loved one has fallen prey to a nursing home \nemployee with a violent or criminal record. At last month's Aging \nCommittee hearing, we heard the real life nightmare of Richard Meyer, \nwhose 92 year-old mother was sexually assaulted by a male certified \nnursing assistant who had previously been charged and convicted for \nsexually assaulting a young girl. We can and we must work to prevent \ntragedies like this one from occurring again in the future.\n  Americans over the age of 85 are the fastest growing segment of our \nelderly population. There are 31.6 million Americans over the age of \nsixty-five, and as the baby boom generation ages, that number will \nskyrocket. Over 43 percent of Americans will likely spend time in a \nnursing home. As our nation seeks ways to care for an aging population, \nwe must establish greater protections to ensure that our seniors will \nreceive the best care possible.\n  I have visited countless nursing homes in my home state of Nevada. \nDuring these visits, I have always been impressed by the compassion and \ndedication of the staff. Most nurse aides and health care workers are \nprofessional, honest, and dedicated. Unfortunately, it only takes one \nabusive staff member to terrorize the lives of the residents.

Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Benefit\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nVerification and Integrity Act. This legislation takes a government-\nwide approach to improving eligibility verification and debt collection \nin Federal benefit and assistance programs by identifying, testing, \nevaluating, and, in some cases, implementing ``data sharing'' \ninformation technologies. Federal agencies would be encouraged to make \nuse of federal, state, and private databases such as the National \nDirectory of New Hires and credit bureau data to help ensure that the \ngovernment delivers benefits to the right person, at the right time, \nfor the right amount. This bill mirrors Title VI of H.R. 4243, a bill \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Steve Horn and Carolyn \nMaloney.\n  The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency has found that \nthe federal government loses billions of dollars each year by not \nadequately verifying information in applications for federal benefit \nprograms. For example, an audit by the Department of Education's Office \nof Inspector General disclosed that approximately $109 million in Pell \ngrants had been over-awarded in 1996 because students failed to report \nor under-reported their income. The Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment projected that during the same year it had paid out at \nleast $600 million in excess rental subsidies because of tenants' \nunder-reporting of income.\n  News reports confirm the pervasiveness of this type of fraud against \nthe government. One story in the Wall Street Journal described how \n``student-aid consultants'' charged clients $350 each for phony tax \nreturns, which would under-report the student's family income. Because \nthe government does not compare the tax return accompanying the student \nloan application with the tax forms that had been submitted to the IRS, \nthe student can fraudulently apply to the government for financial aid \nand receive thousands of dollars in Pell grants. In another example, \nthe Washington Post reported that an owner of a California trade school \nwas indicted on allegations that he stole $1 million in federal Pell \ngrants by creating imaginary students. Since the government never \ncompared the names of these students with information it already had, \nthe school was able to hide its crimes for years.\n  The report of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency \nconcluded that federal agencies need eligibility verification to deter \nand detect the growing fraud in federal benefit and assistance \nprograms. Several federal agencies do have procedures to try to verify \ninformation submitted by applicants by comparing it with information \ncontained in various federal and state government databases. \nUnfortunately the legislative authority for gaining access to this \nverifying data often does not encompass many of the most useful \ngovernment sources: there is no comprehensive authority to share data \namong agencies. Private industry has made great strides in improving \neligibility information accuracy, and the federal government could \nclearly learn from the best business practices of companies like \nAmerican Express, Visa, Citicorp and Nationsbank. This bill contains \nprovisions to encourage the government to test and incorporate best \ncommercial business practices for eligibility verification.\n  Similarly, information contained in the National Directory of New \nHires and other databases could be a vital aid to the Department of \nEducation's efforts to locate debtors under its student loan programs, \nand to other agencies trying to locate and collect from debtors. The \nDepartment of Education devotes 70% of its debt collection efforts to \nlocating debtors. The National Directory of New Hires, a comprehensive \ndatabase that lists where virtually all Americans are employed, was \nrecently established as part of the legislation to find and crack down \non ``deadbeat dads''. The Directory is maintained by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and the data contained in the database \ncannot be shared with other agencies without explicit legislative \nauthorization. As with child support collection, the Department of \nEducation could use the New Hires directory as an enormously helpful \ntool to locate where a debtor lives and works. Once a debtor is found, \nthe Department could then use its existing authority to notify the \ndebtor, and then as a last resort and after meeting all due process \nrequirements, the Department could garnish the debtor's wages.\n  To improve government-wide data-sharing coordination, this \nlegislation creates a ``Federal Benefit Verification and Payment \nIntegrity Board'' which would provide oversight and foster agency \ninterest in pursuing data sharing ideas and technologies. Once an \nagency tests an idea and obtains a positive result, the Board can \nrecommend to the Congress that permanent authorizing legislation be \nenacted. Federally funded benefit programs that could use data-sharing \ntechnologies include: the Pell Grant program, federal student loan \nprograms, Medicaid, the Food Stamp program, USDA and HUD housing \nprograms, veterans compensation programs, Social Security programs, the \nRailroad Retirement Survivor program, the Civil Service Retirement \nProgram, Small Business Administration programs, and USDA business \nprograms. While this list is not exhaustive, the legislation would \npromote data-sharing between agencies that have the current statutory \nauthority to do so.\n  In addition, this legislation balances the need for data in verifying \neligibility with the paperwork burden and privacy intrusion that data \nsharing imposes. In fact, this legislation contains a number of \nincreased privacy protections, including requiring that agency \nproposals contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to \nensure the security and confidentiality of records; prohibiting \nnonessential duplication and re-disclosure of records within or outside \nan agency receiving information for a test; expanding encryption and \nelectronic signature technology to protect the confidentiality and \nintegrity of information; and doubling the penalty for willfully \nviolating the privacy act to $10,000. Existing computer matching and \nprivacy act laws will not be changed.\n  The act also expands on the present full due process rights of \nbeneficiaries, including all rights under the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act. The bill ensures that agencies administering federally \nfunded benefit programs adequately inform applicants applying for \nbenefits that their data can be shared to verify their eligibility for \nthose benefits. The agency will be required to maintain a record of \neach applicant's acknowledgment. In this way, agencies can encourage \nindividuals to provide accurate information when applying for benefits. \nMoreover, applicants will be given the opportunity to explain \ninconsistencies.\n  Finally, the Committee recognizes the importance of keeping the \nNational Directory of New Hires data secure and private. Consequently, \nthis legislation intends that any agency requesting access to the \nNational Directory of New Hires have the statutory authorization to \naccess the same kind of data from other data sources. Also, all data \nmatches with the New Hires database must occur under the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the agency who owns this information. This \nway, the government would be able to centralize all data matches at one \nlocation--where the data resides.\n  By using data-sharing technologies, agencies can deter and prevent \nfraud while becoming more accurate and efficient. This bill promotes \ndata-sharing tools which can save taxpayers substantial resources and \nat the same time encourage beneficiaries of government programs to deal \nhonestly with their government. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the International Maritime Satellite \nTelecommunications Act to ensure the continuing provision of certain \nglobal satellite safety services after the privatization of the \nbusiness operations of the International Mobile Satellite Organization, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n              international mobile satellite organization\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to authorize continued U.S. participation in the \nInternational Mobile Satellite Organization, currently known as \n``Inmarsat'', during and after its restructuring, scheduled to take \nplace April 1. The United States is currently a member of this \norganization, but its structure and functions are slated for \nsignificant reform. Rather than actually owning and operating mobile \nsatellite telecommunications facilities, the intergovernmental \ninstitution will retain the much more limited role of overseeing the \nprovision of global maritime distress and safety services, ensuring \nthat this important function is carried out properly and effectively \nunder contract. U.S. participation in the organization--which will keep \nthe same name but change its acronym to ``IMSO''--will not require a \nU.S. financial contribution and will not impose any new legal \nobligations upon the U.S. government. Privatization of Inmarsat's \ncommercial satellite business is an objective broadly shared by the \nlegislative and executive branches, American businesses, COMSAT, which \nis the U.S. signatory entity, and the international community.\n  To give some brief background, Inmarsat was established in 1979 to \nserve the global maritime industry by developing satellite \ncommunications for ship management and distress and safety \napplications. Over the past 19 years, Inmarsat has expanded both in \nterms of membership and mission. The intergovernmental organization now \ncounts 84 member countries and has expanded into land-mobile and \naeronautical communications.\n  Inmarsat's governing bodies, the Inmarsat Council and the Assembly of \nParties, recently reached an agreement to restructure the organization, \na move that has been strongly supported and encouraged by the United \nStates. This restructuring will shift Inmarsat's commercial activities \nout of the intergovernmental organization and into a broadly-owned \npublic corporation by next spring. The new corporation will acquire all \nof Inmarsat's operational assets, including its satellites, and will \nassume all of Inmarsat's operational functions. All that will remain of \nthe intergovernmental institution is a scaled-down secretariat with a \nsmall staff to ensure that the new corporation continues to meet \ncertain public service obligations, such as the Global Maritime \nDistress and Safety System (GMDSS). It is important to U.S. interests \nthat we participate in the oversight of this function, as well as that \nwe be fully represented in the organization throughout the process of \nprivatization.\n  The legislation I am introducing will enable a smooth transition to \nthe new structure. It contains two major provisions. First, it \nauthorizes the President to maintain U.S. membership in IMSO after \nrestructuring to ensure the continued provision of global maritime \ndistress and safety satellite communications services. Second, it \nrepeals those provisions of the International\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nMaritime Satellite Telecommunications Act that will be rendered \nobsolete by the restructuring of Inmarsat, including all those relating \nto COMSAT's role as the United States' signatory. The bill's provisions \nwill take effect on the date that Inmarsat transfers its commercial \noperations to the new corporation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nmeasure and ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make spending reductions to save taxpayers money; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n    Saving Taxpayers from obsolete programs and spending act of 1998\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I introduce the Saving \nTaxpayers from Obsolete Programs and Spending Act of 1998 also known as \nthe STOP Spending Act of 1998. This legislation cuts or eliminates over \n25 unnecessary federal programs and would save approximately $80 \nbillion over the next five years.\n  This legislation targets programs throughout the government--from the \nPentagon, to the Departments of Agriculture, Interior and Energy, to \nNASA. If this legislation were to be enacted, we would have a leaner, \nbetter, smarter government. Many of these programs, like the peanut \nquota program, are outdated relics of a different era. Others, like the \ncancellation of an unnecessary tactical aircraft program, just \nrepresent new thinking that more properly reflects a changing \ninternational security environment.\n  Mr. President, the federal government spends about $1.7 trillion each \nyear. Much of this is for important programs that provide health care \nto American families, Social Security and Medicare to senior citizens, \neducation for our kids, roads for our cars, security for our nation, \nhousing for families with modest incomes, protection for the \nenvironment, and research to advance our civilization. However, there \nalso is too much waste in government. And we must constantly reassess \nour spending priorities.\n  Many of the programs targeted in this legislation represent bad \npolicy and bad economics. The benefits go primarily to a narrow group \nof beneficiaries, while the costs are borne by consumers, taxpayers, \nand in some cases, the environment. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's sugar program is one example of a program which \ninterferes with the proper functioning of the marketplace at the \nexpense of consumers and the general public. This program guarantees \nU.S. sugar growers a price that is well above the world price of sugar \nand results in American consumers paying over $1 billion extra for \nsugar products each year. In addition, since the artificially high \nsugar prices that result from the sugar program encourages cultivation \nof marginal agricultural lands near the Florida Everglades, much \nenvironmental damage has been done as a result of increased pollution \nand runoff from these lands. Unfortunately, the benefits from this \nprogram primarily go to very few large and politically powerful \ncorporations, not small farmers.\n  This is but one example of the many wasteful and outdated programs \ncut or eliminated as part of this legislation. There are many more \nexamples which I will not detail at this time. However, the bottom line \nis that we can make our government more effective and save money at the \nsame time if we make the commitment to do so.\n  Mr. President, I understand that with the limited time remaining in \nthe 105th Congress, this legislation is not likely to be approved \nbefore the end of this session. And I realize that many of these \nproposals would face strong opposition. But I hope my colleagues will \nreview this legislation and support my efforts to reduce government \nspending in the future by cutting these outdated and wasteful programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the spending cuts \nincluded in this legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n

OELKE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof Kimbel E. Oelke, publisher of the Dundalk Eagle--a homespun and \npioneering publication committed to covering the local news stories \nthat directly affect the daily lives of the citizens of the greater \nDundalk area. Once sold for 10 cents to 500 subscribers and written \nentirely by Mr. Oelke at its founding in 1969, the Dundalk Eagle is now \ncirculated to 24,000 people by a staff of twenty.\n  Oelke's commitment to the community extended beyond his distribution \nof the newspaper to include his participation in the creation of the \nDundalk Library, the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, the Dundalk \nAssociation of Businesses and the Greater Dundalk Sports Hall of Fame.\n  From the age of seven when he first moved to Baltimore, Oelke had \njournalistic ambitions. I think all would agree that the realization of \nhis dream has not only enriched the lives of thousands of his readers, \nbut conveyed a sense of community too often missing in our modern era. \nKimbel Oelke's commitment to community journalism will leave a legacy \nof service for future generations both in and out of Dundalk.\n  I extend my most sincere sympathies to his wife Mary, their three \nsons and seven daughters, and to all the family and friends of Kimbel \nOelke. Mr. President, I ask that two articles celebrating Kimbel \nOelke's life be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                      [From the Sun, Aug. 4, 1998]\n\nKimbel E. Oelke, 80, Longtime Publisher of Dundalk Eagle and Community \n                                Booster\n\n                          (By Fred Rasmussen)\n\n       Kimbel E. Oelke, publisher of the Dundalk Eagle, died \n     Sunday of a heart attack while attending Mass at St. Rita \n     Roman Catholic Church in Dundalk. He was 80.\n       Mr. Oelke, a well-known figure in eastern Baltimore County, \n     was a seasoned newspaper reporter and editor when the \n     unthinkable happened one day.\n       He woke up one morning and noticed his name missing from \n     the mastheads of Dundalk's Community Press and the Eastern \n     Beacon, where he had worked for 31 years.\n       He had complained when the newspapers began expanding and \n     turning away from local news coverage, and the owner, \n     Stromberg Publications, demoted him to advertising manager of \n     the Essex Times, another of the chain's newspapers.\n       Disgruntled, he quit. He was in his early 50s and had a \n     wife and 11 children to support.\n       He and his wife took a gamble. They took their savings and \n     started their own newspaper.\n       The Dundalk Eagle, a tabloid, arrived on May 15, 1969. Its \n     slogan was ``Of The People, By The People, For The People.''\n       In a front-page editorial, Mr. Oelke wrote, ``I am firmly \n     convinced that there is a need for a paper in the greater \n     Dundalk area continually cognizant of the needs and desires \n     of the people and the local businesses.''\n       The paper sold for 10 cents a copy and subscriptions were \n     $1 a year. It has grown from 500 subscribers to a paid \n     circulation of 24,000 and a staff of 20.\n       For many years, Mr. Oelke wrote most of the newspaper copy \n     and was a familiar figure in courtrooms, police stations and \n     firehouses. Tipsters kept his phones ringing.\n       The paper was homespun and covered Dundalk and its environs \n     in great detail. Mr. Oelke's appetite for Dundalk minutiae \n     was insatiable.\n       One of the Mr. Oelke's space-saving tricks, which gave his \n     newspaper a particularly distinguishing if not unusual look, \n     was his use of ampersands--``&''--instead of the word ``and'' \n     in copy.\n       ``The Eagle is more family-like than at most places,'' said \n     Wayne Laufert, who was hired as a reporter in 1986 and was \n     named editor in 1996.\n       ``That's due to the personalities of Mr. and Mrs. O. Most \n     of us think of them as grandparents. They treated a group of \n     20 or more people to Christmas dinner every year and hosted \n     summer parties where we ate crabs and played softball.''\n       Mr. Laufert described Mr. Oelke as ``a very warm person'' \n     who had ``difficulty saying `no' to people. He was very \n     accommodating and it was one of his most endearing \n     qualities.''\n       Deborah I. Cornely of Dundalk, a daughter and the paper's \n     managing editor, said, ``He was the kind of man who was very \n     humble. He never bragged about his accomplishments, but most \n     of all tried to give everyone an even break.''\n       Deeply involved in the community, Mr. Oelke led the efforts \n     to establish the Dundalk Library, the Dundalk Chamber of \n     Commerce, the Dundalk Association of Businesses and the \n     Greater Dundalk Sports Hall of Fame.\n       Mr. Oelke, a soft-spoken man who had a penchant for green \n     eyeshades and big King Edward cigars, was born in Louisville, \n     Ky. When he was seven, his family moved to Dundalk, when his \n     father was transferred there by American Standard, the maker \n     of plumbing fixtures.\n       The 1935 graduate of Sparrows Point High School once \n     dreamed of becoming a major-league baseball player, but his \n     hitting failed him. In 1938, he became sports editor of the \n     Community Press.\n       ``When I was in high school, I had two ambitions: To be a \n     baseball player and to be a newsman,'' he told the Dundalk \n     Eagle on the newspaper's 25th anniversary.\n       After serving with the Navy in the Pacific during World War \n     II, he returned to the Press and was promoted to editor.\n       Studying at night, he earned a law degree from the \n     University of Baltimore Law School.\n       Services will be held at 8:30 p.m. today at the Duda-Ruck \n     Funeral Home of Dundalk, 7922 Wise Ave.\n       He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Georgina \n     Jarboe, whom he married in 1946; three sons, Timothy Oelke of \n     New Freedom, Pa., James A. Oelke of Corpus Christi and Andrew \n     P. Oelke of Seattle; seven other daughters, Kim E. Boone of \n     Dundalk, Barbara E. Oelke of Monkton, Elizabeth A. Oelke of \n     Fawn Grove, Pa., Mary Jane Oelke of White Marsh, Suzanne C. \n     Oelke of Seattle, Amy K. Christensen of Upperco and Kerry A. \n     Raszewski of Monkton; a sister, Virginia Becker of Dundalk; \n     16 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Dundalk Eagle, Aug. 13, 1998]\n\n            Family, Friends Bid Last Goodbye to Kimbel Oelke\n\n                        (By Terri Narrell Mause)\n\n       The St. Rita Catholic Church parish priest explained that \n     God has a purpose for each person's life, and praised Kimbel \n     Oelke for fulfilling what he was ``called to do.''\n       But it was three of Oelke's daughters who painted the most \n     vivid picture of the newspaper publisher during the Mass of \n     Christian burial for their father Aug. 5. The Mass was led by \n     the Rev. William Remmel of St. Rita's, assisted by the Rev. \n     Joseph Cornely, who works with Trinity Missions in \n     California, and Deacon Albert Chesnavage.\n       Oelke, the founder and publisher of The Dundalk Eagle, died \n     Aug. 2 while attending St. Rita's with his wife. He was 80 \n     years old.\n       In emotional and eloquent testimonials, the three women \n     recalled their father as a man devoted to his family and \n     dedicated to bringing out the best in others.\n       Deborah Cornely, Oelke's second daughter and managing \n     editor of The Eagle, told the story of how her father taught \n     her to ride a bike.\n       Oelke transformed the bicycle into a simulated airplane, \n     complete with painted wings and a tail, finishing it the \n     evening before the then-4-year-old was to ride it in \n     Dundalk's 4th of July parade.\n       ``The only problem was that I'd never ridden a two-wheeler \n     before,'' Cornely said in her eulogy.\n       So on that evening, her father removed the training wheels \n     from the bike, steadied it as she climbed aboard and assured \n     her she could do it.\n       After she had ridden some distance, confident her father \n     was still holding on, she looked back to see him, ``standing \n     all smiles & applause, way back at my point of departure.''\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\n       ``He'd sent me off alone, and through his encouragement, \n     his insistence that I was up to the task, I'd accomplished \n     something on my own that I didn't think I could do,'' Cornely \n     said. ``That was one of the first of many cherished memories \n     I have of my father helping me overcome my fears & succeed in \n     life.''\n       The next day, the newly trained bicyclist collected a blue \n     ribbon for the bicycle division from then-Gov. Theodore \n     McKeldin.\n       Elizabeth Oelke, her parents' fifth child, next recited the \n     publisher's favorite poem, William Henley's Invictus, as she \n     remembered her father as a journalistic poet, an ``adman'' \n     who appreciated the power and beauty of language.\n       The poem was one Oelke knew by heart and recited with \n     ``precision, gusto and conviction,'' applying it to his own \n     life and encouraging his family to do the same, Elizabeth \n     Oelke told the mourners at St. Rita's.\n       ``I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my \n     soul,'' she said, reciting the final lines of the poem. ``And \n     if that was the only think my father had given me, that would \n     have been enough. But he gave us so much more.''\n       In a final family tribute, Amy Oelke, the ninth of her \n     parents' 11 children, remembered how her father fostered \n     independence and self-confidence in his children with \n     encouragement and praise. She specifically recalled his use \n     of the word ``best.''\n       ``Every Thanksgiving, we had the best turkey we'd ever \n     had,'' she said. ``Mom was the best woman in the world. And \n     he always made us all feel like the best. But he never acted \n     like he or his family was better than anyone else.\n       ``I was blessed--and we all were--with the best father.''\n\n\n                            final farewells\n\n       After the service, family members and friends joined a \n     procession down Merritt Boulevard to Sacred Heart of Jesus \n     Cemetery of German Hill Road.\n       Under a sunny, clear sky with a soft breeze accompanying \n     the priest's brief words of comfort, several of Oelke's \n     friends took one last opportunity to remember the man.\n       Some remembered his love of golf.\n       ``He'll be playing that big golf course in heaven,'' said \n     former Baltimore County councilman Don Mason of Eastwood.\n       Oelke's son-in-law Donald Cornely (a nephew of the priest \n     who assisted in the service) pulled from his pocket a handful \n     of orange golf tees imprinted with ``The Dundalk Eagle, \n     Published Weekly, Read Daily,'' and told about golfing with \n     the publisher.\n       ``The first time he took me golfing--he was a very patient \n     man, because I'm not very good at the game--he handed me a \n     couple of these,'' Cornely recalled. ``After teeing off the \n     first time, I started to pick up the tee, but he wouldn't let \n     me. He told me to leave it there, and he took some more from \n     his pocket, leaving them across the course as we walked.\n       ``He knew other golfers would pick up the tees to use \n     themselves, and The Eagle would get publicity. He did that \n     wherever we played--New York, Pennsylvania and other states--\n     no matter how far away we were from Dundalk.''\n       Oelke was buried in his golf shoes with his favorite putter \n     lying along-side him.\n       Others attending the graveside service recalled his \n     contributions to the community and his passion for community \n     news.\n       Kenneth C. Coldwell Sr., publisher of the Avenue \n     newspapers, said Oelke encouraged and helped him when he \n     first entered the newspaper business 25 years ago.\n       ``He was a great guy and a great friend,'' Coldwell said at \n     the graveside service Aug. 5. ``Community newspapers \n     throughout the world should take a chapter from him, because \n     he knew how to run a community newspaper.\n       ``He would look you in the eye, shake your hand with a firm \n     handshake and say, `Good luck.' That's how I want to remember \n     him.''\n       Mason first met Oelke when he organized a group that tried \n     to pinpoint and expose excessive government spending. Oelke, \n     Mason says, always supported the group by printing its \n     findings in The Eagle.\n       ``I recognize--and I'm sure a lot of people will \n     recognize--that an institution has passed on,'' Mason said. \n     ``I'm sure when St. Peter meets and interviews Mr. Oelke, \n     he'll appoint him editor-in-chief of heaven's weekly.''\n\n\n     working for oelke meant covering police beat, painting office\n\n       The following was written by Gaitherburg resident Stuart \n     Gorin, who got his start in newspapers as a 14-year-old hired \n     by Kilmel Oelke, the Eagle founder who died Aug. 2.\n       As a writer with the U.S. Information Agency focusing on \n     aspects of U.S. foreign policy, I am a long way from Dundalk, \n     Md., where many years ago Kimbel Oelke gave me my start in \n     journalism.\n       He was a customer in my late father's store, the old \n     Stansbury Food Center, where I was a 14-year-old reluctantly \n     helping out while dreaming of becoming a newspaper reporter. \n     Scoop--he was always Scoop to me, never Mr. Oelke--nearly \n     bowled me over when, after murmured conversations with my \n     parents, he offered me a summer job as a cub reporter for The \n     Community Press and Baltimore Countian in 1953 for the \n     princely sum of $6 a week.\n       Scoop took me under his wing and taught me how to be a \n     reporter: how to write in newspaper style, how to ask \n     questions, how to be fair. When a citizen has a complaint \n     against the city council, write it, he said, but be sure to \n     get the council's side in the story, too.\n       It wasn't always easy, but it sure was exciting. When he \n     gave me my first byline, on a story about the family of a \n     little boy in a coma, I felt on top of the world.\n       Part of my job, Scoop said, was to cover the police beat. \n     We went to the police station, where he introduced me to the \n     desk sergeant. Every day I would gather material from the \n     police blotter for stories, and I thought I was becoming a \n     seasoned professional. But the next week, a new officer \n     was on the desk, and when I explained my mission he \n     brushed me aside and told me to go home to my mother. \n     Crushed, I trudged back to the office and informed Scoop, \n     who roared with laughter and then took me back to the \n     station and smilingly declared that yes, I really was his \n     reporter and needed to see the blotter.\n       But that embarrassment was nothing compared to what Scoop \n     put me through for an interview with the winner of a local \n     beauty pageant. Get all of the details, and don't forget her \n     measurements, he admonished. Back in the 1950s, this was \n     considered routine, but not for a red-faced 14-year-old who \n     had to approach a ``grownup'' 18-year-old. What I finally \n     decided to do was type out a list of questions for her, \n     asking her the vital statistics in the middle of the list. I \n     rang her doorbell, identified myself as a reporter for the \n     Community Press, handed her the list, and asked her to please \n     fill it out. When I admitted to Scoop how I obtained the \n     information, he again roared with laughter.\n       One time he didn't laugh. He needed the newspaper office \n     painted, and I said I could do it on a Saturday morning. Of \n     course I knew how, I said. I had completed half of the \n     ceiling in blotchy streaks with drops on the floor and the \n     desks when he came in, shook his head, took the paintbrush \n     out of my hand and sat me down in front of a typewriter \n     instead, saying this was where I belonged. A professional \n     painter finished the job right, and I haven't held a \n     paintbrush in my hand since.\n       Early on, Scoop showed me one of the benefits of being a \n     reporter. It was the first year that the Baltimore Orioles \n     were in the major leagues, and we went to a couple of games \n     using our press passes.\n       During my high school year between the two summers I worked \n     for Scoop, I attended Saturday matinees at the old Hilltop \n     Theater in Baltimore, where big-name stars came weekly for \n     live productions. Each week I would interview the star and \n     write a column on the theater's activities that Scoop ran in \n     The Community Press.\n       Then, after I finished college and was drafted, the Army \n     sent me back to Dundalk to Fort Holabird in 1962. When I \n     stopped in to say hello, Scoop told me that his night court \n     reporter had just left, and if I wanted the job for old \n     time's sake it was mine. So while I was a soldier, every \n     Monday night I would cover the court session and leave my \n     stories in the office for him to pick up the next day.\n       There were occasional phone calls after that assignment, \n     but years passed before I saw Scoop again. Helen Delich \n     Bentley was still in Congress and running for re-election in \n     1986, and I came to Dundalk during one of her campaign stops \n     to write an article. I got together with Scoop for lunch and \n     we had a wonderful afternoon reminiscing. Regrettably, that \n     was the last time I saw him.\n       Besides writing for USIA, I've worked for newspapers and \n     wire services not only in the United States but also in \n     Europe and Asia. It's been a satisfying career that all \n     started with the Dundalk Community Press. Thanks, Scoop. I'm \n     going to miss you.\n\n\n               letter writers recall founder of ``eagle''\n\n       Condolences sent to The Eagle upon the death of the paper's \n     founder, Kimbel Oelke, included the following letters:\n       Kimbel Oelke contributed more to our community than most of \n     us know. His tenacity and vision gave Dundalk a weekly \n     reminder of who we are as individuals and as a community. His \n     paper is our family album. His legacy is our deep sense of \n     community. His life is our measure of what it means to be a \n     good man.\n       Kimbel, I am certain you are reading this from heaven. You \n     left an undeniable and meaningful mark on Dundalk and on so \n     many of us who had the fortune of knowing you.--Michael \n     Galiazzo, Rainflower Path, Sparks, Md.\n       We at Sparrows Point send our deepest sympathy to all of \n     you upon the death of Mr. Oelke. He was a universal citizen, \n     a true friend of businesses and the community.\n       We recall his unconditional support of Bethlehem Steel and \n     his wholehearted, selfless help in a grassroots campaign \n     against steel imports. His help was crucially needed at a \n     critical time in our history, and he came through with flying \n     colors.\n       There were many other times when his advice, counsel and \n     friendship were sought, and he was there for us, as he was \n     for everyone in the community. He will be missed by all whose \n     lives he touched.--The letter was signed by Sparrows Point \n     Division president Duane R. Dunham and 15 other company \n     officials.\n       As always, Baltimore Sun reporter Fred Rasmussen had \n     outdone himself in his magnificent obituary of a truly great \n     man, the late Kimbel E. Oelke of Dundalk, founder and \n     publisher of The Eagle.\n       That having been said, nevertheless, Mr. Rasmussen \n     overlooked or did not know some\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\n     remarkable events about this man's epic saga of life which I \n     was present to witness by virtue of my relation to both him \n     and his community.\n       I first me him in 1974 while handling public relations for \n     Patrick T. Welsh's House of Delegates campaign and later, in \n     1978, for the same man's state Senate campaign. Today, Mr. \n     Welsh is President of The Eastern Baltimore Area Chamber of \n     Commerce. None of his successes would have happened without \n     the fair coverage of Mr. Oelke and The Eagle--and the same is \n     true of every other candidate for public office from that \n     time to this.\n       In 1984, when I worked at Dundalk Community College and the \n     entire collegiate community harnessed its abilities and \n     energies to re-employ area residents, Mr. Oelke was there as \n     well, and when I had occasion to run for the office of \n     Congress of the United States in 1982, 1984 and 1988, I got a \n     fair hearing from him each and every time.\n       Thus, he was, is and remains my ideal of what a newspaper \n     publisher should be: fair, faithful and true. I am not \n     surprised that he died in church in the arms of the Lord and \n     the family that loved him. I, too, shall miss him.--Blaine \n     Taylor, Joppa Road, Towson.\n       Please accept our most sincere wishes regarding Mr. Oelke's \n     death. Hopefully his family, friends, and the staff at The \n     Eagle are doing well.\n       I am new to the Baltimore area, so I obviously have no \n     previous knowledge of Mr. Oelke and the paper. However, your \n     staff should know that his story and the related story of the \n     newspaper is a great one. He sounds like he was a good person \n     with his head and heart in the right place. It is great when \n     the good guys win!\n       Anyway, just know that I was personally moved by learning \n     about Mr. Oelke's life.

MCGINTY FOR HIS LIFE LONG CAREER \n                            IN THE AIR FORCE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, over the last 33 years, Lt Gen \nMichael D. McGinty has served as an exemplary Air Force officer. His \ncareer-long efforts to provide quality support to all the members of \nthe Air Force and their families serve as a benchmark for other \nmilitary services and leave a lasting and positive legacy of Air Force \npersonnel policy and practice.\n  Lt Gen Mike McGinty entered the Air Force as a distinguished graduate \nof the University of Minnesota Reserve Officer Training Corps program. \nIn his early days as an Air Force pilot, Lt Gen McGinty flew the F-4 \nand logged over 115 combat missions in Southeast Asia, including 100 \nmissions over North Vietnam.\n  As his Air Force career progressed, Lt Gen McGinty gained vast \nexperience both as an pilot and as a personnel expert. He earned the \nrating of Command Pilot with more than 3,500 flight hours in a variety \nof aircraft, including the F-4, A-10, C-21 and T-39. He also invested \n19 years of his career working a broad range of Air Force personnel \nissues.\n  In March 1988, Mike McGinty assumed command of the 10th Tactical \nFighter Wing at the Royal Air Force Station in Alconbury, England. \nDuring a time of great change in world affairs, Lt Gen McGinty worked \ndiligently to maintain and solidify local host nation relations while \nsimultaneously enhancing quality of life support for service members \nassigned to his command. As a result of Lt Gen McGinty's vision and \ndedication to his troops he established Alconbury's first-ever Family \nSupport Center.\n  As commander of the Air Force Military Personnel Center, and more \nrecently as the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Lt Gen \nMcGinty led the Air Force through a period of great challenge and \nchange. During his tenure, Mike moved Air Force personnel systems into \nthe ``electronic era.'' He expertly managed significant drawdowns of \nboth military and civilian personnel while simultaneously meeting the \nexpanded personnel requirements resulting from increased deployments. A \nconstant advocate for Air Force people, he led the way in working \ndifficult issues in the rated force management, recruiting, retention, \nand transition assistance arenas. Lt Gen McGinty worked to meet \nchanging Air Force needs by expanding the role of Department of the Air \nForce civilians in Air Force personnel management. He increased career \nbroadening opportunities for Air Force civilians through developmental \npositions at the Air Staff, the Air Force Personnel Center, and major \ncommand headquarters. He established the first-ever Air Force Civilian \nExecutive Matters Office, introducing policies and operations that \nensure training and development of senior civilians that parallels \ntheir military counterparts. His efforts in this arena clearly enhance \nforce stability.\n  Most importantly, Lt Gen McGinty's career has been based on his \nunfaltering support of Air Force people. His philosophy has been that \n``the strength of the Air Force lies in it's members.'' He remains a \nstrong advocate for ongoing quality of life initiatives, enhanced \nfamily support services, career mentoring, and leadership by example.\n  I have personally known Mike McGinty for several years as both a \ncolleague and a friend. We have worked together to improve our nation's \nAir Force by addressing the critical people issues we face: retaining \nour key qualified and experienced Air Force professionals, improving \nthe quality of life for our families, enhancing our recruiting efforts, \nand placing our pay and benefits programs where they should be to take \ncare of those who guard and defend our nation. Mike has led the way in \nthis effort, a performance characteristic of his entire career. The men \nand women of the Air Force, as well as our entire nation, owe him a \ndebt of gratitude. I recall his candor and wisdom during testimony as a \nshining example of how well our military leaders represent the best \ninterests of our men and women in uniform.\n  Also a dedicated family man, Mike and his wife, Karen, are the proud \nparents of a daughter, Shannon, and a son, Tim. In addition to flying, \ntheir interests include bird watching and photography.\n  During his distinguished career, the general has earned some of our \nnation's highest honors: the Distinguished Service Medal twice, the \nLegion of Merit twice, the Distinguished Flying Cross with device, the \nMeritorious Service Medal four times, and the Air Medal ten times, \nalong with the Air Force Commendation Medal and numerous campaign and \nservice medals.\n  Lt Gen Mike McGinty's vision, leadership and dedication will have a \nlasting positive impact on the Air Force and the nation. As he embarks \nupon his retirement, I wish him continued success in all that he and \nKaren pursue. Those of us in Congress, and the men and women of our Air \nForce, will greatly miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11799-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REMOVING HOLD ON H.R. 2610, A BILL TO REAUTHORIZE THE OFFICE OF \n                      NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a remarkable example of community commitment taking place \nin my home state of Michigan this fall, the United Way Torch Drive. \nThis year will mark the 50th United Way Torch Drive in metropolitan \nDetroit.\n  The Torch Drive was officially kicked off in 1949 by General Mark \nClark with a goal of raising $8,550,000. Many people doubted that this \ngoal could be reached. During that period of time, similar fundraising \ncampaigns in other cities were falling short of their goals. However, \nthe people of the Detroit area proved the skeptics wrong, contributing \nalmost $9.3 million to the Torch Drive in three weeks. The metropolitan \nDetroit Torch Drive was the first such drive in the country, and its \nsuccess has been a model for cities throughout the country.\n  The Detroit Torch Drive has been helped by local and nationally \nrecognized Americans from every walk of life. Business leaders like Max \nFisher and Lee Iacocca have lent their time and talents to the Drive. \nEntertainers like Jackie Gleason, Audrey Hepburn and the Supremes have \ndonated time as\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nwell. National and local media stars, from Walter Cronkite to J.P. \nMcCarthy have made themselves available to help. And sports stars, from \nHockey Hall of Fame player Gordie Howe to current Detroit Pistons star \nGrant Hill, pitch in as needed. But as impressive as this list of \nfamous people is, United Way representatives will tell you that it is \nthe dedication and heart of the people of metropolitan Detroit which \nmake the Torch Drive a success year after year. Thanks to them, the \nUnited Way is able to support more than 130 agencies in metropolitan \nDetroit, providing assistance to people in need and solutions to long \nterm problems like homelessness, substance abuse, hunger and mental \nillness.\n  Mr. President, I have many reasons to be proud to be a Detroiter. One \nof the strongest reasons for my pride is the generosity and warm-\nheartedness of my neighbors. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nthanking the tens of thousands of people who have made the annual \nUnited Way Torch Drive such an overwhelming success over the past 50 \nyears, and in looking forward to the next 50 years of giving help and \nhope to people in need in metropolitan Detroit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11799-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11800-S11801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF MEG DONOVAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Thursday, Meg Donovan, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, passed away after \na painful struggle with cancer. Her death, far too early at age 47, has \ndimmed the light for all those who loved and knew her: her husband, \nStephen Duffy, her three children Colin, Liam and Emma, her father, \nDaniel Donovan, her sisters, Paula and Mary Ellen, her brother, \nPatrick, and her many friends and colleagues in Washington.\n  Meg was a Washington veteran, having worked in the nongovernmental \naffair community for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, in the \nCongress for nearly twenty years, and most recently in the Department \nof State. Through all those years she has consistently been an advocate \nfor the downtrodden, for those who live in countries where the basic \nhuman rights and freedoms which we take for granted are denied. They \ncould have had no better champion than Meg Donovan.\n  Meg was invaluable to me and my staff during the years that I served \nas Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, which had \njurisdiction over the authorization bill for the State Department, USIA \nand the international broadcasting agencies. When we needed \ninformation, she ensured that we got it. She was an articulate advocate \nfor the Administration's positions and an effective deal maker when the \ntime was right. And as Secretary of State Albright, former Secretary of \nState Christopher, and all those who have been confirmed as Ambassadors \nduring the Clinton Administration's tenure will tell you, Meg Donovan \nknew better than anyone how to help a nominee navigate the shoals of \nthe confirmation process in the Senate.\n  On Saturday, Secretary Albright delivered the eulogy at Meg's \nfuneral. Her heartfelt words aptly captured the many sides of Meg \nDonovan--a devoted wife and mother, a dedicated and passionate \ngovernment servant, and a woman whose zest for life was boundless.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my \nsincere sympathies to Meg's family. I also ask that Secretary \nAlbright's eulogy for Meg be printed in the Record.\n\n                         Eulogy for Meg Donovan\n\n                By Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\n\n       Father D'Silva; Duffy, Colin, Emma, Liam, Mr. Daniel \n     Donovan, Patrick, Paula, Mary Ellen, and other members of Meg \n     Donovan's family; colleagues, friends and acquaintances of \n     Meg:\n       There are times when it seems more fitting just to stammer \n     with emotion than to speak with finely turned phrases.\n       It does not seem fair; it is not fair that Heaven, which \n     already has so much, now has so much more. And that we here \n     on Earth, who need so much, have lost someone who is \n     irreplaceable in our hearts.\n       This we know. Meg could not pass from one world to the \n     other without changing both.\n       We are crushed with grief. But the scriptures say that \n     those who mourn are blessed for they shall be comforted; and \n     we are comforted by the knowledge that, somewhere up above, \n     God is getting an earful on human rights.\n       I did not become acquainted with Meg Donovan until I went \n     to the State Department in 1993. Like her, I was a mother of \n     three, including twins. I felt I understood better than some \n     others might the choices and challenges she faced. But many \n     of you knew her longer and more intimately than I. I cannot \n     capture her personality or her career in full.\n       To me, if there is one word that sums up Meg, it is \n     ``completeness.''\n       There are others in this town who are smart and good at \n     their jobs; others with a commitment to causes that are right \n     and just; others who bargain shrewdly and hard; others with a \n     warm and wonderful sense of humor; others who understand the \n     obligations of friendship; others who are devoted and loving \n     to their families; others who have the discipline to live \n     their faith.\n       There may even be others with Christmas sweaters that light \n     up and play jingle bells. But rarely have the elements of \n     true character been so artfully mixed as they were in Meg \n     Donovan. Van Gogh is arriving in Washington; but a human \n     masterpiece is gone.\n       When I was designated by President Clinton to serve as \n     Secretary of State, I did what my predecessor, Warren \n     Christopher, did. I turned to the person with the best \n     instincts in Washington on how to deal with our friends on \n     Capitol Hill. That was Meg. We began preparing in December.\n       Now, naturally, I thought the President had made a \n     brilliant choice for the job, but I had to wonder, as we went \n     along in practice, and Meg corrected and improved upon my \n     every answer on every subject, whether there was anyone more \n     qualified to be Secretary of State than she.\n       Of course, that being December, the birthday of the twins \n     came along. And naturally, Liam and Emma didn't understand \n     why their mother couldn't promise to attend the party. Their \n     proposal, passed on and advocated by Meg, was that we adjourn \n     our practice session and re-convene at Chuck E. Cheese. It is \n     typical that, when the hour of the party drew near, Meg \n     excused herself, and did not ask but told her new boss, that \n     she was heading for Chuck E. Cheese.\n       When he was Secretary of State, George Marshall used to \n     tell his staff ``don't fight the problem, decide it, then \n     take action.'' I suspect he would have liked Meg a lot \n     because, all her life, Meg was a doer.\n       Like quite a few others, she came to Washington committed \n     to the fight for tolerance and respect for basic human rights \n     for all people. What set her apart is that she could still \n     make that claim after having worked here 25 years.\n       Whether at the Helsinki Commission, or the House Committee \n     on International Relations, or the Department of State, Meg \n     was one of the good guys. She could out-talk anyone, but talk \n     isn't what she was after. She wanted change.\n       She wanted Soviet Jews to be able to exercise their right \n     to emigrate. She wanted Tibetans to be able to preserve their \n     heritage. She wanted prisoners of conscience to breathe the \n     air of freedom. She wanted women to have the power to make \n     choices that would determine the course of their lives.\n       Above all, she wanted to draw on and draw out the best in \n     America: the America that would use its resources and power \n     to help others achieve the blessings we all too often take \n     for granted.\n       These were her ideals, but Meg was more than a dreamer. No \n     one was more effective than she at creating the coalitions, \n     marshaling the arguments and devising the strategies that \n     would yield concrete results.\n       One of Meg's big problems was that she knew the system \n     better and played it better than anyone else. So, whenever we \n     found ourselves in a real legislative mess, which was not \n     more than three or four times a week, we turned to Meg to \n     help get us out.\n       Around the Department and earlier in her years on Capitol \n     Hill, Meg's energy and wisdom added sparkle to every meeting. \n     When she spoke, people listened. When she listened, people \n     chose their words with care. She was thoughtful and patient \n     with those who, by virtue of experience or ability, needed \n     her help. She brought out the best in others; just as she \n     demanded the best from herself.\n       In our collective mind's eye, we can still see her striding \n     purposefully down a hall with her arms full of folders, \n     trailed by some hapless Ambassadorial nominee whose future \n     had been entrusted to Meg's capable hands.\n       We see her, hugely pregnant, maneuvering around swivel \n     chairs and outthrust elbows on the cramped dais of the House \n     International Relations Committee.\n       We see her serious and firm, forearms chopping the air for \n     emphasis, persuading us with eloquence and passion that doing \n     the right thing is also the smart thing.\n       We see her relaxing at an office party, gold bracelets \n     flashing, surrounded by flowers from her garden, a cherub's \n     face aglow with health and life, and her 100 megawatt smile \n     turned on full.\n       We see her where she most belonged, with Duffy, her partner \n     of 24 years, and with their children.\n       And as we see her, we also hear that inimitable laugh, \n     which was not exactly musical, but which conveyed a love and \n     enjoyment of living that somehow makes what happened even \n     harder to believe and accept.\n       Meg knew the impermanence of life. She lost her mother to \n     cancer and a sister to cystic fibrosis. So she made the most \n     of every single day.\n       The poet, William Blake, wrote that:\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\n       He who binds himself to a joy\n       Does the winged life destroy\n       But he who kisses the joy as it flies\n       Lives in eternity's sunrise.\n       No force, not even life itself, could bind Meg Donovan or \n     ground her flight. She was only 47. But, in that time, her \n     gifts to those of us who are gathered here and to those from \n     around the world who have benefited directly or indirectly \n     from her commitment, were full and rich.\n       This morning, as she looks down upon us, I know that she \n     would expect us to cry and that, if she could, she would \n     herself hand us the tissues. But she would also want us to be \n     thankful for our time together, and to dedicate ourselves to \n     improving our own lives by helping others.\n       We are sad today, but our sorrow is accompanied by the \n     abundance of joy in the memories we share, the life we \n     celebrate and the love that surrounds us.\n       May that joy melt, over time, the clouds of our grief. May \n     Meg's family, especially, draw comfort from our affection and \n     from the deep respect we held for her.\n       And may Meg Donovan rest in peace, for we will never, never \n     forget her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11800-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA INTERNS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a true \nurban innovator, a woman who has devoted her ``retirement'' years to \nsolving the many challenges that confront urban communities across the \nnation, Ms. Evelyn Dukes.\n  The urban community of northeastern Detroit has greatly benefitted \nfrom the work of Ms. Evelyn Dukes. Her involvement with urban and \nneighborhood renewal began with the ``Adopt-A-Park'' program. In her \nneighborhood, Ms. Dukes daily observed gangs, drug users, and loiterers \nfrequenting a parcel of land that was formerly a small community park, \nbut had become a symbol of fear and apathy. Fortunately, Ms. Dukes did \nnot view Brookins Park in the same manner. As an organizer for numerous \nBlock Clubs and Neighborhood Watch Groups, Ms. Dukes saw the area as an \nopportunity to bring the community together and reclaim a vital \nrecreational park. By calling on organizations from the city's Park and \nRecreation Department to the Detroit Piston Basketball Organization, \nMs. Dukes' vision for Brookins Park became a reality. Today the land is \nused by community residents for picnics, reunions, and birthday \nparties, and Ms. Dukes is on to her next project, Skinner Park.\n  Ms. Dukes is also involved in her neighborhood organization and is an \nactive member in the Citizen Band Radio Patrol organization. While on \npatrol, she documents dangerous situations and possible criminal \nactions. Evelyn is President of the Ninth Precinct Community Relations \nBoard and is very involved in the City Wide Roundtable, an organization \nof Detroit leaders who meet on a regular basis to discuss issues and \nsolutions involving public service, safety, and awareness.\n  At 73, Evelyn Dukes' personal commitment to her neighborhood and city \nare an inspiration to everyone. She is truly a model for community \ninvolvement, and her efforts and achievements clearly set Ms. Dukes \napart as an exemplary citizen. She has been honored by being selected \nas only one of seven people in the country to receive the National \nCrime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime \nPrevention.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Evelyn Dukes on \nreceiving this award and thanking her for the stalwart dedication she \nhas shown to improving her community.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11801-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n                           ANTI-NEPOTISM BILL\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1892, the \njudicial anti-nepotism bill.\n  Section 458 of 28 U.S.C. reads: ``No person shall be appointed to or \nemployed in any office or duty in any court who is related by affinity \nor consanguinity within the degree of first cousin to any justice or \njudge of such court.'' There is some debate about the interpretation of \nsection 458. Some hold the view that the statute means what it says--no \nperson related to a judge of a court may be appointed to that same \ncourt. But some hold a contrary view. Indeed, in a 1995 memo by Richard \nShiffrin of the Office of Legal Counsel, although the OLC conceded that \nthe statutory language appears to restrict presidential appointments to \noffices or duties In federal courts, the OLC argued that the statute \nonly applies to judges hiring or appointing persons to the courts. Many \nscholars disagree with this view and with the other memoranda issued by \nthe Administration. Finally, there is also disagreement as to whether \nsection 458 applies to appointments where a judge has taken senior \nstatus is a ``judge of such court.''\n  For future judicial nominees, the Administration and the Senate must \nunderstand the criteria required for Article III judicial appointments. \nS. 1892 maintains the current prohibition on relatives of judges being \nappointed to or employed in any job of the court, such as for example, \npositions as clerks and bailiffs.\n  S. 1892 amends 28 U.S.C. 458 to clarify that no person may be \nappointed to be a judge of a court if that person is related within the \ndegree of first cousin to any judge, including a judge retired in \nsenior status of that ``same court.'' Under the bill, ``same court'' \nmeans, in the case of a district court, any court of the same single \njudicial district; and, in the case of a court of appeals, the court of \nappeals of a single judicial district.\n  For example, a person may not be a member of the Federal District \nCourt in Arizona if a related person is already a member of the Federal \nDistrict Court in Arizona, but related persons may serve simultaneously \non federal district courts in Arizona and New Mexico. Additionally, \nrelated persons may serve simultaneously on the Northern and Eastern \nFederal District Courts in California. A person may not be a member of \nthe 2nd Circuit if a related person is a member of that circuit, but \nrelated persons may serve on the 2nd and the 7th Circuits \nsimultaneously.\n  It is important to Note that this act does not apply to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The act takes effect on the date of enactment and applies only to an \nindividual whose nomination is submitted to the Senate on or after such \ndate. Thus, the bill would not affect the nomination of William \nFletcher.\n  A thorough study of the constitutional provisions at issue, of the \nrelevant case law, and of prominent legal treatises makes it clear that \nthe bill is constitutional. Indeed, a March 31, 1998 report on the bill \nby the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has \nconcluded that ``[a]fter consideration of the text of the Constitution, \nthe precedents, and the historical practice, we believe it to be \nestablished that Congress has the authority to fix this and other \nqualifications for the office of judges of Article III courts. . . .'' \nThe Constitution is, in fact, silent on what lower courts there were to \nbe, their composition and jurisdiction, and their powers. Inasmuch as \nthe Constitution ``delineated only the great outlines of the judicial \npower . . ., leaving the details to Congress, . . . ``[t]he \ndistribution and appropriate exercise of the judicial power must . . . \nbe made by laws passed by Congress. . . .'' Rhode Island v. \nMassachusetts, 12 Pet. (37 U.S.) 657, 721 (1838).\n  The public policy behind Section 458 and S. 1892 is clear: For the \npublic to maintain a sufficient level of confidence in the integrity \nand impartiality of its public institutions, those institutions must \nstrive not only to avoid circumstances in which actual impropriety \ncould arise among public servants, but to avoid all circumstances that \ncreate even the remote appearance of impropriety. Having close family \nmembers serve on the same court would create an appearance of \nimpropriety. Of all the relationships that one judge could have to \nanother--for example, former law partners or members of the same bench \nfor 20 years--a familial relationship is one that is certain to \nautomatically cause a litigant to question the impartiality of a judge.\n  Litigants must have complete confidence that federal judges will be \nobjective and impartial while on the bench. The institutional integrity \nof Federal courts requires scrupulous protection of public confidence \nin the judicial process. Preventing close family members from serving \non the same court is a small price to pay to avoid a potential \ndiminution of credibility and impartiality of the Judiciary, one of the \nNation's most hallowed institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11802-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J. WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \ninvaluable member of my staff, Mike Williams, who has served as my \nMilitary Legislative Assistant since I arrived in the Senate in January \n1997. Mike joined my staff after serving a great American and one of \nGeorgia's most honored and beloved Senators, Senator Sam Nunn, where he \nbegan as an intern while attending Georgia Tech and after graduation \nquickly became involved in legislative matters, including military \nissues. After more than five years of public service, Mike will be \nleaving my staff after the 105th Congress adjourns to pursue other \ncareer opportunities. He will be sorely missed and not easily replaced.\n  Mike's excellent assistance and invaluable experience made my \ntransition from being Georgia's Secretary of State to a United States \nSenator and a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee smooth \nand successful. He serves as a positive example to us all--a good \nperson who is committed to his family and to continually improving \nhimself. While working full-time for Senator Nunn and then myself, Mike \nhas attended law school in the evening while still finding quality time \nto devote to his lovely wife Allyson and their beautiful daughter \nCatherine. Now in his final year of law school at Georgetown, Mike has \ndecided to leave Capitol Hill to pursue a career in the law profession. \nI wish him well in all of his future endeavors and I know that he will \nhave a lifetime of many more accomplishments and shining moments. \nAlthough Mike's invaluable contribution to my staff will be greatly \nmissed, his daily presence in our lives will be missed even more. Mike, \nthank you for your years of service to me and the people of the great \nState of Georgia--I am very proud of all you do. You truly are a great \nAmerican!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11802-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11802-S11803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NOTICE OF INTENTION TO MOVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood friend of mine and a great leader in my home state of Michigan, \nBruno Nowicki. On October 11, 1998, Bruno's friends and family will \nhelp him celebrate his 90th birthday at a celebration at the Polish \nCentury Club.\n  Bruno Nowicki is well known in Michigan and in his native Poland for \nhis efforts to commemorate and celebrate the contributions of Polish \npeople to the United States and to the world. He has designed monuments \nto Polish-American heroes of World War II and Vietnam and to \nRevolutionary War Generals Pulaski and Kosciuszko. Bruno Nowicki has \nalso been a strong supporter of public libraries, and served on the \nBoard of Governors of the Detroit Public Library from 1971 until 1994. \nHe melded his interests in promoting Polish culture and supporting \npublic libraries by arranging for statues, mosaics and busts of \nprominent figures in Poland's history to be displayed in the Detroit \nMain Library and the Hamtramck Public Library. Bruno worked with artist \nZygmunt Dousa of the University of Krakow to design the Polish Room of \nthe Ethnic Conference and Study Center at the Wayne State University in \nDetroit. He is a co-founder of the Polish Riverfront Festival, which \nprovides assistance to children's hospitals in Poland.\n  I was proud to work with Bruno Nowicki in 1993-1994 on an issue \nespecially close to his heart, promoting chess to students in schools. \nAn avid chess player who participates in (and has won) tournaments in \nthe U.S., Bermuda and Cuba, he believes that the skills children \ndevelop by learning to play chess can be applied to everyday life. A \nfour-year study of school chess players confirmed Bruno Nowicki's \nbelief. The study found that chess helps children build self-confidence \nand self-worth, dramatically improves children's ability to think \nrationally, and results in higher grades, especially in English and \nMath. Bruno provided me with important information which I used in \ndrafting an amendment to the 1994 Goals 2000: Educate America Act, \nwhich allows State educational agencies to use certain Title III funds \nto promote instruction in chess as a tool for teachers to use to \nmotivate students to develop critical thinking skills, self-discipline \nand creative resolution methods.\n  Mr. President, Bruno Nowicki has demonstrated time and again his \ncommitment to his community. He is truly a person who has touched the \nlives of thousands of people. I know my colleagues join me in wishing \nBruno a happy 90th birthday and in commending him for his remarkable \ndedication to community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11803-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11803-S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE GUN A MONTH FORUM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last month I convened a forum \nto investigate the problem of gun-trafficking. At the forum, we heard \nfrom a number of compelling witnesses and I have been submitting their \ntestimony into the Record so that my colleagues and the public can \nbenefit from their insights. Taken together, this testimony makes a \ncompelling case for the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act, S. 466, which I \nintroduced earlier this Congress.\n  Today, I would like to submit the final testimony from this forum, \nthat of Captain Thomas Bowers, Director of the Office of Crime Gun \nEnforcement for the Maryland State Police. Two years ago, the Maryland \nLegislature passed the Gun Violence Act of 1996, which restricted the \npurchase of handguns to one in a thirty day period. The results have \nalready been dramatic. In fact, Maryland saw a 78 percent decrease in \nthe number of handguns sold as a result of multiple purchases in the \nfirst year after the enactment of this law. This means fewer lethal \nweapons supplied to criminals in cities nationwide.\n  I hope that my colleagues will work with me to pass this important \npiece of legislation. Keeping handguns out of the hands of criminals, \nand reducing the gun violence across our nation should be of paramount \nimportance to all.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony of Captain Thomas Bowers be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n                    Testimony of Capt. Thomas Bowers\n\n       Senator Lautenberg, I am Captain Thomas Bowers, Director of \n     the Office of Crime Gun Enforcement for the Maryland State \n     Police.\n       On behalf of Colonel David B. Mitchell, our superintendent, \n     thank you for the opportunity to address you today.\n       The troopers seated behind me represent the subject matter \n     experts in the area of firearms enforcement.\n       The Maryland State Police is the point of contact for \n     regulatory and criminal oversight of all regulated firearm \n     purchases in Maryland. In 1966, Maryland initiated an \n     application process to purchase handguns. This process \n     included a 7-day waiting period and a background check.\n       In 1995, Governor Parris N. Glendening, Lieutenant Governor \n     Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Colonel Mitchell initiated a \n     comprehensive program entitled Operation Cease-Fire, one \n     element of the cease-fire initiative was the Maryland State \n     Police Firearms Investigation Unit. This unit provides the \n     ``front line'' response to the problem of firearms related \n     violence throughout the State of Maryland.\n       The Firearms Investigation Unit was initially tasked with \n     the responsibility of enforcing Maryland's existing firearms \n     laws and, more importantly, identifying the source or sources \n     of firearms used in the commission of violent crimes.\n       Through the work of the Firearms Investigation Unit and \n     information provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms the straw purchase was identified as the major \n     source of crime guns in Maryland, even more significant, \n     based upon crime gun trace data from the city of Baltimore. \n     The straw purchase of firearms through multiple sales was \n     determined to be the source of the majority of regulated \n     firearms used in the commission of violent crime. Let me \n     repeat that the straw purchase of firearms through multiple \n     sales was determined to be the source of the majority of \n     regulated firearms used in the commission of violent crime.\n       Each multiple straw purchase tells a dramatic story. I'd \n     like to give you two examples.\n       1. The first is that of a 32-year old male who was \n     recruited by a drug organization to purchase 9 9mm semi-\n     automatic handguns from a Maryland regulated firearms dealer. \n     Upon receipt of the handguns from the dealer, the young man \n     immediately provided them to a member of the hierarchy of the \n     drug organization who then distributed the handguns to drug \n     traffickers whom he controlled. Within a few weeks, two of \n     the 9mm handguns were used in two separate homicides.\n       2. A second example is that of a young man who purchased 11 \n     9mm and 45 caliber semi-automatic handguns from a Maryland \n     regulated firearms dealer. A short time later, the same \n     resident returned to the same regulated firearms dealer and \n     purchased 30 more semi-automatic handguns. An investigation \n     was initiated which revealed that all 41 semi-automatic \n     handguns were smuggled out of the United States and into the \n     country of Nigeria in violation of both United States and \n     Nigerian law.\n       In 1996, through the efforts of Governor Glendening, the \n     Maryland legislature passed a comprehensive violence \n     reduction initiative entitled, The Gun Violence Act of 1996. \n     This act limited the purchase of a regulated firearm to one \n     in a 30-day period and also required a background check and \n     7-day waiting period for secondary sales of regulated \n     firearms between individuals. (Three charts; regulated \n     firearm definition, secondary sale definition, and secondary \n     sale regs.)\n       Maryland's one gun a month law limits the number of \n     handguns an individual can purchase to only one during a 30-\n     day period not per calendar month. There are codified \n     provisions for specific exceptions to the law. They are \n     enumerated on the chart displayed before you. (Two charts; \n     exceptions to one/month and Maryland State Police From 77M \n     (multiple purchase).\n       (1) Residents may apply to the Maryland State Police to be \n     designated as private collectors.\n       (2) Residents may purchase two handguns during a single \n     visit to a licensed gun dealer if the dealer has offered a \n     second handgun at a discount when purchased with the first. \n     Under this exception the resident cannot purchase another \n     handgun for 60 days.\n       (3) Law enforcement agencies and licensed private security \n     organizations are exempt from the multiple purchase law when \n     purchasing handguns for use by their employees.\n       (4) Residents may purchase more than one handgun if they \n     are part of a set or sequential serial numbers as in an \n     accepted collector series.\n       (5) To facilitate the replacement of a firearm that was \n     lost or stolen with documentation from a law enforcement \n     agency.\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\n       (6) To facilitate the replacement of a defective firearm by \n     the same regulated firearms dealer with 30 days of purchase.\n       (7) Lastly the one gun in 30 days provision does not apply \n     to estate sales.\n       As a result of this legislation, the number of firearms \n     acquired through multiple purchases have reduced \n     significantly.\n       In addition, and perhaps most telling effect, is the \n     drastic decrease in the number of guns initially purchased in \n     Maryland that have been recovered as a result of crimes in \n     other States.\n       By comparing the one year period prior to the enactment of \n     Maryland's multiple purchase legislation, which became \n     effective on October 1, 1996, with the year following its \n     enactment, you can clearly see the dramatic results (two \n     charts; multiple sales bar chart comparison, and multiple \n     sales graph)\n       From October, 1, 1995, to September 30, 1996, 7,569 \n     handguns were sold in Maryland, as a result of multiple \n     purchases.\n       From October 1, 1996, to September 30, 1997, that number \n     was reduced to 1,618 handguns which were sold as a result of \n     multiple purchases, a seventy eight percent (78%) (59% \n     difference) reduction in firearms acquired through multiple \n     purchases.\n       In 1991 Maryland was nationally ranked second in terms of \n     suppliers of crime guns to the city of New York. By 1997, one \n     year after the passage of Maryland's one gun a month law, \n     Maryland moved out of the top ten suppliers of crime guns to \n     New York City.\n       Maryland is proud of it's proactive firearms legislation. \n     Our efforts to limit the supply of guns to the illegal market \n     without adversely impacting upon law abiding citizens are \n     strong and sincere. The multiple purchase allows for the \n     quick acquisition of large numbers of regulated firearms by \n     proscribed individuals. The one gun a month law in Maryland \n     has shown that it is an effective means of disrupting the \n     illegal diversion of firearms which are acquired through \n     multiple purchases and will ultimately reduce the supply of \n     firearms readily available to criminals.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you \n     today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11803-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL S. DALEY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael S. Daley who is retiring from over 30 years as an orderly at \nFletcher Allen Hospital in Burlington, Vermont. Michael joined the \nhospital in the late 1960's and began his career as a health care \nworker. After a few years, he thought he would try his luck in \nCalifornia. He soon realized that Vermont was where he wanted to be. He \nrejoined the workers at the hospital in October 1970 and continued to \nbe a care giver in every sense of the word. Michael is my wife, Liz's, \nbother. I can not count the number of times Vermonters' have come up to \nme to tell me how kind Michael had been to them when they were ill or \ninjured.\n  Being an orderly was more than a job to Michael. It was a vocation. \nHe was ever mindful of the importance of medical care, however, he \nnever neglected the soul. Every one of his co-workers would tell you \nthat Michael brought a sense of humor to everything he did. He would \noften bring his lunch to a patient's room and visit during this lunch \nbreak. Doctors, new to the O.R. or leaving for other assignments, were \nregularly treated to lunches prepared by Michael in their honor. \n``Michael knows everyone'', a co-worker stated. I think that Michael \nmade it his business to get to know everyone. He would note when \nsomeone from our hometown of Shrewsbury, Vermont was hospitalized and \nhe would pay them a visit. If a person wanted to talk, Michael would be \nthere.\n  Michael is a religious man who lives his faith. His work in the \nEpiscopal church in Milton, Vermont kept that small community alive for \nyears. Along with his wife, Alice, and their three children, Michael is \nand has been very active in Saint Andrews Church in Colchester, \nVermont. His faith has helped Michael go the extra mile in the care and \ncomfort of his fellow Vermonters. His sense of humor has added sunshine \nto the lives of those he meets. Michael represents the millions of \nunsung heros who care for and comfort our neighbors, family and \nfriends. I wish to honor him and his life's work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11804-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL COMMEMORATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE \n                   CENTENNIAL OF THE SUBMARINE FORCE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nU.S. Navy Submarine Force as it approaches its 100 year anniversary and \nto commend to the work of the National Commemorative Committee for the \nCentennial of the Submarine Force.\n  The submarine force traces its beginnings to the spring morning of \nApril 11, 1900. Following demonstration trials off Mount Vernon on the \nPotomac River, the Navy agreed to purchase the submarine boat USS \nHolland (SS-1). The USS Holland was named for its inventor John \nHolland. Inventors such as John Holland and Simon Lake had been \nexperimenting in submarine design during the last decades of the \nnineteenth century. However, Mr. Holland was the first to give the \nsubmarine true mobility by using a gasoline engine on the surface and a \nbattery supplying electric motors when submerged. It was due to the \nsuccess of the USS Holland that the Navy pursued the submarine program. \nFor this reason, the Submarine Force traditionally recognized April \n11th as the anniversary of its establishment.\n  Dramatic improvements to the submarine have been made since the USS \nHolland. The diesel engine replaced the gasoline engine in 1912. All \nwelded hulls, allowing submarines to submerge to much greater depths, \nwere introduced in the 1930s. Radar and sonar were incorporated during \nWorld War II. It is with the introduction of nuclear power, however, \nthat the submarine became a true submersible--limited in endurance only \nby the needs of its human crew.\n  Earlier this year the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program celebrated its \n50th anniversary. It was in 1948 that the legendary Admiral Hyman \nRickover, then a Captain, assigned himself the task of building a \nnuclear submarine. At that time, the technology that enabled the \nrelease of nuclear power was in its infancy. Just seven years later, \nthe USS Nautilus put to sea under nuclear power. Today the Navy's \nnuclear submarine force is a crown jewel of our Nation's Defense \narsenal.\n  In the year 2000, the Navy's Submarine Force will celebrate its 100th \nanniversary. The Secretary of the Navy has designated the period from \nJanuary 2000 through December 2000 for the commemoration of the \nCentennial of the U.S. Submarine Force. The Director of Submarine \nWarfare, Rear Admiral Malcolm Fages, and the Submarine Warfare Division \nhave the responsibility for overall coordination of commemorative \nactivities with assistance of the National Commemorative Committee for \nthe Centennial of the Submarine Force.\n  Mr. President, it is the work of the National Commemorative Committee \nand its chairman, Admiral Hank Chiles, that I wish to recognize today. \nPlans are already underway to observe the anniversary at appropriate \noccasions throughout the calendar year 2000. The National Commemorative \nCommittee is planning events and ceremonies that will provide the \nopportunity for people to observe and experience the special world of \nthe U.S. Navy Submarine Force and to become more acquainted with its \nrich and colorful history. Proposed events for 2000 include the opening \nof a Smithsonian exhibit, a birthday ball and the unveiling of a \nsubmarine stamp in Washington, DC, and participation in fleet week \ncelebrations throughout the year.\n  I commend the dedicated effort of the National Commemorative \nCommittee for the Centennial of the Submarine Force and urge my \ncolleagues to support the Committee as they continue their work \nplanning the centennial events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11804-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11804-S11805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S 87TH ANNIVERSARY NATIONAL DAY\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nsubstitute amendment to S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nProtection Act of 1998.\n  The substitute makes a number of changes to the Committee-passed \nbill. While not as far reaching as some would like, I believe that the \nchanges improve a measure that has always had a very laudable intent, \nbut which was criticized nevertheless by attorneys general and consumer \ngroups for preempting, in some instances, more favorable state law and \nnot providing consumers with enough information about a vehicles' \nhistory.\n  As a former Attorney General, I was particularly sensitive to these \ncriticisms, and last Fall I placed a hold on the measure with the \nexpectation of facilitating a consensus between the bill's supporters, \nthe attorneys general, and various consumer advocate groups. \nRegrettably, a consensus of legislation was not to be had. While the \nchanges in the amendment are generally intended to address concerns \nraised by the attorneys general and, to some extent, consumer \nadvocates, neither of these groups has endorsed this measure. I removed \nmy hold on the amendment despite this, however, because there is a \nconsensus, of which I am a part, on the need for federal legislation \nregarding salvage and rebuilt vehicles. The bill, as amended, is not \nperfect. But as my months of trying to broker an agreement revealed, \n``perfect,'' even if defined to mean the best interest of consumers, is \na subjective term. S. 852, as amended, is, in my view, and in that of \nover 50 co-sponsors, better than the status quo.\n  I remain troubled that the attorneys general and some consumer \nadvocate groups do not agree. I am also somewhat baffled by the \nseemingly studied misconstruction of the bill, and my amendment to it \nby some who continue to oppose it.\n  Let me explain the changes in the amendment to S. 852. In response to \ncomplaints that S. 852 set too high a damage threshold for designating \na vehicle as ``salvage,'' the amendment lowers the threshold from 80% \nto the lower of 75% or the percentage threshold in a state as of the \ndate of enactment. Seventy-five percent is the threshold recommended by \nthe task force created by the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992, on whose work \nthis legislation is based. Industry defenders of the higher threshold \nargued that lowering it would hurt, not help, consumers because it \nwould devalue vehicles even when there is no legitimate safety-related \nreason for mandating the disclosure of prior damage. I understand their \npoint, but don't agree. Yes, there is some threshold at which mandatory \nlabeling, and the bureaucratic burden that attends it, is more costly \nthan beneficial for both buyers and sellers, but I do not believe we \nhave come close to that turning point.\n  The attorneys general's concern that S. 852 did not provide for \nsufficient disclosure applied not only to the percent of damage \nthreshold, but also to limited scope of the vehicles covered by the \nbill. S. 852 proposed to permit the ``salvage vehicle'' label to attach \nonly to vehicles less than seven years old or with more than $7500. \nWhile states were free to use any other label they chose for all \nvehicles, including older vehicles, state attorneys general wanted to \nbe able to use the term ``salvage'' to describe older vehicles because \nit is the term most commonly used today to advise of prior damage. The \namendment to S. 852 permits states to do this, and explicitly provides \nthat states can use the term ``older model salvage vehicle'' to label \nolder vehicles.\n  Complaints about the mandatory nature of S. 852 ran the gamut. Some \ncritics of S. 852, including the Department of Transportation, objected \nto the fact that states were not obligated to comply with the Act, \narguing that states could opt out and become regional title washing \ncapitals. Others complained that the bill was too prescriptive, and did \nnot allow states (the majority of which, until now, do not appear to \nhave adopted very consumer-friendly laws) to set the standards for \nlabeling and disclosure. Rather than refight the battle that led the \nHouse to conclude that a mandate would be unconstitutional, and because \nI was unable to persuade anyone to agree that we should use a big stick \nas opposed to a carrot approach, the amendment to S. 852 does not make \nthe labeling system mandatory, but incorporates a provision to address \nconcerns that opt-out states will become title-washing capitals. The \namendment to S. 852 makes it a violation of the Act to move vehicles, \nor vehicle titles, across state lines for the purpose of avoiding the \nrequirements in the Act.\n\n  Another minor modification to S. 852 corrects what I believe was an \noversight in S. 852, and makes it a violation of the Act not to comply \nwith the labeling and disclosure requirements for ``flood vehicles.''\n  Another modification made to S. 852 clarifies that states that choose \nto abide by the provisions of the Act must carry over not only the \n``salvage vehicle,'' ``nonrepairable vehicle,'' and ``flood vehicle'' \nlabels on titles, but also any other disclosure that states prescribe. \nThis concept was contained in S. 852, but the language was unclear. The \nlegislation does not restrict states from labeling a car with any term, \nand prescribing treatment of a car so labeled with any term, other than \nthe very limited list of terms used in the bill. In other words, a \nstate that accepts federal funds for the national motor vehicle \nidentification number database, and that does not specifically state on \nits titles that it is not complying with the federal titling standards, \nmust use the definition of ``salvage vehicle'' and ``nonrepairable \nvehicle'' prescribed in the bill. However, S. 852 permits that state to \nlabel the same vehicle with any other term it chooses and imposes any \nrestrictions attendant to the other label. The amendment clarifies that \nstates that chose to use the national labels, including those for \n``salvage vehicle'' and ``nonrepairable vehicle,'' must not only carry \nover these labels from other states, but must also carry over any other \nlabels another state chooses to affix, and specify the state that so \nlabeled the vehicle.\n  Other modifications specifically permit state attorneys general to \nbring actions on behalf of individuals for violations of the Act, and \nclarify that the Act in no way affects individuals' ability to bring \nprivate rights of action. In response to concerns that S. 852 preempted \nstate causes of action and created a sole remedy for violations \nrelating to title labeling and disclosure, the amendment specifically \nprovides that the Act does not preclude any private right of action \navailable under state law. This provision was intended to provide \nassurances that nothing in the Act restricts individuals, or attorneys \ngeneral, from pursuing any claims under state law, such as claims based \non violations of consumer protection laws, unfair trade practices, or \nfailures to disclose the material terms of a contract. Curiously, the \ninclusion of this provision, designed to allay concerns about \npreemption, appears to have unreasonable stirred them. Some appear to \nhave drawn the illogical and legally unsupported conclusion that any \nclaim not specifically preserved is implicity barred. Let met again try \nto clarify. There is absolutely nothing in the bill that suggests that \nthe remedies it provides (action by attorneys general) are exclusive. \nSimply because the legislation states that private actions are \nspecifically preserved does not mean that all other actions are barred \nor restricted in any way.\n  The modification that has drawn criticism even from those consumer \ngroups whose interests I was attempting to advance in my amendment, is \nthe striking of the criminal penalty provisions. This modification was \nnot requested by anyone seeking to avoid accountability. Rather, I \nsought to strike the criminal penalties because I believe that the \ncriminal sanctions in S. 852 were inappropriate in most instances, and \nunnecessary in others. As\n\n[[Page S11806]]\n\na general matter, I believe that Congress creates too many federal \ncriminal offenses, when it should leave this task to state law. A \nviolation of this bill, such as a failures to make disclosures about a \nvehicle's history, generally is not the type of violation for which \npeople should be sent to jail. If the conduct is so egregious that \ncriminal sanctions are warranted, then existing state laws against \nfraud, theft, and the like are available based on which to prosecute \nviolators.\n  The change I have just described to S. 852 are not extensive. They \nare, nevertheless, important and, in my opinion, improve a bill that is \nneeded at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11805-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION ACT, S. 1677\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for this bill offered by our distinguished colleague from Rhode \nIsland. I want to thank Senator Chafee for all the work he has done, \nand especially his effort to addressing some of the concerns I had \nabout the bill.\n  The North American Wetlands Conservation Act, or NAWCA, is a \nblueprint for successful environmental protection--through voluntary \ncooperation among government agencies, private conservation \norganizations, and landowners. It is a matching fund which involves \nstate, federal, and private partners in protecting and restoring \nwetlands across the country.\n  Mr. President, this is very important for the environment. Wetlands \nserve a multitude of purposes. Obviously, they provide critical habitat \nand breeding grounds for migratory birds, fish and aquatic plants. But \ntheir benefit goes far beyond wildlife habitat. Wetlands are nature's \nsponges--absorbing heavy rains and minimizing the damaging effects of \nfloods and erosion. Wetlands are also natural filters, trapping and \nisolating potentially damaging pollution and improving the quality of \nour lakes and rivers.\n  Since 1990, there have been 9 NAWCA projects in Ohio which have \nprotected almost 9,000 acres of critical wetlands. NAWCA has \ncontributed $3.3 million towards these projects--and those funds were \nmatched by $6.9 million from groups such as Ducks Unlimited and Ohio's \nDivision of Wildlife.\n  Last summer, I was able to visit one of these projects, Metzger Marsh \nin northwest Ohio. I was impressed, not only with the beauty and \ndiversity of the wildlife at this marsh, but also with the cooperation \namong government, private agencies, and landowners that protected this \narea.\n  While there are several partners working together on this effort, I \nwould like to mention one organization in particular. Ducks Unlimited \nis a national nonprofit conservation organization with over 18,000 \nmembers in Ohio alone. It has contributed over $80 million in matching \nfunds to support NAWCA projects across the country. This is over three \ntimes the amount contributed by any other conservation organization. In \nlight of the longstanding commitment of Ducks Unlimited to this \nproject, I believe they should continue to serve on the NAWCA Council--\nand I would like to thank Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, Inhofe and \nHutchison for insuring that the organization's membership on this \ncouncil will continue.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important piece of environmental \nlegislation, and I urge its adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11806-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11806-S11807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONSUMER REPORTING EMPLOYMENT CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  (The text of (S. 2561), the Consumer Reporting Employment \nClarification Act of 1998, as passed by the Senate on October 6, 1998, \nis as follows:)\n\n                                S. 2561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 678, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 678) to require the Secretary of the Treasury \n     to mint coins in commemoration of Thomas Alva Edison and the \n     125th anniversary of Edison's invention of the light, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 678, the \n``Thomas Edison Commemorative Coin Act'', a bill that directs the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins commemorating Thomas \nEdison and the 125th anniversary of the invention of the lightbulb. I \nam the author of the Senate version of this bill. In 1928, Congress saw \nfit to award to Mr. Edison a Congressional gold medal ``for the \ndevelopment and application of inventions that have revolutionized \ncivilization in the last century.'' Mr. President, by passing this \nlegislation today, we have the opportunity to once again honor the \nmemory of one of the world's greatest inventors by issuing \ncommemorative coins bearing Mr. Edison's likeness.\n  Thomas Edison produced more than 1,300 inventions during the course \nof his lifetime, 1,093 of which were patented. These included the \nincandescent lightbulb, the alkaline battery, the phonograph, the \nmicrophone, motion picture cameras, and stock tickers. He was one of \nAmerica's greatest inventors, and truly a genius. Formerly known as \n``The Wizard of Menlo Park'', he would spend countless hours in his \nlabs in New Jersey coming up with ideas that ultimately made all our \nlives much easier.\n  In 1887, Thomas Edison built his lab in West Orange, New Jersey. It \nwas known as the world's first ``invention factory'', where he and his \npartners invented, built and shipped out numerous products stemming \nfrom Edison's work. He saw every failure as a success. One story is \nthat Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times in his storage battery \nexperiments. Instead of being dejected, he said ``Why, I haven't \nfailed. I've just found 10,000 ways that it won't work.'' Conversely, \nin response to remarks about his success, he would say, ``Genius is 1% \ninspiration and 99% perspiration.'' It is now proper to honor this man \nwho left such a lasting legacy with these commemorative coins.\n  Mr. President, not only would these coins honor the memory of Thomas \nEdison, they would also raise revenue to support organizations that \npreserve his legacy. The two New Jersey sites,\n\n[[Page S11808]]\n\nthe ``invention factory'' in West Orange, New Jersey and the Edison \nMemorial Tower in Edison, New Jersey, are in need of funding for \nmaintenance and repair. Each year, nine thousand young students visit \nthe West Orange site alone to learn about the great inventor. The \nproceeds from the sale of these coins will help to preserve \nirreplaceable records containing Edison's thoughts as well as priceless \nmemorabilia. This bill, at no cost to the government, would provide the \nfunds necessary to protect these and six other historical sites so that \ngenerations of school children can continue to visit them.\n  Mr. President, I introduced similar legislation in the 104th Congress \nas well as at the beginning of this Congress. I now urge the passage of \nH.R. 678 so that we may honor the memory of Thomas Alva Edison and \ncelebrate the 125th anniversary of the lightbulb while, at no cost to \nthe government, providing needed funds to important historical sites.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 678) was considered read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11807-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ACCOMPANYING S. 2206\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) alternative dispute resolution, when supported by the \n     bench and bar, and utilizing properly trained neutrals in a \n     program adequately administered by the court, has the \n     potential to provide a variety of benefits, including greater \n     satisfaction of the parties, innovative methods of resolving \n     disputes, and greater efficiency in achieving settlements;\n       (2) certain forms of alternative dispute resolution, \n     including mediation, early neutral evaluation, minitrials, \n     and voluntary arbitration, may have potential to reduce the \n     large backlog of cases now pending in some federal courts \n     throughout the United States, thereby allowing the courts to \n     process their remaining cases more efficiently; and\n       (3) the continued growth of Federal appellate court-annexed \n     mediation programs suggests that this form of alternative \n     dispute resolution can be equally effective in resolving \n     disputes in the federal trial courts; therefore, the district \n     courts should consider including mediation in their local \n     alternative dispute resolution programs.\n\n     [SEC. 2.] SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES TO \n                   BE AUTHORIZED IN ALL DISTRICT COURTS.\n\n       Section 651 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 651.

Each United States district court shall devise \n     and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program, \n     by local rule adopted under section [2071(b)] 2071(a), to \n     encourage and promote the use of alternative dispute \n     resolution in its district.\n       ``(c) Existing Alternative Dispute Resolution Programs.--In \n     those courts where an alternative dispute resolution program \n     is in place on the date of the enactment of the Alternative \n     Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, the court shall examine the \n     effectiveness of that program and adopt such improvements to \n     the program as are consistent with the provisions and \n     purposes of this chapter.\n       ``(d) Administration of Alternative Dispute Resolution \n     Programs.--Each United States district court shall designate \n     an employee, or a judicial officer, who is knowledgeable in \n     alternative dispute resolution practices and processes to \n     implement, administer, oversee, and evaluate the court's\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\n     alternative dispute resolution program. Such person may also \n     be responsible for recruiting, screening, and training \n     attorneys to serve as neutrals and arbitrators in the court's \n     alternative dispute resolution program.\n       ``(e) Title 9 Not Affected.--This chapter shall not affect \n     title 9, United States Code.\n       ``(f) Program Support.--The Federal Judicial Center and the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts are \n     authorized to assist the district courts in the establishment \n     and improvement of alternative dispute resolution programs by \n     identifying particular practices employed in successful \n     programs and providing additional assistance as needed and \n     appropriate.''.\n\n     [SEC. 3.] SEC. 4.

In defining these exemptions, each \n     district court shall consult with members of the bar, \n     including the United States Attorney for that district.\n       ``(c) Authority of the Attorney General.--Nothing in this \n     section shall alter or conflict with the authority of the \n     Attorney General to conduct litigation on behalf of the \n     United States, with the authority of any Federal agency \n     authorized to conduct litigation in the United States courts, \n     or with any delegation of litigation authority by the \n     Attorney General.\n       ``(d) Confidentiality Provisions.--Until such time as rules \n     are adopted under chapter 131 of this title providing for the \n     confidentiality of alternative dispute resolution processes \n     under this chapter, each district court shall, by local rule \n     adopted under section 2071(b), provide for the \n     confidentiality of the alternative dispute resolution \n     processes and to prohibit disclosure of confidential dispute \n     resolution communications.''.\n\n     [SEC. 4.] SEC. 5.

The lead defendants are the \nSecretary of Commerce and the United States, who are being represented \nby the Department of Justice.\n  The complaint also names as defendants the Secretary of the Senate, \nGary Sisco, and the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, Greg \nCasey, as well as the Clerk and the Sergeant at Arms of the House of \nRepresentatives, because of their roles in paying and certifying the \nelection of Members and in controlling access to the two Chambers.\n  This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the \nSecretary of the Senate and the Senate Sergeant at Arms in this matter \nto seek dismissal of the case against them. The Legal Counsel will \nargue that the Senate officers are not proper defendants in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the resolution appear in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 291) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 291\n\n       Whereas, the Secretary of the Senate, Gary Sisco, and the \n     Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, Gregory S. \n     Casey, have been named as defendants in the case of Clifford \n     Alexander, et al. v.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of H.R. 4655, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4655) to establish a program to support a \n     transition to democracy in Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is about to act on \nH.R. 4655, the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. I introduced companion \nlegislation, S. 2525, last week with 7 co-sponsors. Last Friday, the \nHouse International Relations Committee marked up the legislation and \nmade only minor, technical changes. On October 5, the House passed H.R. \n4655 by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 360 to 38. That vote, and \nour vote in several moments, is a strong demonstration of Congressional \nsupport for a new policy toward Iraq--a policy that overtly seeks the \nreplacement of Saddam Hussein's regime through military and political \nsupport for the Iraq opposition.\n  The United States has many means at its disposal to support the \nliberation of Iraq. At the height of the Cold War, we support freedom \nfighters in Asia, Africa and Latin America willing to fight and die for \na democratic future. We can and should do the same now in Iraq.\n  The Clinton Administration regularly calls for bipartisanship in \nforeign policy. I support them when I can. Today, we see a clear \nexample of a policy that has the broadest possible bipartisan support. \nI know the Administration understands the depth of our feeling on this \nissue. I think they are beginning to understand the strategic argument \nin favor of moving beyond containment to a policy of ``rollback.'' \nContainment is not sustainable. Pressure to lift sanctions on Iraq is \nincreasing--despite Iraq's seven years of refusal to comply with the \nterms of the Gulf War cease-fire. Our interests in the Middle East \ncannot be protected with Saddam Hussien in power. Our legislation \nprovides a roadmap to achieve our objective.\n  This year, Congress has already provided $5 million to support the \nIraqi political opposition. We provided $5 million to establish Radio \nFree Iraq. We will provide additional resources for political support \nin the FY 1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, including $3 \nmillion for the Iraqi National Congress.\n  Enactment of this bill will go farther. It requires the President to \ndesignate at least one Iraqi opposition group to receive U.S. military \nassistance. It defines eligibility criteria such a group or groups must \nmeet. Many of us have ideas on how the designation process should work. \nI have repeatedly stated that the Iraqi National Congress has been \neffective in the past and can be effective in the future. They \nrepresent the broadest possible base of the opposition. There are other \ngroups that are currently active inside Iraq: the Patriotic Union of \nKurdistan, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Supreme Council for the \nIslamic Revolution in Iraq. The State Department seems to believe there \nare more than 70 opposition groups, many of which do not meet the \ncriteria in H.R. 4655. Many barely even exist or have no political \nbase. They should not be considered for support. We should also be very \ncareful about considering designation of groups which do not share our \nvalues or which are simply creations of external forces or exile \npolitics, such as the Iraqi Communist Party or the Iraqi National \nAccord.\n  I appreciate the work we have been able to do with the Administration \non this legislation. But we should be very clear about the designation \nprocess. We intend to exercise our oversight responsibility and \nauthority as provided in section 4(d) and section 5(d). I do not think \nthe Members of Congress, notified pursuant to law, will agree to any \ndesignation that we believe does not meet the criteria in section 5 of \nthe Iraq Liberation Act of 1998.\n  This is an important step. Observers should not misunderstand the \nSenate's action. Even though this legislation will pass without \ncontroversy on an unanimous voice vote, it is a major step forward in \nthe final conclusion of the Persian Gulf war. In 1991, we and our \nallies shed blood to liberate Kuwait. Today, we are empowering Iraqis \nto liberate their own country.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 4655, \nthe Iraq Liberation Act, for one simple reason: Saddam Hussein is a \nthreat to the United States and a threat to our friends in the Middle \nEast.\n  This lunatic is bent on building an arsenal of weapons of mass \ndestruction with a demonstrable willingness to use them. For nearly \neight years the United States has stood by and allowed the U.N. weapons \ninspections process to proceed in defanging Saddam. That process is now \nin the final stages of collapse, warning that the U.S. cannot stand \nidly by hoping against hope that everything will work itself out.\n  We have been told by Scott Ritter and others that Saddam can \nreconstitute his weapons of mass destruction within months. The \nWashington Post reported only last week that Iraq still has three \nnuclear ``implosion devices''--in other words, nuclear bombs minus the \nnecessary plutonium or uranium to set them off. The time has come to \nrecognize that Saddam Hussein the man is inextricable from Iraq's drive \nfor weapons of mass destruction. For as long as he and his regime are \nin power, Iraq will remain a mortal threat.\n  This bill will begin the long-overdue process of ousting Saddam. It \nwill not send in U.S. troops or commit American forces in any way. \nRather, it harkens back to the successes of the Reagan doctrine, \nenlisting the very people who are suffering most under Saddam's yoke to \nfight the battle against him.\n  The bill requires the President to designate an Iraqi opposition \ngroup or groups to receive military drawdown assistance. The President \nneed not look far; the Iraqi National Congress once flourished as an \numbrella organization for Kurds, Shi'ites and Sunni\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\nMuslims. It should flourish again, but it needs our help.\n  Mr. President, the people of Iraq, through representative \norganizations such as the INC, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the \nKurdish Democratic Party and the Shi'ite SCIRI, have begged for our \nhelp. The day may yet come when we are dragged back to Baghdad; I \nbelieve that day can be put off, perhaps even averted, by helping the \npeople of Iraq help themselves.\n  Opponents of this initiative--I shouldn't call them friends of \nSaddam--have said that the Iraqi opposition exists in name only, that \nthey are too parochial to come together. They are not entirely wrong--\nwhich is why Senator Lott and Chairman Gilman (the lead House sponsor) \nhave carefully crafted the designation requirement in H.R. 4655 to \ninsist that only broad-based, pro-democracy groups be selected by the \nPresident to receive drawdown assistance. I would go further, and \nsuggest to the President that he designate just one group, the Iraqi \nNational Congress, in which the Kurds, the Shi'ites and the Sunnis of \nIraq hold membership. The opposition must be unified, but it may just \ntake the leadership of the United States to bring them together.\n  Finally, this bill gives the Congress oversight over the designation \nand drawdown authorities. As Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I intend to exercise vigorously that authority. The White \nHouse and the State Department have indicated that they support this \nbill. We have a unique opportunity, and I intend to do everything in my \npower to ensure that opportunity is not frittered away. The price of \nfailure is far too high.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to urge the passage of H.R. 4655, \nthe Iraq Liberation Act. Thanks to strong leadership in both Houses of \nCongress and thanks to the commitment of the Administration toward the \ngoals we all share for Iraq and the region, this legislation is moving \nquickly. This is the point to state what this legislation is not, and \nwhat it is, from my understanding, and why I support it so strongly.\n  First, this bill is not, in my view, and instrument to direct U.S. \nfunds and supplies to any particular Iraqi revolutionary movement. \nThere are Iraqi movements now in existence which could qualify for \ndesignation in accordance with this bill. Other Iraqis not now \nassociated with each other could also band together and qualify for \ndesignation. It is for Iraqis, not Americans to organize themselves to \nput Saddam Hussein out of power, just as it will be for Iraqis to \nchoose their leaders in a democratic Iraq. This bill will help the \nAdministration encourage and support Iraqis to make their revolution.\n  Second, this bill is not a device to involve the U.S. military in \noperations in or near Iraq. The Iraqi revolution is for Iraqis, not \nAmericans, to make. The bill provides the Administration a potent new \ntool to help Iraqis toward this goal, and at the same time advance \nAmerica's interest in a peaceful and secure Middle East.\n  This bill, when passed and signed into law, is a clear commitment to \na U.S. policy replacing the Saddam Hussein regime and replacing it with \na transition to democracy. This bill is a statement that America \nrefuses to coexist with a regime which has used chemical weapons on its \nown citizens and on neighboring countries, which has invaded its \nneighbors twice without provocation, which has still not accounted for \nits atrocities committed in Kuwait, which has fired ballistic missiles \ninto the cities of three of its neighbors, which is attempting to \ndevelop nuclear and biological weapons, and which has brutalized and \nterrorized its own citizens for thirty years. I don't see how any \ndemocratic country could accept the existence of such a regime, but \nthis bill says America will not. I will be an even prouder American \nwhen the refusal, and commitment to materially help the Iraqi \nresistance, are U.S. policy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4655) was considered read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11811-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11812-S11813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \npassed S. 736--the Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer \nAct. I, along with Congressman Skeen, have been working to convey \ntracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred \nto as ``acquired lands''--back to the district, during the past several \ncongresses.\n  I introduced this bill in May of 1997 in order to transfer lands back \nto the rightful owners. This legislation will not affect operations at \nthe New Mexico State park at Brantley Dam, or the operations and \nownership of the dam itself. Furthermore, the bill will not affect \nrecreation activities in the area.\n  This legislation is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, \nand directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the \nlands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the \nproject was constructed. I believe this is a fair and equitable bill \nthat has been developed over years of negotiations. The Carlsbad \nIrrigation District has had operations and maintenance responsibilities \nfor the past 66 years. It met all the repayment obligations to the \nGovernment in 1991, and it's about time we let CID have what is \nrightfully theirs.\n  This legislation accomplishes three things: Conveys title of acquired \nlands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the \nDistrict to assume management of leases and the benefits of the \nreceipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180-day deadline for the \ntransfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out \nthe transfer.\n  The Carlsbad Irrigation Project is a single-purpose project created \nin 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation, acquiring all facilities, lands \nand water rights of the privately-owned Pecos Irrigation Company. The \nCID has had operations and maintenance responsibilities for the \nirrigation and drainage system since 1932.\n\n  During the 104th Congress, the Carlsbad Irrigation District presented \ntestimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on one \noccasion, and before the House Committee on Resources on two occasions. \nAdditionally, the administration expressed on several occasions before \nthese two committees that they want to move forward with acquired land \ntransfers where they make sense. The Commissioner of the Bureau of \nReclamation, Eluid Martinez, has informed the district and me that he \nbelieves that the Carlsbad project is one of several projects where the \nBureau would like to pursue transfer opportunities. It is about time \nthat we pass this legislation to provide the Bureau with the ability to \naccomplish their stated goal in a fair and equitable manner.\n  This transfer shifts responsibility from the Federal Government back \nto a local entity, and creates opportunity for the district to improve \nand enhance the management of these lands. After a long wait, we have \ngotten administration support for this transfer in language substituted \nby the Senate Energy Committee, and have gained support from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. I hope that the House of Representatives \nwill act quickly on this legislation so that the Carlsbad Irrigation \nDistrict will promptly begin getting the benefits for that which they \nhave paid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11813-8", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11814-S11816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LEWIS AND CLARK RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 777) to authorize the \nconstruction of the Lewis and Clark Water System and to authorize \nassistance to Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit \ncorporation, for the planning and construction of the water supply \nsystem, and for other purposes, which had been reported from the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, with amendments, as follows:\n  (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface \nbrackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in \nitalic.)\n\n[[Page S11815]]\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to support, along with \nmy colleague, Senator Mack, legislation to honor former Congressman \nDante Fascell by naming the Biscayne National Park Visitors Center \nafter the ex-Congressman of Florida. I had the pleasure to begin my \npolitical career as an intern in Congressman Fascell's office and am \nproud to have had the opportunity to serve with one of Florida's \ngreatest representatives.\n  Congressman Fascell's long history of public service began in the \nFlorida House of Representatives after his service in World War II. He \nwas elected to the Eighty-fourth Congress and spent the following \nthirty-six years in office. During this time Congressman Fascell was \ninfluential in both foreign and domestic policy.\n  While in Congress, Dante Fascell influenced U.S. foreign policy by \nco-authoring the War Powers act and chairing the Committees on Foreign \nAffairs and Arms Control, International Security and Science. In 1969, \nCongressman Fascell led House action to establish the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. This legislation was the first step in \nefforts to develop economically healthy communities and affordable \nopportunities for numerous families throughout the nation. He was also \na devout supporter of both law enforcement and education on narcotics \nabuse.\n  During his years in Congress, Dante Fascell was an outstanding \nenvironmental activist and improved the quality of Florida's natural \nhabitats and wildlife.

Mr. President, for the last year or so, both the House and \nSenate have been working on legislation that would reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973. The Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has reported legislation offered by my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Kempthorne, that would modify the Act in significant ways. \nAlthough it is unlikely that we will take up this bill in the short \ntime remaining to us, I would like to make a few observations about the \nEndangered Species Act and what it has meant to Hawaii, home to more \nendangered species than any other state or territory within the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, as legislators, we are guardians of our Nation's rich \nnatural inheritance; in this capacity, we cannot afford to squander the \necological legacy we leave to our children. Surely, part of our concern \nfor rare species and ecosystems is the simple realization that once \nthey are gone, we would have failed in our stewardship responsibility. \nHawaii is poised on the brink of irreversible ecological change, and it \nis important that wise stewardship decisions be rendered to preserve \nour unique, tropical ecosystem.\n  The term ``ecosystem'' has become a political buzzword and does not \nadequately described the delicate checks and balances that make up the \nnatural world. The basis of Hawaii's natural system begins not with a \nlist of threatened plants and animals, but with the unique origin of \nthe islands. For millions of years, lava welling out from the earth's \nmantle cooled upon the ocean floor, gradually forming the Hawaiian \nislands, one by one, a process that is ongoing even today. As one \nisland moves away from the influence of a ``hot spot'' in the middle of \nthe Pacific, another island is born. Each island is the peak of a \nvolcanic mountain, with its base hidden far below the surface of the \nocean. Only a few types of birds, insects, and plants were able to \ncolonize the remote islands, and these few evolved into scores or even \nhundreds of unique species. The islands sheltered no large land mammals \nor reptiles, only creatures that have gradually lost their natural \ndefenses against such predators.\n  The Endangered Species Act is critical to this unique, insular \necosystem. There are, 1,126 total U.S. species listed by Fish and \nWildlife Service under protection of the ESA, and although its islands \nrepresent just two-tenths of one percent of the total U.S. land area, \nHawaii is home to more rare and endangered species than any other state \nor territory. In addition, three-fourths of the nation's now extinct \nplants and birds once existed only in Hawaii. Hawaii has an astounding \n363 listed endangered species. Only California, with 223 listed \nspecies, rivals Hawaii in the number of listed endangered species. The \nPacific islands, not including Hawaii, have a total of 16 listed \nendangered species.\n  The causes of Hawaiian species decline are numerous and complicated, \nbut the most significant threats come from non-native animals that \nuproot and devour fragile native plants. Feral pigs, rats, and \nmongooses not only physicially destroy plants, but spread the seeds of \naggressive alien plants such as the South American banana\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\npoke vine, and small invasive trees like the Brazilian strawberry \nguava. These alien plants form thick, impenetrable monocultures that \nchoke out native plants. When native plants disappear, the birds and \ninsects that rely on native plants for food are also threatened. \nDiseases that kill native flora and fauna are also spread by alien \nspecies: birds in particular are ravaged by diseases transmitted \nthrough mosquitoes.\n  Hawaiian plants and animals co-evolved over millions of years and \ncontinue to depend on each other for survival. The interdependency of \nHawaiian insects, birds, and plants makes this ecosystem susceptible to \nrapid, irreversible change due to loss of species richness. Endangered \nspecies in Hawaii range from mammals such as the charismatic monk seal \nand the Hawaiian goose (also the state bird), or nene [nay-nay], to sea \ncreatures like the hawksbill sea turtle and invertebrates such as the \nOahu tree snail. There are endangered plants from 279 taxa, including \nplants with great cultural significance such as the mahoe and uhiuhi. \nHawaii harbors at least 5,000 species as yet unknown to science as well \nas many rare species, including the wekiu bug, which has ``antifreeze'' \nin its blood, and the Wood's tree hibiscus, a small tree previously \nunknown to science, found in Kauai, with only four individuals known \nworldwide.\n  I cannot stress enough that the loss of even one species may \ncontribute to the decline of entire ecosystems, and barring \nunprecedented action, many species may vanish undiscovered. Along with \nthe species, lost also is genetic information that could lead to new \nfoods and medicines.\n  Mr. President, the survival of hundreds of endangered species now \ndepends on human intervention. Though gravely threatened, Hawaii's \nremaining natural treasures can be saved. Conservation of habitat, \ncontrol and eradication of noxious introduced plants and predators, and \nenlightened resource management are the answer. Conservationists within \nHawaii kill feral animals, erect fences to keep ungulates away from \nfragile plants, breed animals in captivity, pollinate flowers by hand, \nand destroy alien plants. We are hoping to restore and maintain healthy \necosystems so that Hawaii's native species have the respite and \nprotection they need to survive. Thus, Hawaii is not a lost cause: more \nthan a quarter of the state's land remains unspoiled. But we must \ncontinue in our struggle to protect rare and endangered species before \nthe battle is over and our legacy to our children is robbed of species \nrichness.\n  Since the enactment of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, we have \ngarnered important knowledge and won substantial victories across the \ncountry in our efforts to protect imperiled species. Eight U.S. species \nhave removed from the list due to recovery and another 18 species have \nbeen upgraded from endangered to threatened. More importantly, at least \nhalf of all species listed for a decade or more are not either stable \nor improving in status.\n  For example, the first group of captive-bred Mexican wolves was \nreleased back into the American southwest this year; California \ncondors, southeastern fish, and dear to me, the Hawaiian silversword \nplant and `alala have also been re-introduced to the wild. Bird \nconservation groups in my own state have hatched eggs from 12 different \nendemic species--species that have never before been reared in \ncaptivity like the `akohekohe, palila, Maui parrotbill, puaiohi, \n`elepaio, and `amakihi. All of this has been accomplished in 25 years \nsince the Act's passage--remarkable when considered on nature's time \nscale rather than our fast paced Congressional calendar.\n\n  But these successful conservation efforts are not merely a result of \nFederal law. In Hawaii at least, the State legislature has enacted an \nendangered species law that is comparable, and, in some instances, \nstronger than Federal law. Last year, the State amended this law to \nallow ``take'' of endangered or threatened species when such \nauthorization is issued in conjunction with a safe harbor agreement or \nhabitat conservation plan. Although modelled after Federal law, the \nState amendments are more strict. For example, under the ESA, in order \nto allow for a ``take,'' the population must not decrease; however, \nunder the Hawaiian statute, the likelihood of population increase must \nbe proven before taking is allowed.\n  Despite success on the Federal and State levels to protect and \npreserve biological diversity, Congress may next year consider \nlegislation similar to the Kempthorne bill, that in its current form \ncould weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Nation's most \nimportant law protecting endangered wildlife and wildlife habitat.\n  There are many provisions of the Kempthorne bill, S. 1180, the \nEndangered Species Recovery Act of 1997, that I applaud and support. \nThe bill emphasizes recovery efforts, and codifies many of the \nadministration's efforts to provide incentives to landowners that are \naffected by the Endangered Species Act. The Kempthorne bill also \nexpands the role of States in implementing the act, which has the \npotential to tailor species recovery efforts on a case-by-case basis, \nrather than applying a Federal cookie-cutter approach to species \nprotection.\n  However, there are key elements of S. 1180 that are fundamentally \nunsound. For example, the legislation would lock in Habitat \nConservation Plans without allowing for review and adjustment. Mr. \nPresident, our knowledge of rare species is slow in coming; but as our \ninformation base grows, Habitat Conservation Plans need to change and \ngrow, too, reflecting new and more complete information about the needs \nof endangered species. Imagine if our knowledge or medical science were \nsimilarly locked in--we would still be using leeches to bleed patients \nof ``humors.''\n  In addition, the Kempthorne measure does not fully cover water \nrights, nor does it provide just compensation to property owners. It \nwould also establish significant bureaucratic obstacles to listing, \nmanagement, and recovery plans. And it offers less conservation per \ndollar appropriated.\n  Our House colleague, Congressman George Miller, has put forward a \nbill that I find more consistent with the original intent of the \nEndangered Species Act. The Miller bill emphasizes recovery of species; \nsteps up protection of candidate species; creates a new and important \ncategory of ``survival habitat'' which is designated at time of \nlisting, yet also has a version of ``no surprises'' permits; and \ncreates a habitat conservation fund based on performance bonds paid by \nrecipients of incidental take permits. It contains extensive tax \nbenefits for landowners affected by the Endangered Species Act. Most \nimportantly, under the Miller legislation, the public is allowed to sue \nto enforce the terms of Habitat Conservation Plans.\n\n  I applaud Senator Kempthorne for attempting in his legislation to \nbalance the needs of private landowners against the protections we \naccord endangered species; unfortunately, I believe his bill tilts too \nfar in favor of the former. However well-meaning, key provisions of the \nbill represent a backtracking on endangered species and endangered \nspecies habitat protection. Until these shortcomings are addressed, \nCongress should not consider altering the most important and effective \nlaw we have on the books for protecting our rarest forms of life.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by noting that more than any other \nstate, Hawaii is teetering on the edge of no return. The Endangered \nSpecies Act is our ultimate safety net when the more than 150 other \nU.S. laws and international treaties fail to prevent a species from \ndeclining toward extinction. When measured in terms of preventing \nthreatened species from going extinct, the Act has been an overwhelming \nsuccess. I would be reluctant to support legislation, however well-\nintentioned, that would reduce the effectiveness of this landmark law.\n  I therefore look forward to debating reauthorization of the \nEndangered Species Act when the 106th Congress convenes. Senator \nKempthorne and Congressman Miller have both made good starts in \nheightening concern about endangered species and in bringing to light \nthe complexities of species protection and recovery. Let us build on \ntheir efforts next year and debate more thoroughly the requirements \nthat are necessary to crafting a stronger, more effective endangered \nspecies law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/07/senate-section/article/S11828-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
