Mr. President, on this legislation, again, I want to \nemphasize to the American people that we are being prevented from even \ndebating the real merits of this very important legislation, which \nwould give some degree of protection to volunteers from being sued when \nthey are not even remotely involved in what may have caused a lawsuit. \nIf they are involved in some excessive action or some misconduct, they \nwould still be subject to lawsuits, but this would give some degree of \nprotection to volunteers.\n  I cannot help but again point out the fact that, at a time when there \nis this great conference in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, \ntalking about voluntarism in America, how important it is to be \ninvolved with Little League, to be involved with reading, to be \ninvolved with the Boys and Girls Club, the Red Cross, the Salvation \nArmy--be involved. Here, when we say, ``Yes, but one of the problems is \nthat you run the risk of being sued; if your good will causes you to be \ninvolved as a volunteer you could wind up having legal action against \nyou and we want to provide some protection against that''--the \nDemocrats are filibustering the motion to proceed to the bill.\n  That is very curious. They say maybe it is related to other issues \nthat have not been brought up. But the fact of the matter is, this is \nvery clear. It is a very clear choice. Is the Senate going to go on \nrecord of supporting volunteers and giving them some reasonable \nprotection against frivolous lawsuits, or are we going to side with the \nplaintiffs' lawyers who want to be able to sue everybody, anytime, \nanywhere they want to, even volunteers? We are going to have to choose.\n  So I want to serve notice to the Senate we are going to vote on this \nissue over and over and over, and we will not go to other legislation \nuntil this Volunteer Protection Act is passed.\n  You know, if there is going to be a lot of whining about we cannot do \nother things--this is important, fundamental legislation that tells an \nawful lot about whether we are honest about wanting to encourage \nvolunteers and be helpful to volunteers in America.\n  I would like to address some questions to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia, who has done such outstanding work on this legislation. I \ncommend him for being prepared to come to the floor of the Senate and \npoint out what is actually in the bill. I put down some of the \nridiculous allegations that I have heard against the bill yesterday, \nabout who might be covered by this. You have stood here and you have \nanswered the questions. You have told the truth about what is in the \nbill. You have been prepared to work out problems that might exist, \nalthough it does not look to me like anybody is really very serious \nabout addressing concerns they may or may not have. So, I thank you on \nbehalf of the volunteers of America for volunteering to stand here in \nthe Senate and do battle for them. You have done a great job. I have \nheard a lot of other good speeches from our colleagues out here in the \nSenate, Senator Ashcroft--I encourage others to come over and engage in \nthis debate.\n  But would you answer for me this question? First of all, is this \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nprotect volunteers who are involved in misconduct in any way from \nlegitimate lawsuits?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First of all, I thank the leader for focusing on this \nimportant measure this morning. I think you have pointed out what to me \nhas been a startling irony, that the administration is calling on \nthousands of Americans to step forward and then sends a team down here \nto trip them if they do.\n  The answer to the question is absolutely not. First of all, it is \nonly 12 pages long and it is very precise. If you are involved with \nmisconduct, reckless conduct, gross negligence, driving under the \ninfluence, a hate crime, a sex crime, a civil rights crime--this \nlegislation offers you no protection. What it does is it deals with the \nvolunteer who steps forward and makes a simple mistake or omission in \nthe act of being that volunteer. It would grant protections, limited \nprotections to a volunteer in that circumstance.\n  It was suggested yesterday that organizations who promote hate would \nsomehow find a shield in this measure. That was disappointing. I did \nnot think that had a real place in the debate. Nevertheless, it was \nbrought up and it is absolutely incorrect. No organization--they \nspecifically alluded to the Ku Klux Klan--given the definition of an \norganization here, there is not a jury or a judge in America that would \nfind that definition to include the Ku Klux Klan.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Georgia will yield, it is pretty clear \nand narrowly defined, as I read it. It would be applicable to \nvolunteers or any category of volunteers in the performance of services \nfor a nonprofit organization or governmental entity; and (2) nonprofit \norganizations or governmental entities. That is pretty narrow in its \napplicability.\n\n  But let me ask you, are you telling me that there are examples in \nAmerica where individuals who get involved with the Salvation Army or \nget involved with Little League Baseball literally are being sued?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely. It is not so much a case of the judgments. \nIt is a case of the threat of the suit and what it can do to you. The \nbest example is listed here where a man who is part of a rescue team \nrescued an individual who had fallen off a ledge and was paralyzed. The \nperson who was rescued by that rescue team sued the rescuers for $12 \nmillion.\n  It was ultimately thrown out of court. But it has had a chilling \neffect on people. You come forward, you want to volunteer, but you \ndon't want to put your family's business or assets at risk for doing \nthat.\n  Mr. LOTT. Who is opposed to this legislation? What is the reason for \nopposing it? I cannot understand it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let us look at the lineup here. I read a letter \nyesterday I have from Little League Baseball. You have the United Way, \nthe Red Cross, the Navy League, the Air Force Association, the American \nSociety of Association Executives. Who is on the other side here? What \nis the cast? It is those among the trial attorneys who simply cannot \nabide that there be any reform at all, including volunteers, from the \nprotection of these kind of suits. That is never mentioned. But that is \nwhere the opposition is.\n  We had a case from Senator Santorum who, in the last Congress, \nfinally got the Emerson bill passed, which protected people who were \ngiving food to homeless and starving people. It took the entire session \nand it was finally passed by unanimous consent in the waning hours of \nthe last Congress--the same opponents.\n  So here we are, trying to make it possible for Americans to respond \nto four Presidents: Clinton, Bush, Carter, and Ford; and here they are \ntrying to block it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank you again for your effort. I am hoping we will \nbegin to see a break in the stonewall against the motion to proceed to \nthe bill today and that we will have some Democrats join in getting \ncloture so we can go on and finish our discussion of the bill and get \nto a final vote. I think that will happen because I think all of us \nreally want to encourage voluntarism and I think this legislation will \nhelp that all across America.\n  Then we can go on, either later on this week or next week, to take up \nsome nominations that are pending on the Executive Calendar and be \nprepared on Monday to go to the supplemental appropriations bill. It is \nour intent to move forward with that legislation. There is a lot of \ncomplaining now that there may be some amendments in committee or \namendments offered on the floor. What's new? This is the U.S. Senate. \nAny Senator, he or she, can offer an amendment. We can debate it. And \nthere are those who say, ``If you offer certain amendments or if there \nare certain things in the bill, we are going to filibuster those items \nand hold up the bill,'' and then they say we are holding up the bill.\n  I am saying now the Appropriations Committee will do its job today or \ntomorrow and report out the supplemental appropriations bill, hopefully \nin a way that will pay for the cost of the bill, for the most part. And \nthen we will be prepared to begin on Monday and I will be prepared to \nhave the final vote Tuesday or Wednesday. If we have to, we will file \ncloture to try to cut off a filibuster on items that may or may not be \nin the bill. And we hope to be able to complete it Wednesday or \nThursday of next week.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3809-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 543, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 543) to provide certain protections to \n     volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \n     entities in lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between 10 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. shall \nbe divided equally between the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] or \nhis designee, and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] or his designee. \nThe Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I did not expect the majority leader to \ninvest the time, which I very much appreciate his having done, to frame \nthe nature of the situation we have here. But, just to restate it for \nthose who may be listening, in response to the summit on voluntarism, \nwe have brought to the Senate floor a very specific proposal, \nlegislation, to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. We have \nmoved to bring it before the Senate and the other side is filibustering \nthat motion in order to prevent our taking action on this Volunteer \nProtection Act.\n  As I said in response to the leader, this is legislation that has \nbeen before the Congress in one form or another for almost 12 years, \nand has been consistently rebutted by the hierarchy of the Trial \nLawyers Association. It is 12 pages long and it gives modest protection \nto volunteers who step forward in the 600,000 organizations across our \nland who try to promote the interests of those in need, whether they \nare children, the elderly, the illiterate, the wounded, or those who \nhave been affected by the very flood we are talking about in the \nMidwest.\n  We have appeal after appeal from organization after organization \nrequesting the legislation. They are having volunteer members of their \nboards of directors resign, because while they want to help, they do \nnot envision taking all their family business and all their family \nassets and putting them in a lottery, so they resign.\n  When the organization asks for a mother or father to step forward and \ncoach Little League Baseball, they hesitate, because they have read \nabout these illogical but, nevertheless, real lawsuits against \nvolunteers. Often, the organization has no assets at all, but one of \nthe volunteers does. And so the suit goes straight to the individual \nwho has accumulated, for whatever reason, some resources, some wealth. \nThey are at particular risk because they have what is called deep \npockets. They are chilled from coming forward. Often these people are \nvery talented, high capacity, but they are chilled away; they are \ncautioned away.\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\n  I told the story several times on the floor of Terry Orr of the \nWashington Redskins. When he came to play for the ball club, senior \nteam members brought him immediately in to help with the inner-city \nproblems, with the children, which he did. Then he matured, and he took \non the responsibility and went to the rookies. What did he hear? \n``Well, wait a minute.'' First question, ``What is the liability? How \nmuch at risk am I?'' He found himself talking to attorneys, and he \ncould not bring the same energy and resource that he had seen when he \nfirst came to the team.\n  This is a rather new phenomenon. This has not been a part of American \nlife until recently; in fact, until the 1980's. Lawsuits directed at \nvolunteers, you could not count them on a hand, but in the eighties, \nseveral celebrated cases suddenly made the volunteer a new target. \nThroughout the eighties, we saw the number of Americans who were \nwilling to volunteer shrink. We have seen the financial resources that \nhave to be invested in protecting the volunteers grow, at the expense \nof the programs for which they were designed. For example, the \nWashington, DC, Girl Scouts have to sell 87,000 boxes of cookies to pay \nthe premium for the protection of the volunteers--not to help the Girl \nScouts, but to pay the premium to protect the volunteers. And we have \nseen volunteers leave the scene, resignation after resignation.\n  This legislation, this very narrow and targeted piece of legislation, \nprotects those volunteers, makes it easier for them to answer the call \nof the Presidents at the summit and will reduce the overall expenditure \nof the organizations trying to do good service and good work in our \nNation.\n  I might add that voluntarism, as I said yesterday, is uniquely \nAmerican. It is a quality that has been noted by every nation about the \nAmerican people. It really is near the heart and soul of who we are. It \ndoes not happen this way in most countries in the world. As the \nPresident knows, I was Director of the U.S. Peace Corps, and I had a \nchance to see it right up close. It is an American miracle, and it \nought to be protected and cherished and nourished in every way that it \ncan. I find it the irony of ironies that after that summit, we \nintroduce this legislation and we are caught in a filibuster from the \nother side to keep this from being acted on.\n  Mr. President, I see that I have been joined by my colleague from \nWyoming, and I know that he has wanted to speak on this. I yield such \ntime as he might need to speak on this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor this important piece of legislation. I rise to join my colleagues \nand friends in supporting the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. This \nbill aims to protect one of the bulwarks of our democratic Government, \nand that is America's volunteers. That is the foundation of the United \nStates. That is a principle that we have been working on for a long \ntime. We seem to be losing a little of the momentum that our \nforefathers had in the area of voluntarism, and part of that has to \ncome out of fear.\n  Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to preside over the Senate \nfor several hours. During that time, I was amazed at the direction of \nthis particular debate. While my Republican colleagues have been \nworking to achieve meaningful legal protection for volunteers, one \nDemocrat after another has paraded on to the Senate floor to discuss \nmatters absolutely unrelated to protecting volunteers from frivolous \nlitigation. I have heard speeches on the budget, on flood relief, on \nMedicare and on Alexis Herman, just to name a few. But I have not heard \nany meaningful discussion by my colleagues across the aisle on \nprotecting America's volunteers.\n  It is time that we get serious about helping our Nation's volunteers, \nand this is not going to happen by wandering into these other various \nand sundry tangents.\n  I heard the debate on the budget. The budget is not this debate. The \nbudget is still being negotiated, and I understand that is going well, \nbut it is not possible for us to debate the budget on the floor right \nnow. It is not being held up by this piece of legislation, which should \nonly take a little while to debate and pass.\n\n  I heard them talk about the supplemental budget, and a portion of \nthat, of course, is emergency relief, and it is important. It is \nimportant in my State as well as for the people who have debated this. \nBut that is not before this body either. That is in committee, and the \nissues that have been raised on that are not ones that are being \naffected by this debate.\n  I have heard discussions on Medicare and Alexis Herman. Alexis Herman \nmay be more at the center of this delay than anything else that has \nbeen brought up.\n  Right now, there is a hearing taking place on a bill that will solve \nthe Executive order. Hopefully, that bill will get a quick hearing--it \nappears to be--and it will be brought over here and will undo any \nmisconceptions that there might be on the Alexis Herman situation, \nwhich appears to be a basis of a major Presidential change since the \nhearings were held in committee.\n  Those hearings were held, but the President has changed the momentum \nof his policy with labor since the time of those hearings, but that is \nnot a part of this debate either. We have not had any debate from the \nother side of the aisle about protecting our volunteers. Instead, we \nhave had a filibuster on a motion to proceed. This is not even the bill \nitself, this is just the motion to proceed. I assume we will have \nanother filibuster when we get to the bill itself.\n  This is a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. \nWe are a volunteer country, or we used to be. We are becoming a country \nof mercenaries. We are beginning to pay people to volunteer. Can they \ntruly be called a volunteer if they are paid to do that? And if we \nbegin to pay and pay constantly, will we ever have true volunteers?\n  We talk about the momentum of volunteers, and that has been a long \nand proud tradition in the United States. Volunteer organizations \nrepresent a distinctly American manner of living, living out the golden \nrule by strengthening our neighborhoods, our schools, and our churches.\n  When I was mayor of Gillette, we had tremendous growth, more than \ndoubled in size, and we needed everything basic that a community could \npossibly have. That included mostly water and sewer and streets. We did \nnot have money for parks that the people moving there wanted. We got an \nintern from the University of Wyoming to sit down with any group that \nwanted a park, and he would design a park for them. The catch was they \nhad to build it, and they did. We built seven parks in one summer with \nvolunteers. These were young people who were moving into a boom \ncommunity. If they had known about liability, I do not know that they \nwould have participated.\n  I spent 10 years as a soccer coach. I am not sure today I would be a \nsoccer coach. I don't think I could take the liability. I have worked \nwith Boy Scouts. It has become such a litigious society that the Boy \nScouts now have requirements that any time there is a boy working on a \nproject, there have to be two adults around, and that is to prevent \nlawsuits. The Boy Scouts used to have annual Christmas tree sales in \nGillette. When I went to serve with my son selling Christmas trees, I \nhad to have another adult along, because of our litigious society. That \ndefinitely discourages volunteers.\n  Volunteer organizations have strengthened and nourished the lives of \nour citizens and influenced every facet of our culture. A brief \nreflection on the myriad of volunteers and volunteer organizations that \nserve our fellow citizens should remind us of their tremendous value. \nThe volunteers of the Salvation Army help feed and clothe the less \nfortunate and provide Christmas gifts for thousands of children every \nyear. Meals on Wheels has for years provided more meals and \nconversation to many of our Nation's homebound. Habitat for Humanity \nhas helped revitalize our inner cities by providing privately owned \nhouses for the Nation's poor. Mother Theresa's Missionaries of Charity \ncares for thousands of dying AIDS patients and unwed mothers in the \npoorest neighborhoods across the country.\n\n  I could go on and on with the Jaycees, Lions Clubs, the Kiwanis, the \nRotary and the Optimists. The Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts help \ninstill in children the virtues of responsibility and enterprise, while \nLittle League and youth soccer leagues teach children the\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nvalues of team cooperation and hard work.\n  Volunteers in these organizations, and countless others, have given \ngenerously of themselves in order to help their neighbors and better \ntheir communities. Unfortunately, even these volunteers have fallen \nprey to our suit-happy legal system. Lawsuits, in recent years, have \nresulted in enormous verdicts against volunteers and nonprofit \norganizations. Too often these suits are for what most of us would \nconsider frivolous claims that penalize volunteers who are simply doing \ntheir jobs.\n  The threat of costly litigation and large verdicts have frightened \nmany good citizens away from giving their time and energy to volunteer \norganizations. It is time to curb that trend. The Volunteer Protection \nAct would relieve a volunteer from liability if the volunteer is acting \nwithin the scope and responsibility and if the volunteer is properly \nlicensed, certified and authorized by the State in which the harm \noccurred, if such authorization is required.\n  It also limits punitive damages that may be awarded against \nvolunteers and nonprofit organizations for the actions of the \nvolunteers. This bill does not protect volunteers from liability for \nactions which are willful or criminal or which involve gross \nnegligence. As such, this bill strikes a healthy balance. It provides \nbroad protection for volunteers who are performing their duties, while \nstill allowing people to recover against volunteers who cause harm from \nacts that are willful, criminal or grossly negligent.\n  Mr. President, it is time to restore some sanity to our tort system. \nLet's begin by protecting our Nation's volunteers from the slings and \narrows of outrageous litigation. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Volunteer Act.\n  As we were growing up, we were taught to do what is right, to do our \nbest, to treat others as we wanted to be treated, to take the common \ncourtesy of asking others what they need to have done, and in America, \nwe not only ask what they need to have done, but people follow up on \nthat, not to the degree that we could, not to the degree that we used \nto.\n  My mother always taught me that service is the price that you pay for \nthe space that you take up on this Earth. The service concept in this \nNation is a foundation that we have to continue to promote, and our \nsystem of litigation has taken that away from us. Let us restore \nservice and voluntarism in this country and give some protection.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself such time as I will consume out of that \n31 minutes.\n  Mr. President, when I hear the debate here on the floor, it strikes \nme that anyone who is watching or listening to this debate must think \nthat we are talking past each other. It must appear that we do not seem \nto be able to engage on any one subject. One Senator comes to the floor \nand talks about voluntarism, the need to protect volunteers from \nliability; another Senator talks about Alexis Herman, the President's \nnominee for Secretary of Labor and the need to get that nomination \nconfirmed. People cannot understand why we are not talking about the \nsame thing.\n  Let me just give my perspective of where we are.\n  On the Democratic side, the position that many of us are taking is \nthat we should not be going ahead with business as usual in the Senate \non the last day of April unless we can get the majority to agree to \nallow a vote on the President's Cabinet nominee. We are getting fairly \nfar into this year.\n  The President, several months ago, nominated Alexis Herman to be the \nSecretary of Labor. In the Labor and Human Resources Committee we voted \nunanimously to recommend to the full Senate that she be confirmed for \nthat position. Just in the last couple of weeks we have been told that \nvote will not be taken on the Senate floor, we will not have a chance \nto vote for her confirmation because some on the Republican side \ndisagree with the President's Executive order on another issue related \nto project labor agreements. He issued an Executive order on that \nsubject which they did not agree with.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Alexis Herman to \nbe our Secretary of Labor. Our committee, the Labor Committee, did \nreport that nomination to the full Senate for consideration. We did so \nunanimously. This was not a Democratic vote and Republicans opposed. It \nwas a unanimous vote. Unfortunately, we have not been able to go ahead \nand take that vote on the Senate floor.\n  When I tried to put this in some perspective--I have served here in \nthe Senate with three different Presidents in the White House. \nPresident Reagan, when he was in the White House--of course, much of \nthe time that he was there the Republicans controlled the Senate, so an \nissue like this never arose. But there were 2 years during which he was \nPresident when the Democrats controlled the Senate. I am not aware of \nany occasion where we refused to allow a vote on one of his nominations \nbecause we disagreed with one of the policies that President Reagan was \npursuing. We certainly disagreed with many of his policies, but I \ncannot recall any occasion where we refused to go ahead and permit a \nvote on one of his nominees in order to gain leverage and force him to \nchange a policy.\n  The same thing with President Bush. When President Bush was in \noffice, of course the Democrats controlled the Senate during that time, \nand he nominated his Cabinet members. I do not recall any effort on the \nDemocratic side to refuse to allow a vote on those Cabinet Members. I \nthink everyone agreed that the election was over, the President had the \nright to choose his own Cabinet, and that we in the Senate could object \nto some of those Cabinet individuals and we could vote no on their \nnomination, but we certainly would not deny the President the right to \na vote on those Cabinet members.\n  So I see what is happening here with Alexis Herman's nomination as \nsort of unprecedented, clearly unprecedented in the time that I have \nbeen here in the Senate in the last 14 years.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues are opposed to the \nadministration's plans to issue an Executive order on project labor \nagreements. I know that many of my colleagues may have fundamental \ndisagreements about the appropriateness of that Executive order. This \nis, in my view, simply not adequate grounds for refusing to go ahead \nand have a vote on his Cabinet nominee.\n  I personally support the administration's proposal on project labor \nagreements for a variety of reasons. And we can have that debate when \nthe issue comes up. As my friend from Wyoming, my colleague from \nWyoming, indicates, there is a bill being considered. Fine. Let us get \na piece of legislation out here. Let us have a vote on it. Let us do \nwhatever and send it to the President, and perhaps we can persuade him \nto sign something if we can get agreement on something that seems \nreasonable.\n  But the Executive order on project labor agreements has nothing to do \nwith whether or not the President should be able to appoint his own \nCabinet. We should allow him to do that. We should certainly allow a \nvote on the Senate floor on those Cabinet nominees. If the majority \nwants to turn down a nomination in order to make some point, clearly \nthat is a course they can pursue. But to deny a vote on the Senate \nfloor in order to try to register a complaint about the President's \npolicy, I think, is improper.\n\n  Ms. Herman presented herself extremely well to the Labor Committee. \nShe honestly and fully answered all questions put to her. I think she \nwon over several Senators who might have thought, going into that \nhearing, that they might not support her. She will be a strong advocate \nfor working families. She will work hard, I am persuaded, to help our \ncountry prepare for the next century. Her record of public service, her \nrecord of caring about people on issues that come before the Department \nof Labor, which is unquestioned, her commitment to serving her country \nare the reasons why all of us, as I said on the Democratic and \nRepublican side, in the committee joined to send her nomination to the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n  I know that if we get a vote on the Senate floor, it will be an \noverwhelming vote of support for this nominee because all of the \nSenators I have talked to believe she would be a good Secretary of \nLabor.\n  The working families of this country deserve to have someone in that \nposition which is a very important position at this time in our \nhistory. It is getting late in the legislative year. We need to go \nahead and allow the President to put his own nominee in there so that \nhe can proceed with his agenda.\n  I say there will be many opportunities over the course of this year \nand next year throughout the 105th Congress where we will debate issues \nsuch as project labor agreements here on the Senate floor. I think that \nis entirely as it should be. But I do not think it is appropriate for \nus to proceed with business as usual on the Senate floor while refusing \nto allow a vote on the President's nominee for Secretary of Labor.\n  So that is the basis for my objection to proceeding on this bill that \nis pending before the Senate today. I think it is a credible piece of \nlegislation which should be debated and should be seriously considered \nby the Senate. But it should be seriously considered by the Senate in a \ncircumstance where we are allowing the Executive branch and allowing \nthe President to go ahead and name his Cabinet. It is too late in the \nyear for us to be playing the kind of cynical game that is going on \nhere in denying a vote for this Secretary of Labor.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join on a bipartisan basis to bring that \nnomination to the floor and have that vote and then proceed to \nconsideration of this other legislation and then proceed to the \nconsideration of a great deal of other legislation that we should be \ngetting on with.\n  I think it is clear that the Senate is rudderless at this point. We \nhave very little on the Senate agenda. We look ahead to the next 2 or 3 \nweeks, and I do not see a great deal of constructive activity going \nforward here unless there is much more in the planning than I am aware \nof. But I do think the least we can do is to go ahead and get one \nimportant nomination up and vote on it at the soonest date possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of Senate \nResolution 78 and the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 78) to designate April 30, 1997, as \n     ``National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nResolution 78, which would designate April 30, 1997 as ``National Erase \nthe Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor and \nam pleased we have acted today to pass this resolution.\n  While I believe it is important to set aside a day for special focus \non fighting hatred and bigotry, this cannot be a 1 day event. That is \nwhy this resolution calls on every American to practice tolerance and \nto take a strong stand against hate crimes and violence in their \ncommunities each and every day.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senators Baucus and Burns, for introducing \nthis important legislation. This legislation will bring awareness to \nwhat is an unsettling trend in this country--the increasing incidents \nof hate crimes and the growing occurrences of discrimination.\n  I am greatly disturbed that hate crimes are on the rise. We saw \nevidence of that rise in the burning of African-American churches \naround the country, which apparently was motivated by racism. We saw it \nin the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City, which was \nreportedly motivated by anti-government hatred.\n  We've read and seen reports in the media about hate crimes. We've \nwitnessed the violent attacks against individuals because of their \nrace, gender, sexual orientation or their beliefs. It's evident in the \nincreasing number of individuals in this country who have joined fringe \ngroups like militias and other hate groups. We've also seen it in the \ngrowing anti-immigrant sentiment in our country. As the granddaughter \nof immigrants, I find this particularly repugnant.\n  I recently met with a group of Asian-Pacific-American community \nleaders from my State of Maryland. They shared with me very compelling \nstories about discrimination that is faced each and every day by Asian-\nPacific-Americans. Unfortunately, I hear this all too often when I meet \nwith minority groups.\n  Asian-Pacific-Americans in Maryland are concerned about their right \nto participate in the democratic process. They shared with me their \nfears that their right to engage in campaign electoral activities is \nbeing questioned, simply because of a few cases of alleged campaign \nfundraising abuses purportedly committed by members of the Asian-\nPacific-American community.\n  I have seen reports that indicate hate-motivated attacks on Asian-\nPacific-Americans have grown more than 38 percent since 1993. I find \nthat appalling. Violence against Asian-Pacific-Americans, as with other \nminority groups, is bred by stereotypes, discrimination, and tensions \nin communities.\n  I am concerned about what is happening in our country. It's \ninconceivable that more than 30 years after the passage of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, we are still grappling with racism in this country.\n  This plague of hatred has spread and reached our youth. A young \nAfrican-American boy in Chicago was brutally attacked recently by a \ngroup of white teenagers. What happened in Chicago is one of the most \nbrutal acts we have witnessed in recent years. It is even more \nappalling that the perpetrators were young teenagers.\n  We need to educate our youth on tolerance. We need to teach them not \nto hate and not to discriminate. We need to start this process early.\n  My State of Maryland is becoming more ethnically diverse. I meet with \nminority groups in my State often and they share the same concerns. \nThey are concerned about the climate of hate in our society. They fear \ndiscrimination in schools and in the work force. And most importantly, \nthey are concerned about their children and their children's future. If \nthis plague of hate continues in our country, what kind of future are \nwe ensuring for our most precious resource--our children?\n  We have to change the negative attitudes and perceptions in this \ncountry about minorities. We have to eliminate the persistence of \nviolent hate crimes against racial, ethnic, and religious groups.\n  To succeed in making our society free of hate, racism, and \ndiscrimination, we have to take a stand that we will not tolerate \nrandom acts of hate, subtle and overt racism, and wide-spread \ndiscrimination. I am committed to doing my part. This is a commitment \nthat has to be made by everyone.\n  I believe that this resolution will send the message that we will no \nlonger tolerate hate and discrimination in this country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a \ncosponsor to Senate Resolution 78. This resolution designates April 30, \n1997, as National Erase the Hate Day.'' I support this resolution \nbecause it not only designates a day to focus on solutions to hate \ncrimes, but also calls upon all nations, States, neighborhoods, and \ncommunities to take a stand against these hate crimes.\n  As I have stated many times, ours is a nation of immigrants \nconsisting of people from various racial, ethnic, and religious \nancestries. People came here from around the world to become part of a \nnation of independence, opportunity and freedom. There should be no \ntolerance or acceptance of any crimes--especially those crimes which \ntarget their victims simply because of\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\ntheir race, ethnicity, or religious background.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has published the first \ncomprehensive summary of hate crimes in America. Their publication, \nCause for Concern, Hate Crimes in America, provides a number of \nexamples of hate crimes that have resulted in injury or even death to \ninnocent people solely on account of their racial and other makeup.\n  For example, on June 11, 1995, arsonists burned down the home of a \nLatino family in the Antelope Valley, CA, city of Palmdale. They spray \npainted ``white power'' and ``your family dies'' on the walls.\n  In August of 1992, a 19 year old Vietnamese American pre-med student \nin Coral Springs, FL, was beaten to death by a mob of white youths who \ncalled him ``chink'' and ``Vietcong.''\n  And, in Oklahoma City, following the bombing of the Federal office \nbuilding, an Iraqi refugee in her mid-twenties miscarried her near-term \nbaby after an April 20 attack on her home. Unknown assailants pounded \non the door of her home, broke windows, and screamed anti-Islamic \nepithets.\n  Mr. President, there is no room in our country for these kinds of \ncrimes. We must not allow them to continue. We currently have Federal \nlaws against hate crimes. Further, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights reports that 47 States and the District of Columbia have passed \ntheir own hate crime laws. Among other things, these laws ban vandalism \nagainst religious institutions such as churches, synagogues, and \nmosques.\n  It is my sincere hope that this resolution will inspire more people \nto stand up against all hate crimes in all their forms.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 78) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the term ``hate crime'' means an offense in which \n     one or more individuals, commits an offense (such as an \n     assault or battery (simple or aggravated), theft, criminal \n     trespass, damage to property, mob action, disorderly conduct, \n     or telephone harassment) by reason of the race, color, creed, \n     religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or \n     mental disability, or national origin of another individual \n     or group of individuals;\n       Whereas there are almost 8,000 hate crimes reported to the \n     Department of Justice each year, and the number of hate \n     crimes reported increases each year;\n       Whereas hate crimes have no place in a civilized society \n     that is dedicated to freedom and independence, as is the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must lead and set \n     the example for the world in protecting the rights of all \n     people;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should take \n     personal responsibility for and action against hatred and \n     hate crimes;\n       Whereas the Members of Congress, as representatives of the \n     people of the United States, must take personal \n     responsibility for and action against hatred and hate crimes;\n       Whereas the laws against hate crimes, which have been \n     passed by Congress and signed by the President, must be \n     supported and implemented by the people of the United States \n     and by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials \n     and other public servants: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 1997, as ``National Erase the Hate \n     and Eliminate Racism Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and throughout \n     the world to recognize the importance of using each day as an \n     opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence \n     in their nations, states, neighborhoods, and communities.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to my good \ncolleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. \nThere is--and the public knows this better than we do--a lot of \nlegislation we debate on the floor of this body that might make sense \nin Washington, but does not make sense outside of Washington. We spend \na lot of time debating legislation that does not make a difference in \npeople's lives. This bill, S. 543, not only expresses American common \nsense--at least from my part of the country, Midwestern common sense--\nbut it also says no to Washington nonsense.\n  This bill gives me an opportunity, at the same time, to compliment \nthe Senator from Georgia for the outstanding work that he is doing in \nthis area.\n  Debate of legislation that solidly promotes voluntarism is an example \nof Congress spending some of its time to get something done where there \nis a real reward. It is an example of the taxpayers' money well spent, \nto pay us to write legislation that will encourage Americans to do what \nwe have a tradition of doing in this country--volunteering.\n  I am sure Alexis de Tocqueville has been quoted on the floor of the \nSenate often during the debate of this bill. One observation that the \nFrench nobleman made when he came to this country in the 1830's to \nstudy our new system of government, was the American tradition of \nvoluntarism that he saw in our churches and in our volunteer \nsocieties--or as he termed them ``societies of cooperation.'' He \nbelieved that one of the wonderful and unique aspects of our society \nwas that neighbor helps neighbor. Yet, now our society has impediments \nto this tradition of voluntarism, to this neighbor helping neighbor.\n  Our good friend from Georgia has a solution that restores the \nvoluntarism that de Tocqueville observed. This very important \nlegislation will remove one impediment to voluntarism in America. This \nbill will lessen the threat of a lawsuit for volunteers and their \norganizations. So here we are today discussing some legislation that is \ncommon sense. We are wisely spending our time and energy debating \nlegislation that would provide to the taxpayer, in volunteer hours, \nmore return on the taxpayers' dollars than anything we do.\n  I come here to support the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and to \ncompliment Senator Coverdell. This legislation has two important \nbenefits. First, it promotes voluntarism. It promotes voluntarism at \nthe time of the big volunteer crusade in Philadelphia. Praise the Lord \nfor the people that were involved in that because that was a very \nworthwhile project and it was bipartisan. The Congress can do something \nthrough this legislation that will help that effort as well. So this \nlegislation promotes voluntarism, and it also enacts much needed tort \nreform.\n  Volunteers are vital to the health and welfare of our communities, \nStates, and our Nation. We all rely on the kindness of friends and \nstrangers. Volunteers are often these people, whether we see them or \nnot, who bring meals to the homebound; who clean up trash along our \nhighways; who respond to natural disasters. I will point out just a few \nrecent examples.\n  The United Way of Central Iowa rallied 2,500 volunteers--nearly twice \nas many as in 1995--to complete 97 projects. Among these volunteers was \na troop of Brownies who baked brownies for the children and families at \nthe local Ronald McDonald House.\n  At the American Red Cross homeless shelter in Rockford, VT, 47 \nvolunteers, including 15 shelter residents, painted and cleaned the \nshelter, dug a new pathway in its yard, and picked up litter in the \nneighborhood.\n\n  The George Washington High School swim team in Danville, VA, gave an \nhour of free swimming lessons to 60 nonswimmers in grades 2 through 4.\n  In Detroit, MI, kids from University CAMP and Detroit Country Day \nSchool painted, cleaned, and removed graffiti and boarded up vacant \nhomes.\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\n  The Men's Club of Oakland Methodist Church in Maryville, TN, \ninstalled carpeting and built a wheelchair ramp for a needy family \nwhose 8-year-old daughter is in a wheelchair.\n  These are only a few of the volunteers whose efforts have come to my \nattention. This is just a sampling of what volunteers give to our \ncommunities. We have an obligation to these volunteers and to their \norganizations beyond the casual ``thank you.'' If they are going to \nmake these efforts, we must do everything in our power to enable and \nencourage them. We owe it to them to make their burden lighter and \ntheir jobs easier. We owe it to the organizations to make it as easy as \npossible for them to recruit volunteers. We must lower the risk \nincurred by volunteers and their organizations.\n  This bill lowers the risk. It limits potential liability for \nvolunteers and their organizations. It is only fitting that we pass \nthis legislation for all of the volunteers and their organizations who \nput forth the sweat and the labor to accomplish so many good deeds. It \nis simply fair and equitable. That is what this legislation is all \nabout.\n  I am a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairman \nof the subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue. I can tell you \nfrom my experience in this position that this is badly needed reform. \nThe purpose of our civil court system is to establish liability and to \ncompensate the injured. It does not always accomplish this now. I \nbelieve that our court system needs reform, including punitive damage \nreform. Punitive damages are an unpredictable risk for companies and \nvolunteer organizations. They are sometimes a windfall to those less \ninjured, while the truly injured do not receive the same financial \namount. Our court system should not be a lottery but, instead, should \naward all who are similarly injured with similar compensation. \nLikewise, those punished should be punished equally for similar \ntransgressions.\n  This bill does not accomplish all of the needed reforms for the \nsystem. However, it is a solid first step. It will give the volunteer \ncommunity some certainty of the risks that it faces. It does not \nrelieve anyone of liability for conduct that is criminal, grossly \nnegligent or reckless. It continues to hold those who intentionally \ncommit wrongdoing liable for such acts. It is a good, fair bill that \nwill boost the volunteer community and volunteers.\n  So I strongly urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nthink of the volunteers that they know, the people represented by the \nPresident and ex-Presidents and by Colin Powell in Philadelphia, the \npeople they have met along the way, as well, and perhaps even \nvolunteers who personally helped them. That is what this bill is all \nabout. It is about volunteers and not about trial lawyers.\n  As everyone on this floor knows, the highly paid trial lawyers have \nset out to stop this bill. Of course, too many in this body, \nparticularly a large majority on the other side of the aisle, are doing \nthe trial lawyers' bidding, as you can see from the opposition to this \nbill. The trial lawyers want to stop this bill because it will cost \nthem money. It will reduce their legal fees in most cases when they are \nsuing a volunteer or volunteer organization. But this bill is not and \nshould not be about trial lawyers and not about trial lawyers' \ncompensation. This is a bill about what America is about, about \nvolunteering and about volunteers. It is about the people who do things \nthat they do not even want to be thanked for; it is about selfless \npeople who give of their time and give it freely to those in need.\n\n  It is to these people that we owe something. That is what the \nPhiladelphia conference was all about. We owe it to the volunteers to \nmake their jobs easier. That is what this bill does. I ask my \ncolleagues to put volunteers ahead of trial lawyers and to support this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for his \nlong work in this area of legal reform and for his comments here today. \nThey were particularly thoughtful.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, twenty seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a very brief rebuttal to the argument \nwe just heard from the Senator from New Mexico. He said the holding of \nthis Cabinet nominee was unprecedented. I cannot speak to that one way \nor another. I have only been here 4 years, but I can say that the \nactions of his President, our President, are also unprecedented. An \nExecutive order that totally rewrites labor law and obviates the \nConstitution is unprecedented and has no standing, in my judgment, in \nthis debate--none.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa said it eloquently. This is one we do \nfor the volunteers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I believe that the \ngoal of encouraging voluntarism is a laudable one. I stand ready to \nwork with others on a bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to doing so. \nThis bill, S. 543, is not the answer and appears not even to ask the \nright question. It is flawed and would benefit from attention through \nthe normal legislative process of hearing, public comment, review, \ncommittee consideration, amendment and report, and Senate action. \nInstead, the majority is trying to force this bill through the Senate \nto catch the train of press coverage on the Presidents' summit on \nAmerica's future.\n  The contrast between what has taken place in Philadelphia and here in \nWashington could not be more stark. In Philadelphia, thousands of \nvolunteers and activists are joining with leaders who have served as \nPresidents from both major political parties, First Ladies, involved \ncelebrities, and corporate sponsors. The summit may well spark a \nrenewed dedication among the millions of Americans to get involved to \nmake a difference.\n  Ours is a tradition rich in neighbor helping neighbor and citizen \nservice. The honest involvement of so many and the commitment to \nimprove the lives and futures of 15 million children is extraordinary.\n  By contrast, this week the Republican controlled Senate simply cannot \nabide the nonpartisan events in Philadelphia. I do not know whether it \nis the involvement of Gen. Colin Powell, Nancy Reagan, George and \nBarbara Bush, or President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton that is driving the \nRepublican leadership bonkers, but something has. Is it not possible \nthat something happening outside of Washington can have meaning to \nmillions of Americans without congressional Republicans having to \ninsert themselves for partisan gain. I asked yesterday why we are being \nforced to take up the ill-considered S. 543. The answer is because the \nRepublican leadership says so. Otherwise, they might miss out on \nclaiming credit in connection with this week's activities in \nPhiladelphia. I guess in their minds nothing happens that does not \ninvolve their political agenda. Voluntarism should not be about \npolitics. The summit was not partisan and about politics. \nUnfortunately, this heavyhanded effort is purely partisan.\n  I suggest that the 130 cosponsors of all political persuasion who \nhave joined in the approach outlined by H.R. 911 may have a better \nidea. It is much less of the Federal Government knows best approach \nthat is embodied in S. 543. Indeed, I suspect that sometime soon the \nRepublican majority will try to snuff out this alternative approach to \nthe excesses of S. 543. The House bill is too acceptable an \nalternative, too widely supported to be tolerated in these partisan \ntimes. Only a bill with a pure Republican pedigree will be tolerated in \nthis 105th Congress. How quickly the Republican leadership has \nforgotten the lessons of legislating through bipartisan cooperation for \nthe good of the country.\n  Why is the Federal incursion into State law and local volunteer \nactivity needed? Why is this bill the top priority for Congress? Why \nhas the majority leader threatened to shut down the Senate until this \nparticular bill is passed and devoted an entire week to it? Well, the \nbill purports to protect volunteers from ``liability abuses.'' \nVoluntarism is at an all-time high according to the Wall Street \nJournal--and that was before the summit in Philadelphia. This morning \nthe principal sponsor of the bill and the majority leader clarified \nthat it is not so much that judgments are being awarded against \nvolunteers or volunteer organizations but that there is a threat of \nsuit. If that is so then why are we being forced to adopt broad-based \nFederal standards, which by the way will\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nnot prevent the filing of lawsuits but only provide a series of Federal \nlaw defenses based on factual proof after hearings?\n  Why not, instead, encourage the States in their efforts to allow or \nrequire indemnification of volunteers for the costs of suit? That is \nwhat Georgia and Vermont and many other States have already done.\n  Where are the outrageous jury awards against charitable organizations \nthat threaten voluntarism in America? This morning the proponents of \nthis legislation admit that they do not exist. Nonetheless, purportedly \nin the interests of the beneficiaries of their services, we are being \nasked to adopt a Federal standard other than the exercise of due care \nthat such activities otherwise might be held to under 200 years of \nState law development even though the behaviors we are discussing will \naffect the most vulnerable among us.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement \nof administration policy received from the administration.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n     (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the \n         concerned agencies.)\n     S. 543--Volunteer Protection Act of 1997--(Coverdell (R) \n         Georgia and 10 cosponsors)\n       Although the Administration strongly supports national and \n     community service and volunteerism, it opposes S. 543.\n       The President has a deep commitment to volunteer and \n     service activities and supports efforts to encourage \n     Americans to engage in these activities. The Administration \n     will work with Congress on proposals that, while respecting \n     state law, help provide reasonable liability protection to \n     volunteers involved in the delivery of needed services.\n       S. 543 is not such a bill. Without any hearings \n     demonstrating the inadequacy of state law in this area, S. \n     543 effects a sweeping preemption of state law in cases \n     involving ``non-profit organizations'' and ``volunteers.'' \n     The over-broad definitions in the bill--which might apply to \n     hate groups, street gangs, or violent militia--make this \n     takeover of state law potentially troubling.\n       As with broader tort reform measures, the Administration is \n     also troubled by the legislation's one-way preemption--state \n     laws would be preempted if they favor plaintiffs, but not if \n     they favor defendants--and by Section 5 of the Bill, which \n     would totally abolish joint-and-several liability for \n     noneconomic damages (e.g., pain and suffering). This \n     provision would unfairly discriminate against the most \n     vulnerable members of our society--the elderly, the poor, \n     children, and nonworking women--whose injuries often involve \n     mostly noneconomic losses. Noneconomic damages are as \n     important to victims as economic damages and must not be \n     relegated to second-class status.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the statement notes the President's deep \ncommitment to volunteer and service activities, indeed his AmeriCorps \ninitiation and participation at the summit are both noteworthy examples \nof his commitment. The statement notes as I have the overbroad \ndefinitions in the bill and its unnecessary takeover of State law, \namong other serious problems.\n  The principal sponsor came to the floor this morning to say that the \nKu Klux Klan is not included within the bill's definition of nonprofit \norganizations that would be covered by its provisions. Unfortunately, \nhe did not say why. Wishing does not change the words of the bill.\n  To my colleagues who believe S. 543 could not immunize the Ku Klux \nKlan from liability, let me refer you to a letter to me from Morris \nDees of the Southern Poverty Law Center. As many of us know, this \norganization has been on the front lines in the battle against hate \ngroups like the KKK. The Southern Poverty Law Center is acutely aware, \nprobably more so that most of my colleagues, of the hateful acts \nperpetrated by groups like the KKK. Yet the Senate is considering a \nbill that would potentially bestow liability immunity upon the KKK.\n  I know that every one of my colleagues violently opposes the KKK and \nwould not support liability protection for them, but because we have \nnot been given adequate time to consider this bill, flawed provisions \nlike this overbroad definition remain.\n  The definition of nonprofit organizations includes the Government and \nnot-for-profit organizations. Not-for-profit organizations appear to be \nself-defined to include any organization ``conducted for public benefit \nand operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, \nwelfare, or health purposes.''\n  Who decides which groups qualify for limited liability under this \ndefinition and what happens when groups like the KKK declare themselves \na noncommercial, nonprofit volunteer organization?\n  The Southern Poverty Law Center realizes this and opposes S. 543 \nbecause they know the Senate bill before us would make it more \ndifficult to prosecute hate groups like the KKK. To quote Morris Dees, \nthe highly respected director of the Southern Poverty Law Center:\n\n       We strongly urge you to withdraw this legislation and vote \n     against any law that limits the ability of our civil justice \n     system to punish those people and organizations that inflict \n     unspeakable injuries on our friends, neighbors, family \n     members and communities. Please, do not help protect white \n     supremacists, neo-Nazi organizations, violence-prone militia \n     groups and others who commit hate crimes.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know about my colleagues, but when Morris Dees \nspeaks, I think we should pause and listen. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Dees' letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      The Southern\n\n\n                                           Poverty Law Center,\n\n                                   Montgomery, AL, April 29, 1997.\n     Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Southern Poverty Law Center opposes \n     Senate Bill 543, legislation that would make it more \n     difficult to sue non-profit organizations. Because the bill \n     broadly covers all non-profit organizations, it would protect \n     white supremacists, neo-Nazi and violent militia groups. \n     These are the types of organizations the Southern Poverty Law \n     Center has crippled over the past ten years through the use \n     of both federal and state tort laws.\n       Senate Bill 543 raises the standard of care and the \n     standard of proof in punitive damages cases, making it harder \n     for the victims of hate activity and racial attacks to punish \n     wrongdoers. For example, it would allow punitive damages \n     against non-profit organizations or its volunteers if their \n     misconduct constituted ``willful or criminal misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed.'' However, misconduct that constitutes \n     ``gross neligence'' or ``recklessness'' would be exempt from \n     such damages. In other words, if a cross burning were legally \n     held on Ku Klux Klan property and a larger fire ensued, \n     spreading to a neighbor's home and killing the neighbor, the \n     KKK would be immune from punitive damages if its conduct \n     constituted ``recklessness'' or ``gross negligence.''\n       The bill does contain a number of narrow exceptions for \n     volunteers, including misconduct that constitutes a crime of \n     violence, hate crime, sexual offense or civil rights \n     violation. However, these kinds of misconduct are only exempt \n     from the bill's restrictions if the defendant was first \n     convicted in a criminal court. Our cases against Klan and \n     White Aryan Resistance leaders would not have fallen under \n     Senate Bill 543's exemptions, since these individuals had no \n     prior criminal convictions. Moreover, the $12.5 million \n     judgment we obtained against the White Aryan Resistance, \n     which put this group out of business, consisted mostly of \n     punitive damages which may have been subject to Senate Bill \n     543's limitations.\n       Important questions relating to a non-profit organization's \n     responsibility and conduct are liability issues judges and \n     juries should decide, not Congress. We strongly support your \n     opposition to this legislation that would limit the ability \n     of our civil justice system to punish those people and \n     organizations that inflict unspeakable injuries on our \n     friends, neighbors, family members and communities. Thank you \n     for not helping to protect white supremacists, neo-Nazi \n     organizations, violence-prone militia groups and others who \n     commit hate crimes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Morris Dees.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor prior to \nthe vote to respond briefly to the distinguished majority leader. We \nhave had the good fortune to work together\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\non a number of issues, and I am disappointed that at least to date on \nthis matter we have not been able to find common agreement.\n  I am disappointed with his announcement that we would not be taking \nup additional legislation, which I assume he meant even the emergency \nsupplemental disaster assistance legislation until we dispose of this \nbill. I have expressed my concerns already about the need to expedite \nconsideration of disaster help to 23 States who are waiting for us to \nrespond quickly.\n  The situation all through the country, but especially in the upper \nMidwest, is very severe. There are thousands of people who are homeless \ntoday as a result of the floods and natural disasters that they have \nhad to face, thousands of people without businesses, thousands of \npeople without homes, and thousands of people without schools. These \nthousands of people, hopefully, will be able to get through in spite of \nthese difficulties and who still have hope that we can respond as \nquickly as possible.\n  I do not know who the anonymous donor was, but apparently an \nanonymous donor has agreed to provide $2,000 to every person living in \nGrand Forks and East Grand Forks to help them get through these \ndifficulties. We estimate that is at least a $10 million contribution. \nWell, if somebody, anonymously, can do that, it seems to me that this \nCongress can also respond--obviously, without anonymity--but as quickly \nand as effectively as this donor has.\n\n  So I hope that we can move this. I hope we are not going to subject \nthis to extraneous legislation and I hope that, regardless of whether \nwe agree or disagree on this particular bill, we recognize the urgency \nwith which we have to deal with this issue and come to grips with it \nand respond, as we have in other emergency situations.\n  We ought to recognize that it is not Democrats or Republicans who are \ngoing to suffer the consequences of delay; it is farmers, businesses, \nchildren, hospitals, and so many people who await our decision--not by \nthe week or the day, but by the hour. So we don't have much \nopportunity. South Dakota was hit, Mississippi was hit, North Dakota \nwas hit--23 States. So we all know the dramatic repercussions that \nnatural disasters can have, and we know how critical it is that we \nrespond as quickly as possible.\n  On this particular piece of legislation, I have a great respect for \nthe distinguished Senator from Georgia. I differ with him on this \nparticular bill, in part, because I, frankly, think there is a better \nway to do it. Congressman Porter, Senator Leahy, and others have worked \non legislation that would allow us to deal with the legitimate \ncircumstances presented by the distinguished Senator from Georgia, but \nin a way that also protects individuals who may be physically abused or \nsexually abused, or who may be victims of circumstance and have no \nrecourse if this legislation were to pass. We want to be sure that we \ncan provide a meaningful way with which to provide the balance, I \nguess, between the need of victims to address problems and the need for \nvolunteer organizations to be protected from lawsuits that, in many \ncases, are frivolous. So we are seeking balance here. I think we can \nprovide better balance in the Porter-Leahy legislation.\n  The majority leader came to the floor this morning and put a new \nurgency on this bill that I had not heard before. If there was such \nurgency, it is somewhat surprising to me that our Republican colleagues \ndid not see fit to move it through the legislative process with the \nsame degree of urgency. Why didn't we hold hearings immediately upon \nthe introduction of the bill? Why didn't we have a markup in the \ncommittee if it was so urgent? Why hasn't there been more discussion? \nAnd why wasn't the Democratic leader consulted about the urgency and \nthe nature of this legislation weeks ago, to say this week we are going \nto take this up because it is urgent? No one said anything to me about \nurgency. I first heard about urgency today. I am puzzled by the urgency \nthat we have now attributed to this legislation, given the record.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that we can figure out a way to compromise \non this legislation in a way that would allow us to expeditiously move \nthis process along. Regardless of circumstance, I hope that we will not \nhold hostage the emergency disaster legislation in an effort to \nleverage passage of this bill. We can do better than that. There ought \nto be ways with which to work this out, as we have found the ability to \nwork out so many other somewhat controversial and, at times, \ncomplicated pieces of legislation. Two weeks ago, we got a unanimous \nconsent agreement that was four pages long. If we can pass a unanimous \nconsent agreement that is that complex, taking us four pages, on a \ntreaty as controversial as chemical weapons was just last week, it \nseems to me that we ought to take something for which there ought to be \nbroad-based interest and support and find a way to compromise this in a \nway that allows us to move it along.\n  Quite clearly, there is another matter involved here. The papers \naddressed it this morning. We are equally troubled by the fact that Ms. \nHerman has been subjected to an amazing array of practices that I hope \nwill cease. She has had her hearing. She has been investigated, \nreinvestigated, and subjected to an array of questions. She has been \nbrought in for special meetings and special explanations. She has been \nthe subject of a great deal of rumor, innuendo, and media outlets \nacross the country. She has presented herself in a way that I think is \nas professional as any I have ever seen. The President deserves the \nright to have his advisers, to have his Cabinet working with him. Once \nwe have decided that she is qualified--and I guess that based upon the \nunanimity with which she was approved in the committee, there is a \nbipartisan recognition of her qualifications--that should be it. She \nhas dispelled all the questions. She has responded as affirmatively as \nshe knows how to do. The President has made public his choice. What is \nthere left that must be done to advance her nomination?\n\n  We have tried to negotiate. We have tried in as many ways as possible \nto work through this. We are left with no recourse but to oppose \ncloture so long as we can't get some understanding of what there is \nleft to do in the case of the nomination of Alexis Herman to be \nSecretary of Labor. So we want to move that, too. We want to find a way \nto resolve that impediment as well. It is not our desire to hold things \nup. But when we bypass the committees and then don't take up \nlegislation or nominations that certainly warrant consideration on the \nSenate floor in an expeditious manner, whether it is the emergency \nsupplemental or the nomination of a Labor Secretary who has been \nconfirmed now for some time by the committee itself, then the question \ncomes, what options do we have left?\n  At least the volunteer bill gets a cloture vote. Maybe we ought to \nsubject Ms. Herman to a vote, and if there is a certain degree of \nopposition to that, we can have a cloture vote on her nomination. But \nwe don't even get that. So this isn't the way I hoped we could achieve \nmore meaningful bipartisanship on a whole array of issues. I hope we \ncan do that on all of the bills I mentioned and all of the nominations \nstill pending on the Executive Calendar.\n  I might say, Mr. President--on the number of nominations--the other \nday when I looked, there were four pages of them on the Senate \nCalendar. I see now on page 11, ``Nominations Placed on the Secretary's \nDesk,'' are now such that we have virtually 11 pages of them, of people \nthat await confirmation, await a decision by the Senate, people whose \nlives are affected by delay, just as my disaster victims are affected \nby delay.\n  The question is, how much longer will they wait? What is it they must \nwait for? Is it a concern about their qualifications? Is it a concern \nabout something in their background? Is it simply an unwillingness on \nthe part of the majority to deal with the business that we have \navailable to us, which we must address? Every President has the right \nto make nominations and to make decisions with regard to the personnel \nin his or her administration. That is the least we can afford this \nadministration, but more importantly, the least we ought to be able to \nafford those people whose names are on these 11 pages.\n  So let's get on with the business and let's move ahead. Let's find a \ncompromise on this bill. Let's confirm Ms. Herman. And above and beyond \neverything else, let's make absolutely certain that we pass the \ndisaster bill as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, as we discuss the topic of voluntarism, I \nrise today to acknowledge a group of individuals who are making a very \nbig difference, a tremendous difference as the people of Minnesota are \nfighting the floodwaters that have paralyzed so much of our State.\n  The men and women of the Minnesota National Guard have stepped up \nthese last several weeks and served with distinction under what have \nbeen very deplorable conditions. Battling a rising river is back-\nbreaking work in itself. It is nearly impossible when combined with the \nice and the extreme cold produced by a blizzard. Yet those are the \nconditions that the Guard endured as they worked side by side with the \nresidents of Minnesota's flood devastated communities.\n  Well over 2,000 National Guard troops have been called up to assist \nin both preventing flood damage and cleaning up when the waters finally \nbegin to recede. These are men and women who have full-time jobs and \nlives outside the Guard and take time away from their other \nresponsibilities to fulfill an obligation they feel to Minnesota and \nits communities. Many of the mayors and elected officials within the \ndeclared disaster area told me that the Guard has been such an integral \npart of their flood response efforts that they cannot imagine being \nwithout their assistance. The National Guard have always been \ninstrumental in so many ways, in so many communities, that it is nearly \nimpossible to list every activity in which they have been involved.\n\n  Now, as the flood waters began to rise, they helped with the \nsandbagging that saved so many homes and buildings. They went door to \ndoor, urging residents to leave before the waters forced them to go. \nThey put their engineering expertise to work, finding ways to ward off \nthe flooding. And when it came time to evacuate, the National Guard \nplayed a key role moving Minnesotans to safety, whether by helicopter \nor truck, and helped evacuate nursing homes and hospitals. When all the \nresidents were gone, they were there to guard the deserted towns and \nkept away sightseers and potential looters. The Guard's water \npurification units and electrical generators have been invaluable \nduring the flooding.\n  The members of the Minnesota National Guard have served with little \nsleep and under the worst of conditions, but they have continually \nexceeded our expectations and they deserve a great deal of the credit \nfor leading us through this time of crisis. Without the Guard, I think \nit is safe to say that a great many more lives would have been lost and \na great deal more property would have been damaged. They have earned \nthe respect and the deep gratitude of all Minnesotans and I salute them \nfor standing with us and I thank them for their service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3818-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3818-S3819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just before the vote, the minority \nleader was speaking. Of course he addressed many matters not related to \nthe legislation before us, but he did allude to it. I appreciate the \nkind remarks that he made and that perhaps there could be work done to \narrive at an agreement which both sides--at least he could agree with. \nBut he specifically alluded to the situation where you would not want \nto have a volunteer involved with a sexual harassment or sexual crime.\n  I really do hope--this is not a long piece of legislation. It is 12 \npages. I wish the staffs and Members would read it. I want to read this \nbrief section, to respond to his comment:\n\n       Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--The limitations on \n     the liability of a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or \n     governmental entity under this section shall not apply [Note. \n     No protection.

There may be others, but this is \nnot, because a volunteer, involved in that type of activity, is not \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, I might point out, too, the announcement that this \nlegislation would be before the Senate was published in the calendar \nissued by the majority leader to everybody, including the minority \nleader, some time back. It specifically said that on Monday, April 28, \nthis is the legislation that would be before us. We are now up to 55 \nvotes to break this filibuster. I guess I could be somewhat relieved. \nAt the rate we are going we will only need five more cloture votes and \nwe will actually be able to proceed to the congressional response to \nthe President's summit on voluntarism. We have heard a lot about \ngridlock, about not being able to do anything, and this is a very \nvisible example right here on the Senate floor of the obstacle and \nhurdle, the gridlock that is preventing us from proceeding to a very \ngood piece of legislation. It has broad support all across the country. \nIt would help volunteers step forward and participate and respond to \nthe President's request. But we are being blocked by a Democrat \nfilibuster to prevent our proceeding to S. 543, the Volunteer \nProtection Act.\n\n  I would like to take a moment or two, here, to talk about the \nresponses to the limited debate from the other side about the bill. \nMost of the debate has been about other subjects.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator for yielding. \nOne of the reasons for the discussion about the other subjects is \nespecially the gravity of the disaster that has occurred in the States \nof Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota. A number of us wanted to \naddress the issue. We face a markup this afternoon, and hope very much \nthat can occur without extraneous amendments and we wanted to discuss \nthat a bit. I appreciate very much the courtesy.\n  I wonder if the Senator might indicate to me when we might be able to \nget some time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Of course we are on S. 543, as you know.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would say I would need maybe another 10 or 15 \nminutes on this matter before yielding to the other side.\n  Let me also say, in deference, having experienced this sort of \nnatural disaster in my own State, I can appreciate the deep concern of \nthe Senator about it. It is my understanding that the supplemental is \nbeing marked up this afternoon. To have listened to the debate \nyesterday, you would have thought it was already out of committee, \nthough. That is a proposal that is still in committee. This is a matter \nthat is before the Senate.\n  We have heard that voluntarism is healthier than ever, we have \nmillions of volunteers, and we do not need a bill to encourage \nvoluntarism. That is simply not the case, clearly not the case. \nAccording to the Independent Sector report, the percentage of Americans \nvolunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and \n48 percent in 1993. So, from 1989, the number of Americans willing to \nvolunteer has dropped 54, to 51, to 48. There may be any number of \nfactors involved. I commend the President and ex-Presidents for trying \nto step forward and call on Americans to reverse the trend.\n  If they want to reverse the trend, they are going to have to deal \nwith this subject. They are going to have to make it not a threat to be \na volunteer. They are going to have to create a condition that the \nvolunteer, in addition to being asked to come forward and provide the \npublic service, is not at the same time saying, ``And I am going to \ntake my family's home and bank account and put them on a Russian \nroulette lottery wheel to see if they are going to be at risk.''\n  The Gallup organization studied voluntarism and found, in a study \ntitled, ``Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit \nAssociations,'' that approximately 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has \nexperienced the resignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns. \nThe only way we are going to turn that around is to pass S. 543, and to \ndo it quickly. All the work of General Powell and the Presidents and \nthe 30 Governors and 100 mayors in Philadelphia--that is a beautiful \nvisual, and inspirational, but, unless we do something pragmatic like \nprotecting these volunteers, you are not going to get the response that \nyou are looking for.\n  The Gallup organization also found that one in six volunteers \nreported withholding services due to a fear of exposure to liability \nsuits. That is the point I made about, you step forward to volunteer \nbut you are also putting at risk your home, your assets, your savings \naccounts. That is a little bit more to ask of a volunteer than I think \nthey will find to be acceptable.\n  One in seven nonprofit agencies have eliminated one or more of their \nvaluable programs because of exposure to lawsuits. So, there are a \nnumber of conditions at play here. Not only do the organizations have \nto invest more of their dollars into insurance costs to try to protect \nthe volunteers--and of course when it goes to insurance it is not \nbuying swimming lessons, it is not feeding the hungry, it does not pay \nfor medicine or assistance that goes to an elderly person. It goes to \nan insurance company to protect the volunteer, as best they can, from a \nlawyer in a lawsuit.\n  So, it is diverting resources away from the purposes of the charity. \nIt says, ``We have heard that there is no evidence of a national crisis \ninvolving a flood of lawsuits and huge damage awards against volunteers \nof nonprofit organizations.''\n  First, volunteers and organizations sued are not interested in \npublicizing the fact. They would just as soon it not be heard. So you \nreally don't have a true sense of the magnitude of these lawsuits. \nSecond, many cases are settled out of court. So there is no judgment \nentered. Again, insurance companies are not interested in publicizing \nor providing data on their settlements.\n\n  Mr. President, I am told we have several Senators who are seeking \ntime on various matters. I am going to ask unanimous consent, see if I \ncan get this right, that we would next turn to Senator Dorgan for 10 \nminutes, go to Senator McCain for 10 minutes, Senator Conrad for 10 \nminutes and Senator Hutchison for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3818-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3819-S3824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE DISASTER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know there is discussion this morning, \nagain, about a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee this \nafternoon, now scheduled for 2 o'clock, to deal with the disaster \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I come to the floor only to urge, as \nI did yesterday, that the committee consider the disaster \nappropriations bill and the issues in that bill without adding \nadditional extraneous amendments or matters that are unrelated to the \nbill.\n  I do not want to or intend to debate other issues. There are people \nwho have amendments, I am sure, that they feel strongly about--\namendments on various bills. But I encourage them very strongly to find \nother places to offer amendments if they feel they need to offer \namendments.\n  We have several amendments that I understand have been noticed that \nhave nothing at all to do with the disaster supplemental bill. They are \nextraneous, unrelated issues that people want to put on this piece of \nlegislation because, I suppose, they believe this kind of legislation \nwill ultimately be signed by the President. But, to add extraneous or \nunrelated matters to this supplemental appropriations bill that is to \nbe passed to respond to a disaster, only will increase the amount of \ntime it takes to enact this bill. It will jeopardize the passage, I \nsuspect, if they are very controversial amendments. And, in my \njudgment, that is not what we should do on this disaster bill.\n  So, I encourage my colleagues today, as we go to a markup, to join \nall of us in working to pass a bill that is free of extraneous or \nunrelated amendments that would cause problems for the bill.\n  I want, as I did yesterday, to commend Senator Stevens and Senator \nByrd and all of the others on the committee who, in a bipartisan way, \nhave worked very hard with us to respond to a disaster that occurred in \nour part of the country.\n  In many ways, facing the kind of disaster that was faced in North and\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nSouth Dakota and Minnesota brings out the best in people. It was really \nheartwarming to have seen during this disaster the thousands and \nthousands of people, many of them young people--high school and college \nstudents--and folks in their senior years, show up at sandbag lines to \nstack sandbags to build dikes to fight the river.\n  It is an extraordinary thing to see what people have done, the acts \nof heroism that have occurred so frequently, especially up in the Red \nRiver Valley, in this flood fight and the fight against the fire and \nthe fight to overcome the effects of the massive blizzards.\n  The victims of all of this are the tens of thousands of people who \nwere displaced. The city of Grand Forks is a city of nearly 50,000 \npeople with no one living there, streets inundated with water. The only \ntraffic in Grand Forks was by three or four Coast Guard boats taking \npeople up and down and some law enforcement people on the outside of \nthe city trying to make certain that there was order. But other than \nthat, this was a city inundated and a city evacuated.\n  Of all the wonderful things people have done--and there are so many--\nI noticed last evening that an unidentified woman from California \ndecided that she wanted to make a personal donation of $2,000 per \nhousehold in Grand Forks, ND, to those men and women who have suffered \ndamages to their homes. What a wonderful thing for someone to do. That \nwill cost millions of dollars. An anonymous donor says, ``I want to \nstep up here and help.'' What a wonderful thing to do.\n  Part of what is needed to be done, as well, is the Federal Government \nto understand that that region cannot recover by itself. It needs a \nhelping hand by the Government to say to our region, ``You're not \nalone. The rest of the people in this country want to help,'' as we \nhave done so often in other parts of the country in floods, fires, \ntornadoes, and earthquakes.\n  In order for the Federal Government to provide that assistance, we \nmust pass a disaster supplemental appropriations bill. We should, in my \njudgment, do that without any extraneous amendments that are unrelated \nto the bill. I encourage all those who are inclined to want to add \namendments to try to find a way to bring those issues to the floor at a \ndifferent time. I am not here to suggest that the ideas that will be \noffered have no merit, that they are inappropriate ideas to be \ndiscussing or debating. I am not suggesting that at all. I just ask \nthat we stick with what we should be doing; that is, understanding the \npeople who have had such a heavy burden placed on them, in many cases \nlosing everything they have, being evacuated from their homes, the \npeople who I saw in shelters with tears in their eyes, worried about \ntomorrow, about whether there will be hope, whether there will be \nopportunity again, whether there will be help for them and their \nfamilies, their children, and their parents. I just hope we can pass a \npiece of legislation that is without extraneous amendments that offers \nthat kind of help.\n  The Senator from Arizona is on the floor. I want to say to him that I \ndon't judge ideas that others are attempting to offer anywhere. They \nmay have merit. I just urge everyone to take a look at the importance \nof this bill and see if we can't find other places to debate these \nideas. I think the men and women of the Senate are men and women of \nenormous good will. We always try to do the right thing.\n  I said yesterday and want to say again, Senator Stevens, Senator \nByrd, and others have done a remarkable job in working with us to try \nto develop a package of assistance to that region that will be \nenormously helpful and enormously beneficial. I hope at the end of the \nday, at the end of this week, we will have moved something through this \ncommittee to the floor of the Senate to be scheduled early next week \nthat can then be accepted by the House and be signed by the President \nand will extend the helping hand of the Federal Government to a lot of \nfolks who have been hit very, very hard.\n  I do not intend to have a debate with anybody about the merits of \nthis or that issue. I only come to say that this is very important, \nvitally important, to our region of the country, and I urge in the \nstrongest possible terms that the Congress be allowed to pass this \nsupplemental disaster appropriations bill without extraneous amendments \nattached to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, like all of us here today, I want to \nextend my sympathies to the communities and families of the upper \nMidwest who have experienced the terrible flooding over the past \nseveral weeks.\n  It brings back vivid memories of the flooding that hit western \nMaryland last year and I know all Marylanders join me in extending our \nthoughts and prayers to everyone in the Midwest.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was hoping for quick consideration of \nthis important legislation so we could speed relief to disaster \nvictims. They are counting on us to help them get back on their feet--\nto help them rebuild their homes and businesses.\n  I am so disappointed that what should have been a speedy, nonpartisan \ntargeted relief bill has turned into another nasty partisan battle.\n  I am greatly concerned about the many extraneous provisions that have \nbeen wedged into this bill. The provisions are designed to inflame and \ndivide us and to provoke a veto from the President.\n  They make it so much more difficult to get assistance to the people \nin flood ravaged communities who are counting on us. I am particularly \nalarmed by the inclusion in this package of what is artfully called the \nShutdown Prevention Act.\n  Nobody knows the pain of a Government shutdown better than me and the \nMarylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, I visited \nGovernment agencies that had to remain open.\n  I saw the frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial \nhardship it caused for all Federal employees.\n  I do not want another shutdown and will do everything I can to \nprevent it. But, the revised bill now provides for a permanent \ncontinuing resolution which is nothing more than a partisan trick.\n  It is designed to lock in deep cuts to important programs under the \ncover of preventing a Government shutdown. I am opposed to this \nprovision and urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  In addition, I am disturbed by the way in which we have chosen to pay \nfor this bill. This bill takes $3.6 billion in unobligated funds from \nHUD's section 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster \nrelief fund.\n  I do not believe we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Eventually, Peter will be broke.\n  The projected budget problems with regard to the section 8 program \nare well known.\n  In fiscal year 1998, section 8 renewals will cost $10.2 billion. That \nis a $7 billion increase over the fiscal year 1997 funding level.\n  We will need the unobligated funds to pay for the section 8 renewals \nin fiscal year 1998. We should not be raiding the program to pay for \ndisaster funding.\n  I am pleased that of the $5.8 billion in unobligated section 8 funds, \n$2.2 billion will be saved to cover fiscal year 1998 section 8 renewal \ncosts. However, as the budget estimates show, we will need every dollar \nwe can find to cover the huge increase in section 8 costs next year.\n  The VA/HUD Subcommittee cannot serve as the ATM machine for the rest \nof the committee. If we are going to pay for emergency disasters, one \nsubcommittee should not bear a disproportionate share of the burden.\n  We must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills. These disasters are not going to end.\n  We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. \nAre we going to continually robe the VA/HUD account to pay for these \nbills?\n  I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with \nthese type of disasters--a new system that is off-budget.\n  I wanted to support this bill because it is so important to the \nfamilies and communities who need help. However, the changes that were \nadded at the last minute make it impossible for me to do so. I hope in \nthe future we can avoid partisan fights over disaster relief bills and \nfind a more equitable way to pay for them.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, of course, like all Americans, extend \nmy deep and profound sympathy and\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\npledge of assistance to those who have been ravaged by these natural \ndisasters which are unprecedented in some parts of the country. But I \nam, frankly, very surprised that the Senator from North Dakota, and \nothers, would not want to also prevent a man-made disaster that took \nplace 2 years ago.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he realizes, if the Government \nwere to shut down again, whether those people would be able to get that \nassistance? The answer is no, I say to the Senator from North Dakota, \nand it is foolishness--it is foolishness--not to understand that when \nthere are manmade disasters, it affects people just as badly as natural \ndisasters do.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I am sorry he is not \nconcerned about the people of Arizona, the hundreds of families who \nwere put out of work and lost their livelihood the last time the \nGovernment was shut down, the thousands of families who didn't work for \nthe Federal Government, who were never repaid--never ever repaid--when \nthe Secretary of the Interior, my fellow Arizonan, in his wisdom \ndecided to shut down the Grand Canyon for the first time in 76 years.\n  Mr. President, I am astounded at the arguments that are made against \nthis amendment that Senator Hutchison and I and those of us on this \nside of the aisle are supportive of to prevent the effects of a manmade \ndisaster which happened 2 years ago, which every American decried, \nwhich every American thought was terrible, the hundreds of millions of \ndollars that were lost, the people who were trying to apply for \nMedicare benefits, the people who were trying to apply for Social \nSecurity, the other aspects of Government services that they lost, like \ngetting a passport so they could get back from school in Europe or take \na vacation--all of the Government services that we were deprived of. \nYet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have the unmitigated \ngall to call this an extraneous provision.\n  I don't know where the Senator from North Dakota was--and I am sorry \nhe left the floor--3 years ago when the California emergency earthquake \nsupplemental contained language inserted by then Majority Leader \nMitchell that dealt with the investigation of potato diseases.\n  I didn't see the Senator from North Dakota on the floor when Senator \nByrd put language in the bill that funded employees at the fingerprint \nlab in West Virginia. You know, it is a long way from West Virginia to \nCalifornia, Mr. President, and that language required $20 million to be \nexpended to hire 500 employees to remain available, to be expended \nwithout regard to any other law--without regard to any other law. That \nwas put in the California emergency earthquake supplemental.\n  Where were my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when all of \nthese extraneous provisions were put in, which is a habit around here \nwhich I have decried and taken the floor in opposition to time after \ntime after time.\n  Mr. President, this is crazy, this is just crazy, and do you know why \nthey are doing it? Because they want to be able to threaten the \nshutdown of the Government so they can achieve one of two things: one, \nan enormous political advantage like they gained 2 years ago when, over \nChristmas, we saw pictures of Federal workers sitting around empty \nChristmas trees; or what they were able to do last year, and that is to \nbasically blackmail the Congress into spending around $9 billion more \nthan had been budgeted for. That is the kind of leverage they want to \nmaintain.\n  Do you know what, Mr. President? I understand political leverage, I \nthink I understand it fairly well after a few years around here, but I \nam not prepared to do it at the expense of the lives and welfare of the \nAmerican people, and clearly those on the other side are willing to do \nthat. I view that as gross and crass and cynical and the worst aspect \nof this kind of process that we are engaged in here.\n  We are trying to prevent the shutdown of the Federal Government, \nwhich affects the lives of millions of Americans, perhaps 250 million, \nand for the Senator from North Dakota, who I am glad came back to the \nfloor, to say that this is an extraneous amendment when it has been a \nhabit in the Congress to put extraneous information--where was the \nSenator from North Dakota when Senator Byrd put on the amendment that \nrequired $20 million in the hiring of 500 employees in West Virginia on \nthe California earthquake disaster bill? Where was the Senator from \nNorth Dakota when then Majority Leader Mitchell put in the California \nemergency earthquake supplemental an investigation of potato diseases?\n  I hope the American people know better than to accept these bogus \narguments when we are trying to prevent a manmade disaster.\n  I repeat, again, to the Senator from North Dakota, I am concerned \nabout the people of North Dakota. I want to get them money as quickly \nas possible, but I am deeply disturbed he doesn't care about the people \nwho live around the Grand Canyon who, if the Government shut down, \nwould be out of work and not get the money back. It happened in my \nState. I don't know what happened in North Dakota when we shut down the \nGovernment. I know what happened in Arizona. I know what happened in \nTexas. I know what happened all over the country. I was flooded with \ncalls and letters and messages: ``What are you idiots doing in \nWashington shutting down the Government?\"\n\n  I do not want it to happen again. It cannot happen again. This is a \nbig issue; this is an important issue. I am going to object and come to \nthis floor every time someone from the other side of the aisle says \nthis is extraneous and the President is going to veto it. If the \nPresident wants to veto it, fine. The President of the United States \nthen will be responsible the next time the Government shuts down--don't \nblame us--and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, too, who \ndon't support preventing the Government from being shut down. That is \nwhere the responsibility will lie.\n  The President may veto it. It may come back. We may cave. We have \ndone that before. If we do, the record will be clear, I say to my \ncolleague from North Dakota. I really appreciate, again, his concern \nabout extraneous amendments. I hope he joins me the next time a \nsupplemental bill comes to the floor and we will propose amendments \ntogether to take out those extraneous amendments, because he wasn't \nthere on the other times that I have been on the floor when there have \nbeen extraneous amendments on a supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you. I commend my colleague, the \nSenator from Arizona, for his commitment to trying to do what is right. \nWe are supposed to learn from our mistakes, and I think everyone \nbelieves that it was a mistake that we had a Government shutdown. It is \nnot anything anyone intended, but to say that we would allow ourselves \nto go forward into a disaster like that again would be saying you \ncannot learn a lesson of history.\n  We are learning the lesson of history. We know what it was like when \nveterans were not sure they would get their benefits because this \nadministration refused to say that veterans benefits were essential \npayments, and they really lived in fear that those benefits that they \nearned would not be there. Not to mention all of the other Federal \nemployees who wanted to come to work but could not by law do it and \nwere not sure if the money to pay their mortgages would be there.\n  Mr. President, let's talk about the timing. This is the first bill \nout of the Appropriations Committee. It is a supplemental bill asked \nfor by the President to cover some of the unforeseen expenses. But \nthere are other things in the bill as well, Mr. President. I don't \nthink the Senator from North Dakota can just pick and choose which \nthings are essential. We have to look at good government, and we have \nto look at our responsibility. Part of our responsibility is seeing \nthat the victims in North Dakota, who have suffered greatly--and we all \nunderstand that. I grew up on the gulf coast and have lived through \nhurricanes and have seen people not have homes. I, of all people, \nunderstand disaster. We are going to do the right thing, and part of \ndoing the right thing is we are going to take up raises for the \nDistrict of Columbia police officers. We are going to take up\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nU.N. dues. That is part of this bill, in addition to disaster relief \nand taking care of our soldiers and their requirements in Bosnia.\n\n  So this is the time that we are able to address how we will \nappropriate this year. What we are saying is, we are not going to shut \ndown Government. This may work to the benefit of the President; it may \nwork to the benefit of Congress. We do not really know. But what we are \nsaying is, we are not going to shut down Government. We are going to \nallow the negotiations that occur on September 30, that are still \noccurring to continue to occur based on the merits without any \nartificial hammers over anyone's head, not the President, not Congress.\n  That is the only responsible way we know how to deal with these \ndisagreements. So we are saying, come September 30, we will fund at \npresent levels minus 2-percent because in fact that 2-percent going \ninto the next fiscal year is appropriating money that we have not yet \ndecided how to appropriate. We did not say 75 percent. We are not \nlooking at Draconian cuts here. We are looking at staying with the \nbudget resolution that we passed out of this Congress and sticking to \nit.\n  The budget resolution says that we would have $541 billion for the \nnext year in the budget plan that marches toward the year 2002 in a \nresponsible approach to cutting the rate of growth of spending.\n  The President's request for the 1998 budget that we are discussing \nwas actually somewhat under that. So how someone can say we are \nactually cutting the President's budget is really hard to understand \nbecause we are actually over what the President said he wanted for the \n1998 year; we are over that by $3 billion.\n  So what has happened here is the President has come in and asked for \n$25 billion more; and we are being accused of cutting the $25 billion-\nadd that he has put on to his own budget submitted last year.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a lot of rigmarole to say that we are not \ntrying to do the responsible thing. We are doing it in the first bill \nthat comes out of the Appropriations Committee to set the process for \nthis next year. And the process is going to be that if we do not have \nagreements by September 30, which we hope we do, but if we do not, that \nwe are going to continue at present levels minus 2 percent. If any \nagency of State or Federal Government cannot operate on a 2 percent \ncut, ask them to call any small business, ask them to call any family \nthat has had trouble making ends meet to see if they would be able to \nbudget a 2 percent cut. If 2 percent is a Draconian cut, it is time \nthese people came into the real world, the real world of taxpayers \ntrying to make ends meet.\n  So we are saying, everyone will be on notice that if we do not have \nan agreement for a particular appropriations bill, we will continue \nfunding, there will not be a shutdown, and if you cannot cut 2 percent \nout of your budget with 6 months' notice then you really do not deserve \nto be running the Federal Government.\n  Second, Mr. President, I think it is very important when we are \naddressing the issue of responsible governing that we say we are going \nto cover disaster victims and we are going to do it in a timely way.\n  If the President says that a 2-percent cut in present spending is \nsomething that would make him veto the bill, then the President should \nanswer to the victims of North Dakota, the President should answer to \nthe soldiers in Bosnia. Because 2 percent from what we are spending \ntoday, if we do not have an agreement, I think is quite responsible.\n  We are not talking Draconian cuts. We are talking responsible \nGovernment. In fact, you know we had hoped to have total bipartisan \nsupport for this. We thought from all the things that were said when \nthe Government was shut down that we would have a huge Democrat-\nRepublican alliance to say, let us address it now. Let us give everyone \nnotice so that everyone can plan.\n  In fact, I will quote from Senator Daschle, December 30, 1995, \ntalking about the Government shutdown:\n\n       The Government remains shut because some Members . . . want \n     it shut. It is Government by gimmick, and it is wrong.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We are addressing the concerns raised by Senator \nDaschle. And those concerns are addressed so that we will not have \nGovernment by gimmick, so that we will have responsible Government, so \nthat everyone will know what the rules are, and so that we will be able \nto negotiate in good faith on appropriations that have not been \nfinished by September 30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a brief question on the \nshutdown issue?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator know how many times in the 200-year \nhistory of America the U.S. Government has shut down for an extended \nperiod of time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would appreciate hearing from the Senator from \nCalifornia on that.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It only happened one time when this Congress was put in \nthe hands of her party. And I would just like to say to my friend, who \nis my friend--and we do work on other things together; I am very happy \nabout that--that on this matter it is tragic--tragic. And I wish you \nwould go to North Dakota or maybe come to California where 120,000 \npeople had to be evacuated from their homes. That we are putting a \nbudget fight on an emergency supplemental--emergency--we do not have a \nbudget.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We are not having a budget fight. We are talking \nabout responsible Government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If we can meet on the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would just say, if we did this work we would not have \nthis problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has her time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have seen victims of floods. And I am glad the \nSenator from California suggested it because I have seen the victims of \nflood. I live on the gulf coast. I have lived through hurricanes. I \nhave seen my own home flooded. I have seen neighbors who have not had \nhomes to live in, who stayed in our home because of the water. I know \nwhat it is like to see a tornado tear up an entire city in Dallas \nCounty.\n  But you know something? This is trying to do the responsible thing. \nIf the President decides to veto a bill because we are trying to stop \nthe Government by gimmick that Senator Daschle accused us of doing--and \nthe Senator from California points out that we have only had a shutdown \nfor an extended period of time one time. And I am saying, we have \nlearned from history.\n  The President vetoed the bills back in 1995, but he blamed it on \nCongress. So Congress is saying, let us do the responsible thing. Let \nus make sure that we do not have a Government shutdown. If it is our \nfault, then we are trying to correct it, we are trying to do the right \nthing. And it is not a budget fight. It is the first bill out of the \nAppropriations Committee. And we are trying to set a process that would \nallow us to meet the needs of the victims of North Dakota, the soldiers \nin Bosnia, pay U.N. dues, raise the salaries of D.C. police, and make \nsure that everyone is on notice that we are not going to have \nGovernment by gimmick, we are going to have Government by responsible \npeople, and we are going to set the parameters right now which it is in \nour prerogative to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I served in the House of Representatives for 10 years, \nand I served on the Budget Committee for 6 years during that time. I \nnow serve on the Budget Committee and happen to be on the \nAppropriations Committee as well. And since the Senator from Texas \nwants to learn from history, let me share some history with her.\n  In all those years on the Budget Committee--it is actually 11 in all; \n6 in the House, 5 in the Senate--I have never seen the majority party, \nwhether it was Republican or Democrat, not put forward a budget. I have \nnever seen such a dereliction of duty. I miss my Budget Committee \nchairman. I want to\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nsend him a card: ``Looking forward to seeing you.''\n  I like working with Chairman Pete Domenici. We do not even meet \nanymore, Mr. President. We are not doing our work. And now on an \nemergency supplemental bill, where the people who have been suffering \nare counting on us, we move a piece of legislation on to that bill that \nhas nothing to do with a natural disaster, that has to do with a \nbudgetary fight which is an admission of surrender by the people who \nare offering it that they cannot play by the rules of the game, by the \nlaws of this Congress which say you must have a budget on the floor by \nApril 15.\n  And then to come to the floor and criticize the Senator from North \nDakota, who has been working, as I have, with our Republican friends, \nwith our Democratic friends, to craft an emergency bill that is \nfiscally responsible, that meets the needs of people, to have my friend \nfrom North Dakota attacked as not being empathetic to the needs of this \ncountry, to me, is beyond repair.\n  We have two jobs to do today. We have to pass an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations to help the people of California, to help \nthe people of North Dakota, indeed, to help the people of 22 States who \nhave suffered, who have lost their homes, their businesses, who were \nevacuated--we have to do that--and we have to do it fast. We have to \nhelp our farmers, our small businesspeople.\n  I do not think I will ever forget the vision of that city in North \nDakota that is a ghost town. It just looked like something out of a \npicture out of World War II--burning buildings sitting in water. And we \nare putting our budget battle on to this emergency bill. And I just \nhave to say, I am so surprised that this has occurred. It did not \nhappen on the House side.\n\n  Our chairman, Chairman Stevens, called off the hearing--the markup--\nafter telling us that he was prepared to go forward with a clean bill \nbut others wanted this added. In respect to his colleagues, of course, \nhe did the right thing, called off the markup.\n  So I hope we can come together as Democrats and Republicans. That is \nwhat the people want us to do. And let us do our job. Let us get these \npeople the help they need.\n  There are other amendments now on there, environmental amendments \nthat totally eviscerate environmental laws that should not be part of \nthis bill.\n  There is a labor fight going on about how much you pay workers at \nconstruction projects. That has now gotten on to this emergency bill.\n  We have procedures here. We have processes here to deal with these \nother matters. So I am hoping we do two things today: We pass a clean \nbill in the committee, and we are going to go to that markup at 2 \no'clock; and, second, we ask our colleagues on the Budget Committee, \n``Put your budget on the table before you try to resort to across-the-\nboard cuts.''\n  And I want to correct the record on this point. My friend from Texas \nmade a point that in actuality this continuing resolution is going to \nbe a level of spending higher than the President suggested. Now, this \nmay be true for the overall number, but I can assure my friend, he has \nan initiative in education, he has an initiative in children's health, \nhe has an initiative to clean up Superfund sites, he has an initiative \non crime. This President has initiatives in his budget. So if you just \ngo ahead and say, well, we have decided to forget about our free markup \nbudget, and throw in the towel, and put this solution down on the \ntable----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Put this 2-percent solution on the table and indicate to \nthe President that there will not be severe cuts in education, the \nenvironment, in crime, in health research, that is simply not true.\n  As a matter of fact, our analysis that we have done thus far--and we \nare still working on it--shows in some cases a 7-, 8-, 9-percent \nreduction that will result in young people not having Pell grants, kids \nnot getting into Head Start, Superfund sites being delayed, veterans \nbenefits being delayed, if that 2-percent solution goes forward. I hope \nwe can have that debate another day.\n\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator is saying I was correct, then, \nthat we are increasing over the President's own budget that he put \nforward last year.\n  The Senator is making the point that there are new expenditures that \nyou would like to make. I ask the Senator from California if she does \nnot think it would be more responsible if the President would keep his \nword, keep to the $539 million that he asked for last year for this \nyear, and set the priorities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me answer your first question. If you want a second \nquestion, I will answer your second question. Let me answer your first \nquestion.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. You let me ask the question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You asked me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It will be delayed if there is a Government shutdown, \nbut not with a 2-percent cut.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to yield as long as you want, but I do not \nwant to forget your first question.\n  You asked me, did I not think it would be more responsible for the \nPresident to stick to last year's budget? No, absolutely not. Maybe the \nSenator has forgotten, we had an election, and this President won. Do \nyou know what the election was about? It was about how much you ought \nto cut Medicare, how much you ought to spend on the environment, how \nmuch you ought to spend on education, how many more cops we should put \non the beat. We had the election and the American people chose this \nPresident.\n  I am answering your question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I need to finish my answer, Mr. President, and then I \nwill be happy to yield again.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If we could have some order. The California \nSenator has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me finish. The Senator is asking what is responsible.\n  It would be irresponsible for this President to back down on what he \nsaid he would do for the American people. I know there are some of my \ncolleagues who do not agree with this President, who do not want to \nspend more on education, who do not want to spend more cleaning up the \nenvironment, who want to cut more out of Medicare, who would like to \ngive tax breaks to the very wealthiest.\n  That is a fair debate, I say to my friend. This is a debate about \nbudget priorities.\n  What I think would be responsible for this President is to stick with \nthe promises he made in his campaign to the American people.\n  The second thing I think would be responsible for us is to keep this \nemergency supplemental appropriation clean of this budget battle. I \nthink the American people can see in the debate between the Senator \nfrom Texas and myself, in the remarks that were made by the Senator \nfrom Arizona, that the budget battle is a very heartfelt battle. As a \nmatter of fact, it differentiates the parties. So what is responsible \nfor this President, it seems to me, is to get this emergency \nsupplemental to the people, clean of these other amendments, and what \nis responsible for this U.S. Senate is to produce a budget and do our \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I am thoroughly convinced if we do that, we do not \nneed a 2-percent gimmick. We can have a real budget debate and a real \nbalanced budget for the people of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to myself the 10 minutes allocated \npreviously.\n  Mr. President, the only thing that matters to me at the end of the \nday is, has the Congress proceeded to enact the disaster supplemental \nbill? And will the disaster supplemental, as enacted, be free of \nprovisions that would otherwise engender a Presidential veto? Will the \nCongress get its work done on the disaster supplemental bill? That is \nall I came to talk about and all I intend to talk about.\n  There was a demonstration here on the floor by those who say, well, \nif you do not support our amendment, whatever our amendment is, you do \nnot care about Government shutdowns. What a load of nonsense. I will \nnot respond to\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nall of this, but just to say this: I did not come to the floor to \ncriticize anybody and I will not respond as I am tempted to do. I came \nhere asking only one thing: That when the Senate Committee marks up its \nbill at 2 o'clock, that we mark up a supplemental disaster \nappropriations bill without attaching amendments that are unrelated to \nthe bill.\n  One Member came and took great offense to that and ranted about the \nfact that I or others do not support efforts to stop Government \nshutdowns, and so on. I have no idea how people learn these \ntechniques--the technique of misstating your opponent's position and \ngoing on and debating them. That is an old debating technique that some \nmemorize. It does not serve a particular interest to me.\n\n  I am very happy to work with all Members of the Senate in finding \nways to avoid any Government shutdown, at any time. I have never \nsupported a Government shutdown. I am happy to work with anybody at any \ntime to avoid a Government shutdown. I do not want someone coming to \nthe floor to ascribe motives I do not have. My motive was for one \npurpose today, and that is to encourage all Members of the Senate to \nunderstand this disaster supplemental has the word ``disaster'' \nattached to it because some parts of the country are suffering a \ndisaster. We want, at the end of the day, to pass a bill that extends a \nhelping hand to those folks.\n  Now, I understand everybody else has 800 objections to it, and they \nhave different agendas. We have in our caucus, people who have agendas, \nthey want to bring things to attach to this bill. They are saying, \n``This is the first appropriations bill. We want to attach something to \nit.'' My position to them was exactly the same. It does not matter what \nparty you are in. I have told members of our caucus, ``I do not want \nyou to attach things to this bill.'' I will tell them that today if \nsomebody says they want to do it.\n  Leave this bill alone. This bill affects 22 States. It affects people \nwho have been driven from their homes who need help. We do not need \npeople to come to the floor pointing and shouting about who supports \nGovernment shutdowns in September or October. Who is willing to help \npass a disaster bill in April and May? That is the question.\n  I get sorely tempted some days to come and respond in kind to some of \nthe things I hear. But my Scandinavian heritage overcomes that urge \nfrom time to time, and it will again today. My response would be in a \nmore personal way to those with whom I take offense when they suggest \nsomehow that those of us who want to see a disaster bill passed without \ninterference have an agenda that does not care about the rest of the \ncountry and Government shutdowns. People know better than that. We \nshould have reasonable and thoughtful debates here in the Senate. We \nshould not do that sort of thing.\n  The agenda of the Senate, it seems to me, in the Appropriations \nCommittee this afternoon, is how does this country respond to a series \nof disasters. That is what I care about. There are other issues that \nothers care about. That is fine. We should talk about the issues. But I \nwould feel the same way, I guess, if it was your disaster. I would want \nyour people to get the help they deserve. And I have done that on \nearthquakes, fires, floods, and tornadoes all around the country in all \nthe years I have been here.\n  My hope is, without ascribing ill motives to anyone in the Senate, \nthat we can just decide to work together. I have said three times, and \nlet me say again, Senator Stevens is a wonderful chairman of that \ncommittee and he has been enormously helpful, I think doing a terrific \njob, as are other members of that Appropriations Committee, Senator \nByrd and others, in difficult circumstances, putting together a \ndisaster relief bill that extends a helping hand to people who \ndesperately need help in this time.\n  Mr. President, my hope is that when we convene at 2 o'clock, we will \nproceed through this bill and probably be able to talk some people out \nof offering amendments that might load this bill down and not allow it \nto get passed on an expeditious basis. My hope is perhaps at the end of \nnext week all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike who care about \nthis, can join the President in a bill-signing ceremony that says we \ndid what we were supposed to do. We did what was necessary. This \nGovernment extended a helping hand to people who were down and out, \nflat on their back, who needed help, and that there were not intramural \npolitical games being played here, there and everywhere that would \ndelay and do the things that people so often and too often now expect \nof the Congress.\n  I understand sometimes why the American people look at this process \nand become profoundly disappointed--profoundly disappointed--because \nalmost everything that happens is someone thumping their chest saying, \n``I am the one that will save the Republic.'' The fact is, what saves \nthe Republic is the good will of men and women working together on \ncommon problems in this country in a sensible, thoughtful way. I hope \nthat we will begin doing that and continue to do that not just on this \nbill but on bills that affect all of America and all of Americans. That \nis my hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3819-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3824-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1977--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to proceed \nto S. 543.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I came to the floor to speak to that piece of legislation, \nbut also to speak to the supplemental and the current situation the \nSenate finds itself in at this moment.\n  Senator Dorgan has spoken passionately, as he should, about a concern \nfor the citizens of his State and that their needs are responded to \nbecause of the devastating floods that are ongoing in his State. For \nthat, this Senate will respond.\n  I now have the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee, \nand I must tell you that it is my intent to support a supplemental \nappropriation that has disaster relief in it--for the citizens of North \nDakota, yes, but also for the citizens of Midvale, ID, my hometown.\n  In early January of this year, the national television cameras did \nnot sweep across the 4 feet of water that surged through my hometown, \nthat displaced 40 residents, destroyed homes, took the one small \ngeneral store and put it out of business. I flew over it a few days \nlater in a helicopter to see utter devastation like I had never seen \nbefore and like my friends and neighbors had never witnessed. I \nremembered looking at the files of the local newspaper and the flood of \n1950 when I was a small child in that community. This, of course, was \neven worse. This was, without doubt, the 100-year flood.\n  Now, what I found out at that time--and I have great praise for FEMA \nand the Army Corps of Engineers and others--is that they did respond \nand they responded immediately. The citizens of Midvale were cared for \nwithin the limitations of the law and prescriptive to their needs. I am \npleased about that and played a small role in helping them.\n  What I also find out is that the citizens of North Dakota are being \ncared for at this moment. There is adequate money at this moment to \ndeal with the immediate needs. They are being cared for. Will there be \nnecessary moneys for the future needs of rebuilding and repair? No. \nThat is what the supplemental is all about. There is adequate time for \na responsible and reasoned debate on what we do about the expenditures \nof our Government.\n  I am going to support a continuing resolution tied to the \nsupplemental appropriation. Why? Because I do not like the budget \nprocess gamed. I do not like a President, who owns a bully pulpit, to \nveto and then stand on that pulpit, when it was his pen that brought \nthe Government to a halt, turning and saying, ``Look at those folks up \non the Hill. They did not give me what I wanted, so I am shutting the \nGovernment down.'' He says, ``They did not give me what I wanted, so \nthey are shutting the Government down,'' and he got away with it. The \nAmerican people said, ``Oh my goodness, isn't that terrible. Congress \nshould not have done that.''\n  Congress did not intend to do that. Congress will not do that again. \nThat is why we have considered amongst\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\nourselves the importance of putting together a supplemental with a \ncontinuing resolution that has a level of expenditure of 98 percent of \nthe 1997 fiscal year level. That is right and it is responsible.\n  Now, I am on the Appropriations Committee. Yes, I am a freshman. I \nunderstand that. Does it take away my power and my leverage on the \ncommittee? I really do not think so. All appropriators want to produce \nand pass the 13 appropriations bills that will constitute the new \nbudget for fiscal year 1998. Why? Because it is good policy. The \nPresident has some new programs, and he will get them. We have some new \nprograms that we want and some spending reduction levels that we want \nand a tax package that we want that we think are important for the \nAmerican people, and we will get there and the budget will be balanced.\n  But what the CR gives us is the room to operate and to say to our \nGovernment employees, you will not be put at risk and we will not allow \nyou to be gamed. I have a sense there is a little gaming going on now \nabout the need and the urgency.\n  Let me make myself clear. It is my understanding, based on an \nimmediate review of the budgets of FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers \nand other areas, that they have money to deal with the immediate \nsituation, and it has been dealt with. Every citizen in this country \nthat turned on the national news saw Federal employees and Federal \npeople on the ground in North Dakota helping, and they are there today \nand will be there tomorrow. What is important is that we deal with this \nissue and deal with it in a responsible and timely way. Will there be \nadd-ons to the supplemental? Yes, there will be.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am not on the Appropriations Committee. Let me say \nthis just for clarification here. The supplemental is a vehicle by \nwhich we can help the flood; it is not a disaster supplemental.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In other words, this has been in the process since \nbefore the emergency, so it is going to probably deal with Bosnia. I am \njust guessing, as I am not on the committee. Do you not have something \ndealing with our troops overseas in this matter?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The President, as the Commander in Chief, has the latitude \nwithin the law to spend beyond the limits of the budget when we have \ntroops in foreign lands. The Food and Foraging Act allows for the \nPresident to do that. That case has occurred in Bosnia. What the \nsupplemental offers is some reprogramming of dollars within the defense \nbudget to pay for expenditures that have already been let in the area \nof Defense. So it is not just flood money. It is clearly reprogramming \nmoney for the Department of Defense and for our troops stationed in \nBosnia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My point is this. When we have a disaster, we \ntypically use whatever vehicle is moving to deal with it. For example, \nin the great 500-year flood that we experienced several years ago in \nGeorgia as a result of Alberto--and I believe we all understand the \nsense of urgency that comes from any Member of the body who represents \nthat kind of a condition--for the long-term relief, I, along with my \ncolleague at the time, Senator Nunn, were addressing it on a series of \nappropriations bills. So this disaster is being addressed on this \nappropriation vehicle, but it is not a bill for the disaster. It is the \nprocess in which we are engaged that we are using to help the disaster.\n  Now, this is my last question, and then I will let the Senator \nproceed with his remarks. The Senator very astutely made the point that \nthe emergency brings out our emergency resources. In our case, FEMA was \nthere immediately. A coordinated center was set up for relief, water \nwas flown in, and the National Guard was dispatched throughout the \nsouthwestern quadrant of the State. What we were dealing with in \nappropriations was the long-term build-back, which takes a long time.\n  I just find it ironic, the one thing that you have to have to protect \nthe long-term build-back is that the system does not shut down. So, for \nme, the idea of putting a disaster protection in the supplemental that \nassures that the long-term relief will not come to a stop suddenly \nbecause of politics is a pretty good idea. Would the Senator agree with \nthat?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Well, I agree with that, of course. As you know, our \nbudgets operate on a fiscal year basis. My guess is that, come October \n1, 1997, when the 1998 budget begins, there will be Federal agencies on \nthe ground in North Dakota negotiating contracts with private \ncontractors to rebuild or restore facilities in those devastated areas. \nThey will be, at that moment, negotiating. If the Government shuts down \nfor any given time, all negotiations have to stop, all transactions \nhave to stop. That is reality. The Government isn't functioning.\n  As we found out in the last shutdown, it is a very clear shutdown--\ncease and desist, turn out the lights, go home--except for only \nessential employees who, by definition of their employment, might stay \non location for the security of the buildings and operations of the \nfacilities. That is reality.\n  So I think the point the Senator from Georgia makes is a very clear \nand important point. Now, with these disasters ongoing and impending, \nthe reality of continuation is very, very important. I have money in \nthis supplemental for Idaho. It could be called disaster money. It goes \nto my hometown of Midvale and Washington County and Payette County and \nJerome County. I have 13 counties in Idaho that have been declared \ndisasters. We have flooding going on in my State as we speak.\n  Senator Dorgan mentioned he didn't want any add-ons. Let me tell you \nof an amendment I am going to try to put on. It deals directly with \ndisaster, and it is an add-on. When a disaster strikes and there is an \nimmediate event and an emergency situation and there needs to be build-\nback of dikes to protect private property and private life, we have a \nproblem. The problem is that the Endangered Species Act can step in, \nand external agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and \nNational Marine Fisheries can oftentimes come in like they have in \nCalifornia during the incidents in January of this year. There was a \nspecial area designated by the Assistant Secretary to allow the waivers \nto take place because it had to be an Executive waiver. In St. Marys in \nnorth Idaho, a flood event that occurred in 1996 was in the midst of \nbeing repaired. At that time, there were over 400 homes in that \ncommunity under water. As I flew over in a helicopter, just the \nrooftops were sticking out. The dikes had blown. Now they are repairing \nthem. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stepped in and said, ``We \ndon't think you are following the Endangered Species Act. Stop.'' That \norder went out about a month and a half ago. There is no more dike \nbuilding going on in St. Marys in Benewah County in north Idaho. The \nwater is rising as we speak and the dike is not complete. This is all \nabout habitat for osprey eagles and has nothing to do with human life \nand property.\n\n  My little amendment says that during the time of a declared \nemergency--in this instance, I am simply saying 1996 and 1997--the \nEndangered Species Act doesn't pertain during the time of emergency and \nemergency repairs to follow. I am sure that that will be the case along \nthe Red River in North Dakota and other areas that we will have to deal \nwith. That is an add-on, and I am sure the Senator from North Dakota \nwould want that. There can be others that can be argued to be direct \nand specific as it relates to the supplemental.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to suggest that this Senate \ndeserves to debate and to vote upon S. 543. I find it amazing that, in \nthis system of Government by laws that we all support and believe in, \nwe have found ourselves so encumbered by laws that we can no longer \nvolunteer, or you can't give freely of your time without liability or \nwithout risk of liability, or to work in a voluntary organization, and \nthat organization has to take out insurance to protect themselves so \nthat they are exempt from lawsuit. We used to deal with that as a free \nand open society. We had a doctrine of charitable immunity. In other \nwords, we said, if you are giving to charity and you are giving in a \nvoluntary and charitable way, you are immune from litigation. Well, \nthat\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nno longer exists. Most States abrogated charitable immunity by imposing \nfull liability for damages without adequate consideration of whether \nunique characteristics of charitable organizations and volunteers \nwarranted some other arrangement.\n  I find it amazing that we are being blocked by the party of the \nPresident, who has just done a very admirable thing in Philadelphia \nabout voluntarism, to launch a national voluntarism program across this \ncountry, which I suspect 100 percent of the Senate believes in, along \nwith the huge majority of the American people. We are now at a \nstandstill on legislation to protect those who would come out in \nresponse to our President and to General Powell and to past Presidents \nand to a nation which really does believe that the way to save our \ncities of America is not just a Federal program, but to incorporate the \ncause and caring of citizens of our country that give of their time in \na voluntary way.\n  I hope that we can pass this legislation. It is literally being \nfilibustered at this moment. Are there extenuating circumstances? Yes, \nthere are. We all know that. It is too bad we can't move on with this \nlegislation and deal with it. But I will tell the Senator this. I \nmentioned it to him several times on the floor in, I think, appropriate \nand just ways. We will convene the Appropriations Committee this \nafternoon, we will mark up a supplemental, and it will have some \nemergency dollars in it and some defense reprogramming. It will have a \nCR in it, I believe, and it will probably have other issues in it that \nSenators, bipartisan Senators, Democrats and Republicans, will find \nnecessary to put in the supplemental.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that the amendment you \ndescribed a few moments ago--I understand that there is some \ncontroversy about it, but it is perfectly appropriate. Your amendment \ndeals with the disaster. I read it last evening at home, and I \ncertainly would not intend to be critical of somebody who is offering \namendments that deal with the bill. I want you to understand that. My \nconcern is amendments that really don't have any relationship to this \nbill but which people want to get passed. I heard you describe it and \nuse my name. I have no problem with that amendment being offered \nbecause it relates to this bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for saying so. I said it in the \ncontext that it is an add-on. You are right. I think it is appropriate \nand I think it will have bipartisan support. We are all for the \nEndangered Species Act, and we want to make sure our Government \nagencies function and operate in a way that their activities do not \ndamage or threaten endangered species. But in a time of a flood \nincident or emergency, to invoke a bureaucracy and withhold the ability \nto immediately get out there and solve that problem and protect private \nproperty and human life is really beyond me. Yet, we find ourselves in \nthat circumstance. My amendment will deal with that.\n  With those comments, I hope we can move in a timely fashion to deal \nwith S. 543. I hope that, with the work of the Appropriations Committee \nthis afternoon, we can have a supplemental come to the floor that deals \nwith disaster relief, that deals with reprogramming of defense dollars. \nIt is going to deal with a lot of other issues. It is not the disaster \nbill. It should not be said that it is. It is an appropriation bill \ndealing with supplemental needs, most of them requested by the \nPresident and sent to the Congress. We are responding to the \nadministration, in most instances, by dealing with those things that \nthe President feels are necessary and that the majority of the Congress \nwould agree with.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, about an hour ago, to facilitate \nremarks on the subject we have been hearing about for the last hour, I \nstepped aside from the explanation of what is really before the Senate, \nwhich is S. 543. I see the Senator from Illinois here. I do have some \nrather extended comments to make about S. 543. So I might ask what \nwould be required by the Senator who has come to the Senate floor? I \nhave been trying to accord the various interests here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I wanted to address my remarks to \nthe issue concerning the disaster assistance and the continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time would the Senator need?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since I am new to this Chamber, it will be brief.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will yield the floor so that you might make your \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 543.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it may be of interest to note why we are \nhere and what we are talking about. Nominally, we are here to consider \nSenate bill 543, an important piece of legislation and one which I \ncosponsored in a slightly different form as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I commend the Senator for offering this. I think it is \nan important piece of legislation. I hope that we can have real debate \non it and consider some amendments and enact legislation to certainly \nachieve the goals. They are worthy goals. People who volunteer to help \norganizations should not risk or fear liability for their acts, unless, \nof course, they are guilty of something which is wanton or criminal in \nnature. I think the Senator offers a good piece of legislation. I would \nlike to see some changes, and I hope we reach that point.\n  The reason why we are not considering it, the reason why the \nDemocrats have voted on two successive days to continue this debate has \nnothing to do with the bill directly. It relates to the appointment of \na person to serve as Secretary of Labor. We feel this has been delayed \nfor the wrong reasons. We hope the Republican majority will move on Ms. \nHerman's nomination very quickly. Unfortunately, your bill has become a \ncaptive in this negotiation.\n  The other measure that came up here today is one I would like to \naddress for a moment, one that I feel an affinity to, the question of \ndisaster assistance. In 1993, in my congressional district, in \ndownstate Illinois, we were literally inundated by the Illinois and \nMississippi Rivers, and it was awful. I feel very badly for families \nthat are victimized by disasters. But I will tell you. Some disasters \ncome and go very, very quickly. In the dead of night a tornado rips \nthrough a town, and by the next morning people are picking up the \npieces, clearing the rubble, and planning for rebuilding. A fire rips \nthrough an area and people the next day are talking about demolition \nand reconstruction. But a flood lingers and lingers. Mr. President, \n125,000 Americans are now homeless in North Dakota and Minnesota \nbecause of this flood. The pictures that I have seen make my experience \nin downstate Illinois almost pale in comparison. That is something I \nthought I would never see because the flood that we experienced was \ndevastating.\n\n  It is really sad, though, as we consider the response of this Nation \nthrough our Government to this disaster, that we have seen other issues \nextraneous to the issue at hand really take center stage. I hope that \nthe Appropriations Committee will think about the families that have \nbeen hurt, businesses destroyed, and the farms inundated when they \nmarkup this afternoon. Give us a clean disaster bill that will help \nthese families. There are important issues to debate. But save those \nfor another day. Let's really come to the rescue of the families of \nthis Nation. Let's show compassion for these families.\n  I daresay there isn't a Senator in this body who could go up to North \nDakota to one of shelters where these homeless people are now waiting \nand say, ``You have to understand. We can't help you out until we have \na momentous debate on another issue.'' That would be a hard sell. I \nwouldn't want to have to do it. I hope that Members who have been \nspared in their own States and districts from this kind of disaster \nwill try to commiserate with those of us who have been through it. It \nis time to think about those families, and this issue that is tying us \nup as to whether or not we will endure another Government shutdown. I \npray that we will not. The decision about 2 years ago by the Republican \nmajority to send a bill that they knew would be vetoed leading to the \nshutdown of the Government is a sad experience. I think all involved in \nthat understand that today, and they want to avoid that in the future. \nThat is a goal that I share.\n  I don't agree with the approach that is being used because the \ncontinuing\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nresolution bill is a complete abdication of responsibility by the \nMembers of the Senate. It was only a few weeks ago that Members came to \nthis floor, and in very convincing and pious tones talked about \namending the Constitution of the United States to require the Senate \nand the House to meet their obligation and their responsibility to \nbalance the budget. We were about to amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States because we take that issue so seriously. It failed by one \nvote.\n  Despite all of the fervor and all of the commitment, where are we \ntoday? The Republican majority in the House and Senate has failed to \nmeet its statutory obligation to produce a budget resolution which is a \nblueprint on how you will reach a balanced budget. That was supposed to \nhave been done by April 15. Yet here we are weeks later without a \nbudget resolution. Negotiations continue.\n  So now the proposal is that we will amend or add to the disaster bill \nthis blueprint for balancing the budget. Excuse me. The people in North \nDakota whose homes have been flooded, whose kids who are out of school \nsitting in homeless shelters, people who are drinking water out of cans \nbecause you can't use the water system--they are gone--folks that do \nnot know what has happened to articles in their lives that have meant \nso much to them--it is a little hard to explain to them that we have a \nmore important thing to worry about than the roof over their heads or \nthe food that they are going to eat. We have, instead, to worry about \nthis continuous debate about balancing the budget.\n  If the goal is to avoid shutting down the Government, I am about to \noffer a solution. It is one that I guarantee you will make certain that \nthe Federal Government never shuts down again. It has two parts to it. \nThe first part is this: No budget, no pay. If Members of House of \nRepresentatives fail to enact a budget, if Members of the Senate fail \nto enact a budget, they don't get paid. That will focus the attention \nof this Chamber and the House on getting its business done in a hurry.\n  There is a second part. I call this ``no dessert until you clean your \nplate.'' Have you ever heard of that one? You did while you were \ngrowing up. Mom and dad used to tell you that one all the time.\n  It is very simple. It merely says that the last appropriations bill \nto be enacted, the last spending bill to be enacted, would be the \nspending bill that covers this Chamber and the House of \nRepresentatives. So, if we fail to appropriate the money for the \nDepartment of Justice, or the Department of State, we know that the \nHouse and the Senate will not continue in business. ``No dessert until \nyou clean your plate.'' Pass the spending bills for all the agencies of \nGovernment, and make ours the last one. And until all the others are \nenacted we cannot enact our own.\n\n  I will guarantee you all of the volumes of debate that we will hear \nabout balancing the budget may lead to a good conclusion and a good \nending--that we will finally see Members who have their paychecks on \nline, and who will realize that the operations of the House and Senate \nare on the line, decide, ``Yes, we had better pass the appropriations \nbill. Yes, we had better enact a balanced budget instead of a \nconstitutional amendment, and get down to the business of passing \nbills.''\n  It is sad that this Appropriations Committee in the Senate will come \nback this afternoon and amend this disaster bill, and embroil these \npoor people--125,000 homeless people who have lost their homes because \nof this flood--in the middle of this political debate. They really \ndeserve better. America deserves better.\n  We are a caring people. And the people in this Chamber--men and women \nalike, Democrats and Republicans--are caring people as well. Let us not \nsacrifice what is good about America, and what we are so proud of in \nthe name of a political debate. Let us get down to the business of \nhelping the flood victims, and then let us get down to the business of \nbalancing the budget.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding this time. I am sure we will return \nto this bill in earnest very soon, and his patience will be rewarded.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the brevity of my \ncolleague from Illinois. I will make a couple of comments about his \nremarks, and then return to S. 543.\n  First, as he properly stated regarding S. 543, I was pleased to hear \nthat he felt good about the legislation, that it has gotten caught up \nin the debate about the supplemental budget and about the nomination of \nAlexis Herman. But I would point out to the Senator from Illinois that \nwe have been on S. 543 since Monday and have been blocked from action \non it. And the supplemental legislation--which deals with Bosnia, which \ndeals with the disaster, which deals with the multitude of issues--is \nnot out of committee. And there is no reason whatsoever for it to be \nused as some political obstacle to block legislation that would help \nAmerican volunteers respond to the President's request to step forward.\n  I point out that S. 543 has been on the floor since Monday afternoon, \nand that we have been blocked from going to the legislation by a \nfilibuster. And they have evoked the fact something about the \nsupplemental and whether we are in a debate over a continuing \nresolution or not. It is not even out of committee. So, obviously, it \ncannot be used as any leverage against S. 543.\n  With regard to the President's nomination of Alexis Herman to be \nSecretary of Labor, and the fact that that matter has not been brought \nto the floor, I don't believe that issue--which I will talk about in a \nsecond--should be used to deal with this very targeted, narrow \nlegislation in response to the summit in Philadelphia.\n  What you have there is an individual who went through the committee \nprocess, and purportedly handled her business there very well, but as \nthe future spokesperson for the administration on labor failed to \nmention that the administration was contemplating a massive change in \nlabor law; and that they were contemplating doing it not by bringing \nlegislation to the House and the Senate but by making the change occur \nby decree--an Executive order issued by the President--that would \nexclude about 80 percent of the American work force from eligibility on \na labor contract. That didn't come up in the hearing. That is not an \ninsignificant policy. It is even in the minds of many a constitutional \nconfrontation.\n\n  We don't govern by decree in America--nor edict. The President cannot \nwrite the law. He can veto it, but he cannot write it. That is a huge \nissue. And the majority said, ``Wait a minute. We want to talk more \nabout that.'' And we are going to. It is likely to be extensive. That \nis what that nomination is entrapped about--the idea that the President \nwould rewrite law that has been in place for 60 years, and bypass the \nCongress.\n  That disagreement, purportedly, according to the other side, is the \nreason that we should take no further action on S. 543, a 12-page bill, \ndouble-spaced bill, whose simple goal is to protect American volunteers \nfrom being undue legal targets.\n  Prior to 1980, this was not a problem in our country. You can count \non two fingers the number of lawsuits that have been targeted at \nvolunteers. But in the 1980's there were several celebrated cases. And, \nall a sudden, there was a rush. ``Well, here is a new resource that we \ncan sue.'' Often the volunteer organization has very limited resources. \nBut maybe one of the volunteers owns a home, or maybe it is worth a \nquarter of a million dollars. ``We will go after that.'' This \nlegislation says no. You can't do that. It has to be proportionate.\n  There was a case discussed yesterday where a volunteer was sitting at \nthe reception desk at a gym. A child in the gym dropped a weight and \nbroke his or her leg. The volunteer agency that organized this \nrecreation didn't have anything. But guess what? The volunteer \nanswering the phone did. Who did they sue? Right--the volunteer \nanswering the phone who had nothing to do with anything other than \nbeing a good-spirited American. When that news gets around town, how \nmany people are going to go answer the phone? Not many.\n  That is what we are trying to protect here in this legislation--that \nthe volunteer could only be held liable for that which she was \nresponsible, which was zero. A 12-page bill, double-spaced with a very \nnarrow focus to that, tries to help fulfill the call of Presidents \nClinton, Bush, Carter, and Ford: America, step up, renew our volunteer \nspirit,\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nrenew what is so unique about it, and reinvigorate your desire to come \nforward.\n  If they do not protect those families and their assets, their homes, \ntheir checking accounts, that is asking more than they are going to \nget. Volunteers are willing to step forward, but it is another thing to \nsay step forward and place everything you have in place to manage your \nfamily, you put that in a legal lottery, which is why there have been \n48,000 resignations in the last several years, which is why voluntarism \nhas dropped from 54 percent to 48 percent and going down, which is why \ncharitable organizations do not have as much in resources to spend on \ntheir work because they are spending it on insurance, and which is why \nthere is this chilling cloud. As more and more Americans realize they \nare not just volunteering to help someone in need, they are placing all \ntheir own property at risk, as everyone learns that, their first \npriority is to protect their own family.\n  S. 543 comes to this problem in a very balanced and appropriate \nmanner. Now, I have discovered that even though this is only 12 pages \nlong, double spaced--and I know we always talk about how much of the \nactual legislation is read. It is pretty obvious this has not been read \nby a number of the Members because of the comments they have made. \nYesterday we heard that it would protect the Ku Klux Klan, of all \nthings. I suggested that it be read. I will read the provision that \ndeals with that. It is the definition of a nonprofit organization, what \nis one. It is this. It is ``any organization described in section \n501(c)(3)''--that has to be an educational effort--``of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from tax under section 501(a).''\n  That means the Internal Revenue Service has to certify that it is an \nappropriate organization. I have been through that myself. It takes a \nlong time. They ask a lot of questions. It would be ``any not-for-\nprofit organization organized and conducted for public benefit and \noperated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, \nwelfare, or health purposes,'' period.\n  That is the kind of organization this legislation provides some \nprotection for. Why do I say some? Because it does not protect the \norganization or the volunteer for willful misconduct.\n  In other words, let us say the volunteer was driving, carrying \nchildren and was inebriated--drunk. No protection. Let us say the \nvolunteer was involved in a hate crime or a sexual offense or a civil \nrights matter. No protection. This is designed to deal with the \nvolunteer at the Little League who is just carrying out his or her job \nas a volunteer and somebody trips or slips or falls. We all know what \nthat means. It would give them some protection from liability.\n  So this legislation, as narrow as it is, would cut a wide swath and \nopen the door for a large number of Americans to do what they naturally \nwant to do anyway; it is a part of who we are, and that is to step \nforward and volunteer and answer the call of four Presidents and \nGeneral Powell. It is being filibustered and has been since Monday at \nabout 2 o'clock--with the exception of the managing Member on the other \nside, virtually none of the other side's debate has had anything to do \nwith this at all but extraneous matters--for which we have now had two \ncloture votes, and the majority leader has said we are going to have \ntwo more because we are going to do something about voluntarism in \nAmerica.\n  It does not have anything to do with the supplemental, and it does \nnot have anything to do with our argument over labor law. Those are \nboth very, very powerful issues and ought to be dealt with in the \nappropriate venue. It is a little bit like taking a sledgehammer to \ndeal with an ant. This is a good Samaritan act, and the fact that we \nare now sitting here at 1:20 on Wednesday for these 12 pages, double \nspaced, is a rather remarkable comment on goodwill--or the lack of it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to cover questions that have been \nraised, not so much by the other side but by others, about what we need \nto do on voluntarism. Some people have suggested that we do not need to \ndo much, if anything, that voluntarism is healthier than ever.\n  That is simply not true. I am going to repeat this. According to the \nIndependent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering \ndropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991, and then 48 \npercent in 1993--a clear pattern. Fear of litigation alone does not \nexplain the decline, but it is one factor we can address.\n  I was glad to see the Presidents and General Powell calling on \nAmerica to reinvigorate itself. I was once the Director of the U.S. \nPeace Corps, and I feel I have some personal knowledge. I had a chance \nto be right up close to the American spirit. It is unique and it is a \ntreasured value, a treasured piece of the American spirit. Anything \nthat interrupts it or gets in the way, anything that chills it, \ndiscourages it, we ought to be attentive to. Historically and \ncontemporarily, voluntarism as it occurs in the United States is fairly \nunique around the world even. It has been written about, and it is \ntrue. It began with our very beginning. As Americans moved all across \nthe country to the West, over and over again was that coming together \nand that volunteer spirit to help one another build this great Nation. \nIt would be like being concerned about protecting our national \nmonuments, protecting our national treasures, our parks.\n\n  Voluntarism is an American national treasure of immense proportions. \nI used to try, with my mental calculator, to figure out the value that \nthe Peace Corps volunteers had contributed to the world and to the \nUnited States, and it is in the billions--billions. I assume there are \npeople who have tried to do that here domestically, but it would be \nvery difficult to calculate because there is so much of it we do not \neven know about--the person who walks across the street to take a warm \nmeal to an invalid, or that special hand that is held out to a child \nlost in a train station. If you stop and think about it and become a \nlittle more observant, you will not be able to get through a single day \nin America when you will not see some manifestation of this treasure, \nand it requires and deserves our attention. I frankly think it deserves \na lot more attention than it has received in the last 72 hours here.\n  The Gallop organization studied voluntarism and found, in a study \ntitled ``Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit \nAssociations,'' that 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has experienced \nthe resignation of a volunteer from a board or some function in the \norganization. They have stepped aside. That is even worse. That just \nshows you the degree of fear we have here. It is not that they did not \nstep forward or there was something in their mind that said, ``I do not \nknow whether I should do it because I could get sued.'' This is a \nperson who already agreed to do it and became so intimidated that they \nquit. They resigned from the board. They left. I would venture to say \nthere is not a Member of this body who has not experienced and thought \nabout this very thing, if they would all think back. Because they are \nin public life, they are more visible, and so they have thought, do I \nreally want to do this? Does this put me at more risk, or my family? I \nbet every Member of this Congress of the United States has had their \nthinking modified because of fear of a legal challenge.\n  One in seven nonprofit agencies has eliminated one or more of their \nvaluable programs because of exposure to lawsuits. So here we have the \norganization that is eliminating its services--we are not going to do \nthat anymore; we are not going to teach people how to swim. That is a \ndangerous environment. We are not going to do the same kind of camping \nprograms because you are in the outdoors and it is harder to control. \nOr the story we heard from my colleague from Wyoming where the Boy \nScouts cannot have a volunteer with a child now. They have to have two. \nThey cannot have one adult and a child alone for fear there will be an \nallegation and a lawsuit.\n  This is a very worrisome development--fairly new, mid-1980's, last 10 \nyears, this chilling cloud that is growing and growing.\n  Look at these statistics. One in five volunteers are more concerned \nabout serving in volunteer organizations due to the increased liability \nthreat. One in five. That is 20 percent, and it is going to grow unless \nwe do something like S. 543. And 18 percent of those surveyed had \nwithheld their leadership services due to fear of liability.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n  That is the point I was making about the Members of Congress. It \nwould be interesting if we could document it, if everybody would think \nback and say, well, was there a board I left? I can think of one. Was \nthere a board on which I refused to serve? I guarantee you that the \nvast majority, if not all, have changed or made a different decision \nabout assistance because of the fear of liability.\n  And 49 percent reported seeing fewer people willing to serve on \nnonprofit organizations. That is like the story I told about Washington \nRedskin Terry Orr when he took over trying to recruit team members to \nhelp in the inner city here in Washington. They had to fight to get \nhim, because he was concerned about liability.\n\n  Mr. President, ``72 percent reported volunteers becoming cautious in \nwhat they say or do, relating to their volunteer work.'' That is a \npoint that has not been talked about much here. But, clearly, people \nmake different decisions when they are fearful of liability and they \nbegin, even if they are a volunteer, not being as effective a \nvolunteer. The kind of duty they will accept, the kind of thing they \nmight or might not do, begins to be less effective. One of the reasons \nI have always argued against programs that say they are volunteer, but \nfor which there is a large sum of money paid, which is actually a \npayment relationship, is that the unique chemistry that creates the \nAmerican volunteer is altered; the free spirit of it, the nature of it \nis not the same if the volunteer is forced to be there.\n  Some have suggested that we ought to mandate voluntary service. The \nminute you mandate it you cannot use the word ``volunteer'' anymore. \nThat is drafted, and that person interacts with the children or elderly \npeople they are serving in a completely different way than when it is \nself-sought.\n  I was with a man the other day in middle Georgia. He volunteers a \ngreat deal of his time teaching youngsters how to fly and be involved \nin the Civil Air Patrol. He has spent several thousands of his own \ndollars to help these young men and women. He was driving me to my \ndestination and, as we approached, he said: But it's all worth it when \nI see their faces, when I see the excitement in their faces. That is \nvoluntarism and that is a special chemistry. The point I am making here \nis, when you introduce this fear, this chilling fear about what you can \nand cannot do and how liable you are, you change the entire chemistry \nof this volunteer that I have called an American treasure.\n  Another thing I have heard from time to time is, ``There is no \nevidence of a national crisis involving a flood of lawsuits.'' It is \nnot the number of judgments we are worried about here. We do not know \nall of them because many of them are settled. Institutions do not like \nto talk about this. It only invites more. So you really cannot get a \ntotal picture of what is happening in this arena. But you only have to \nhave one of these celebrated cases to change the behavior of millions \nof Americans. So it is not a question of how much has happened. The \nfact is that it has happened and therefore the insurance companies have \nmodified their premiums manyfold.\n  There is one example of a Little League whose premium for protection \nin this arena was $75. It went to $775. You multiply that all across \nthe land. It is the fact that it is a phenomenon that is occurring more \nreadily, volunteers are a target, premiums are up, and volunteers step \nback.\n  We have heard some on the floor say persons injured by volunteer \nnegligence will not be protected. In other words, there is not a \nredress for the first person who was injured, the young fellow who \nbroke his leg when he dropped the weight. Under this legislation, \nanyone injured by this simple negligence, that is conduct that is not \nreckless, wanton, intentional, or criminal, of a volunteer, can still \nseek recovery from the organization. In other words, the organization \nwould still have a liability, but not the volunteer who is just there \nas a good Samaritan. It would be the organization. The volunteer who \ncame there as a good Samaritan, who just happened to have resources \nmore than maybe the organization, is not set aside as a target. Which \nis appropriate.\n  Of course, as I have said repeatedly on the floor, and I hope some on \nthe other side would listen to this, that when the volunteer's conduct \nis reckless, wanton, intentional, or criminal, then nothing in this \nlegislation changes the terms of recovering the damages. In other \nwords, there is no shield, there is no protection for a volunteer who \nwas engaged in reckless, wanton, intentional, or criminal activity.\n  A question has been raised, why should a volunteer who causes harm to \na child through negligence be immune from suit?\n  It is not the intention of the bill to cause volunteers to act \ncarelessly with children, or any that they are helping, or those that \nare entrusted to their care. The truth is that simple, honest mistakes \nand accidents happen in life. They just do. The organization still \nremains potentially liable for the actions of its volunteers, and will \nstill encourage due care by its volunteers. In fact, the legislation \nspecifically says that if it is the practice to certify licensure, \ntrain the volunteer, the volunteer organization, the charitable \ninstitution, is still responsible for carrying that activity out. \nOtherwise they do, indeed, increase their liability.\n  We believe, in fact, that the organization will often be in a better \nposition to pay than the volunteers would be anyway. Volunteers \nthemselves can be people of limited means or not, just as those who are \nserved by charitable volunteers are often people of limited resources. \nWe have heard that no independent study suggests federally imposed tort \nimmunity, legal immunity, will increase the number, frequency, or \nquality of volunteers. As I have said over and over here, every one of \nus has met someone like this. If it was ourselves, we looked at \nourselves in the mirror. Who has not expressed fear of liability in \nvolunteering?\n\n  This is not rocket science. It is pretty straightforward. We have a \nsituation where the current system is chilling the impact of \nvolunteers--reducing their ability to come forward, causing them to \nleave, causing them to alter the way in which they carry out their \nwork.\n  I hesitate to bring this up again, but I guess I have to because the \nother side has alluded to it, particularly yesterday, where it was \nsuggested that organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan might gain \nlawsuit immunity from S. 543. As I have read here, now, at least three \ntimes and probably, given the circumstance, will do so three more, the \nbill specifically excludes from its protection suits based on \nmisconduct that includes violent crime, hate crimes, sex crimes, or \ncivil rights violations. It also does not apply where the defendant was \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. The bill only provides limited \nimmunity for the simple negligence of volunteers in carrying out their \nvolunteer duties for a nonprofit organization, organized for public \nbenefit, and primarily carrying out charitable, civic, educational, \nreligious, welfare, or health purposes. And, as I have said, it \nincludes volunteers for 501(c)(3) organizations, which are educational \norganizations that must be certified and approved by the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Some have said, if this bill is passed it will not reduce the \nliability insurance rates of nonprofit organizations at all. In fact, \ninsurance rates for nonprofit organizations could go up. The primary \nobjective of the bill is to encourage more volunteers. Insurance \nramifications are secondary. The primary purpose, I repeat, of this \nlegislation, S. 543, is to encourage more Americans--in your State, Mr. \nPresident, and in mine, and in every State of the Union--to come \nforward and reinforce the meaning of voluntarism in our country. While \nwe can look at nonprofits' insurance rates as a measure of the problem, \nreducing the insurance rates of nonprofit organizations is not the \nbill's main goal. I personally believe that you will see a reduction in \nthe rates because it stands to reason that, if the liability is \ncircumscribed, made smaller, that the rates will ultimately reflect \nthat. And that those sums of money, instead of being used for insurance \npremiums, can be used to buy meals, give rides, teach, provide meals, \nand otherwise give aid and assistance to Americans in need.\n  We have heard this objection, and this has been mentioned on the \nfloor: ``We do not need a Federal law. We\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nshould leave it to each State to decide how to protect volunteers.'' It \nwas, I think, very well stated yesterday when Senator McConnell, from \nKentucky, pointed out the national nature of voluntarism. Many of the \nNation's most preeminent volunteer organizations are national in scope. \nWe do not have to spend much time thinking about it--the American Red \nCross, the United Way, Little League International--and the list goes \non. These are national organizations and their activities interact with \nall the States and volunteers. Their activities cross State lines. We \nhave a classic example. We have been talking about it today. There is \nno telling how many volunteers are in the Midwest and how many of them \ncome from somewhere else in the country. Many of them do.\n  I experienced a flood of these proportions in our State several years \nago and people came from everywhere and volunteered and pitched in. \nThey made sandbags, they helped clean out the mess, the mud. And, as \nhas been characterized, a flood takes a long time to get straight. In \nfact, I think I could sadly say that many of the communities that have \nbeen confronted with this flooding in the Midwest will never be the \nsame. Their character will be altered forever. It takes a while to \nappreciate the scope of what massive flooding can do. The point here is \nthat the volunteers move across State lines a lot, and the \norganizations that recruit them are national organizations.\n  The decline of voluntarism is of national concern, else why would we \nhave three former Presidents and the President all gathered together \nwith 30 Governors and 100 mayors? They were not in Philadelphia to \nencourage voluntarism just in Philadelphia. They recognize that this is \na national problem, and as I mentioned a little earlier, it is also a \nnational treasure. Voluntarism, and what it means to America, is a \npiece of our national mystique, just as our national parks and our \nnational monuments, and it needs national attention.\n  Having said that, the legislation does acknowledge the State role. \nFirst, if the State takes greater safeguards in the national bill, the \nnational bill does not preempt those safeguards that go beyond the \nscope of the national bill.\n  If everybody involved in the legal action is a citizen of the same \nState, the State, by legislative action, may opt out from under S. 543 \nand only State law would apply, where all the defendants and plaintiffs \nwere of that State. But, as I said, if it is a case that involves \nvolunteers or activities among States, the Federal law would prevail.\n  I have said the national groups can cross State lines, but even local \ngroups operate across State lines. How often is the camping trip to the \nnext State, the neighbor State, or to the beach or to the mountains, to \na lake--somewhere else? A lot of volunteer activity occurs across \nmultiple State lines.\n  A Boy Scout troop in Georgia may go to an outing in Tennessee or \nNorth Carolina, Alabama, or Florida. This would be the case in every \nState. I remember when I was an Explorer Scout. A lot of the activities \noccurred somewhere else, outside the home State.\n  In emergency situations and disasters, which I have alluded to, such \nas hurricanes and floods in the upper Midwest States, volunteers come \nfrom many States, and under pretty difficult situations, too, which has \nnot been talked about. Volunteers are often confronted with situations \nand circumstances that are abnormal, such as working in a disaster, \nwhere accidents are more prone. If you think back, most of the \naccidents that you have had in your own home were usually during \ninclement weather, you were doing something that was a little out of \nthe norm. You were more prone to a mistake or accident. Volunteers are \noften embroiled in that very kind of situation where you are more \nlikely to have a mistake made, which would be another argument for S. \n543.\n  There is so much volunteer activity that is directed at a \ncircumstance or phenomenon that is out of the norm--a fire, a calamity \nof some sort in the community, and people make more mistakes in that \nenvironment because they are in places with which they are not familiar \nand they are confronting circumstances they do not deal with on a daily \nbasis, which is yet another argument, frankly, that has not been \nchronicled. But it just occurred to me as another reason why S. 543 \nwould be so pertinent.\n  State laws are a hodgepodge of Good Samaritan laws and, in some \ncases, provide little protection at all. On that point, I want to read \nfrom the ``ABA Section of Business Law,'' a recent article that deals \nwith this subject pretty well. It talks about the fact that in the \neighties, this began to become a major problem. Prior to that, it was \nnot. Then it talks about the States all trying to deal with this. It \ngoes on to say:\n\n       The blame falls largely on the patchwork nature of \n     volunteer protection laws, which vary tremendously throughout \n     the United States. To facilitate analysis and comparison, the \n     Nonprofit Risk Management Center compiled them in a \n     publication, State Liability Laws for Charitable \n     Organizations and Volunteers. This article--\n\n  The one I am quoting--\n\n     draws on that analysis.\n       Each of the laws grants volunteers partial immunity. The \n     extent of that immunity, and the conditions required for it \n     to apply, vary not only across the states, but even within \n     some states depending on the type of volunteer and the nature \n     of the organization the volunteer serves. The common feature \n     of the statutes is that unless volunteers' conduct fails to \n     satisfy whatever standard the law specifies, they cannot be \n     held personally liable.\n\n  Which is, of course, the goal we are after in S. 543.\n\n       The variations result from differences in circumstances \n     that impelled legislatures to act, effectiveness of the \n     volunteer-protection proponents, and the sensitivity of \n     legislatures to the prospect of injured parties being denied \n     recovery.\n\n  The point here is that this article chronicles in a very thoughtful \nway that the current situation is unmanageable, when you have national \norganizations, volunteers crossing State borders, activity in the \nvarious States and none of the two States being the same. Therefore, \nthis has accomplished very little in terms of the chilling impact on \nvolunteers. They do not know what risks they face and, therefore, they \nare stepping back from volunteering.\n  Charities, especially small charities, do not have the resources to \ndetermine the difference in State laws affecting them. Amen. There is \nabsolutely no way. Of course, as you know, Mr. President, with the \noutburst of lawmaking here and across the States, it is almost \nimpossible for any citizen to understand the complexities of the law \ntoday. Just talk to them about the IRS, that one alone. But here the \ncharities do not have the resources to understand what they are \nconfronted with in all the different States, and if the charity does \nnot, the volunteer certainly does not. The volunteer is really the \nhapless wanderer as that volunteer travels from this State to that \nState, and their liability threat is changing each time they go to a \nnew location. There is absolutely no way for them to unravel it.\n\n  Therefore, concluding on this point, the national interest requires \nsome uniformity. It does not prohibit the State from exceeding it, and \nit does not prohibit the State--in fact, it gives them an option to \ncome out from under it, if all the parties of the case are from that \nState.\n  Some say this bill preempts State law, violating principles of \nfederalism. This is the activity we have just been talking about. The \nbill respects federalism concerns by allowing States to opt out of its \nprovisions for those cases in which all parties are citizens of the \nState. It leaves in place State laws that are not inconsistent with its \nprovisions and allows States to pass stronger volunteer protections if \nthey wish.\n  The bill also leaves in place existing State laws on vicarious \nliability requiring a financially secure source of recovery, requiring \nrisk management procedures and other State requirements.\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude my remarks in just a few \nminutes. It is my understanding that Senator D'Amato is going to be in \nthe Chamber at 2 o'clock for a matter that he will choose to discuss. I \nwant to reiterate, S. 543 is a 12-page, double-spaced, clean-cut bill \nthat helps Americans respond to the President's call to volunteer. It \nhas nothing to do with the significant labor dispute on policy between \nthe Congress trying to protect its rights of the third branch, and the \nPresident trying to change labor law by Executive order. It has nothing \nto do with that whatsoever. Nor does it\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\nhave anything to do with the controversy or debate over the \nsupplemental on Bosnia, disaster, and other matters. That legislation \nis still in committee and not before the Senate. What is before the \nSenate is S. 543. Its sole purpose is to make it easier for an American \nto volunteer and protect the unique treasure that voluntarism \nrepresents for the United States.\n  We have, I believe, two cloture votes set for tomorrow. So given the \ncircumstances, I suspect we will come back to this legislation. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum pending the arrival of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I received a very important and \na very encouraging letter from Ambassador Thomas Borer. Ambassador \nBorer is the special representative that the Swiss have appointed to \nhandle the very perplexing and very troublesome question as it relates \nto the assets of Holocaust victims during and after World War II, \nparticularly those as they related to the accounts that were opened in \nSwiss banks.\n  Let me read this letter. It is a short one, but a very important one. \nIt is from the Embassy of Switzerland, addressed to Senator D'Amato as \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Washington, DC:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am referring to your letter of March \n     20, 1997 and my reply of March 27, 1997 regarding the \n     question of publishing the names of dormant account holders \n     from the Holocaust era.\n       Please find enclosed [a] copy of the letter of the Chairman \n     of the Swiss Bankers Association to the Chairman of the Swiss \n     Federal Banking Commission dated April 28, 1997. In this \n     letter the SBA expresses its unequivocal support for this \n     idea.\n\n  I am going to place this letter in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Embassy of Switzerland,\n\n                                         Washington, DC, April 28.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am referring to your letter of March \n     20, 1997 and my reply of March 27, 1997 regarding the \n     question of publishing the names of dormant account holders \n     from the Holocaust era.\n       Please find enclosed copy of the letter of the Chairman of \n     the Swiss Bankers Association to the Chairman of the Swiss \n     Federal Banking Commission dated April 28, 1997. In this \n     letter the SBA expresses its unequivocal support for this \n     idea.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Thomas G. Borer,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me tell you what this is about. I did \nwrite to Ambassador Borer. I spoke to him on March 20. And I indicated \nto the Ambassador that I thought that it was awfully important that the \nSwiss Bankers Association, that the Swiss Government do something to \ndemonstrate tangibly an effort of good faith, that would be very \nimportant, that there are many accounts--we do not know exactly how \nmany; but certainly they go into the hundreds, and they may go into \nmore--that have been dormant since 1945, that it made little sense to \nwait years until the Swiss completed their investigation for the \nrelease of these names, that even if it took legislation--and I \nexplained to him that it had been advised to me that there was a good \npossibility that it might not even take legislation--that the names of \nthese accounts--those are dormant accounts that were opened prior to \n1945 and that have been dormant since that point in time --that the \nneed for secrecy certainly no longer existed, but that there was a need \nto connect the families and the heirs today who might have claim to \nthose accounts, to their heirs, to their families.\n  It is not just a question of money. It is a question of doing what is \nright, because unfortunately for 50-plus years people have been denied, \nheirs have been denied. They have had to go through a tortuous process, \nthat in many cases it is just impossible to ascertain what moneys may \nor may not have been left to them, and that by the publication of the \nnames in some registry, in some total form--something that is being \ndone in many countries, in many States in our country where there is a \ndormant account, the names of the people are actually published so that \npeople who may have claims can come forth.\n  I wrote to him, and I will just quote you part.\n\n       I am writing to you to impress upon you the need for the \n     passage of legislation which would allow for the publication \n     of names of dormant accounts presently held in Swiss banks. I \n     feel that this change would go a long way towards solving \n     this enormously difficult and complicated problem and would \n     equally be seen as a productive step which I am sure would be \n     warmly received.\n\n  I am pleased to tell you that the Ambassador reported to me \nyesterday, yesterday morning, that the Swiss Bankers Association \nunequivocally supports the concept of public disclosure of the names of \nthe account holders in this very special and limited situation of the \ndormant accounts now being investigated as it relates to the Holocaust \nand those dormant assets.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that this is important.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from me to \nAmbassador Borer and a letter from the Swiss Bankers Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1997.\n     Ambassador Thomas G. Borer,\n     Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Bern, Switzerland.\n       Dear Ambassador Borer: I am writing to you in connection \n     with the on-going inquiry by the Senate Banking Committee \n     into the fate of assets held by Swiss banks belonging to \n     victims of the Holocaust. As you are aware, among the issues \n     which the Committee has focused its attention on has been the \n     status of dormant accounts which may still exist in Swiss \n     banks. My concern is that the present status of Swiss law \n     inhibits any effective way to ensure the return of these \n     assets to their rightful owners.\n       Presently, both the Volcker Commission and the New York \n     State Banking Department are conducting inquiries designed to \n     locate and identify dormant accounts. This of course is in \n     addition to the 1996 survey undertaken by the Swiss Bankers \n     Association and any internal reviews being conducted by the \n     banks themselves. The problem lies in the bank secrecy \n     provisions of the Swiss Federal Banking Law which preclude \n     any effective way to contact the rightful owners of any \n     dormant accounts uncovered through these efforts. For \n     example, if a dormant account belonging to a Holocaust victim \n     is located and that account holder did not name a beneficiary \n     when the account was opened, there is no mechanism in place \n     by which the heirs of that Holocaust victim could receive \n     that which is rightfully theirs. The only way he would be in \n     a position to make a claim to those assets would be if he \n     knew of the existence of the account and the name of the bank \n     in which it is located. Obviously, if the rightful heirs \n     possessed such information, the account would have been \n     claimed long ago. In cases where the account holder did name \n     a beneficiary, it appears that less than diligent steps were \n     taken to locate these beneficiaries. This was made abundantly \n     clear in the case of the 53 accounts turned over to the \n     Polish Government pursuant to the Swiss-Polish Agreement of \n     1949. Notwithstanding the fact that the Swiss government \n     classified these assets as heirless and turned them over to \n     the Polish government, the recent publication of the names \n     this year led\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n     to the location of several heirs within days of the \n     publication.\n       Although much reliance has been placed upon the role Mr. \n     Hanspeter Hani, the Ombudsman, the fact is that little faith \n     is placed in his office given the results of his searches \n     thus far, as well as the enormous restrictions on what he can \n     do. Although he accepts a fee of one hundred francs, he \n     merely screens the claims and circulates a portion of these \n     names to the banks. Clearly this is not the most effective \n     way to connect dormant accounts with their rightful owners \n     and indeed, the numbers speak for themselves. Despite the \n     fact that well over one thousand claims have been filed with \n     his office, less than one percent have resulted in the return \n     of assets to a claimant. The very justification given by the \n     Swiss Bankers Association for charging the one hundred franc \n     fee was to discourage false claims, this leads to the \n     inescapable conclusion that the claims received by his office \n     are indeed legitimate, but nevertheless, virtually all claims \n     have been rejected. The failure of Mr. Hani's office is but \n     one indicator of the barriers set up by Swiss law which \n     prevent an effective notification system to the owners or \n     heirs of dormant accounts.\n       I am writing to you to impress upon you the need for the \n     passage of legislation which would allow for the publication \n     of names of dormant accounts presently held in Swiss banks. I \n     feel that this change would go a long way towards solving \n     this enormously difficult and complicated problem and would \n     equally be seen as a productive step which I am sure would be \n     warmly received.\n       Although I am cognizant of the precedent setting concerns \n     of lifting the bank secrecy laws, I'm sure we all agree, the \n     fate of assets placed in Switzerland during the Second World \n     War is a unique situation calling for a unique response. The \n     fact is, these accounts were opened over fifty years ago, so \n     it is hard to imagine that present or potential customers of \n     Swiss banks would be concerned about the publication of this \n     limited group of names. What happened during the Second World \n     War was unparalleled in the history of modern civilization \n     and accordingly exceptional measures are called for.\n       The Volcker Commission will soon begin its review and \n     additional dormant accounts will almost certainly be found. \n     Is it really necessary to wait between two and five years for \n     the Commission to complete its work before a decision can be \n     made on how to handle these accounts? Clearly a more \n     effective solution would be to allow for the publication of \n     the account names as they are found so that efforts to locate \n     the rightful owners can begin immediately. New York State \n     presently has such a mechanism in place whereby banks publish \n     the names of dormant accounts which are present on their \n     books. This publication is done through major newspapers and \n     if any owners or potential heirs believe that they are \n     entitled to the contents of a published account, a claim is \n     filed with the bank, which then reviews the claimant's \n     documentation to ensure that it is legitimate. If nobody \n     comes to claim the money, it is turned over to the Office of \n     the Comptroller of the State of New York which handles any \n     future claims and relieves the bank of further liability. It \n     is a fairly simple system which has been in existence for \n     over fifty years and frankly I am not aware of any criticism \n     or problems with it.\n       I think we all agree that the manner by which dormant \n     accounts existing in Swiss Banks are to be handled is an \n     issue which will have to be addressed. There is simply no \n     justification for maintaining the veil of secrecy over these \n     accounts. I firmly believe that the only effective way to \n     ensure that the assets are returned to their rightful owners \n     is to publish the names of the dormant accounts holders and \n     that it be done as they are uncovered rather than years from \n     now.\n       If you would like to discuss this matter further, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Swiss Bankers Association,\n\n                                                   April 28, 1997.\n     Dr. Kurt Hauri,\n     Chairman, Swiss Federal Banking Commission, Bern.\n     Re: Publication of names of Holocaust-related dormant \n         account-holders\n       Dear Dr. Hauri: In recent weeks, it has been proposed that \n     the names of the holders of accounts opened before 1945 that \n     have been identified as dormant, be disclosed publicly for \n     the purpose of advancing the efforts of the Swiss banks, the \n     Swiss Government, Jewish organizations and others to assist \n     Holocaust victims and their heirs locate their assets. You \n     expressed support for such a proposal on April 22, 1997. As \n     you know, the recent initiative by the Swiss Bankers \n     Association (``SBA'') resulted in the identification of \n     dormant accounts that include accounts that may have belonged \n     to victims of the Holocaust. The Independent Committee of \n     Eminent Persons (the ``Volcker Committee'') is currently in \n     the process of identifying all dormant assets held by Swiss \n     banks that could have belonged to Holocaust victims.\n       I am writing to express the SBA's unequivocal support for \n     the concept of public disclosure of the names of account \n     holders in the very special and limited circumstances \n     presented by Holocaust-related dormant assets. It is our hope \n     that, working with the Federal Banking Commission, the Swiss \n     Government and other interested parties, including the \n     Volcker Commission, a mechanism will be implemented soon that \n     will permit such disclosure consistent with Swiss law and \n     sound banking practices.\n       When such mechanism is put in place, the names of account \n     holders can be disseminated throughout the world. Public \n     disclosure of the names of account holders Holocaust-related \n     dormant assets is a position that is fully supported by the \n     three largest members of the SBA, Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank \n     Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland. Each of these \n     institutions have committed to sharing in the costs required \n     to globally publicize a list of account holders names.\n       We look forward to discussing this matter with you in the \n     very near future.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Dr. Georg F. Krayer,\n       Chairman.\n     J.P. Chapuis,\n       Delegate.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the chairman of the Swiss Bankers \nAssociation in his letter stated:\n\n       I am writing to express the SBA's unequivocal support for \n     the concept of public disclosure of the names of account \n     holders in the very special and limited circumstances \n     presented by Holocaust-related dormant assets.\n\n  This announcement is a major breakthrough because, for the first \ntime, the Swiss bankers will be providing account names on a timely \nbasis. We will not have to wait for the completion of the Volcker \nCommission and its report. That investigation may take a period of \nyears to be completed. Why should the heirs and those people be \ndeprived of a much more expeditious manner to come forward and to \nestablish the right to those accounts?\n  It is about time this has taken place because this question is one \nthat has existed for over 50 years. I am pleased that we are making \nprogress. I look forward to continuing in the efforts of attempting to \nsee that justice is done, not only as it relates to the dormant \naccounts, but also on the question of the disposition of other assets \nand also in terms of the accountability of assets, of huge amounts of \ngold and other matters that were, I believe, surreptitiously and \nillegally transferred by the Nazis with the aid and assistance of some \nwho claimed neutrality.\n  But the point of the matter is that this is a significant \nbreakthrough. I want to thank Ambassador Borer. I think he is to be \ncommended because this is a significant departure and one that is long \noverdue from the past policies that said, ``Oh, no; these are secret \naccounts. They have been opened up that way,'' and then requiring \npeople to go through incredibly difficult, if not impossible, proofs, \nrequiring them to come up with sums of money that in many cases people \njust do not have. The question of having people, in the past, turned \nback because they did not have a death certificate of a family member \nwho died in the death camps--that kind of thing has taken place \nrepeatedly over the years.\n\n  It certainly did not bode well for the fiduciary responsibility that \nthe banks held up. They were the beacon and the repository of people's \nmoney, that they could rest at ease that their families would be \nprotected and the assets protected. Indeed, the veil of silence worked \nto enrich others at the expense of the legitimate heirs.\n  So, for the ambassador to be able to bring about this sea change--\nthis is a sea change, this is a significant breakthrough. I look \nforward to continuing to work in this area to see to it that the \npublication of these names takes place as quickly as possible so that \nthere can be this feeling of closure that many are looking for. It is \nnot just the money. It is a question of justice that people are \nseeking.\n  Mr. President, I am heartened today by this very significant action \nthat the Swiss Bankers Association have pledged. I look forward to \nworking with the ambassador and the other representatives of the Swiss \nGovernment in seeing to it that this matter is dealt with sooner, \nrather than later. This is the commitment that they have made. This is \na very prestigious, very important group. I hope this can be carried \nout, again, within a matter of days or weeks. Mr. President, 52 years \nis too long to have waited for this to take place. But better now than \nnever. It still is, hopefully, the harbinger of better things to come \nin terms of clearing up and getting down to the roots of what has taken \nplace.\n  I commend the ambassador for this and say that I am very heartened \nbecause I think this is a tangible success.\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n I also say to the World Jewish Congress and Edgar Bronfman and Israel \nSinger, they are to be commended for never losing faith in continuing \ntheir effort. Without their persistence, we never would have reached \nthe point where we now have a proposal to put $4.7 billion forward in a \nhumanitarian fund to be administered by a number of organizations in \ncountries that will play a part in determining those people who are \nmost in need. That fund would be administered over a period of some 15 \nyears. Without the World Jewish Congress and its leadership, its \nperseverance, we never would have achieved the results I am speaking to \ntoday. That is, the publication of the names of those people who had \ndormant accounts, going back to 1945, nor would we have achieved the \nsetting up of this humanitarian fund to aid those who are elderly and \nmost in need.\n  I thank the Chair and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I guess only those who have just \ntuned in would be aware of the fact that we have been discussing an \nattempt since Monday afternoon, from Monday afternoon until Wednesday \nat 3 p.m., to allow the Senate to proceed to S. 543. The other side has \ndecided to filibuster this legislation and has now twice blocked our \nattempts to end debate and move on to the bill. Although we are getting \ncloser, we might say, well, maybe if there are five more votes like the \none today, we will finally end the debate; the bill being a very \nnarrow, specific proposal that tries to respond to the call of the \nPresident and three former Presidents to encourage voluntarism in \nAmerica.\n  To revisit for a moment what was going on in Philadelphia, it was \nGen. Colin Powell who said that ``the multiple crises confronting \nchildren in America have the potential to explode our society.'' I am \ngoing to reread the quote of General Powell.\n\n       ``The multiple crises confronting children have the \n     potential to explode our society,'' as General Powell called \n     on his fellow Americans to make an extraordinary personal \n     commitment to serve as mentors to at-risk youth.\n\n  Earlier today I pointed out that volunteers being called on today are \noften called on to participate in situations that are less than normal \nenvironments; that the potential for volatility and miscommunication \nand misunderstanding is very high.\n  S. 543 has perhaps more importance today than it did over a decade \nago when it was first envisioned in this Congress because it gives the \nvolunteer a shield, a modest shield I might add, from certain kinds of \nliability. It does not protect the volunteer from willful or wanton \nmisconduct. For example, if a volunteer were driving an automobile and \ninebriated, there would be no protection whatsoever. But for the \neveryday routine activity, it would protect the volunteers.\n  Here we have General Powell saying to his fellow Americans, make an \nextraordinary personal commitment to serve as mentors to at-risk youth. \nAnd here we are having spent 3 days trying to pass one modest proposal \nto help those volunteers step forward and we are systematically choked \nand throttled. What a great response to General Powell and to the \nNation, calling on Americans to come forward and then we have a boot on \ntheir neck right here in the Nation's Capitol in this Chamber.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Together with President Clinton, former Presidents Bush, \n     Carter, Ford, 30 Governors and 100 mayors participating in a \n     conference on volunteering--\n\n  Conference on volunteering--\n\n       Powell said that as many as 15 million young Americans need \n     mentors to help them overcome the adversities they face.\n\n  Well, by logical conclusion, that means we have to have many millions \nof Americans to come forward to take care of just this audience--15 \nmillion young Americans need mentoring. That does not include the \nsenior citizens who need mentoring, who need Meals on Wheels, who need \nsomebody to come by and visit in the evening. That does not include the \nyoung people who are involved in youthful sports like Little League \nbaseball or Pop Warner football. That does not include the Americans \nthat would travel to the Midwest to assist in filling sandbags, who \nwould help clean out the muck and debris that will follow this flood.\n\n  In other words, it requires millions upon millions of Americans to \nstep forward. And yet a cursory review of the data demonstrates \nconclusively that because of legal threats, the number of volunteers is \ndropping. It is going in the wrong direction in terms of what General \nPowell and Presidents Clinton and Bush are asking. There are not more \nAmericans stepping forward; there are less. And a principal reason \nthere are less is that they do not mind volunteering, but they do mind \nputting their entire family's assets--their checking accounts, their \nhome, their business--in a legal lottery.\n  I told the story this morning of the situation where a charity, a \nnonprofit, had a gym for youth to use after school and a youngster \nbroke his arm when he dropped the weights. The organization did not \nhave any resources to speak of, but the volunteer receptionist did. \nGuess who got sued. Right, the volunteer receptionist. Those kinds of \nthings get around, and before long you have more and more Americans \nsaying, ``I want to volunteer, but I don't want to jeopardize my \nfamily.''\n\n       General Powell said these children are at risk of growing \n     up physically or psychologically abused. They are at risk of \n     growing up addicted to the pathologies and the poisons of the \n     street. They are at risk of bringing children into the world \n     before they themselves have grown up. They are at risk of \n     never growing up at all.\n\n  Madam President, I have been joined by two of my most esteemed \ncolleagues, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri and Senator Thomas of Wyoming. \nI am going to call on Senator Ashcroft to make a few remarks, but I \nwould just\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nlike to remind the Senator and close on this point, that not only are \nwe asking American volunteers in the summit to step forward in greater \nnumbers but--and this is a key point we have not talked enough about--\nwe are asking them to be volunteers in very difficult environments--in \npoisonous streets, dangerous streets, where communications are \ndifficult. In other words, where the threat of being liable for an \nerror or mistake is probably many more times multiplied. This is not \njust asking volunteers to go on a fishing trip. We are asking \nvolunteers to go into some very tough situations which only complicates \nand calls further on this Senate, this Congress to do something to give \nthem some relief from the threat of everything they own being up for \ngrabs.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to respond to \nthe final point of the Senator from Georgia, who has pointed out that \nwe need volunteers among the most needy and among the most deprived \nindividuals in our culture, and those most needy and deprived \nindividuals are the riskiest people to help.\n  I cite this article which I hold in my hand on civil justice: ``A \nThousand Points of Fright?''--f-r-i-g-h-t, not l-i-g-h-t. It is a \nscholarly work by David Webber. He writes that ``lawsuit fears are \ndampening the enthusiasm of volunteers.'' And he says, ``And the White \nHouse is beginning to take notice,'' which is constructive. I commend \nthe White House. I commend the President for mobilizing the Presidents, \nto have the Presidents' summit on voluntarism.\n  But one of the interesting things that the governmental relations \ndirector for the National PTA says is that ``we are just more conscious \nthan ever before of litigious possibilities. The bad thing has been the \nchilling effect on activities we can sponsor, especially for high-risk \nkids--kids with handicaps--and child care programs.''\n  What he has basically said is exactly what the Senator from Georgia \nwas speaking of; that in the highest risk situations we have a chilling \neffect not only on volunteers but on programs, where you begin to see \nthe withdrawals of programs, the programs that do not go into effect, \nthe programs that do not exist, opportunities that are never \ncapitalized on because of this sort of chill that comes from the \nlitigious, as he calls it, possibilities.\n\n  I must admit that frequently these possibilities do not result in a \nlawsuit with a verdict against the volunteer, but if you work as a \nvolunteer and you are sued, it could cost you $10,000 just to defend \nthe suit--$10,000. And, of course, you could have a judgment against \nyou just as the Boy Scout leader from the Cascade Pacific Council had a \nverdict of $4 million against him, because you let the boys play touch \nfootball, or the Little League coach who, because he shifted the player \nfrom shortstop to left field, gets a judgment against him. I mean these \nvolunteers obviously are going to think about what happens to their \nfamily. How can my kids go to school? I would love to help the world, \nbut I have to protect my family.\n  That would be a response you would have to commend in individuals, \nand yet it is not something we want in America. We do not want to have \nto choose between helping the world or protecting our families. We want \nto be able to say to a volunteer, you can do both. The genius of \nAmerica is that we do not have to be selfish in order to protect our \nfamilies. The genius of America is that we have always been able to \nhelp each other, while we have protected our families.\n\n  The kinds of lawsuits that we have seen are just incredible. A 14-\nyear-old boy was sliding into home plate head first when he collided \nwith the catcher. The catcher had blocked the plate as instructed. \nCatchers are always instructed to block the plate. In the rules of \nbaseball, it is the only position where you are entitled to stand in \nfront of the plate without the ball. But the catcher had blocked the \nplate and, unfortunately, there was a neck injury. Although plaintiff \ncame to the league sliding head first, and that was the way he liked to \nplay baseball, the volunteer coaches were found negligent for not being \nable to adjust the way the child slided--slid. I sound like Dizzy Dean, \nwho used to say ``slud into second.'' But volunteer coaches were held \nnegligent for not instructing the player on proper sliding techniques \nand failing to warn of the danger created by sliding into home plate \nhead first. Of course, the player obviously watched major league player \nafter major league player, role models all--and they should be, many of \nthem great folks--sliding in head first.\n  I wonder about asking people to volunteer to coach these children, so \nmany of them without dads in their own homes, so many of them at-risk \nkids, doing their best to provide them enthusiasm for their sport, and \nrestraints so as to protect themselves. And, when there is an injury, \nhaving that kind of lawsuit. So many of our volunteers are around \nsports--you wonder about the kind of lawsuits that surround sports.\n  Here is one that really stunned me. It was a part-time official who \nwas asked to officiate in a crucial Big Ten basketball game. At the \nlast second he called a foul that gave one of the teams a victory. He \ncalled them like he saw them. It switched the victory. A souvenir \ncompany that had anticipated the victory by the other team sued the \nofficial, challenging his call with a $175,000 negligence suit claiming \nhe had wrongfully harmed the souvenir company's ability to sell their \nsouvenirs. The official won the lawsuit. So let us just lay that to \nrest, the official won the lawsuit. But only after a 2-year court \nbattle that went all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court.\n  Do you know what it takes, in terms of resources, to take a court \nbattle to the supreme court of one of our States? I mean, it takes more \nthan it takes to send a kid to college. It takes more than it takes to \nhave family vacations. It takes more than it takes for some families to \nbuy a home. It certainly takes more than it takes even for the \nwealthiest families, almost, to have a downpayment on a home. We ask \npeople to volunteer in these kinds of settings. It seems to me we ought \nto have some protection for them.\n  Here is another one that caught my eye. I should not say ``caught my \neye,'' because this is about a person who was hit in the eye, a catcher \nin a softball game. He was playing without a mask. The umpire had a \nmask. The catcher got hit in the eye. He sued the umpire because the \numpire had not given him his mask. The catcher walked away with a \n$24,000 settlement.\n  We are asking people to volunteer. I think the President is doing the \nright thing. There is absolutely no question in my mind that he is \ncalling America to greatness, a greatness that reflects the character \nof the fact that we care for each other. That is what America is all \nabout. It is what sent de Tocqueville back to France, 150 years ago, \nexclaiming about the virtue of America. He said it was not to be found \nin the corridors of the bureaucracy or the Halls of the Congress. He \nsaid it was to be found in the people. He said America is great because \nAmerica is good.\n  We want the goodness of America to be reflected again in this \ncountry. We want the capacity of people to identify with each other, to \nlove each other--literally love each other enough to say I am not just \ncontent to work with my own kids, I am going to work with the kids in \nthe neighborhood and some kids who are not as fortunate as mine. Maybe \nthey are kids who have lost their mom or dad, for one reason or \nanother. That kind of tragedy has touched my family and it has touched \nmost of the people in this country, and we want the loving character of \nAmerican citizens to be available and we do not want it to be \ninhibited. We do not want it to be so you cannot volunteer.\n\n  I think about those women in Evanston, IL, who wanted to set up the \nhome for battered women. They could not get insurance because of the \nlitigation potential. All the insurance companies said you have to \noperate for 3 years without insurance before we can determine whether \nor not we will insure you. So nobody could risk their own family in \norder to help other people. They did not want their own homes to be \ntaken in order to provide a home for someone else. So we end up not \nhaving that extension of compassion in our culture.\n  I do not think there is any President who has more successfully said \nto the\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\npeople in this country, ``I feel your pain.'' He says it with \nsincerity, and I believe he does. He has a great capacity to empathize. \nAnd he has called this country to feel it, to feel the opportunity and \nrespond to the opportunity to help one another. And we have a great \nopportunity to say we are going to take a big roadblock out of the way.\n  I started out by referring to this article, ``A Thousand Points of \nFright?'', saying the most difficult to help are the riskiest to help. \nAnd they need help badly. We have this barrier standing in the way. We \nhave gone through examples. I guess we could tell stories about these \nlawsuits until the cows came home--at least that's a phrase my aunt \nused to use--but the truth of the matter is, this is important. It was \nimportant enough for the four previous Presidents of the United States \nto join the current President of the United States and one of the \ngreatest military heroes of our age, to join the whole effort and to \ngalvanize public opinion to try to say we need volunteers.\n  It is a little bit confounding, to think there are those in this body \nwho want to stop us from considering--who do not even want us to have a \nchance to debate and vote on an issue like giving volunteers this kind \nof break.\n  I do not know how anybody could say we want to make sure that a \nperson who volunteers has the potential to be sued and harassed. I \nnotice that a former Attorney General of the United States, Dick \nThornburgh, wrote an opinion piece for one of our major newspapers. He \nsaid: ``If you are sued, the average cost to defend yourself--'' in a \ncase not involving a car, car cases cost a lot of money, usually--``is \n$7,500.'' There isn't anybody who can afford that and that is the \naverage cost. That includes the cases that are dismissed.\n  I think it is time for us to say we want more volunteers, we want to \ncooperate with the President, we want America to be what America has \nthe character to be. It is time for us to respond to the people. We \nneed to respond to the people by inviting them to have the kind of \ncaring compassion reflected in voluntarism. It is the least we can do \nto pull the roadblocks out of their way and make a clear path for \nAmericans to care for each other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I appreciate very much the remarks by \nthe Senator from Missouri. As usual they are most eloquent and \ninspirational and on target. I appreciate very much his coming to the \nfloor and sharing his views on S. 543, of which he is a principal \ncosponsor.\n  Madam President, I return to the point I was making a moment ago \nabout what the Nation was being implored to do by General Powell and \nthe President. Most of these initial quotes are from General Powell. He \npoints out that President Clinton appointed General Powell as general \nchairman of the President's Summit for America's Future and the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pledged to ensure that ``promises \nmade during the celebrity-packed event are fulfilled long after the \nhoopla is over.''\n  Madam President, the hoopla is over. It is time, frankly, for all of \nthese officials to send a message here, I think, that we need to take \nthis affirmative step. It is a perfect affirmative step for us to take, \nfollowing the glorious visuals, and get down to the real grassroots \npracticals, which are the protection, as framed in S. 543, of \nvolunteers, so that they are able to respond to the hoopla. Down in my \npart of the country, they say this is now where ``the rubber hits the \nroad.'' It is no longer the glory of the balloons and television. We \nare talking about the real, practical efforts that have to take place \non the ground to make it possible for volunteers to renew America's \nvolunteer spirit.\n\n       The President went on to say to General Powell: ``This may \n     be your most important mission and I thank you for \n     reenlisting.'' The few thousand delegates from across the \n     Nation who were seated on the lawn outside the historic \n     structure, rose to their feet in applause.\n\n  It is obvious that the inspirational moment was infectious. How often \nhave we witnessed a gathering like this, raising the expectations, \nlifting the heart, bringing a nation to its feet--an exhilarating \nmoment, only to find 3 months later or 6 months later that the issue \ndisappeared with the last hand clap, that all the expectations that \nwere being sought were forgotten after everybody got back on the plane, \ngot back home. We do not want that to be the legacy of this summit. \nCongress ought to step forward, not only on the proposal that I and \nothers have offered here, which alleviates, and creates a shield, \nprotects the volunteers, makes it possible for them to answer this call \nand to be a piece of this applause, to be an extension of this \napplause.\n  There are many things we ought to do to expand voluntarism in \nAmerica, and make it easier and more readily doable. But an absolute \nmust, as a beginning, Madam President, is that we remove the chill and \nlegal intimidation that has caused a dramatic drop in the number of \nAmericans who will answer the call, that have left doubt in volunteers \nabout what they do. Even if they answer the call, the way they respond \nto their activity is changed and altered by this legal chill that hangs \nover voluntarism in America.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       By encouraging volunteering, the President is trying to \n     promote positive change in American society at a time when \n     the Congress and bipartisan emphasis on balancing the Federal \n     budget make it politically difficult, if not impossible, to \n     create new Government programs to address the country's \n     pressing social problems.\n\n  This is an appropriate response. This is exactly correct. America's \nfinancial predicament does not allow us to do some of the things we \nhave done in the past, and America must call on its citizens to help \nfill the gaps.\n  This is not a new experience for America. America was founded in \ntimes of austere circumstances for most Americans, and it was in that \nera that the concept of American voluntarism was born. So we are not \ncreating a new phenomenon here; we are simply returning to our roots.\n  Everybody remembers--we have either seen it or read about it--the \nvolunteer coming to the aid of a family that was damaged by some \naccident or problem in the rural area of our country--the barn \nbuilding, the coming together in any kind of need to help families, \ncommunity members. As I said earlier, this is as much a part of \nAmerica's treasure as its Capitol, as its monuments, as its parks. \nVoluntarism is a unique feature of American life, and it ought to be \nnurtured and protected, just as we do the other American treasures, \nlike the way we care for this Capitol. This is the Capitol of the \nUnited States, the capital of the free world, and it is an expression \nof who we are as a people, and we care for it. We should be every bit \nas attentive to our concern about the treasure that voluntarism makes \nfor America.\n  There is no way to ever calculate the value of what American \nvoluntarism has meant to our country in any given year. It is billions \nupon billions of dollars that are freely given and invested to help the \ncountry be a better place. But I think the connection that the \nPresident makes between the need for voluntarism and the financial \npredicament the country faces is correct.\n  This is a difficult time. This is a time of shrinking resources. Our \ngeneration of Americans has to confront decisions that were made over \nthe last three decades that have left our generation to deal with over \n$5 trillion worth of debt and to deal with promises that, unmanaged, \nwill consume 100 percent of the U.S. Treasury within 8 years.\n  Let me repeat that. Our basic entitlement programs already consume \nover 50 percent of the U.S. Treasury, which is a dramatic increase from \nwhen I arrived just 4 years ago. It is spiraling upward. So it is \nabsolutely correct for the President to make a linkage between the \nfinancial condition of the country and the need to reach out and get \nAmericans to do things on their own accord that the Government can no \nlonger do--maybe one can argue never should have done in the first \nplace. I am sure part of the reason voluntarism has been weakened is \nbecause there has been a message that has been reverberating around the \ncountry for about 25 years that the final resolution of all of our \ncommunity ills ought to be the Government. I think we are learning that \nthat is not, and has never been, the case.\n  The final resolution of many of our ills rests with the people \nthemselves. A key component of that is the American spirit and the \nAmerican willingness to volunteer.\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n  The President goes on and says:\n\n       The era of big Government may be over, but the era of big \n     challenges for our country is not.\n\n  I think every American would agree with that.\n  ``So we need an era of big citizenship,'' the President said in \nPhiladelphia. ``We need an era of big citizenship.''\n  I certainly agree with that, and I think every Member of Congress \nwould agree with that. But while the Government may not be able to do \nsome of the things it used to do, the Government certainly should not \nbe an impediment to big citizenship. The Government ought not to be \nthrottling attempts to make it easier to be a forthcoming citizen.\n  Frankly, I don't think the Government should be engaged in a \nfilibuster that prevents our moving legislation that would make it \ndramatically and clearly easier to be a part of the era of big \ncitizenship.\n  General Powell, who has experience orchestrating successful \noperations, has made it his own personal crusade to recruit an army of \nmillions of volunteers around the country. He has committed himself to \nbeing able to certify by the year 2000 that the 2 million children \nlacking mentoring, safe places to play and learn, health care, \nmarketable skills, and a good education will have those needs met.\n  Once again, he alludes to the point that I have mentioned several \ntimes this afternoon. Safe places to play begs the question that many \nof them do not have safe places to play today. They are dangerous \nplaces, and being dangerous, they are more likely to be places in which \naccidents and mistakes and misunderstandings occur. In other words, \nthis is not your normal playground. This may be a rough-edge community \nwhich you are asking the volunteer to enter, to subject themselves.\n  A more dangerous place means it is fraught with the potential of \nlegal action. So we are asking these millions of volunteers not only to \ncome forward, but to come forward into environments that are less \npredictable and, therefore, create a greater risk for the volunteer.\n  I mentioned earlier today, Madam President, that the need for this \nlegislation is fairly new; that we did not have a problem of volunteers \nbeing sued until we got into the eighties. Suddenly they became \ntargets, and once you get something like that started, it feeds on \nitself, and it has. So the lawsuits have grown, and the threat has \ngrown.\n  Now we are saying, in this environment where litigation is more \nprevalent, on top of that, we want you to go into a more difficult \nenvironment. Well, there is an incongruity here. As a result of this \nexchange, one of my first acts will be to communicate to General Powell \nthat we need his help to convince this Congress that they need to \nremove barriers so that he can get his 2 million volunteers to come \nforward.\n  Madam President, the hour is now 20 till 4. We have now been on this \nsince 2 o'clock last Monday, this 12-page bill, double spaced, and we \ncontinue to be prohibited from actually going to the debate. We will \nrevisit this, but for the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HERMAN, OF ALABAMA, TO BE SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \ngo into executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 70, the \nnomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor. I further ask \nthat there be 30 minutes of debate on the nomination to be equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking minority manager; I further \nask unanimous consent that immediately following the expiration or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination, and immediately following the vote the \nPresident be notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then \nreturn to legislative session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I only \ndo so to commend the distinguished majority leader for his work in \nbringing us to this point. This has been the subject of extraordinary \ndiscussion and negotiation. It would not have been possible were it not \nfor his cooperation and the work by several Senators, including the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor Committee and the ranking member, \nwho are on the floor at this time. I thank the majority leader for his \neffort, and I appreciate very much the work to bring us to this point.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Chair rules on the unanimous \nconsent request, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my request for a unanimous-consent \nagreement that we proceed to Calendar No. 70, the nomination of Alexis \nHerman to be Secretary of Labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to thank the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for his comments. He knows quite well that there had \nbeen concerns, initially, about this nominee. I have been satisfied \nthat she is qualified for the job. But I didn't know all the details of \nallegations or problems that had been identified. The committee, under \nthe leadership of the chairman, took their time, they looked into the \npotential problems and allegations, and they finally took a vote. I \nbelieve it was a unanimous voice vote. Members of the committee had \nadequate time to look into these potential problems. I think the \nnominee has assured Senators that her conduct is going to be very \ncircumspect as Secretary of Labor. I am satisfied that she will do that \nand that she will work with the Congress and the Senate, on both sides \nof the aisle, and will do a good job as Secretary of Labor.\n  Now, the second problem, of course, has been the idea that there \nwould be an Executive order with regard to Federal union contracting. \nThere has been a considerable amount of concern, as the Senator knows, \nabout this being done through Executive order. We feel that should be \ndone by the Congress with recommendations and time for consideration. \nBut we have worked out an understanding with the administration of how \nthis matter will be handled. Based on their assurances, which we feel \nthey will honor, we felt it was appropriate to proceed with this \nnominee.\n\n  I want to say, again, that the nominee was not the problem over the \nlast few weeks. The problem was an understanding about how labor law \nshould be changed. I think we have reached a point where we can enter \ninto this agreement. I thank the assistant majority leader, Don \nNickles, for his effort. He is knowledgeable in this area. He has been \naggressive in trying to identify the problem and trying to find a \nsolution. I did have a chance to discuss this last night with the \nPresident. He has had an opportunity to discuss it with representatives \nfrom the White House, and I feel that an amicable arrangement has been \nreached.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nexplanation and for his description of the current set of \ncircumstances. We have known now for some time that the delay in \nconfirming Ms. Herman had little to do with her qualifications or the \ndegree to which there was support on the Senate floor. It had to do \nwith the dispute over Federal contracting.\n  I am pleased that the dispute has ended and that we find some \napplicable resolution to that issue. I have not seen the details of \nthat particular agreement, but I am very pleased that, at long last, \nMs. Herman will have the\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\nopportunity to serve in her new capacity as Secretary of Labor. We look \nforward to working with her, and it is my expectation that there will \nbe an overwhelming vote this afternoon on her behalf.\n  We look forward to beginning as early as next week to see her in \noffice and working closely with us on an array of very important \nmatters to be taken up in the next 2 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The nomination will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Alexis M. Herman, of \nAlabama, to be Secretary of Labor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today before the Senate to \nrecommend that we approve the nomination of Ms. Alexis M. Herman to \nserve as Secretary of Labor.\n  Ms. Herman's career has been filled with many firsts. In 1977, Ms. \nHerman was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be the first African-\nAmerican woman to lead the Women's Bureau. Twenty years later, Ms. \nHerman is poised to become the first African-American woman to serve as \nSecretary of Labor.\n  To be appointed and confirmed as the Secretary of Labor is one of the \ngreatest honors that our Nation can bestow upon an individual. It is an \nhonor, however, that comes with a heavy burden of responsibility. \nIndividuals who hold this office become stewards of the public trust \nand bear a great responsibility to the working men and women of \nAmerica. It is my hope and my sincere expectation that Alexis Herman \nwill preserve this trust and serve our country ably and effectively as \nSecretary of Labor.\n  Ms. Herman will take the helm of the Department of Labor at a \ncritical juncture in its history. The passage of welfare reform has \nmade the strengthening of our job-training programs more important than \never. People must be able to obtain skills that will lead to secure \njobs. Workers are entitled to fair pay in a safe environment. And while \na great deal of attention is being focused on the future of the Social \nSecurity system, it is incumbent upon us to ensure the stability and \nexpand the reach of the private pension system as well. I have devoted \nmy career to these issues and I look forward to working with Ms. Herman \nto strengthen the Department of Labor's education and training programs \nand improve the quality of life of working men and women.\n  It is because of my belief in and support for the mission of the \nDepartment that I have done my best to thoroughly review the background \nof this nominee. The pace may have seemed slow to some people but I was \nconvinced then, as I am now, that it is better to take the time to do \nthis job properly.\n  Our efforts were complicated by ongoing revelations of White House \nfundraising activities and by the announcement that the Office of \nPublic Liaison, which the nominee was heading, was, and continues to \nbe, the subject of an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel. \nBut our efforts are now complete and the committee recommends that the \nSenate confirm Ms. Herman as Secretary of Labor.\n\n  Ms. Herman brings a unique set of skills and experience to the \nposition of Secretary of Labor. In the mid-1970's she administered a \npioneering program in Atlanta that helped minority women obtain white \ncollar jobs. From 1977 until 1981, she served as the Director of the \nWomen's Bureau under President Jimmy Carter. In this capacity she led \nthe Department of Labor's efforts to identify and address the needs of \nworking women across the country.\n  Over the years, Ms. Herman has earned a reputation for her ability to \nbuild coalitions and work effectively with groups holding disparate and \ndivergent political views. It is my hope that these skills will be used \nto seriously address our Nation's workplace and work force development \nneeds as we prepare for the 21st century.\n  We have an ambitious legislative agenda for this year--already the \ncommittee has reported S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, and S. \n295, the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1997. These bills \nrepresent critical responses to the vast changes in the American \nworkplace--changes that are unrecognized in a body of labor law \nunchanged since the Great Depression. Employers and employees should be \nworking with, not against, each other whether it's figuring out a \nproblem on the shop floor or in an employee's schedule.\n  Over the next few months we will develop legislation to better \nintegrate education and job training programs and we will begin to \nexplore ways to improve the security and soundness of the private \npension system. These legislative initiatives will have profound \nimplications for the economic competitiveness of our Nation and for the \nquality of life of American workers. We will only succeed in these \nefforts if we have leadership from the Secretary and a firm commitment \nto avoid partisan politics in the interest of addressing critical \nnational needs.\n  I believe that Ms. Herman will be a full partner in these endeavors \nand that she will join us in our effort to improve the quality of life \nof working men and women. I look forward to working with her in her new \ncapacity as Secretary of Labor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have 15 minutes. \nAm I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to extend our appreciation to the \nmajority and minority leaders for working out this agreement where \nwithin the hour the Senate will go on record by an overwhelming vote in \nbehalf of an outstanding nominee for Secretary of Labor. I am grateful \nto them for working out this agreement.\n  I thank especially the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, \nfor the way that he has handled this nomination. Nominations come and \nnominations go. But the fairness and thoroughness with which he handled \nthis nominee I think reflects extremely well, not only on our committee \nbut on the institution as a whole. It was exhaustive. It was extensive. \nIt was probing. It was searching, as any review should be. And at the \nend of the day we were able to see the result of this very thorough \nreview in the unanimous vote by the committee. That is the way that it \nshould be done.\n  All of us in this body, and I think all Americans, will be grateful \nfor the fact that we will have a Secretary of Labor who will be at the \nPresident's elbow and will speak for working men and women in this \ncountry. But at this time, all of us in the Senate should know the \noutstanding job that she has done.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that we have freed ourselves from the \nposition that was taken by some Members here on the floor who differed \nwith the President's authority to issue an executive order encouraging \nthe use of project labor agreements on Federal construction sites.\n  I think, if we look back over the history of project labor \nagreements, we would see that they have been effective, they have \nworked, and they have saved resources. These are voluntary agreements. \nThe Supreme Court has upheld their use on public sector construction \nsites. Clearly the President is justified in urging the use of those \nkinds of agreements when they are appropriate.\n  This morning in the Labor Committee, we heard the outstanding \ntestimony of John Dunlop, who is the former Secretary of Labor, under a \nRepublican administration, who, as the architect of many project labor \nagreements, reviewed in some detail just how they work, how they \nfunction, and the reasons for them. He made a very powerful and \nconvincing case for project labor agreements. But now we have worked \nout a satisfactory way in which the President will issue a memorandum \non that issue which will encourage these project labor agreements to go \nforward where they are appropriate. And now we are moving ahead with \nthe nominee.\n  So I would also like to commend Senator Jeffords for outlining the \nchallenges that are going to be there for the Secretary. When I arrived \nin the Senate, men and women were working\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\ndown at the Fall River Shipyard, building ships in Quincy, MA. They \nworked there with a high school diploma. They had a good job, and a \ngood income. Their father generally had worked at the Fall River \nShipyard, and even their grandfathers worked there and built some of \nthe best ships we had in World War II, and many outstanding commercial \nships as well. It is an entirely different labor market today. Everyone \nwho enters it will have seven different jobs over the period of their \nlifetime at least.\n  The importance of having a well-trained and skilled work force is an \nenormous challenge for our country. We are looking forward to working \nwith the members of our committee to try to play our role in making \nsure that we are going to see that those kinds of opportunities are \ngoing to be available to workers in the future.\n\n  I would like to take, Mr. President, the remaining moments here today \njust to speak about this really extraordinary nominee.\n  I see my colleague and friend, the good Senator from Illinois, has \njoined us, who has been such a strong supporter of the nominee, and \nwill speak. My friend, Senator Wellstone, will speak as well.\n  If we are looking at a success story, we are looking at the life of \nAlexis Herman. If we are looking for personal resolution, \ndetermination, and personal moral courage and physical courage, we are \nlooking at the history of Alexis Herman who, with her mother--who \ntaught her to read at a very early age, in Mobile, AL--traveled as her \nmother was involved in one of the early literacy programs. She attended \na Catholic school in Mobile, AL, that was segregated, and brought the \ntruth to power when she challenged that school to integrate. The school \nresisted those entreaties. And, finally, a year later they admitted \nblacks into that school as a result of the determination and \nperserverance of this extraordinary young woman. She traveled and \nworked to try to bring African-American women into the work force in \nmany of the institutions and companies of this country with great, \ngreat success.\n  Her life has been one of service. She has been an outstanding \nassistant to the President of the United States with outreach programs, \ntrying to work to make sure that the message that was going to be \ncoming from the White House was going to be an all-inclusive message, \nand one that was going to move the country along together and not at \nthe expense of any individuals or any groups.\n  She served with great distinction under Ray Marshall, who was \nSecretary of Labor under President Carter. And Ray Marshall is one of \nthe country's most thoughtful leaders on all of the issues affecting \nthe training of workers and upgrading their skills. And his support--\nhis clear, eloquent comments about the work that Alexis Herman did when \nshe worked with Ray Marshall constitute one of the most outstanding \ntributes that I have ever heard about any worker in any Cabinet \nposition.\n  So the President of the United States has nominated her to be the \nSecretary of Labor. We will, I think, have an extraordinary person, one \nwho can bring innovation and creativity, one who can reach out to \nworking families; one who has special insights into the challenges that \nare out there for workers in a changing world.\n  Alexis Herman exemplifies many of our most important national values. \nShe leads by example, and has a distinguished history of bringing \nothers along. She grew up poor in the segregated South, and she \nsucceeded through talent, energy, and commitment. She has had a \nlifelong commitment to the principle of helping others to help \nthemselves.\n  As I mentioned, her mother, who once was Alabama's Teacher of the \nYear, brought Alexis with her as she taught reading to children and \nadults. Alexis' first summer job was teaching reading at an inner-city \nhousing project.\n  After graduating from Xavier University in New Orleans, she returned \nto Mobile as a social worker. She counseled delinquent youths, helped \nplace children in foster homes, and worked to assist families in \ndealing with issues such as teenage pregnancy.\n  She saw that lack of skills and opportunities were keeping many of \nMobile's black citizens from achieving their full potential.\n  Alexis then spent several years running a pilot program in Atlanta to \nplace African-American women in white collar positions. Included in the \nhundreds of letters the committee received in support of Ms. Herman's \nnomination were a number of letters from African-American female \nexecutives who credited Alexis with starting them on their careers. One \nwoman who is now a vice president at the American Cancer Society wrote \nthat she recalled that Alexis ``advised the wisdom of getting my foot \nin the door first and foremost. From there, she said the rest would be \nup to me.''\n  Another letter noted that the pilot project Alexis ran placed more \nAfrican-American women in management positions in Atlanta during its \nfirst year in operation than the U.S. Employment Service had placed in \nits entire history in the city.\n\n  As I mentioned, in 1977, when Ray Marshall became Secretary of Labor \nin President Carter's administration, he asked her to become head of \nthe Department's Women's Bureau--the youngest Director ever. She worked \non expanding opportunities for women in skilled trades, helped \ndisplaced homemakers obtain the tools necessary to succeed in the \nworkplace, and co-chaired a Presidential task force to promote business \nownership by women.\n  When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named Alexis Herman to \na senior White House position as Assistant to the President and \nDirector of the Office of Public Liaison. In this capacity, she \nidentified the concerns of individuals and families across the country \non the issues, and communicated the President's priorities to them.\n  In the many weeks since her nomination to be Secretary of Labor was \nannounced last December, attempts have been made to generate \ncontroversy about various aspects of her career. However, Ms. Herman \nhas responded to all the inquiries fully and completely. She received \nthe unanimous support of the Labor Committee, and I anticipate that she \nwill receive broad bipartisan support by the full Senate.\n  All her life, as a young student, as a career woman, as a community \nleader and in public service, Alexis Herman has advanced America's \nideals. Hard work, dedication to excellence and commitment to \nleadership are the hallmarks of her character. Her entire career is a \nprofile in courage.\n  She knows from her own life and firsthand experience the very real \nobstacles that too many Americans still face in trying to achieve the \nAmerican dream. Most important, she is dedicated to the cause of \nimproving the lives of all working families. She'll do an outstanding \njob as Secretary of Labor, and I look forward to working closely with \nher in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, and the \nremaining time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, very much, and the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for their efforts in bringing this \nnomination to the floor.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor and asked that Alexis Herman be freed \nand that the Department of Labor be liberated so that they could get on \nwith the business of the American people, the American working people. \nAnd that is what has happened here.\n  So we are rejoicing this afternoon that, indeed, this nomination has \nreached consensus. There has been closure and agreement by leadership \nand by the Members of this Senate to have a vote on Alexis Herman's \nconfirmation.\n  I am so very pleased and grateful to the leadership, and, again, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords for making it so.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the confirmation of Alexis Herman \nas Secretary of Labor. She has been a friend of mine and I know that \nshe will be an outstanding Secretary of Labor. Her\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\ncommitment to improving the condition of America's working people is \nsecond to none.\n  Over the past 4 years, we have witnessed major improvements in our \neconomy. Now we must continue the work to make our economy and our work \nforce better than we have ever known. We need someone to help lead us \nin that direction. I cannot think of a person who is more skilled and \nmore knowledgeable and who is better suited for that task than Alexis \nHerman.\n  Alexis Herman has long dedicated her efforts to putting all Americans \nto work. Early in her career, Alexis Herman implemented a program that \nprovided targeted training to potential employees. This program helped \nto ensure that potential employees possessed the skills required to \nmeet employer's needs. Through the work of Alexis Herman, companies \nacross America had access to employees who had specialized skills, and \nworkers had access to jobs because they were trained for jobs that \nactually existed.\n  Alexis Herman continued her efforts to expand workplace opportunities \nas head of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor under \nPresident Carter. At the Women's Bureau, she not only expanded job \nopportunities by training women for the work force, including training \nin nontraditional jobs, but also expanded job opportunities by training \nwomen to become business owners with a work force of their own.\n  During her tenure at the Women's Bureau Alexis Herman focused her \nefforts on moving women from welfare to work. Especially important and \nrelevant in light of last year's welfare bill is Alexis Herman's \nexperience and skills in the area of creating job training and \nplacement opportunities for welfare recipients and low-skill workers. \nIf we are going to put over a million people to work in the coming \nyears, we are going to need Alexis Herman's practical experience.\n  Alexis Herman's commitment to diversity will make a difference in the \nsteps our Nation takes to enhance our work force. Any time we retreat \nfrom providing equal opportunities to all of our citizens, we risk \nweakening our greatest asset: our workers. With her vast experience in \nincreasing diversity in the workplace, Alexis Herman will ensure that \nno talent goes untapped.\n  Alexis Herman knows the value of diversity. As public liaison for \nPresident Clinton, Ms. Herman worked with Americans across the \ncountry--Americans with diverse backgrounds and concerns.\n  During Ms. Herman's testimony before the Labor Committee, she stated \nthat she had five goals for the Labor Department in the next 4 years: \nlifelong learning and skills development; welfare to work; retirement \nsecurity; safe and equal opportunity workplaces; and balancing work and \nfamily. These goals reflect her life's work to date. These goals also \ndescribe a course for the future that we can all support. These goals \nreflect America's agenda.\n  Training our work force for the 21st century, providing for a secure \nretirement for the Nation's expanding elderly population, and \nrecognizing the importance of family for America's work force are \nclearly national priorities. Alexis Herman understands that to reach \nthese goals we must work together.\n  One of her greatest strengths is that she has formed partnerships \nwith both business and labor in her many years working on employment \nissues. She understands the kind of investment that business must make \nin human capital in order to improve productivity, increase profits, \nand to create jobs. She understands how difficult it is for small \nbusinesses to start up and how important those businesses are to our \neconomy as a whole. She understands that people want to work but that \nthey need the opportunity to be trained so that they can become \nproductive members of the work force. And, finally, Alexis Herman \nunderstands that we are all in this together.\n  Former Secretary Reich was an advocate for working people, an asset \nto the business community and a tireless servant for America's \nfamilies. He has my deepest thanks and my highest admiration for the \nwork he did as Secretary of Labor. But I know that Alexis Herman is \ncapable and up to the task in front of her, that even though she has \nbig shoes to fill, I know she is more than capable of meeting the \nchallenge and finishing the task. There can be no better candidate for \nSecretary of Labor than Alexis Herman. Her confirmation, as Senator \nKennedy pointed out, will, indeed, make history. As Secretary of Labor \nshe will make a difference, however, in the lives of millions of \nAmericans and workers throughout the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Alexis Herman as the next Secretary \nof Labor.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the able majority \nwhip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Vermont for \nhis leadership and also for having the hearing today that discussed \nproject labor agreements.\n  I told my friend from Massachusetts that I did not have a problem \nwith Alexis Herman being Secretary of Labor as much as I had a real \nproblem with what I perceive to be legislation by Executive order.\n  There was proposed to be an Executive order dealing with project \nlabor agreements that, as it was read by me and many other people, \nbasically would have excluded nonunion companies from bidding on over \n$200 million of work per year. I think that requires legislation, and \nif Congress wants to legislate that, certainly Congress has the right \nto legislate that. I told the White House my hope and desire would be \nthat if they want to legislate, to find someone to introduce that \nlegislation, we would take it up in the legislative process.\n  So I have had for the past few weeks objected to considering this \nnomination, trying to get the White House to back off from that order. \nI might inform our colleagues--somebody said, well, what caused this \nchange of events? The White House has now agreed not to issue the \nExecutive order, and I appreciate that. They have said that they were \ngoing to issue a memorandum from the President to the executive \nagencies, and that is certainly within their right. The memorandum does \nnot have the force and effect of law.\n  My purpose was to make sure that the administration did not try to \nlegislate by Executive order. We now have a letter from Erskine Bowles \nthat I will just read.\n\n       This is to confirm the administration's intention to issue \n     a Presidential memorandum encouraging executive departments \n     and agencies to consider utilizing project labor agreements \n     in Federal Government construction projects. The President \n     believes that such agreements are desirable in circumstances \n     where they promote efficient and high quality contract \n     performance and labor/management stability.\n\n  It is also our understanding, as I say, very frankly, they are not \ngoing to do it by Executive order. So that is the reason why I am \nwithdrawing my objection and have no objection to the Senate voting on \nthe nomination of Alexis Herman to be the next Labor Secretary.\n  So I appreciate the cooperation of the White House and think this is \nthe proper way to proceed. If they wish to legislate on project labor \nagreements, certainly they have the right to introduce that legislation \nand we will consider it in due process.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I inquire as to the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6\\1/2\\ minutes on the Republican \nside and 3\\1/2\\ on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Vermont for \nyielding me time. I have sought recognition to support the nomination \nof Ms. Alexis M. Herman for Secretary of Labor, and I am glad to see we \nare finally moving to the confirmation process here because we need a \nSecretary of Labor in place to move ahead on the budget process and the \nappropriations process.\n  I serve as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has \njurisdiction over the Department of Labor. It has an $11 billion \nbudget, and obviously\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\nwe have not been able to hear from the Secretary of Labor so far \nbecause we have not had a Secretary of Labor.\n  When Ms. Herman's status was held up early on, I met with her and had \na long talk with her back in early February. I found that she had a \ngood academic background and had a good work record. Some questions had \nbeen raised on a number of items, but it was my sense at that time that \nshe was entitled to a hearing by the Labor Committee.\n  I am delighted that Senator Jeffords and the committee have held that \nhearing and have reported her nomination out favorably so that we are \nnow in a position to move ahead and to confirm her today. It is my \nsense that she will receive an overwhelming vote of support, perhaps \neven a unanimous vote. That remains to be seen.\n  Apparently she will not receive a unanimous vote, from a signal from \nthe Presiding Officer, and that is within the discretion of every \nSenator, to vote as he or she sees fit. I do express a concern about \nthe nexus or the linkage of Ms. Herman to the Executive order and to \nother collateral matters. I have been around here long enough to \nunderstand that that is not an unusual proceeding, but it is my hope \nthat we can decide these matters on the merits one by one. But whatever \none's position might be in that connection, we at least are reaching \nthe point where we will have a vote at 5 o'clock today on Alexis Herman \nto see whether or not, up or down, she is qualified, in the view of the \nSenate, to be the next Secretary of Labor.\n  I might say that there is considerable concern about the treatment of \nMs. Herman in my home State of Pennsylvania. We had a remarkable event \nover last Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, April 27, 28, and 29, in \nPhiladelphia on the volunteer summit. We had four Presidents--quite an \nimpressive showing. Somebody in the holding room said, ``Mr. \nPresident'' and everyone turned his head. Some who were not present \nturned their head, including Vice President Gore and maybe some others.\n  But there was another summit, a citizen summit some blocks away in a \nsquare in Philadelphia--Philadelphia is famous for its squares--and a \nnumber of people who appeared at the Presidents' volunteer summit also \nappeared at the citizen summit. Mayor Rendell, who presided over the \nsummit for Philadelphia and did an excellent job, appeared in both \nplaces as did Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman Fattah, and I as well. \nWhen I was at the citizen summit there was a lot of concern as to what \nwas going to happen to Ms. Alexis Herman in the line of fair play, \nwhether she was going to be treated fairly and appropriately.\n\n  So I am glad to see our process has worked. I think Ms. Herman is \nqualified to be Secretary of Labor based on her academic record, her \nwork experience, her general demeanor and general qualifications, and \nthe appropriate committee has taken up the issues which were raised as \nquestion marks and has answered them to the satisfaction of the \ncommittee. I look forward to voting for her and look forward to her \nconfirmation, even if it is not unanimous, but I make this prediction, \nthat it will probably be in the 90's.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, whatever interpretation Senators want to make about \nproject labor agreements--I am not here to debate that now--I think \nthat really what we ought to focus on is the vote we are about to take. \nAnd whatever interpretation Senators want to make about how we reached \nagreement, I am not here to debate that.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their fine \nleadership. I do know this. Senator Specter I think was quite correct \nin his remarks. I think there has been concern around the country about \nthe treatment of Alexis Herman, making sure there was fair treatment. \nClearly we are going to have a vote, and I think it is going to be an \noverwhelmingly positive vote. Above and beyond Ms. Herman, I think the \nissue is this position. It has been 6 long months. The Secretary of \nLabor position is so important to the lives of so many families all \nacross the Nation--Minnesota, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Vermont, \nand beyond. Bob Reich was a great Secretary of Labor--a great Secretary \nof Labor--and I think the reason he became beloved to so many people in \nthe country was that he was such a forceable and outspoken advocate and \nhe was talking about living standards for people, about educational \nopportunities, about job training, about jobs at decent wages, and \nabout parents being able to support their children. The Secretary of \nLabor is the most important position we have in the Cabinet when it \ncomes to these critical issues, these bread and butter economic issues, \nwhether or not we fulfill our national vow of equality of opportunity, \nwhich is all about decent jobs and decent educational opportunities.\n  I hope that there will be an overwhelming--and I think there will \nbe--vote in support of Alexis Herman. I think, as Senator Kennedy said, \nher own journey is inspiring. I think in many ways for an eloquent \nAfrican-American woman to be Secretary of Labor, with all of the skill \nshe brings to this position and with all the leadership that she can \nprovide on behalf of working families, it is an inspiring story. I \nthink this is an enormous victory not just for one person and not just \nfor people in the African-American community, but really for the \ncountry. So I hope we will have a very strong vote for her.\n  I thank the chair of our committee, Senator Jeffords, and I thank \nSenator Kennedy and thank in advance all the Senators who I think will \nvote for her.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am glad we are finally going to \nconsider President Clinton's nominee for Secretary of Labor, Alexis \nHerman. She deserves a swift confirmation by the United States Senate.\n  Ms. Herman's contributions during her career in public service and in \nthe private sector are truly impressive and make her uniquely qualified \nto serve as Secretary of Labor.\n  Ms. Herman's commitment to bettering the working and living \nconditions of her fellow Americans began early in her life, with the \nsupport and encouragement of her family. Born in segregated Mobile, \nAlabama, Ms. Herman grew up in a family dedicated to the struggle for \ncivil rights. Her father, a mortician, sued the Democratic Party to \nmake it more inclusive and became one of Alabama's first black party \nofficials.\n  After graduating from Louisiana's Xavier University, Herman went back \nhome to Mobile to help desegregate her Catholic high school. She also \nworked in Pascagoula, MS, the hometown of Senator Lott, helping \nunskilled workers get jobs in the shipyards.\n  Ms. Herman came to Washington in 1977 to work in the Labor Department \nwith Secretary Ray Marshall, where she headed the women's bureau. After \nworking for Secretary Marshall, Ms. Herman entered the private sector, \nforming her own consulting firm to advise businesses on marketing and \nminority hiring.\n  In 1988, Herman joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson's second presidential \ncampaign, where she met Ron Brown.\n  With Ron Brown, Ms. Herman worked on President Clinton's 1992 \ncampaign, and was chief executive officer of the Democrats' 1992 \nconvention in New York. After President Clinton was elected in 1992, \nshe became head of the White House public liaison office.\n  Alexis Herman combines graciousness with toughness in a way that \nallows her to bring diverse groups together and build consensus, \npromote understanding, and resolve conflicts. It is no surprise that, \nas they have gotten to know her, more and more individuals, and more \nand more organizations and institutions, have come to support her \nnomination. She has strong support from a broad political spectrum, \nincluding the business, labor, and civil rights communities, all of \nwhom she has served during her impressive career.\n  It is a testament to her success in building bridges between \ncommunities, helping working people, and remaining true to her \nprinciples that the people back home have not forgotten her. The \nAlabama Legislature passed a resolution urging her confirmation, and \nmany Alabamians came to Washington for her hearing.\n  Alexis Herman has demonstrated her abilities to serve as Labor \nSecretary\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\nover the course of her impressive career. I look forward to working \nwith her upon her confirmation, which, I trust, will be accomplished \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Is there any time remaining on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 52 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to use the last minute to \nthank a number of our staff. They have worked exceedingly hard during \nthe course of this nomination. We are enormously grateful to them: Mark \nChildress, Jeff Huang, Brian Lee, Susan Green, Stephanie Williams, and \nNick Littlefield. I know that Senator Jeffords will recognize his own \nstaff, but we want to thank as well Mark Powden very much, and Scott \nGiles. They worked very closely with Todd Stern at the White House, and \nall of them deserve great thanks. They were of enormous help and \nassistance not only to Alexis Herman but to all the members of the \ncommittee, and we are grateful as always for their skill and their \ncommitment to this institution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first of all want to thank the \nmajority leader and majority whip for the expeditious way they have \nhandled the resolution with respect to the Executive order. I know they \ndedicated the time necessary to make sure this got done as efficiently \nand as effectively as possible so we could move this nomination along.\n  I also want to thank the members of my committee, especially the \nSenator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for the way they controlled \nthemselves and were able to, after a rather extensive amount of time \nrequired to fully review the nominee's record, bring this nomination \nbefore the body today. And of course, as Senator Kennedy mentioned, I \ncannot tell anyone how hard the staff worked on this particular \nnomination, probably harder than any other nomination at least in my \nmemory, especially Ted Verheggen and Scott Giles of the majority as \nwell as the minority staff, especially Mark Childress, whom Senator \nKennedy mentioned. This took undue hours of committee staff time as \nwell as members to review all of the material that was available.\n  I am pleased now that we have brought this to a conclusion. I would \npoint out that the Labor Committee was unanimous in its vote with \nrespect to nominee, and I urge all Members to support a woman who I \nknow will bring real credit to the office of the Secretary of Labor.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time and ask for the \nyeas and nays on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Alexis M. Herman to be Secretary of Labor. \nOn this question the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] and \nthe Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork [Mr. Moynihan] would vote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted that this unconscionable \ndelay has ended and Alexis Herman has, at long last, been confirmed as \nSecretary of Labor. It was a mistake for the Republican leadership to \nhold her nomination hostage on a separate labor issue.\n  The compromise on that issue is entirely satisfactory. President \nClinton gave up nothing substantial. Project labor agreements will be \nconsidered and given important new emphasis by all Federal agencies on \nappropriate Federal construction projects.\n  I look forward to working closely with Secretary Herman on the wide \nrange of issues important to working families and communities across \nAmerica.\n  The big winners today are these working families. Alexis Herman will \ndo an excellent job speaking for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3836-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Saturday's Washington Post told the \nstory of a devastating, but avoidable, tragedy. It is the story of a \nlittle 5-year-old boy in Montgomery County, MD, who was locked in his \nbedroom for 22 hours a day, tied to his bed with a cat leash. This \nlittle boy's mouth was taped shut, his hands and his feet were bound \ntogether. Little Richard Holmes suffered the kind of abuse that no \nchild in this country, or anywhere, ought to suffer.\n  That there are 3 million reports of child abuse in America every year \nis a tragedy, but there is an even deeper tragedy in cases like that of \nRichard Holmes. It is the tragedy of a system that tries too hard to \nkeep some families together when they are families in name only.\n  According to the story in the Washington Post, Richard's grandmother \nand his aunt complained to Montgomery County child protection services \nthat Richard was being abused. They made this complaint last year, \ndescribing to county officials how Richard was returning home from \nvisits to his father famished and with bite marks--bite marks--on his \narms. Their complaints were ignored. In fact, they were accused of \nbeing troublemakers. Richard's father and his girlfriend are now\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nin prison on child abuse charges. This is not new territory for \nRichard's father, who was sentenced to 2 years probation back in 1992 \nafter his neglect of Richard came to the court's attention the first \ntime.\n\n  Mr. President, what on Earth was this little child, this little boy, \ndoing back in his father's custody? It is easy to fault the child \nprotection services to say that they should have done more, and they \nshould have. What I would like to stress today is that those of us in \nthe U.S. Senate should do more.\n  As I have discussed on this floor on numerous occasions, too often \nchild protective services feel themselves hemmed in by a \nmisinterpretation of a law that was passed by this Congress in 1980. \nUnder the Federal Child Welfare Act, for a State to be eligible for \nFederal matching funds for foster care expenditures, the State must \nhave a plan for the provision of child welfare services approved by the \nSecretary of HHS. The State plan must provide ``that in each case, \nreasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child \nin foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the \nchild from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to \nreturn to his home.''\n  In other words, no matter what the particular circumstances of a \nhousehold may be, the State must make reasonable efforts to keep that \nfamily together and to put it back together after it falls apart.\n  There is strong evidence to suggest that in practice, throughout the \n50 States, reasonable efforts have become extraordinary efforts, \nefforts to keep families together sometimes at all costs and sometimes \nto the detriment of these children.\n  I believe that the sad story of Richard Holmes is a very eloquent \ncase in point. So is the story of a little Ohio girl named Jenny Lynn. \nShe is only 3 years old, and she has already been in eight foster \nhomes. Let me repeat that, 3 years old and this poor child has already \nbeen in eight foster homes. One set of foster parents after another \nhave given her up because they are not likely to ever be awarded \npermanent custody, not likely ever to be able to adopt her. She now \nreacts with panic, understandably, whenever she sees trash bags. You \nsee, every time she is moved, her clothes, her possessions are moved in \ntrash bags. Now when she sees trash bags, she is afraid that she is \nbeing moved once again.\n  Why, Mr. President, is she being moved? Why is this little 3-year-old \nbeing moved time and time again? Because the county, Mr. President, is \nstill trying to reunify her family in this case, still trying to \nreunify her with her parents. The problem is, nobody knows where her \nparents are. Meanwhile, she will continue--I guess until they are \nfound--to be shuttled back and forth, back and forth, from foster home \nto foster home.\n  This child, this little 3-year-old, is being deprived of what all \nchildren deserve: Stability, love, loving parents, a home. She is being \ndeprived of her childhood.\n  Mr. President, you do not need to be an expert on child development \nto know that that kind of childhood will not help Jenny Lynn grow up to \nbe a happy adult. Frankly, the whole situation is absurd. And I believe \nwe need to do everything we can to make this kind of nightmare occur \nless frequently in this country.\n  Today, our friends in the House of Representatives passed \nlegislation--the Camp-Kennelly bill--that will help us avoid this kind \nof tragedy. Mr. President, the Senate should do likewise. I have been \nworking on similar legislation here in the Senate, legislation \nsponsored by Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, and other Members of \nthis body, legislation to make it plain that the health and safety of \nchildren is and ought to be the primary concern of child protective \nservices.\n  Mr. President, we are building a bipartisan consensus in support of \nthis idea. The case of Richard Holmes ought to remind us that there are \na lot of kids out there who need our help. We should not delay any \nlonger.\n  Again, Mr. President, the action of the House of Representatives \ntoday is great news. I look forward to moving our bill on the Senate \nfloor, the Chafee-Rockefeller bill, which among other provisions \ncontains this ``reasonable efforts'' language to clarify what we all \nreally know and what we all believe and what I am sure Congress meant \nin 1980, and that is, while we should always try to reunify families, \nthe best interests of the child, the safety of the child, the welfare \nof the child always--always--must be of paramount concern.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3841-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING APRIL 25\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending April 25, the U.S. imported 7,983,000 barrels \nof oil each day, 69,000 barrels less than the 8,052,000 imported during \nthe same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil \nthan the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil \nfor 55.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that \nthe upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,983,000 barrels a \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3842-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3842-S3843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ERASE THE HATE DAY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for \npassing a piece of legislation this morning that designates today, \nNational Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day. The legislation we \npassed this morning also calls on President Clinton to issue a \nproclamation urging all Americans to use each day as an opportunity to \ntake a stand against racism and hate.\n  In 1964, Mike Mansfield of Montana, then majority leader of the U.S. \nSenate, ushered through this body the landmark Civil Rights Act. His \nnational foresight and courage in those years was widely praised in the \npress and by his peers. As one colleague said upon Senator Mansfield's \nretirement, ``The distinguished majority leader votes his convictions \nand lets the chips fall where they will.''\n  In the last several years, however, Montanans of a different \ngeneration have come under the microscope of less favorable scrutiny. \nThe reputation of Montana as a State of forward-thinkers and tolerant \nindividuals was marred by the standoff between the FBI and the so-\ncalled Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in some of \nour cities.\n  Make no mistake, it is important for the media and others to focus on \nthese events, whether they occur in Montana or elsewhere. But equally, \nif we are to learn from them, then we also need to listen to the \nstories of hope, of the people who are willing to stand up to bigots \nand hate groups.\n  Because those stories are happening all the time in Montana. Whether \nit is a community like Billings that stands up to a group of skinheads, \nor a Missoula high school class that devotes an entire project to \nstudying the Holocaust.\n  It was in this spirit and with the strong support of the YWCA of \nAmerica, the Anti-Defamation League, and the USA Network, that I \ncosponsored the legislation that designated today as National Erase the \nHate and Eliminate Racism Day.\n  There is no doubt that we have come a long way as a nation. But with \n8,000 hate crimes reported to the U.S. Department of Justice each year, \nit is clear we still have much more work to do.\n  In addition to taking a day to recognize the importance of the fight, \nwe must continue to support groups like the Northwest Coalition Against \nMalicious Harassment, the Montana Human\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\nRights Network, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the many \nother groups and individuals who continue this work every day.\n  In fact, many of those involved in this arena are now urging \nPresident Clinton to convene a White House conference on the issue. \nThey have my strong support in their request. Surely, what we can do to \nencourage voluntarism, we must do to end hate.\n  I know a simple Senate resolution, or even a national conference, \nwill not end the problems we still have. A piece of paper alone cannot \nteach a child that hate is wrong. But I do believe a piece of paper can \nmake people think. A conference will not end intolerance. But it can \nmake people talk about hate crimes. Designating today as a day to \naddress these important problems is a first step and it can light a \nspark of hope in people's hearts and minds.\n  Again, perhaps our predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Mansfield, when \nspeaking about the task in 1964, said it best when he noted,\n\n       What we do here in the . . . Congress will not, of itself, \n     correct these faults, but we can and must join the wisdom--\n     the collective wisdom of this body--to the efforts of others \n     in this Nation to face up to them for what they are--a \n     serious erosion of the fundamental rock upon which the unity \n     of the Nation stands.\n\n  Tolerance and respect are our nation's bedrock. Today we can join \ntogether to renew the fight for a better America. And if we continue to \nlook at the good, courageous, decent things our neighbors are doing, \nthe sparks of hope we light just might catch fire, in Montana and all \nacross the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3842-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 363.

A bill to empower States with authority for most taxing and \nspending for highway programs and mass transit programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   The TRANSPORTATION EMPOWERMENT ACT\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation which would allow States to keep almost all of their gas \ntax revenues for their own transportation projects without interference \nfrom Washington.\n  The Transportation Empowerment Act--which being re-introduced in the \nHouse by Representative John Kasich--would replace the current law \ngoverning the Federal highways program, the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA].\n  Under ISTEA, Washington currently collects about $25 billion each \nyear in dedicated transportation taxes, skims money off the top for \ndemonstration projects, skims more off the top to fund its highway \nbureaucracy, runs the remainder through a maze of formulas, and then \nreturns what's left to the States to fund their transportation \nprograms.\n  However, this circle of waste, has shortchanged our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. Today, notwithstanding the tremendous \ngrowth in spending, our Nation's transportation investment backlog is \nestimated to be at least $200 billion. This backlog includes the \nfollowing deficiencies: 25 percent of our highways are in poor/mediocre \ncondition; 24 to 28 percent of bridges are structurally deficient/\nfunctionally obsolete; 24 percent of rail transit facilities are in \nsubstandard/poor condition; and 20 to 24 percent of transit buses need \nto be replaced.\n  The fact is that our country is getting less from our transportation \ndollars. Part of the reason for this is reflected in the growth of \nadministrative costs. These costs, as a function of Federal highway \nconstruction dollars, have risen from 7 percent in 1956 to over 21 \npercent today.\n  The history of the Federal program has shown us that the current \nsystem [ISTEA] of collecting and distributing gas tax dollars needed by \nStates to implement their own transportation needs is too inefficient, \ntoo costly, and too bureaucratic. Washington simply can't meet the \nchallenges facing the Nation's infrastructure.\n  Simply put: The era of big Government is over. And in this era, the \nhighway system is a perfect example of a program that ought to be \nreturned to the States. It's a simple formula for success--less \nWashington, more roads. In fact, transportation economists and State \nofficials estimate that if States weren't hamstrung by Washington's \narcane formulas and mandates, they could get 20 percent more highways \nand transit systems for every dollar collected.\n  I have introduced the Transportation Empowerment Act because I \nbelieve we can better serve our Nation's transportation needs primarily \nthrough State run transportation programs, without Federal \nmicromanagement and without laundering gas tax dollars through \nWashington.\n\n\n          key provisions of the transportation empowerment act\n\n  The legislation continues a streamlined ``core'' Federal program. \nThis core Federal transportation program will include the maintenance \nof the current Interstate System, Federal lands programs--Indian \nreservation roads, public lands, parkways and park roads--highway \nsafety programs and emergency disaster relief. Also included is \ncontinued general fund support for transit programs.\n  The bill authorizes States to establish multistate compacts for \nplanning, financing, and establishing safety and construction \nstandards, and encourages innovative approaches on the part of the \nStates, such as use of infrastructure banks and privitization. The bill \nrepeals the requirement that States repay Federal grants associated \nwith transportation infrastructure which is slated for privatization.\n  The legislation provides a 4-year transition period, beginning in \nfiscal year 1998, during which time the existing 14 cents gas tax \ndedicated to transportation purposes would remain in place. After \nfunding the new streamlined core program and paying off outstanding \nbills, the remainder is returned to States in a block grant.\n  At the end of the transition period, beginning in fiscal year 2002, \nthe Federal gas tax would be reduced to 2 cents--that amount necessary \nto fund the core Federal programs.\n  Under the bill each State would be free to replace the Federal gas \ntax and to keep those dollars within the State to use as each sees fit.\n  The bottom line is this--for far too long Washington has had a \nstranglehold on States' transportation needs. It's time for Washington \nto let go and re-empower the States to make their own decisions.\n  More information about the Transportation Empowerment Act is \navailable via the Internet at www.senate.gov/mack/\ntea2.html.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 668. A bill to increase economic benefits to the United States \nfrom the activities of cruise ships visiting Alaska; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         BENEFITS FROM CRUISE SHIPS VISITING ALASKA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Today, Mr. President, I am reintroducing a very \nimportant measure--one that will unlock and open a door that Congress \nhas kept barred for over 100 years.\n  Opening that door will create a path to thousands of new jobs, to \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new economic activity, and to \nmillions in new Federal, State, and local government revenues. \nFurthermore, Mr. President, that door can be opened with no adverse \nimpact on any existing U.S. industry, labor interest, or on the \nenvironment, and it will cost the Government virtually nothing.\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\n  There's no magic to this; in fact, it's a very simple matter. My bill \nmerely allows U.S. ports to compete for the growing cruise ship trade \nto Alaska, and encourages the development of an all-Alaska cruise \nbusiness, as well.\n  The bill amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign cruise \nships to operate from U.S. ports to Alaska, and between Alaska ports. \nHowever, it also very carefully protects all existing U.S. passenger \nvessels by using a definition of ``cruise ship'' designed to exclude \nany foreign-flag vessels that could conceivably compete in the same \nmarket as U.S.-flag tour boats or ferries. Finally, it provides a \nmechanism to guarantee that if a U.S. vessel ever enters this trade in \nthe future, steps will be taken to ensure an ample pool of potential \npassengers.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward approach to a vexing \nproblem, and it deserves the support of this body.\n  Let's look at the facts. U.S. ports currently are precluded from \ncompeting for the Alaska cruise ship trade by the Passenger Service Act \nof 1886, which bars foreign vessels from carrying passengers on one-way \nvoyages between U.S. ports. However, it isn't 1886 anymore. These days, \nno one is building any U.S. passenger ships of this type, and no one \nhas built one in over 40 years.\n  Because there are no U.S. vessels in this important trade, the only \nreal effect of the Passenger Service Act is to force all the vessels \nsailing to Alaska to base their operations in a foreign port instead of \na U.S. city.\n  Mr. President, what we have here is an act of Congress prohibiting \nU.S. cities from competing for thousands of jobs and hundreds of \nmillions in business dollars. That is worse than absurd--in light of \nour ever-popular election-year promises to help the economy, it belongs \nin Letterman's ``Top Ten Reasons Why Congress Doesn't Know What It's \nDoing.''\n  How, Mr. President, can anyone argue with a straight face for the \ncontinuation of a policy that fails utterly to benefit any identifiable \nAmerican interest, while actively discouraging economic growth.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time I have introduced this \nlegislation. When I began, Alaska-bound cruise passengers totaled about \n200,000 per year. By last year, 445,000 people--most of them American \ncitizens--were making that voyage. This year's traffic may exceed \n500,000 people. Almost all those passengers are sailing to and from \nVancouver, British Columbia--not because Vancouver is necessarily a \nbetter port, but because our own foolish policy demands it.\n  The cash flow generated by this trade is enormous. Most passengers \nfly in or out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington \nState, but because of the law, they spend little time there. Instead, \nthey spend their pre- and post-sailing time in a Vancouver hotel, at \nVancouver restaurants and in Vancouver gift shops. And when their \nvessel sails, it sails with food, fuel, general supplies, repair and \nmaintenance needs taken care of by Vancouver vendors.\n  According to some estimates the city of Vancouver receives benefits \nof well over $200 million per year. Others provide more modest \nestimates, such as a comprehensive study by the International Council \nof Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 alone, the Alaska cruise \ntrade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city of Vancouver, plus \npayments to Canadian vendors and employees of over $119 million. If \nthat business had taken place inside the United States, it would have \nbeen worth additional Federal, State and local tax revenues of \napproximately $60 million.\n  In addition to the opportunities now being shunted to Vancouver, we \nare also missing an opportunity to create entirely new jobs and income \nthrough the potential to develop new cruising routes between Alaska \nports. The city of Ketchikan, AK, was told a few years ago that two \nrelatively small cruise ships were very interested in establishing \nshort cruises within southeast Alaska. I'm told such a business could \nhave contributed $2 million or more to that small community's economy, \nand created dozens of new jobs. But, because of the current policy, the \nopportunity simply evaporated.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we allow this to happen? This is a market \nalmost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to see one of the United \nStates most spectacular places, and yet we force them to go to another \ncountry to do it. We are throwing away both money and jobs--and getting \nnothing whatsoever in return.\n  Why is this allowed to happen? The answer is simple--but it is not \nrational. Although the current law is actually a job loser, there are \nthose who argue that any change would weaken U.S. maritime interests. I \nsubmit, Mr. President, that is not the case.\n  For some inexplicable reason, paranoia runs deep among those who \noppose this bill. They seem to feel that amending the Passenger Service \nAct so that it makes sense for the United States would create a threat \nto Jones Act vessels hauling freight between U.S. ports. Mr. President, \nthere simply is no connection whatsoever between the two. I have \nrepeatedly made clear that I have no intention of using this bill to \ncreate cracks in the Jones Act.\n\n  This bill would actually enhance--not impede--opportunities for U.S. \nworkers. Both shipyard workers and longshoremen--not to mention hotel \nand restaurant workers and many others--would have a great deal to gain \nfrom this legislation, and the bill has been carefully written to \nprevent the loss of any existing jobs in other trades.\n  Finally, let me dispose of any suggestion that this bill might harm \nsmaller U.S. tour or excursion boats. The industry featuring these \nsmaller vessels is thriving, but it simply doesn't cater to the same \nclient base as large cruise ships. For one thing, the tour boats \noperating in Alaska are all much smaller. The smallest foreign-flag \nvessel eligible under this limit is Carnival Cruise Line's Windstar, \nwhich is a 5,700-ton ship with overnight accomodations for 159 \npassengers. By contrast, although the largest U.S. vessel in the Alaska \ntrade is rated to carry 138 passengers, she is less than 100 gross \ndeadweight tons.\n  The fact of the matter is that there is no significant competition \nbetween the two types of vessel, because the passengers inclined to one \nare not likely to be inclined to the other. The larger vessels offer \nunmatched luxury and personal service, on-board shopping, \nentertainment, etc. The smaller vessels offer more flexible routes and \nthe ability to get closer to many of Alaska's extraordinary natural \nattractions.\n  In the spirit of full disclosure, Mr. President, let me acknowledge \nthat there is one operating U.S. vessel that doesn't fit the mold: the \nConstitution, an aging 30,000-ton vessel operating only in Hawaii. This \nis the only ocean-capable U.S. ship that might fit the definition of \n``cruise vessel.'' I have searched for other U.S. vessels that meet or \nexceed the 5,000-ton limit in the bill, and the only ones I have found \nthat even approach it are the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, \nboth of which are approximately 3,360 tons, and both of which are 19th \ncentury-style riverboats that are entirely unsuitable for any open-\nocean itinerary such as the Alaska trade.\n  Mr. President, I cannot claim that this legislation would immediately \nlead to increased earnings for U.S. ports. I can only say that it would \nallow them to compete fairly, instead of being anchored by a rule that \nis actively harmful to U.S. interests. It is, as I said at the \nbeginning of this statement, only a way to open the door.\n  We've heard a lot of talk about growing the economy and creating jobs \nduring the last few years. But we all know, Mr. President, that such \nchanges are easier to talk about than they are to accomplish. Well, Mr. \nPresident, here is a bill that opens the door to thousands of jobs and \nhundreds of millions of new dollars, and does it without one red cent \nof taxpayer money. It's been 110 years since the current law was \nenacted, and it's time for a change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the interest of the United States--\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\n       (A) to maximize economic return from the growing trade in \n     cruise ships sailings to and from Alaska by encouraging the \n     use of United States labor, supplies, berthing and repair \n     facilities, and other services, and\n       (B) to encourage the growth of new enterprises including \n     the transportation of passengers on luxury cruise ships \n     between ports in Alaska.\n       (2) In promoting additional economic benefits to the United \n     States from the cruise ship industry, there is a need to \n     ensure that existing employment and economic activity \n     associated with the Alaska Marine Highway System, United \n     States-flag tour boats operating from Alaskan ports, and \n     similar United States enterprises are protected from adverse \n     impact.\n       (3) Cruise ship sailings to Alaska comprise a vital and \n     growing segment of the United States travel industry. Since \n     1989, the number of tourists coming to Alaska via cruise \n     ships has increased by 86 percent. With almost 500,000 \n     passengers per year, Alaska has become the third most popular \n     cruise destination in the world, after the Caribbean and \n     Europe.\n       (4) The cruise ship industry is expected to grow at a rate \n     of 15 percent per year over the next several years. In 1996, \n     7 new cruise ships having a combined capacity to carry over \n     13,000 passengers entered the market.\n       (5) The only United States-flag ocean cruise ship in \n     service is an aging vessel operating cruises only between the \n     Hawaiian Islands. No United States-flag cruise ships are \n     presently available to enter the Alaskan trade. Thus, all \n     cruise ships carrying passengers to and from Alaskan \n     destinations are foreign-flag vessels which are precluded, \n     under current law, from carrying passengers between United \n     States ports.\n       (6) The City of Vancouver, British Columbia receives \n     substantial economic benefit by providing services to cruise \n     ships in the Alaskan trade. In 1996, there were 487 Alaska-\n     related voyages, with over 445,000 passengers, up from \n     389,000 in 1995. Most of the voyages stopped in Vancouver. \n     Vancouver has benefited from the cruise ship industry through \n     the direct and indirect employment of almost 2,500 people, \n     and through revenues from goods and services of approximately \n     $120,000,000 a year.\n       (7) The transfer of cruise ship-based economic activity \n     from Vancouver, British Columbia to United States ports could \n     yield additional Federal revenues of nearly $100,000,000 a \n     year and additional State and local government revenues of \n     approximately $30,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 2. FOREIGN-FLAG CRUISE VESSELS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Cruise vessel.--The term ``cruise vessel'' means a \n     vessel of greater than 5,000 deadweight tons which provides a \n     full range of luxury accommodations, entertainment, dining, \n     and other services for its passengers.\n       (2) Foreign-flag cruise vessel.--The term ``foreign-flag \n     cruise vessel'' does not apply to a vessel which--\n       (A) regularly carries for hire both passengers and vehicles \n     or other cargo, or\n       (B) serves residents of their ports of call in Alaska or \n     other ports in the United States as a common or frequently \n     used means of transportation between United States ports.\n       (b) Waiver.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 of \n     the Act of June 19, 1886 (46 U.S.C. 289) or any other \n     provision of law, passengers may be transported in foreign-\n     flag cruise vessels between ports in Alaska and between ports \n     in Alaska and other ports on the west coast of the contiguous \n     States, except as otherwise provided by this section.\n       (c) Coastwise Trade.--Upon a showing satisfactory to the \n     Secretary of Transportation, by the owner or charterer of a \n     United States-flag cruise vessel, that service aboard such \n     vessel qualified to engage in the coastwise trade is being \n     offered or advertised pursuant to a Certificate of Financial \n     Responsibility for Indemnification of Passengers for \n     Nonperformance of Transportation (46 App. U.S.C. 817(e)) for \n     service in the coastwise trade between ports in Alaska or \n     between ports in Alaska and other ports on the west coast of \n     the contiguous States, or both, the Secretary shall notify \n     the owner or charterer of one or more foreign-flag cruise \n     vessels transporting passengers under authority of this \n     section, if any, that the Secretary shall, within 1 year from \n     the date of notification, terminate such service. Coastwise \n     privileges granted to any owner or charterer of a foreign-\n     flag cruise vessel under this section shall expire on the \n     365th day following receipt of the Secretary's notification.\n       (d) Notification.--Notifications issued by the Secretary \n     under subsection (c) shall be issued to the owners or \n     charterers of foreign-flag cruise vessels--\n       (1) in the reverse order in which foreign-flag cruise \n     vessels entered the coastwise service pursuant to this \n     section determined by the date of each vessel's first \n     coastwise sailing; and\n       (2) in the minimum number needed to ensure that the \n     passenger-carrying capacity thereby removed from coastwise \n     service exceeds the passenger-carrying capacity of the United \n     States-flag cruise vessel which is entering the service.\n       (e) Termination.--If, at the expiration of the 365-day \n     period specified in subsection (c), the United States-flag \n     cruise vessel that has offered or advertised service pursuant \n     to a Certificate of Financial Responsibility for \n     Indemnification of Passengers for Nonperformance of \n     Transportation has not entered the coastwise passenger trade \n     between ports in Alaska or between ports in Alaska and other \n     ports on the west coast of the contiguous States, then the \n     termination of service required by subsection (c) shall not \n     take effect until 180 days following the entry into the trade \n     by the United States-flag cruise vessel.\n       (f) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section shall be construed \n     as affecting or otherwise modifying the authority contained \n     in the Act of June 30, 1961 (46 U.S.C. 289b) authorizing the \n     transportation of passengers and merchandise in Canadian \n     vessels between ports in Alaska and the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. DeWine, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 670. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Technical \nCorrections Act of 1994 to eliminate the special transition rule for \nissuance of a certificate of citizenship for certain children born \noutside the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  technical corrections legislation concerning children born overseas\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce on behalf of myself, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, and Senator Durbin, a \nshort, technical bill to correct a drafting error in last year's \nimmigration bill that could wrongly deny U.S. citizenship to certain \nchildren born overseas to a U.S.-citizen parent.\n  To explain the problem addressed by this bill, some background is in \norder. Prior to 1986, a minor child, born abroad to a U.S.-citizen \nparent, was eligible for U.S. citizenship if the child's U.S. citizen-\nparent had physically resided in the United States for at least 10 \nyears prior to the child's birth. The 1986 Immigration bill shortened \nthis residency period to 5 years for children born after its effective \ndate, but perhaps inadvertently retained the 10-year requirement for \nchildren born before that date.\n  This double standard yielded anomalous results: In families where the \nU.S.-citizen parent had resided in the United States for more than 5 \nyears but less than 10, a younger child--born in, say, 1987--would be \neligible for U.S. citizenship, while that child's older sibling--born \nin, say, 1985--would not be. To eliminate this disparity, the \nImmigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 amended \nthe relevant provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nestablish a uniform 5-year residency requirement, without regard to the \ndate of the child's birth.\n  A provision in last year's immigration bill, however, effectively \nrepealed the 1994 amendment described above, thus restoring the prior \ndouble standard. There was, of course, no policy basis for this change, \nand no one has claimed ownership of it. The change appears to have \nsimply been a drafting error in a purely technical section of last \nyear's bill.\n  This error needs to be corrected without delay. Once a child turns \n18, he is no longer eligible to become a U.S. citizen under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act provision that was affected by the \ndrafting error. Thus, children who turn 18 before this error is \ncorrected will be permanently ineligible to become U.S. citizens under \nthe provision at issue. The longer this error goes uncorrected, the \ngreater the number of children who will be harmed by it.\n  I therefore hope this bill can be passed without delay or \ncontroversy, and I will be working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to that end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 671. A bill to clarify the family violence option under the \ntemporary assistance to needy families program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               the family violence option ii act of 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be introducing \nthe Family Violence Option II, a bill to clarify the Wellstone/Murray \nFamily violence option Act contained in the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Last summer, Senator \nMurray and I introduced the family violence amendment to the welfare \nbill to give States the flexibility to identify victims and survivors \nof domestic abuse and, if necessary, to provide more time to remove the \ndomestic violence barrier so that victims would be able to move into \nthe work force. Our provision was changed to a State option, but that \ndid not change the intent of the legislation.\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\n  States helping battered women should not be penalized for not having \nthe requisite number of women at work in a given month if domestic \nviolence is the reason. Most importantly, battered women should not be \ncompeting with the myriad people with disabilities that prevent them \nfrom working. Abuse victims and survivors may simply need a little more \ntime. That is why the family violence option allows States to grant \ntemporary waivers, not exemptions.\n  Many States have adopted the family violence option, others, some \nversion of it, but most have had great difficulty figuring out what \ntaking the option would mean. Senator Murray and I want to make sure \nStates that take domestic abuse into account when setting work goals \nwill not pay a price. Therefore, this bill makes it clear that victims \nof domestic abuse will not be counted in the 20 percent hardship \nexemption and States who grant temporary waivers of work requirements \nto abuse survivors will not be penalized if they fail to meet their \nwork requirements.\n  Evidence continues to emerge about the high number of incidents of \ndomestic abuse or a history of abuse among welfare recipients. Most \nrecently, a joint study from the Taylor Institute in Chicago and the \nUniversity of Michigan confirmed that large numbers of women on AFDC \nare survivors or current victims. Four recent studies--conducted by \nPassaic County, NJ, Univ. of Massachusetts, Northwestern University, \nand the Better Homes Fund in Worcester, MA--document that at least 14 \npercent--Passaic County, NJ--and as high as 32 percent--Worcester, MA--\nof women on AFDC were currently being abused. The numbers were more \nthan twice those percentages for a history of abuse.\n  Given the extent of this problem, it is imperative that States be \nable to work at a more individualized pace, not a one-size-fits-all \napproach. I would like to share a story about a woman from Minnesota \nwho has used the safety net of public assistance to free herself and \nher children from violence, obtain job skills and training, and become \nself-supporting.\n  Edith is a woman who has defied the odds. She had her first child at \nthe age of 16. By the time she was in her early twenties, she had \nbecome an intravenous drug user, had three more children, and was in an \nextremely violent relationship. Edith's abuser beat her routinely and \nsavagely, sending her to the emergency room again and again. As Edith \nsays, ``Finally, I realized that to save my life and my mental \nstability, I had to get away.'' She waited until her abuser had passed \nout and carefully pried the car keys from his hand and fled Gary, IN, \nwith her young sons.\n  Edith fled to Minnesota because she had family there. Within months \nher abuser found her, forcing her to flee to a battered women's \nshelter. Edith quickly realized that if she was ever going to be able \nto support her children, she would need to get the educational and job \ntraining that she desperately needed. It was at that point that Edith \ncontacted Cornerstone's Transitional Housing Program. Cornerstone is a \nsuccessful women's advocacy program in Bloomington, MN.\n  Edith and her children came into the program in 1992. Utilizing \neducational and vocational resources, Edith entered a vocational \nprogram for electricians. While in Cornerstone's Transitional Housing \nProgram, Edith was able to address the many issues that had resulted \nfrom her battering, including parenting, bad credit, and chemical \ndependency, just to name a few. With support of the program staff, \nEdith completed the apprenticeship and graduated from the Cornerstone \nprogram.\n  I am proud to tell you that Edith will become a licensed electrician \nthis summer. She has just purchased her first home and has set a new \ngoal to become a contractor. Edith would tell you that had she not been \ngiven the time and the opportunity to participate in a transitional \nhousing program specifically for battered women, she could not have \naccomplished all of her goals.\n  We need to insure that women like Edith have the support system in \nplace to escape abusive situations, make the transition to work, and \nthen stay working. When women can support themselves and their children \nthey can stay away from abusive partners and keep themselves and their \nfamilies safe. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the intent of Congress is amending part A of title IV \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) in section \n     103(a) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. \n     2112) was to allow States to take into account the effects of \n     the epidemic of domestic violence in establishing their \n     welfare programs, by giving States the flexibility to grant \n     individual, temporary waivers for good cause to victims of \n     domestic violence who meet the criteria set forth in section \n     402(a)(7)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     601(a)(7)(B));\n       (2) the allowance of waivers under such sections was not \n     intended to be limited by other, separate, and independent \n     provisions of part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); and\n       (3) under section 402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)), requirements under the temporary \n     assistance for needy families program under part A of title \n     IV of such Act may, for good cause, be waived for so long as \n     necessary.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in order to promote and \nimprove employee stock ownership plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE ESOP PROMOTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill enhance employee ownership in businesses across America. The ESOP \nPromotion Act of 1997, which I introduce today with my colleague, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, will facilitate employee ownership and \nretirement savings and enhance the opportunities for America's \nentrepreneurs to gain improved access to capital. This legislation \nwould both improve and update a number of obsolete operating rules for \nemployee stock ownership programs and would implement the full intent \nof Congress, which last year passed legislation designed to make ESOP's \navailable to Subchapter S corporations.\n  The ESOP Promotion Act benefits the owners and workers in the 2 \nmillion S corporations which exist in every industry in every State \nacross America. As the country's principal corporate vehicle for \nentrepreneurs and family business startups, S corporations have long \nbeen engines of economic growth. Unfortunately, the restrictions placed \non these businesses have also resulted, more recently, in reduced \ncapital access for S corporations. For an S corporation which had hit \nthe limit on the number of allowable shareholders or the amount of \npersonal debt that its owners could assume to keep the company in \nbusiness, there has been a burdensome capital crunch affecting not only \nthese companies directly, but hindering the ability of our entire \nnational economy to realize its growth potential.\n  Last year, as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1997, \nCongress enabled S corporations to have\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nESOP's. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that measure, which by \nallowing S corporation ESOP's did two additional, critical things: it \ngave S corporations a new way to access funds without putting any new \nburdens on the Federal tax base, and it gave millions of workers a way \nto participate directly in the success and growth of the businesses \nwhich employed them.\n  But despite the success we marked in 1996, the many S corporations \nwhich now want to build ESOP's cannot. The reason: there continues to \nbe a number of largely technical hurdles in the Tax Code that make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to establish and sustain these employee \nownership programs.\n  One example of such a hurdle, is that, under current law, if an S \ncorporation's ESOP distributes stock to its employee participants, and \neven one employee rolls over his stock into an entity that is not a \npermissible S corporation shareholder--say, an IRA account--then the \ncompany's Subchapter S election will be entirely invalidated. This, of \ncourse, is a risk that no S corporation is willing to take, and while \nthe problem seems minor and technical on its face, no S corporation \nwill establish an ESOP under these conditions.\n  Another example of a technical disincentive is that, while S \ncorporations were established in the 1950's as pass-through companies \nwhich pay a single layer of taxes, the S corporation ESOP would have to \npay two layers of tax--one when the S corporation distributes stock to \nthe ESOP, and the other when the ESOP distributes stock or cash to \nits participants. The second layer of tax was certainly not envisioned \nby Congress when we permitted S corporations to have ESOP's last year. \nUnfortunately, in its current form, this technicality means that an S \ncorporation ESOP participant would pay a nearly 70 percent greater tax \non his share of income than he would if he owned the company's stock \ndirectly. As such, S corporation ESOP's are not yet viable for \nemployees, though we certainly intended that they would be when we \nestablished them.\n\n  The legislation that we are introducing eliminates these and other \ntechnical problems by establishing parity between ESOP's sponsored by S \ncorporations and those sponsored by C corporations; ensuring S \ncorporation ESOP participants that they are subject to only one layer \nof taxation; and permitting employees to sell certain stock to an ESOP \nand defer tax on gain.\n  In addition to the important S corporation measures in the \nlegislation, the ESOP Promotion Act would improve the retirement \nsavings opportunities for American workers. The bill would give \nemployees the option to direct employers to retain dividends paid on \nemployer stock in the ESOP/401(k) plan for reinvestment in the employer \nstock. Employees could then defer income taxes on the dividends and \nallow them to grow tax-free in their ESOP/401(k) plan until retirement.\n  The bill would also correct an inequity to workers in the current tax \nlaw which provides an incentive for employers to pay the dividends to \nemployees in cash, rather than to reinvest them in the ESOP/401(k) \nplan. Employers currently receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on \nstock held in the ESOP/401(k) plan only if the dividends are passed \nthrough to plan participants or are used to pay off an ESOP loan. The \nESOP Promotion Act would provide employers with the tax deduction they \ncurrently receive on dividends paid on employer stock that is passed \nthrough to plan participants, if the dividends instead remain in the \nplan for reinvestment. This reinvestment opportunity for employees will \nenhance their retirement savings and facilitate employee ownership.\n  Congress now has a responsibility for finishing the task we began \nlast year--one that, perhaps, many of us believed we had completed--\nwhen we agreed that S corporations should have ESOP's and enacted a law \nto that effect. Our bill completes the task by making ESOP's useful and \ndesirable for the millions of workers in S corporations, while ensuring \nthat they are suitable for the companies that wish to sponsor ESOP's. \nClearly when Congress enacted the S corporation ESOP provision, we \nexpected that it would be functional by its effective date, which is \nJanuary 1, 1998. I hope that my colleagues will support our \nlegislation, and ensure that our intent is fully implemented by the end \nof this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nencourage States to expand health coverage of low income children and \npregnant women and to provide funds to promote outreach efforts to \nenroll eligible children under health insurance programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n     children's health insurance provides security (chips) act\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to provide health insurance for millions of children who \nare not currently covered. Before I talk about the bill, let me take a \nmoment to thank all of the members of the bipartisan coalition who have \nworked so hard to put this legislation together. Senator Rockefeller, \nthe lead Democratic cosponsor and my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, deserves very special mention in this regard. Senator \nRockefeller has worked for many, many years on these issues and I am \npersonally grateful for all his leadership and hard work in this \nendeavor. He is a true hero when it comes to America's children.\n  There are currently 10 million children in this country who do not \nhave health insurance. Many of these children live in families where \none or both parents are working but do not have employee coverage and \nearn too much to qualify for Medicaid. Others, though eligible, simply \nfall through the cracks, while still others lose eligibility because of \nage-based restrictions. This is a tragic problem and our proposal tries \nto provide real solutions.\n  The Chafee-Rockefeller proposal offers the States additional Federal \nmatching funds if they choose to provide Medicaid coverage to all \nchildren up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. It is a \ncompletely voluntary program--we hope that all States will participate, \nbut we leave that decision to the Governors. States, like Rhode Island, \nthat are already providing coverage at these levels will immediately \nbegin to get additional Federal matching funds once they have provided \nthe 1-year continuous coverage. Our bill also provides grant funds for \nStates to use for outreach to the 3 million children who are eligible \nfor Medicaid but not enrolled.\n  I believe that the Medicaid Program is the best avenue to reach these \nuninsured children. Expansions in the Medicaid Program over the years \nhave done wonders in increasing coverage for children and pregnant \nwomen. We also have to keep an eye on cost, and Medicaid is an \ninexpensive way to cover children--while half of Medicaid beneficiaries \nare children, children only account for 15 percent of overall Medicaid \nspending. And Medicaid is a program that already exists, so we don't \nhave to create a new program or a new bureaucracy. In short, Medicaid \nworks and works well.\n  By encouraging States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children \nunder 18 up to 150 percent of poverty, our proposal also tries to fix \none of the program's problems: under the current Medicaid program a \nchild's eligibility depends not only on family income, but also on age.\n  Let me illustrate this for you: a 6-year-old girl lives in a family \nof four whose annual income is $21,000. That little girl gets Medicaid \nbecause Federal law requires that all children 6 and under be covered \nup to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. On her seventh \nbirthday, that little girl doesn't get much of a birthday present--she \nloses her Medicaid coverage because Federal law only requires that \nchildren between the ages of 7 and 13 be covered up to 100 percent of \npoverty, and her family's income level is slightly above that level. \nHer 4-year-old brother, however, keeps his Medicaid coverage, at least \nfor the next 2 years. How bizarre that there are two children in the \nsame family and one gets coverage because he's under 6 and the other \ndoesn't because she's older than 6. Our proposal would give States the \noption to continue Medicaid coverage for both children until they are \n18.\n  So, I am very pleased to introduce this legislation today along with \nthis distinguished bipartisan group of Senators. I look forward to \nworking together toward the goal of getting critical health care \ncoverage to these children.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased and proud to \nbe introducing legislation today with my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Chafee. As my colleagues in the Senate already know, Senator \nChafee has long been a leader in the area of health care, especially \nwhen it comes to the health care of children. I am also extremely \npleased to be introducing this bill with the help of Senator Breaux and \nthe newest member of the Finance Committee, Senator Jeffords. We are \nexcited to be joined by so many of our colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Moynihan, D'Amato, Baucus, Hatch, Bryan, Kerrey, \nand Moseley-Braun, and with so many of our other colleagues who have \njoined us as original cosponsors, including Senators Collins, Bingaman, \nSnowe, Kennedy, Kerry, Dodd, Robb, Hutchinson, Inouye, Daschle, and \nSpecter.\n  Mr. President, our legislation already enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport because it meets a serious need and it meets that need in a \nvery cost-effective manner. Our legislation builds on an existing \nprogram and employs an approach that the Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nhas used repeatedly over the past decade to expand health coverage to \nchildren and pregnant women. Our legislation is, therefore, not new, \noriginal, or terribly innovative. But, we know it works.\n  For me personally, this legislation fulfills another part of my \npromise to work tirelessly to turn the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Children, which I was honored to chair, into reality. \nThat blue ribbon panel of children's leaders from many fields, \nrepresenting a wide spectrum of views, successfully developed a \nunanimous report to recommend an action plan to give America's children \na real shot at becoming productive, healthy citizens. During our \ndeliberations, we recognized that ensuring basic health care for \nchildren should be one of the country's highest priorities. The bill we \nare introducing today challenges Congress to make the commitment to \nthis basic objective that is so vital for the entire country's future.\n  Our legislation is complementary to many of the other children health \nbills that have been already proposed this year. That is one reason why \nI am also a cosponsor of other health bills that have been introduced \nby Senators Hatch and Kennedy and Senator Daschle. These bills are not \ncompeting bills. They all seek to expand the number of children with \nhealth insurance and they could all easily fit together to meet a \nlarge, and I am sad to report, a growing need in this country.\n  A total of 10 million children in the United States do not have \nhealth insurance and as a result, the vast majority of them do not get \nnecessary health care. Numerous studies have shown that uninsured \nchildren do not receive basic preventive care and immunizations. They \nare less likely to see a doctor for both acute and chronic illnesses \nand are more likely to delay seeking necessary care. Uninsured sick \nnewborns receive fewer services in the hospital than those with health \ncoverage. Children without insurance are less likely to have a regular \nsource of medical care. This means that these children miss out on \ngetting properly screened for problems that could be easily treated \nearly or that need to be monitored on a routine basis. According to the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, having a regular source of medical care \ncould reduce per-child health care costs by 22 percent.\n\n  Those are the facts. But let us not forget the emotional turmoil a \nparent goes through trying to figure out when, or if, to get an earache \ntreated or a rash checked out. Imagine how hard it must be for a mother \nand father to decide to wait just one more day in hopes that a \ntroubling symptom will disappear only to have those symptoms worsen in \nthe middle of the night. Some families don't even allow their children \nto play sports for fear of an injury. Having millions of families and \nchildren in these types of situations is just plain wrong, and we must \ntry to help.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of uninsured children live in \nfamilies where a parent works. Unfortunately, many of these families \nare unable to afford coverage offered by their employer when it is \noffered. In too many instances working parents don't even have that \noption. The trends for job-based insurance are very disturbing. Between \n1987 and 1995 the percentage of children with job-based insurance \ndeclined from 67 to 59 percent. But this downward trend is not new. \nBetween 1977 and 1987 job-based insurance declined by 5 percent. Every \nminute that goes by another child loses his or her private health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, our bill is very simple. We encourage States to expand \ncoverage for children by offering them an enhanced Federal match. Under \nour bill, the States would be eligible to receive a 30-percent increase \nin their current Federal matching rate if they choose to expand \ncoverage for pregnant women, infants, and children up to 150 percent of \npoverty. We cap the Federal match at 90 percent so that all States \nwould be required to contribute some additional funding. Under our \nbill, Rhode Island would be eligible to receive an enhanced Federal \nmatch rate of 70 percent up from 54 percent. West Virginia would be \neligible to receive a 90 percent Federal match, up from 72 percent.\n  Our legislation targets those families earning less than one-and-one-\nhalf times the poverty level or about $24,000 a year for a family of \nfour. Only a quarter of families at or below this income level have \njob-based insurance. By comparison, 81 percent of families earning \nwages above 150 percent of poverty have job-based insurance. The \nconcern of replacing private insurance with public coverage--the so \ncalled crowding out effect--is minimized when so little job-based \ncoverage even exists for families at these income levels.\n\n  Under current law, Medicaid eligibility varies based on a child's age \nand a family's income level. Our legislation aims to establish uniform \nlevel of eligibility. I recently heard from a West Virginia mother \ndesperate for health insurance for her 1-year-old. She and her husband \nwork and earn about $22,000 a year. When their daughter turned 1, she \nlost her Medicaid coverage. She qualified for Medicaid when she was an \ninfant but because Medicaid's income standard for eligibility is \ndifferent for a 1-year-old she no longer qualified after her first \nbirthday. The mother's employer offered health insurance, but at a cost \nof $289 a month or $3,500 a year. They could not afford to buy it. This \nmother was absolutely desperate for assistance because she knew her \ndaughter needed immunizations and other well child care services.\n  Mr. President, our legislation seeks to end instances of children \nlosing their Medicaid coverage just because they have a birthday. Our \nlegislation seeks to end instances of children in the same family \nhaving to meet different income standards.\n  We do this not by mandating States to expand their Medicaid Program. \nWe believe that by providing additional Federal money States will be \nable to move beyond their current eligibility levels. Our legislation \nwould also allow those States that have already exceeded 150 percent of \npoverty to receive an enhanced Federal match. This match would be for \nthose children they are already covering between 100 percent and 150 \npercent of poverty. We did not think it was fair to penalize those \nStates who have already tried to improve coverage for children.\n  A key way to expand the number of children enrolled in Medicaid is to \nguarantee eligibility for 12 months. Some 3 million children are \ncurrently eligible but not enrolled in the Medicaid Program. Some of \nthese children qualify for a few months of Medicaid coverage. But \nbecause of slight changes in their parents' income, they lose coverage \nover the course of the year. Our bill would require States to guarantee \n12 months of eligibility for all children on Medicaid as a condition of \nreceiving an enhanced Federal match.\n  Expansions of Medicaid in the late 1980's resulted in a decreased \nnumber of low birthweight babies, improved access to health care, a \ndecline in infant mortality rates, and millions more children in \nworking families with health insurance. We can build on these successes \nwith this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate and in the House in advancing this bill. I am excited at our \nopportunity to meet a very real and vital need of millions of America's \nchildren.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the children of America need our help. \nNearly 10 million children have no health insurance. Many of these \nchildren live in families with working parents who simply do not make \nenough money to afford health insurance.\n  In order to help address this national problem, I am pleased to \ncosponsor, with many of my good friends and colleagues, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Provides Security [CHIPS] Act. The CHIPS Act will \nprovide Federal financial incentives to encourage States to provide \nuniform Medicaid coverage up to 150 percent of poverty for children of \nall ages.\n  The Medicaid Program provides health care for poor children and \npregnant women. My home State of Vermont, through its Dr. Dynasaur \nprogram, uses Medicaid and is now ranked second best in the Nation in \nproviding health insurance coverage for children under 18 years of age.\n  We felt it was important to improve our existing Medicaid system, a \nsystem which is already in place and currently provides health coverage \nto 16 million low-income children. Three million additional children \nare eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, but they are just not \nenrolled. We should fix that problem.\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\n We also feel that it is important to provide incentives to expand \nMedicaid coverage nationally to the children of families who are at 150 \npercent of the Federal poverty level--the working poor. This \nlegislation builds upon the good work done in Vermont, and many other \nStates, in ensuring that our children have access to health care.\n  Our bill encourages States to expand current Medicaid eligibility for \nchildren and pregnant women to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level \nby increasing the amount of money that the Federal Government \ncontributes to the Medicaid Program. States that elect to participate \nin the program will need to guarantee that all children are covered to \nat least 100 percent of the Federal poverty level and that all children \nare provided with 12 months of continuous medical coverage.\n\n  The bill also provides grant money for outreach programs. States may \ndesign their own outreach programs based on their special needs and \nspecific populations. We will help by simplifying the application \nprocess for Medicaid and other Federal programs for which these \nchildren qualify. One third of all uninsured children are eligible but \nnot enrolled in Medicaid. Our bill, by emphasizing outreach and \nadministrative simplification, will help get many of these children \nenrolled in the Medicaid Program.\n  We must commit our efforts to giving children the best possible start \nin life. As a recent report entitled ``the Social Well-Being of \nVermonters'' indicates, the foundations we lay for our young children \nwill affect their later success in all areas of life. A healthy start \nbegins with a healthy pregnancy and early, comprehensive prenatal care. \nOur legislation will give many children the health insurance coverage \nthey need and, by doing so, help ensure a solid foundation for our \ncountry's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

RESOLUTION 80--REGARDING TACTICAL FIGHTER AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                               S. Res. 80\n\n       Whereas the Department of Defense has proposed to modernize \n     the United States tactical fighter aircraft force through \n     three tactical fighter procurement programs, including the F/\n     A-18 E/F aircraft program of the Navy, the F-22 aircraft \n     program of the Air Force, and the Joint Strike Fighter \n     aircraft program for the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps;\n       Whereas the General Accounting Office, the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, \n     and several Members of Congress have publicly stated that, \n     given the current Department of Defense budget for \n     procurement, the Department of Defense's plan to buy over \n     4,400 F/A-18 E/F aircraft, F-22 aircraft, and Joint Strike \n     Fighter aircraft at a total program cost in excess of \n     $350,000,000,000 is not affordable;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \n     current tactical aircraft plan of the Department of Defense \n     could cost as much as $14,000,000,000 to $18,000,000,000 per \n     fiscal year over the period of fiscal years 2002 through \n     2020, not considering inflation, compared to current tactical \n     aircraft funding of about $2,800,000,000 per fiscal year;\n       Whereas the Pentagon's current acquisition strategy would \n     require at least a 54.9 percent increase in annual \n     procurement spending over the next five years, rising from \n     $44,100,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to $68,300,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2002;\n       Whereas the F/A-18 E/F, F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter \n     tactical fighter programs will be competing for a limited \n     amount of procurement funding with numerous other aircraft \n     acquisition programs, including the Comanche helicopter \n     program, the V-22 Osprey aircraft program, and the C-17 \n     aircraft program, as well as for the necessary replacement of \n     other aging aircraft such as the KC-135, the C-5A, the F-117, \n     and the EA-6B aircraft; and\n       Whereas history shows that projection of the Department of \n     Defense regarding the number of aircraft that it will \n     procure, the rates at which those aircraft will be produced, \n     and the cost of those aircraft are rarely achieved, and in \n     fact frequently experience significant cost growth on the \n     order of 20 to 40 percent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     cannot afford to carry out all three of the F/A-18 E/F \n     aircraft program, the F-22 aircraft program, and the Joint \n     Strike Fighter aircraft program at the proposed acquisition \n     levels;\n       (2) the Department of Defense should reexamine its spending \n     priorities using more realistic assumptions of future \n     spending levels; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense should develop an alternative \n     acquisition strategy that would provide the United States \n     with an effective, affordable tactical fighter force \n     structure.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my senior \ncolleague, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, I rise today to submit a \nresolution calling for the restoration of fiscal responsibility to the \nDepartment of Defense's plan to modernize and upgrade our tactical \nfighter force.\n  The resolution I am submitting today, focuses on the Pentagon's \ncurrent acquisition strategy for three new tactical fighter programs; \nthe Air Force's F-22 Raptor, the Navy's F/A-18 E/F SuperHornet, and the \nmulti-service joint strike fighter. Numerous experts, including the \nCongressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office, have \nconcluded that given our current fiscal constraint and likely spending \nparameters, the current acquisition strategy is unrealistic, unwise, \nand untenable.\n  The administration's fiscal year 1998 proposal for defense spending \nprovides $250 billion in budget authority. According to projections \nprovided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the overall DOD budget is \nexpected to rise after fiscal year 1998 until reaching a plateau of \n$277.5 billion. That is pretty amazing.\n  Amazingly, while all other areas of Government are cutting back, the \nPentagon is anticipating a $27 billion peacetime increase over the next \n5 years.\n  The overall defense budget is comprised of several individual \nbudgets, including, among others, those for military personnel, \noperations and maintenance, military construction, and, of course, \nprocurement, which relates to the purchasing of new aircraft, weapons \nsystems, and technology.\n  It is the procurement budget that I would like to focus on for a \nmoment. The Pentagon's current procurement funding level for new \nweapons systems, ships, and aircraft in fiscal year 1997 is just over \n$44 billion.\n  But under the Defense Department's current acquisition plan, in order \nto achieve the projected purchasing levels of new aircraft and ships, \nprocurement funding will have to rise 55 percent, 55 percent Mr. \nPresident, over the next five years, until it reaches a level of $68.3 \nbillion.\n  Every other title within the Pentagon's budget request--whether we \nare talking about quality of life issues for service personnel or \nspending on research and development--every other title remains \nrelatively stagnant over the next 5 years.\n  No other program within the Pentagon's budget is receiving the sort \nof dramatic increase the procurement budget is slated to receive.\n  The need for additional procurement dollars--24 billion of them--is \nthe result of the Pentagon's planned purchase of some 4,440 new \ntactical fighter airplanes at a total price tag of at least $350 \nbillion according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The Defense Department argues that our fighter force is in need of \nmodernization and that as a percentage of the overall defense budget, \nprocurement spending is within historical norms.\n  It is true, Mr. President, that the Pentagon's projections place our \nlevel of aircraft acquisition at or slightly below where we were in the \n1980's, in terms of as a percentage of the overall defense budget.\n  But this omits the fact that the defense budget was an entirely \ndifferent creature in the 1980's than it is today. Thus, when the \nPentagon argues that the piece of the pie they are asking for today in \nterms of procurement spending is roughly the same as it was in the \n1980's, we must recognize that the size of the whole pie was profoundly \ngreater than it is today.\n  The procurement budget itself is comprised of a number of weapons \nsystems and technology programs, but the Pentagon's acquisition \nstrategy is dominated by the three tactical fighter aircraft proposals \ncurrently on the table.\n  This strategy includes three separate programs, all very expensive, \nall the subject of questions raised by budgetary and aviation experts, \nand all scheduled to move forward at unrealistic procurement levels.\n  We begin with the Navy's F/A-18 E/F SuperHornet program. This \naircraft is the followup to the F/A-18 C/D, currently employed by both \nthe Navy and the Marine Corps.\n  The F/A-18 is an all-weather, multi-mission strike fighter, and the \nNavy currently has about 580 in its inventory. Although the C/D \nperformed remarkably well in the gulf war and has the capability of \nachieving most of the Navy's requirements with some retrofitting, the \nPentagon is currently asking for 1,000 of the expensive E/F airplanes, \nat a projected cost of about $42 million per airplane. The F/A-18 E/F \nprogram has a cumulative cost of at least $67 billion and up to $89 \nbillion according to the General Accounting Office.\n  The second program belongs to the Air Force. It is the F-22 Raptor, a \nstealthy fighter intended to provide air superiority but at a \nextraordinary cost. This aircraft, which one Navy official referred to \nas ``gold-plated,'' will cost at least $71 million per airplane, with \nsome estimates reaching over $100 million per aircraft. In all, the F-\n22 program, slated to provide some 440 airplanes to the Air Force, will \ncost at least $70 billion.\n  The final program is one which is truly still in infancy. The joint \nstrike fighter, formally the Joint Advanced Strike Technology [JAST] \nProgram, is actually still on the drawing board with two major \ncontractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, dueling for what is expected \nto be at least a $219 billion contract--$219 billion, Mr. President. \nThat is some contract. And given the Pentagon's porous record keeping \nits aviation programs on schedule and on target, the costs of this \nprogram will likely surpass the initial $219 billion figure. The JSF is \nintended to be a joint-service, multipurpose aircraft tailored to each \nof the service's individual needs. The Navy variant will have carrier \nlanding and takeoff capabilities. The Marine Corps variant will have \nshort takeoff and vertical-landing capability. In all, the Pentagon \nexpects to purchase 3,000 joint strike fighters\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nover a 25-year period from 2005 through 2030. The Air Force would \npurchase about two-thirds of these planes, the Marine Corps about 640, \nand the Navy the remaining 300.\n\n  The JSF program has thus far received mixed reviews. On one hand is \nthe Pentagon's contention that these aircraft will be affordable \nbecause of commonality of components and high-volume production of an \nairplane capable of meeting each of the three services' differing \noperational requirements. On the other hand is the Pentagon's track \nrecord and the countless aviation programs that have promised so much \nin terms of cost savings and have delivered so little. In fact, the \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that the Pentagon's projections \nwith respect to aircraft procurement typically have cost overruns of 20 \nto 40 percent.\n  This, Mr. President, provides an overview of the Pentagon's current \nacquisition strategy with respect to tactical fighter aircraft. And \nalthough the resolution I am submitting today focuses on tactical \nfighters, it is important to mention a few of the other programs on the \nDefense Department's wish list, as these programs will also be drawing \non a limited procurement budget over the next few years.\n  There is the V-22 Osprey--a tilt-rotor aircraft to be used for troop \nand cargo transport, amphibious assault, and special operations--being \nbuilt primarily for the Marine Corps and Navy. This is a $46.6 billion \nprogram expected to produce some 523 aircraft.\n  There is the Comanche reconnaissance and attack helicopter for the \nArmy. The Pentagon expects to purchase close to 1,300 of these \nhelicopters at a total price tag of $25 billion. And the Air Force is \nasking for 80 C-17 cargo and transport airplanes, at a procurement cost \nof over $18 billion.\n  That Mr. President, is just the portion of the procurement budget \nrelated to aviation spending.\n  The Navy, for example, is looking to increase the procurement of \ntheir surface ships, starting with another aircraft carrier, CVN-77, \nand 17 of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers, as well as four new \nattack submarines. And in fiscal year 1999 the Navy would like to begin \nprocurement of the new San Antonio-class amphibious landing ships for \nour Marine expeditionary forces.\n  Mr. President, in recent months a number of respected experts on \nmilitary spending have warned the Department of Defense of an impending \nfiscal disaster.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle--even high-ranking \nPentagon officials--have all forewarned that the Defense Department \nwill not receive the procurement funding level it has projected and \nwill not be able to sustain these tactical fighter purchases at their \nplanned acquisition levels.\n  Unless we take a step back right now, in 1997, we will undoubtably \nhave what some have dubbed a train wreck, or maybe more appropriately, \na shipwreck, in the next few years.\n  I understand that many of my colleagues are either strong proponents \nor opponents of one or more of these individual fighter programs. The \nresolution I am submitting today does not target any one program for \ntermination--it does not even suggest that one of the programs should \nbe discontinued. The language in this resolution merely states that we \ndo not have now, nor will we have, the necessary available funding to \nmove forward with the purchasing of the number of fighter planes the \nPentagon currently has scheduled and given that, the Pentagon should \npresent to the Congress a more realistic acquisition strategy to take \nus into the next century.\n  In just 2 weeks or so, on May 15, the Pentagon is scheduled to \ndeliver a reassessment of our strategic blueprint for our Armed Forces, \nknown as the quadrennial defense review, or the QDR.\n  This is the first such reassessment since the 1993 Bottom-Up Review, \nand represents a collaborative effort on the part of the Secretary of \nDefense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the individual services to \nconduct a comprehensive review of our inventories and projected needs.\n\n  The upcoming QDR presents the Pentagon a timely opportunity to \nreexamine its spending priorities and make a reasoned determination \nabout what our tactical fighter force will realistically look like over \nthe next 20 years. I am hopeful that the Pentagon will use this \nopportunity to present an acquisition strategy to the Congress that is \naffordable, tenable, and consistent with the goal of Congress to \nachieve a balanced Federal budget in the coming years.\n  If not, I intend to offer the resolution I am submitting today, or a \nvariant of it, as an amendment to the budget resolution or other \nlegislation as part of an effort to force the Defense Department to \nunderstand the gravity of this situation. I hope such a step proves to \nbe unnecessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3852-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3853-S3854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 81--RELATIVE TO THE DENVER SUMMIT OF EIGHT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was submitted \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S. Res. 81\n\n       Whereas this is the first Economic Summit to be held in the \n     United States since the 1990 Economic Summit was held in \n     Houston, Texas;\n       Whereas on May 29, 1996, the State of Colorado was \n     announced as the host of the Group of Seven Economic Summit, \n     to be held on June 20 through 22, 1997;\n       Whereas the Economic Summit is an annual meeting that \n     brings together the leaders of the world's 7 most \n     economically successful democracies: Canada, France, Germany, \n     Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States;\n       Whereas this is the first Economic Summit to include the \n     transitioning economy of Russia, which has resulted in a new \n     reference to the Economic Summit as the Denver Summit of \n     Eight;\n       Whereas the central location of Denver among the summit \n     members, with Europe to the east, Japan to the west, and \n     central Canada to the north, enables the residents of \n     Colorado to serve as a central pillar supporting the \n     international bridge of friendship and prosperity;\n       Whereas the selection of the State of Colorado and the \n     Denver metropolitan region as the host of the Summit of Eight \n     reflects the region's growing economic importance in the \n     international community;\n       Whereas Colorado has distinguished itself as an ideal site \n     for the Summit of Eight because of its leading industries of \n     telecommunications, aerospace, biotechnology, high \n     technology, health care, education, agriculture, recreation, \n     and tourism;\n       Whereas Colorado's dedicated law enforcement officers, \n     firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and other public \n     servants are able and committed to provide vital support to \n     the Summit of Eight; and\n       Whereas the Summit of Eight promises to be 1 of the more \n     significant summits of recent years, with results that will \n     benefit the larger world community, including progress toward \n     relieving international debt, supporting the economic \n     development of Russia and the Ukraine, paving the way to \n     increased efficiencies in international commercial \n     transactions by reducing the regulatory barriers to \n     electronic banking, and minimizing destabilizing factors in \n     the world's financial markets: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its appreciation to the citizens of Colorado \n     and the Denver metropolitan region for hosting the Summit of \n     Eight; and\n       (2) accords recognition of the hospitality to be provided \n     by the people of Colorado and the Denver metropolitan region.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Senate to recognize the historic importance of the \nDenver summit of eight, and the contributions made by my home State of \nColorado and many Coloradans in hosting this historic summit.\n  This meeting marks a historic change in the G-7 summit. For the first \ntime in the 23-year history of these economic summits, Russia has been \nasked to participate to an unprecedented degree. At the Denver summit \nof eight, Russia will participate as a member, rather than as a passive \nobserver who in the past were only allowed to engage in a post-summit \ndialog with the G-7.\n  In this important substantive and symbolic step, President Yeltsin \nwill join with the leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations \nof Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United \nStates to discuss monetary and economic policy.\n  After this significant development was announced at the recent United \nStates-Russia summit, the name of the meeting was changed from G-7 to \nthe Denver summit of eight.\n  As Coloradans, we are proud to have such a distinguished group of \nleaders coming to our State. And, as an honorary chairman, along with \nSenator Allard and Congresswoman DeGette, I\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nam proud that Colorado was chosen to host this historically important \nmeeting.\n  The Denver area is symbolically important for being centrally located \nbetween our European partners to the east, our Japanese partner to the \nwest, and the Canadian partner to the north. Furthermore, the thriving \nindustries in Colorado and the robust economy of the Denver area \nreflect the growing economic importance of Colorado in the \ninternational arena.\n  The Denver area is a recognized leader in aerospace, \ntelecommunications, biotechnology, high technology, health care, \neducation, recreation, and tourism. We are proud to share these \nachievements with the rest of the global community.\n  I would also like to commend those dedicated Coloradans who serve as \nlaw enforcement officials, emergency medical technicians, firefighters, \nand health care providers, as well as the countless volunteers, who \nwill provide invaluable services and contributions in support of the \nsummit. Given the importance of this meeting, they have been working \nhard on their preparations to help ensure that the summit will proceed \nsmoothly. This summit would not be possible without their donations of \ntime, hospitality, and commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3853-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrue Kentucky legend. Triple Crown winners have a special place in \nevery thoroughbred racing fan's heart, especially those of us who are \nlucky enough to have enjoyed their successes.\n  The last favorite to win the derby and the only undefeated triple \ncrown champion in history, Seattle Slew came into the famed mile and a \nquarter race full of promise. Overcoming a disastrous start, the big \nbay righted himself and headed for the front where he would remain for \nthe rest of the race, securing the first of the three jewels he would \ncollect during the spring of 1977.\n  A mere 11 horses in history have won the triple crown, with only 3 \naccomplishing the feat since 1948. Select company indeed. If horse \nracing is the sport of kings then Seattle Slew is truly one of its \nemperors.\n  Some may think the champion stallion now lives the ``Life of Riley'' \nat Robert and Alice Clay's Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, KY. But, \nSeattle Slew did not stop setting records when his racing days were \nbehind him, a fact I know the Clay family is eternally grateful for. He \nhas sired dozens of champions who have racked up almost $50 million in \ncareer earnings.\n  The world recognizes that Three Chimneys is known for its champions, \nbut even among the daunting lineup stabled in Midway, Seattle Slew \nstands out.\n  So, here's to the Clays, Three Chimneys, and most importantly one of \nthe great legends in sport, Seattle Slew. As I grow older, 20 years \nseems like a very brief time, but it has been more than long enough for \nthis great stallion to leave his indelible mark on the sport and those \nwho love him.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the April 27 Lexington \nHerald Leader be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 27, 1997]\n\n                           A Champion Endures\n\n                            (By Mark Story)\n\n       He had no reason to be a champion.\n       In a sport where pedigree is everything, Seattle Slew was a \n     commoner, the son of an unproven, unknown sire (Bold \n     Reasoning) who would die not long after Slew's birth.\n       He was born deformed, ``turned out in front,'' which meant \n     at least one of his legs was not correctly aligned to the \n     rest of his body.\n       In his first year of life, he was so awkward his handlers \n     nicknamed him ``Baby Huey'' after the accident-prone cartoon \n     character.\n       Only by a freak of nature could such a horse aspire to \n     greatness.\n       But in the world of racing, freaks do occur.\n       Twenty years ago this spring, Seattle Slew stamped himself \n     with racing immortality.\n       Overcoming one obstacle after another, he became the only \n     horse ever to win the Triple Crown--the Kentucky Derby, the \n     Preakness and the Belmont--with an unbeaten record.\n       Then, after almost dying from a mysterious viral illness, \n     he returned to the track as a 4-year-old and re-established \n     his legend, defeating 1978 Triple Crown champion Affirmed \n     along the way.\n       As a sire, Slew has also attained greatness, producing \n     champions such as 1984 Derby winner Swale, Slew o' Gold and \n     Capote. The legendary Cigar is a Seattle Slew grandson, as is \n     Pulpit, one of the favorites for this year's Derby.\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\n       At 23, Slew shows little sign of slowing down. He continues \n     to be a productive sire, commanding a $100,000 stud fee while \n     standing at Three Chimneys Farm.\n       Not a bad life's work for a freak.\n       ``This horse is all heart, every bit heart,'' said Mickey \n     Taylor, one of Slew's owners during his racing days and his \n     syndicate manager now. ``He tried his best at everything we \n     ever asked him to do. And he had the talent to do about \n     anything we asked.''\n\n\n                           an obstacle course\n\n       For Seattle Slew, nothing ever came easily.\n       His trip through the Triple Crown was an epic tale of \n     problems overcome.\n       Derby obstacle. Sent off as the 1-2 favorite by a Derby \n     crowd of 124,038, he very nearly lost the race in the \n     starting gate.\n       Fractious in the gate, Slew was caught flat-footed when it \n     opened. He nearly reared coming out of the gate, came very \n     close to making a sideways start and alarmingly near to \n     throwing jockey Jean Cruguet.\n       Before he ever started running, he was five lengths behind \n     the field.\n       In the Churchill Downs owner's boxes, Mickey Taylor put \n     down his binoculars.\n       ``I wished we were anyplace else in the world at that \n     moment,'' he said last week. ``I thought we were cooked.''\n       On the track, Cruguet didn't feel much better. But the \n     French jockey made a snap decision. He asked Slew for \n     everything he had. ``It was do or die,'' Cruguet said last \n     week. ``It was easy to decide for me: We had to go.''\n       And go Slew did.\n       Flying toward the front, he bulled through horses and, \n     miraculously, was within a head of the leader, For The \n     Moment, after a quarter mile.\n       More miraculously, Slew did not tire after his sprint to \n     the front. He won by 1\\3/4\\ lengths over Run Dusty Run.\n       The win was sweet vindication for Slew trainer Billy \n     Turner. Early on, Turner had decided never to ask Seattle \n     Slew to do too much in training. He was afraid if he worked \n     him too hard, the horse's natural inclination toward speed \n     would become dominant and Slew would never develop the \n     stamina required to run Classic distances.\n       This was a courageous, disciplined training decision--and \n     one widely second-guessed in the weeks leading up to the '77 \n     Derby. The joke was that Turner was ``walking Slew up to the \n     Derby.''\n       It took guts to stay with it.\n       ``This was a very fast horse,'' Cruguet said. ``A lot of \n     people would have burnt him up. Billy did a very good job \n     getting him to stretch out and run distances.''\n       Preakness obstacle. But speed was the problem in the \n     Preakness. A talented, fresh speed horse, Cormorant, would \n     try Slew at Pimlico after skipping the Derby.\n       Cormorant's connections were so confident they showed up in \n     Baltimore sporting ``Slew Who?'' T-shirts.\n       Then Cormorant drew the inside post position, the place to \n     be on a Pimlico track with tight turns and a bias toward \n     speed.\n       In the race, Cormorant beat Slew to the front and to the \n     rail. He then held his spot, forcing Seattle Slew to race him \n     around the track on the outside.\n       So Cruguet and Slew dug in. They hooked Cormorant in a \n     withering speed duel, running the fastest mile (1:34\\4/5\\) in \n     Preakness history.\n       Cormorant wilted; Slew didn't, and finished the race 1\\1/2\\ \n     lengths ahead of Iron Constitution.\n       Belmont obstacle. In the Belmont, the problem was supposed \n     to be distance. Many thought Slew was not bred to run 1\\1/2\\ \n     miles. But that turned out to be a breeze; the problem was \n     traffic--not horses on the track, but cars parked around the \n     track. There were so many that Seattle Slew could not get to \n     the track.\n       When he finally made it, the race was almost an anticlimax. \n     Slew controlled the pace from the front and easily defeated \n     Run Dusty Run by 4 lengths.\n       The 10th Triple Crown winner, Slew was the only one who was \n     undefeated at the time he won.\n\n\n                           off-the-track woes\n\n       Seattle Slew's racing brilliance was nearly matched by the \n     turbulence that would engulf his owners and handlers over the \n     years.\n       At the time of the Kentucky Derby, Karen Taylor, Mickey's \n     wife, was listed as the owner.\n       A former flight attendant, Karen Taylor became a media \n     darling in the spring of 1977 for her unassuming ways. ``I \n     live in a mobile home and I drive a pickup truck,'' she said \n     then, ``but I've got a hell of a horse.''\n       But by the time the horse ran in the Belmont, it had become \n     public that the ownership of Seattle Slew was more complex.\n       It turned out the horse was actually owned through a \n     corporation (Wooden Horse Investments Inc.) by the pension \n     and profit-sharing plans of Dr. James Hill and a logging \n     company owned by Mickey Taylor, Karen's husband.\n       Hill, at the time a New York-based veterinarian, had helped \n     the Taylors pick out Seattle Slew at the 1975 Fasig-Tipton \n     yearling sale.\n       As an act of friendship, they say now, the Taylors \n     eventually made Hill a half-owner in Seattle Slew.\n       New York racing officials looked askance at Slew's \n     ownership structure.\n       In court documents from a subsequent lawsuit, Taylor and \n     Hill maintained that ownership of Seattle Slew was set up as \n     it was for tax reasons.\n       But in New York, it was against the rules for a practicing \n     veterinarian to have ownership in a horse. The rationale was \n     that it created at least the appearance of a conflict of \n     interest if a vet were treating horses who might race against \n     a horse he owned.\n       On August 25 of '77, New York racing officials suspended \n     Hill for 30 days. He called the suspension unjust, but did \n     not appeal.\n       For the ``Slew Crew,'' as the horse's connnections were \n     called, the trouble was just beginning.\n       After the Belmont, trainer Turner announced that Slew would \n     be taking several months off from training. He even had the \n     racing shoes taken off the horse's hooves.\n       But in a controversial decision, the owners overruled him \n     and decided to race Seattle Slew in the $300,000 Swaps Stakes \n     at Hollywood Park in July.\n       The race was a disaster.\n       Sent off as the 1-5 favorite, Slew never fired and was \n     humiliated, finishing a badly beaten fourth, 16 lengths \n     behind winner J.O. Tobin.\n       To this day, the Taylors maintain that Turner signed off on \n     shipping Slew west, but the trainer was widely quoted after \n     the race saying that was untrue. In one interview, he called \n     it ``the dumbest thing I ever heard.''\n       ``After the Belmont, (Seattle Slew) was dead,'' Cruguet \n     said, ``. . . The owners, they thought he was a machine.''\n       Cruguet said he knew after a quarter mile that he was on a \n     beaten horse. ``This horse had never lost,'' Cruguet said. \n     ``It was not a good feeling.''\n       From that day on, things were never the same for the \n     original ``Slew Crew.''\n       By December of 1977, the owners had fired Turner. The sides \n     could never heal the breach over the decision to ship west.\n       Eventually, Turner would sue the owners, claiming they \n     reneged on a promise to give him a lucrative lifetime \n     breeding share in Seattle Slew.\n       Shortly after Turner was fired, Seattle Slew almost died.\n       For four days in January of '78, the horse ran a fever. For \n     a time, he refused to eat or drink. His bodily functions \n     ceased. A low white blood cell count suggested a serious \n     infection.\n       His owners were distraught. Karen Taylor would cradle the \n     ill horse's head on her lap, and sing him lullabies.\n       ``Ninety-nine percent of horses would have died,'' Mickey \n     Taylor said.\n       Slew didn't. In fact, he recovered and returned to the \n     track to win five of seven races as a 4-year-old (both losses \n     were in photo finishes). He added to his legacy by defeating \n     Affirmed and was 1978's Champion Older Horse.\n       What almost killed Slew? Mickey Taylor said he knows, but \n     will not reveal it until Seattle Slew's career at stud is \n     finished. He did say the horse was not poisoned.\n       But even after Seattle Slew's racing career ended, the \n     turmoil among his ``Crew'' did not. By 1992, the owners were \n     suing each other.\n       Once, Hill and Taylor had been so close that Hill said they \n     did not need a contract to do business: ``A handshake with a \n     man I trust'' was enough, he said.\n       In 1992, Hill filed suit against Taylor, claiming that \n     Taylor had, among other things, siphoned money from their \n     corporation, used corporation money to buy houses for family \n     members and hired and overpaid his relatives.\n       In November of '93, a jury in Lexington found for Hill and \n     awarded him $4.4 million.\n       Now, the Taylors said they do not speak with the Hills.\n       ``There really isn't much there to be said,'' Karen Taylor \n     said.\n\n\n                      `it's almost like he knows'\n\n       Today, Seattle Slew occupies a 16 16 stall in the main \n     stallion barn at Three Chimneys Farm.\n       Among those quartered with him are two of his sons, Slew O' \n     Gold and Capote as well as such well-known horses as Arazi \n     and Wild Again.\n       Even at 23, Slew boasts the top stud fee at the farm \n     ($100,000). ``He's one of the most potent horses we have,'' \n     said Three Chimneys Stallion Manager Wes Lanter.\n       As a sire, Slew has emerged as clearly superior to the \n     other two modern Triple Crown winners, Secretariat and \n     Affirmed.\n       ``It's not even close,'' said William Munn, a thoroughbred \n     pedigree expert based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n       Seattle Slew has had success on both sides of his line. He \n     sired another Kentucky Derby winner, Swale (1984) and another \n     Horse of the year, A.P. Indy (1992). On the other side, \n     Cigar, who tied Citation's North American record with 16 \n     straight wins, was the son of a Seattle Slew mare.\n       Though there are no guarantees in the world of horse \n     health, farm officials think Slew has a good chance to live \n     into his 30s.\n       Many of Seattle Slew's days start about 7 a.m., when he is \n     saddled and ridden around the all-weather track at Three \n     Chimneys, where he has stood at stud since 1985.\n       (Continuing his knack for finding off-the-track turmoil, \n     Seattle Slew began his stallion career at the ill-fated \n     Spendthrift Farm, which collapsed financially in 1988).\n       It is fairly unusual for horses standing at stud to be \n     ridden, but Three Chimneys rides all its stallions.\n       ``We think it keeps them healthy, and we think it keeps \n     them happy,'' said Farm Manager Dan Rosenberg.\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\n       The man who knows Slew better than anyone, his groom of 15 \n     years, Tom Wade, says Slew hasn't changed much over the \n     years. He has a touch of arthritis and his back has drooped \n     just a bit. ``But he's a fit horse,'' Wade said. ``You can \n     look at him and see that.''\n       Now, as the 20th anniversary of his Triple Crown \n     approaches, Judy DeHaan, the exercise rider at Three \n     Chimneys, has noticed something funny about Slew.\n       ``It's almost like he knows,'' she said. ``He's gotten a \n     little spring in his step again. Lately, it's like `Hold on \n     Judy. We're gonna go.'\n       ``Even at 23, on his good days, he's still got \n     it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3854-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PAYMENT OF LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with over \n1,400 of my constituents from Minnesota who have signed a petition \ncalling for the payment of all of the United States' legal obligations \nto the United Nations by the immediate payment of all dues in arrears. \nI agree with my constituents that it is embarrassing that the United \nStates, the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, expects the \nUnited Nations to provide peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in response \nto the world's conflicts but does not honor its financial \nresponsibility to the United Nations.\n  With several billion dollars of uncollected dues, the United Nations \nis now in dire straits. Consequently, it must borrow from scarce funds \nallocated for peacekeeping operations simply to pay staff salaries and \nto meet its other financial obligations.\n  Of the unpaid dues approximately half are owed by the United States. \nRather than providing other U.N. members with an example of \ninternational responsibility, our Nation is doing just the opposite. \nThis makes the United Nations increasingly incapable of carrying out \nnumerous tasks that are clearly in our Nation's interest but that we \nourselves are either unable or unwilling to perform.\n  I ask that the cover letter sent to me by the Minnesota Alliance of \nPeacemakers and the World Federalists Association with the petitions on \nthis important issue be printed in the Record.\n  The cover letter follows:\n\n                                     World Federalist Association,\n\n\n                                            Minnesota Chapter,\n\n                                  Minneapolis, MN, April 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We, the undersigned representatives \n     of the Minnesota Alliance of Peacemakers and of the Minnesota \n     Chapter of the World Federalist Association, are honored by \n     your willingness to meet with us in respect to some matters \n     that bear closely on your duties as a member of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee. That assignment is, in our view, \n     among the most important that any member of the Senate could \n     receive, given the complex and increasing political, \n     economic, and ecological interdependencies within our ever-\n     shrinking planet.\n       While the world looks to the United States for leadership \n     in this period of transition to a new post-Cold War era, we \n     believe that, it would like to see such leadership exercised \n     within the context of the United Nations System. However, as \n     you are well aware, the viability of that system has been \n     seriously jeopardized because of the non-payment or late \n     payment of dues by many member nations. The principal debtor, \n     by far, is the United States. This country's failure to meet \n     its legal obligations as a UN member sets a deplorable \n     example for others and is not a proper way to exercise \n     leadership. Rather, it tarnishes the good name of the United \n     States in the international community and diminishes our \n     effectiveness in world affairs. For this reason, among \n     others, we submit to you copies of petitions signed by 1417 \n     Minnesotans calling on the United States to pay its current \n     and back dues to the UN promptly and in full. The collection \n     of these signatures is the result of a local drive by the \n     Minnesota Chapter and a recent national drive by the national \n     organization of the World Federalists Association, on the \n     occasion of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. This \n     initiative is consistent with one of the accompanying policy \n     positions adopted by the Minnesota Alliance of Peacemakers on \n     November 12, 1996. A copy of those proposals has already been \n     forwarded to your office. The Alliance, be it noted, is a \n     coalition of twenty-seven peace and justice organizations \n     whose combined membership approaches 10,000 concerned and \n     politically active citizens.\n       We hope and trust that you will weigh our views carefully \n     in the respective proceedings of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee and wish you much success and courage in the all \n     important arena of foreign policy.\n           Respectfully yours,\n         The Rev.

Mr. President, founded in 1847, Plymouth Church \nof Brooklyn, NY, has made significant contributions to the Nation. The \nchurch building, designated in 1963 by the U.S. Department of the \nInterior as a national historic landmark, was known as the ``Grand \nCentral Depot of the Underground Railroad'' because of the antislavery \nactivities of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher and the congregation.\n  Reverend Beecher was familiar with the horrors of slavery auctions \nfrom his own observation and from experiences of members of his family, \nincluding his sister Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote ``Uncle Tom's \nCabin.'' Thus, on several occasions between 1848 and 1860, he conducted \nwell-publicized mock slave auctions at Plymouth Church with the results \nthat the congregation secured the freedom of the slaves and he \ndemonstrated to the Nation the barbarity of selling people who had been \ncreated, according to the Bible, ``in the image of God.'' These \nauctions helped create a pro-abolitionist consensus in the North.\n  In February of 1860, Abraham Lincoln, then relatively unknown east of \nthe Appalachians, was invited to speak at Plymouth Church. At the last \nmoment, the location of the speech was changed to Cooper Union where \nLincoln made an address which introduced him to the eastern United \nStates which, in turn, led to his nomination for the Presidency less \nthan 3 months later. Lincoln worshiped at Plymouth Church on two \noccasions, the only times he attended church services in New York \nState.\n  Following the end of the Civil War, the congregation of Plymouth \nChurch supported the position that women and black men should have the \nright to vote. Even after the 15th amendment to the Constitution gave \nnewly emancipated black men the right to vote, Plymouth Church \ncontinued to advocate for the right of women to vote. Reverend Beecher \nwas the only man ever to serve as president of the American Suffrage \nSociety.\n  Reverend Beecher left an impact on other areas of American cultural \nlife. He was among the first religious leaders in the United States to \nembrace Darwin's theory of evolution and Spencer's theories of social \nevolution. He was an early advocate of Jewish-Christian dialog and of \ngiving public standing to Judaism as a major American faith group.\n  Because the church was for many years the largest and best known \npublic building in Brooklyn, many notable persons have spoken there, \nincluding Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, \nClara Barton, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mark Twain, \nwho described Plymouth Church's 1867 grand tour of Europe and the Holy \nLand in his book ``Innocents Abroad,'' also spoke there.\n  In 1934, Plymouth Church and neighboring Church of the Pilgrims \nmerged to form Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims.

Mr. President, I rise today to note the passing of \nEdith Pratt ``Patty'' Masterson. She died Sunday, April 20, 1997, at \nthe age of 75.\n  Ms. Masterson was very active in Virginia politics, and her \ncontributions to Virginia were noted in the Virginia Pilot newspaper in \nNorfolk. I ask that a February 16, 1997, article from the Virginia \nPilot be included in the Record.\n  As the article indicates, for the past 6 years Ms. Masterson was \nactive in public life as the chief lobbyist for Virginians Against \nHandgun Violence. Her most prominent victory with that organization was \nthe passage of the one gun per month law in Virginia in 1992. Gun \nviolence is a scourge that threatens the lives of our young people, and \nsimply for her efforts to end gun violence, Ms. Masterson deserved \nrecognition and high praise.\n  But Ms. Masterson's lengthy and remarkable public life, which began \nmore than half a century ago, also deserves recognition. In the 1940's \nMs. Masterson became the first woman to argue a case before the South \nCarolina Supreme Court, and she won her case. She also raised five \nchildren and later she went on to teach for 35 years. John Casteen, now \nthe president of the University of Virginia, stated Ms. Masterson was \nthe ``best teacher I've ever seen.'' Ms. Masterson's participation in a \nvariety of civic and educational organizations continued during her \nlast years, and in 1991 she was named Hampton Roads Pioneer Woman of \nthe Year.\n   Mr. President, I commend to this body and the American people the \nlife and public service of Ms. Edith Pratt Masterson.\n  The article follows:\n\n     [From the Virginian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star, Feb. 16, 1997.]\n\n               Patty Masterson: a Virginia-Made Activist\n\n                           (By Margaret Edds)\n\n       The volume is thick as a phone book and appropriately \n     covered in red. ``Only in Virginia--1996,'' the title reads, \n     calling to mind the state's proud promotional slogan, ``Made \n     in Virginia.''\n       But the handiwork recorded in this fresh-off-the-copying-\n     machine document is no cause for civic pride. The 200-page \n     compilation is of 1996 Virginia newspaper clippings that \n     feature guns and bloodshed. The sampling of Virginia murders, \n     woundings, accidents and suicides is representative but \n     incomplete.\n       Pages contain up to five clippings each, gathered by \n     volunteers across the state. Virginians Against Handgun \n     Violence oversaw the project. The League of Women Voters \n     helped. The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington \n     contributed. It is a chilling work.\n       ``When it was clear last year that we were going to have \n     absolutely nothing (in terms of gun-control legislation), it \n     occurred to me that if you could clip all the events \n     involving bloodshed by firearms, not the burglaries or the \n     robberies, it might make an impression,'' said Patty \n     Masterson, a retired Norfolk Academy English teacher who \n     conceived the volume and last week helped distribute it \n     around Capitol Square.\n       She was right. The page-after-page drumbeat of tragedy is \n     first startling, then compelling, then exhausting. One of the \n     women who provided clippings from the Richmond area recently \n     quit. It was too disspiriting an exercise, she said.\n       This is the sixth winter since Masterson, then newly \n     retired from the classroom, adopted the cause of handgun \n     control and moved from Virginia Beach to a Richmond hotel \n     room for a two-month vigil. As a volunteer lobbyist for \n     Virginians Against Handgun Violence, she has become a fixture \n     in the legislative halls, brightening committee rooms with \n     her white hair, knit sweaters and welcoming smile.\n       In this role, Masterson has brought to bear all the skills \n     that have sustained her through an adventurous 74 years--\n     creativity, passion, good sense. The combination helped make \n     her one of the first female attorneys in South Carolina, a \n     Navy wife and enthusiastic mother of five, a popular teacher \n     for 35 years and the force behind a series of seminars on how \n     children learn.\n       But those characteristics have yet to penetrate the mass \n     consciousness in the Virginia General Assembly. Masterson's \n     most thrilling moments in Richmond were among her first. In \n     the 1992 session, with then-Gov. L. Douglas Wilder leading \n     the charge, lawmakers limited over-the-counter handgun sales \n     to one per person per month.\n       ``We did nothing to create it,'' Masterson said recently of \n     the law, ``but we had the fun of surfing in with it.'' Since \n     then, Masterson and her gun-control colleagues have learned \n     both the importance of having a governor in your corner and \n     the frustration of going up against a lobby as entrenched as \n     the National Rifle Association. Last year, all of the major \n     legislation they supported died. This year, two of the three \n     bills Masterson cared most about were not even heard in \n     committee.\n       Her response, like a schoolmarm with a class of sluggards, \n     has been to search for new ways to make lawmakers sit up and \n     take notice. ``Only in Virginia'' is one result. Masterson \n     believes anyone who takes time to peruse its headlines--\n     ``Father Shot on Way Home,'' ``Boy, 5, Shoots Mother With \n     Father's Rifle,'' ```My Only Son,' Mother says after \n     Slaying,''--must be moved to act.\n       Her commitment does not blind her to the limitations of gun \n     control. ``Even if the sale of handguns to civilians were \n     stopped here and now, we'd still have problems because of the \n     millions of handguns out there,'' Masterson acknowledged. But \n     she also recognizes the consequences of inaction. ``It can \n     only get worse if we do nothing.''\n       Not surprisingly, the shootings that Masterson most \n     deplores are those involving domestic violence and children \n     who accidentially set off guns. Such deaths or woundings \n     ``seem so unnecessary,'' she said. ``To me, they are products \n     of a proliferation of handguns.''\n       At a minimum, she believes, gun sales should be limited to \n     storefront transactions or--with private sales--to law-\n     enforcement offices; purchasers should be required to take \n     gun-safety courses, and trigger-locks should be required on \n     guns.\n       As a student of human development, she also believes that \n     society should do much more to guard against the eruption of \n     violence. Gun-control advocates are ``dealing with the \n     tippity, tippity, tip of the iceberg,'' she said. Those \n     working with preschool education and domestic relationships \n     are closer to the core of the problem.\n       Legislative victories or no, what keeps her going is ``a \n     passion for living, for learning, learning, learning,'' she \n     said. It's an attitude that qualifies Masterson as a state \n     treasure, Made In Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3857-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3857-S3858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CYBER-CHATS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over a year ago, I began having \nonline computer chats with students from around my home State of \nVermont. These chats have been a lot of fun and very informative. The \nquestions that the students have asked me reflect not only their \ninterest in government and current events, but also the advantages that \nthey have in terms of access to knowledge via the information \nsuperhighway.\n  Just 3 or 4 years ago, I could not have imagined coming back from a \nvote on the Senate floor, sitting down in front of my computer and \nhaving a conversation with a group of young Vermonters over 500 miles \naway. The advances in technology have amazed me, but so have the \nunderstanding students have about technology and what it means for all \nof our futures.\n  Students' questions have ranged from my legislation to protect the \nprivacy of our online communications to United States policy toward \nIraq to how to get them out of their next period math test. While I \nwill never be able to help a student skip a math test, these \ndiscussions have convinced me of the thirst of our children for the \nopportunities these technologies represent and our responsibility as \nleaders to help provide them\n  Last week, I had the unique opportunity to chat with students from \none of the Nation's oldest running one-room schoolhouses in Granville, \nVT. I\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nask that the transcript from this chat be printed in the Record as \ntestimony of the wonders of Internet technology and, more important, of \nour Nation's youth.\n  I also want to thank Shannon Roland, the teacher at Granville, for \nher work in preparing these exceptional students. She should be \ncommended for bringing their education outside of and beyond the walls \nof a one-room schoolhouse.\n  The transcript follows:\n\n       Oneroom 1. Glad to be here. I am now surrounded by 17 \n     beautiful first through fourth graders, aged 7 to 10. AP and \n     Channel 22 are also here. Hello Senator.\n       Patrick L. I wish I could be there with you in person but \n     we are all excited in Washington to be doing this.\n       Oneroom 1. We are too. Jack has a question for you. Have \n     you ever seen a land mine?\n       Patrick L. I am not the world's best typist so I apologize \n     if I make some mistakes.\n       Oneroom 1. That's fine. We're learning too.\n       Patrick L. I have seen landmines all over the world and \n     have two deactivated ones on my desk. They are horrible \n     weapons that should all be banned. They kill mostly children \n     and innocent civilians.\n       Oneroom 1. Brian wonders if you've ever seen the Granville \n     School web page.\n       Patrick L. Love the picture of the school on the front. Who \n     is the student?\n       Oneroom 1. That's a picture of Benny. He's going to be a \n     bug scientist. Dylan asks, where do you live?\n       Patrick L. I live on a tree farm that belonged to my \n     parents in Middlesex, Vermont. I drive down route 100 often.\n       Patrick L. I also have a house in the Washington area where \n     I live when the Senate is in session.\n       Oneroom 1. Brooke wonders if you might stop by our school \n     sometime.\n       Patrick L. I would like to drop by sometime. Unfortunately \n     we are often in session while you are in school and you are \n     out when I get home to Vermont for the weekend. After seeing \n     your web page I am especially eager to drop by.\n       Oneroom 1. We'll be going to school on Memorial Day if \n     you're around. We've had lots of snowdays. Harlie wonders if \n     you know any of the children who were killed by landmines.\n       Patrick L. I have visited a lot of hospitals around the \n     world where we use the Leahy War Victims Fund. My wife is a \n     registered nurse and I have watched her help with some of the \n     children who have been injured. It is a real tragedy and it \n     has to stop.\n       Oneroom 1. We agree. Benny (the boy in the picture) wonders \n     what you do in your free time.\n       Patrick L. Benny I try to cross country ski around my farm \n     during the winter and hike there during the summer when I am \n     home. I am also an avid photographer and bring a camera with \n     me almost everywhere I go even to meetings at the White \n     House.\n       Patrick L. Benny you look great in the photo!\n       Oneroom 1. We like to cross country ski. In fact, we had \n     lessons here all winter. Sammi wonders if you have ever been \n     to a one room schoolhouse. We think you would like to meet \n     our teacher because she's really nice. [Picture].\n       Patrick L. I think you are very fortunate to have Shannon \n     as your teacher. I have not been in a one room schoolhouse \n     since I was a child but it seems to me you are getting a \n     better education than a lot of very large schoolhouses.\n       Oneroom 1. We think so too. We're going to Boston to the \n     museum and the aquarium for our school field trip. Jasmine \n     wonders when you started being a senator.\n       Patrick L. The field trip sounds great. I did one like that \n     when I was 12 and still remember it. Jasmine I became a \n     Senator when I was 34. That was in 1975.\n       Oneroom 1. Erica asks, have you ever lost a law you wanted?\n       Patrick L. Many times, Erica, I will push for legislation \n     that doesn't pass the first time around but we keep working \n     until it does. One example is the Northeast Dairy Compact. At \n     first it failed but finally passed and will help the dairy \n     farmers in Vermont.\n       Oneroom 1. Christopher is also concerned about landmines. \n     He wonders where most of them are.\n       Patrick L. Most of the landmines, Christopher, are in \n     Africa.\n       Oneroom 1. Dylan says that it scared him too. Brooke says \n     her favorite book is ``Anne of Green Gables.'' Sammi wonders \n     if you can make a link from your site to our web page.\n       Oneroom 1. Brian wonders if that's your wife skating with \n     you in the picture on your web page.\n       Patrick L. Sammi we will link it with the transcript and a \n     couple drawing. Dylan I know what you mean and Brooke I liked \n     that one too and read it to my children when they were young.\n       Oneroom 1. All of the children say thank you for taking the \n     time to do this. This is cool to talk back and forth like \n     this. And it's neat the way we can send questions and have \n     you answer them. Thank you very much. We have to go to recess \n     now.\n       Patrick L. Brian that is my wife Marcelle with me and it \n     was taken on one of the fields at our farm in Middlesex--just \n     a ways up route 100.\n       Patrick L. Thanks--wish I could go to recess with you but \n     instead will head to the Senate floor. I am very proud of all \n     of you and thank you!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3857-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED, NEGOTIATE PEACE IN ZAIRE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Zaire must seize the current moment \nto avoid further bloodshed and negotiate a peaceful resolution to its \ncurrent crisis. A tentative agreement for a meeting on Friday between \nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila has \nbeen reached. This meeting is critical to avoid further loss of human \nlife in Zaire. I applaud Ambassador Richardson's presence in Zaire and \nfully support his important and courageous efforts to facilitate a \npeaceful settlement to the current political turmoil.\n  The current crisis in Zaire has reached a critical fork in the road. \nIn one direction lies the peaceful path of democracy and economic \nreform. In the other, the well-worn road of violence, bloodshed, and \npolitical instability. President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance \nleader Laurent Kabila at this moment hold the fate of their country in \ntheir hands.\n  I strongly encourage President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to earnestly \nengage in a critical dialog on the future of Zaire. I urge them to put \nthe interests of Zaire and their countrymen first, and resolve the \ncurrent political crisis without further unnecessary loss of life.\n  I have been deeply troubled by recent reports of wide-spread human \nrights abuses and mass killings of refugees and displaced persons in \nrebel-controlled Zaire. There are numerous accounts of desperately ill \nand malnourished women and children being indiscriminately slaughtered \nand maimed.\n  Recently 55,000 refugees have inexplicably disappeared from a refugee \ncamp outside Kisangani. Of these refugees, some 9,000, including 2,500 \nseverely malnourished children, had only days earlier been deemed \nmedically unfit to travel by visiting relief workers.\n  After a week of repeatedly denying the United Nations to care for and \nrepatriate refugees in rebel-controlled territory, today's news reports \nindicate the rebel Alliance is once again allowing the United Nations \nto care for the sick and the dying. Refusal to have given access to the \nUnited Nations over the past week, resulting in the maltreatment of \nrefugees and displaced persons has been nothing short of deplorable.\n  I call upon Mr. Kabila to put a permanent end to the bloodletting of \ninnocents in Eastern Zaire. All impediments to humanitarian relief \nefforts in Zaire must be permanently removed.\n  The United Nations must be permitted continued full access to these \nrefugees and allowed to repatriate them to Rwanda without interference. \nFurthermore, the slaughter of those refugees suspected of \nresponsibility for the 1994 Rwandan genocide must cease, as it is \nneither justifiable nor defensible. These people must be returned to \nRwanda where they can stand trial in an appropriate court of law and \nrightly be held accountable for their crimes.\n  It is time for President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to signal their \nwillingness to set Zaire on the path to peace and democracy. Zaire is a \ncountry of enormous potential that has suffered untold tragedies. \nFailure to seize this critical opportunity to negotiate peace in Zaire \nwill only set that country woefully back.\n  The fighting in Zaire must stop. The crisis in the country cannot be \nresolved by force. Replacement of the Mobutu regime with yet another \nauthoritarian regime is a recipe of further political instability. I \nstrongly urge both President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to seize the current \nopportunity to avoid further bloodshed and choose the constructive path \nof peace and democracy in Zaire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3858-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3858-S3859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMENDING TITLES XVIII AND XIX OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Therefore, additional votes could occur other \nthan votes on the Volunteer Protection Act during tomorrow's session.\n  In addition, if the Appropriations Committee completes action on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill tomorrow, it is the intention of the \nmajority leader that the Senate proceed to consideration of the \nsupplemental on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/senate-section/article/S3859-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
