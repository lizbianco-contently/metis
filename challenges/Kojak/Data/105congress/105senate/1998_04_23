The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this amendment Members will be voting on \nshortly simply adds an incentive to the current deduction that is \nallowed for individuals making contributions to tax-exempt \norganizations that provide scholarships for low-income children.\n  Currently it is 100 percent deductible. We are adding an additional \n10 percent incentive so that these organizations, of which currently \nmore than 30 exist around the country, can receive additional funds \nthrough this incentive so that they can offer additional scholarships \nto children trapped in an educational system which allows them no \nescape. There are currently programs operating in virtually every major \ncity in the country. They are giving children a chance.\n  Those who say, ``If you can't give everybody a chance, you can't give \nanybody a chance'', are like those standing on the Titanic saying, ``If \nwe don't have enough lifeboats for all on this sinking ship, nobody \ngets to use the existing lifeboats.''\n  These kids are condemned to failure with no way out of the plight \nthey are in. Let us allow these organizations\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nthat are reaching out through private contributions a chance to give \nthese kids a chance.\n  This is paid for. It is revenue neutral. Earlier the offset was an \nelimination of the gambling loss deduction. That has been replaced. \nThere was controversy. We wanted the focus to be on this amendment. \nThat has been replaced by two provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, \nchanges that are approved by the Finance Committee. There should be no \ncontroversy on that.\n  I urge my colleagues to give children, low-income children in \nminority situations mostly in urban schools--let us give them a chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week we were supposed to be debating \nour Nation's policy on education. Where our Nation's children are going \nto school is to the public school systems. We do not have anything \nagainst the private school system, but we ought to be testing every \nsingle recommendation against does it really help our public schools or \nare we taking needed funds away from our public schools?\n  This does absolutely nothing for our public schools. It gives no help \nand assistance to hard-working parents whose children are going to \npublic schools. What it does do is it says we are going to give a \npreference in terms of charitable giving to these specific \norganizations over charitable giving to cancer, over charitable giving \nto heart disease, over charitable giving to Alzheimer's, over \ncharitable giving to a wide range of other very worthwhile factors.\n  What is possibly the justification for that? We ought to consider tax \npolicy in that respect, but this is not good education policy. It does \nnot advance our common interest of moving the public schools toward \ngreater academic achievement and accomplishment. That ought to be the \ntest. This fails on the education standard, and it fails on tax policy.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will not be accepted.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is a \nvoluntary, incentive-based approach to help improve the academic \nexcellence in our public schools. It allows each State, if they wish, \nto utilize Federal funds that they receive so they can reward \nexcellence and encourage their schools. There is no new requirement of \nnew Federal money. It uses existing Federal money. There is no new \nFederal bureaucracy put in place. It would be taken care of, again, \nvoluntarily by the States. It is simply a concept that all of us \nbelieve in; that is, incentive and reward. We now give a new tool to \nour public schools to utilize these funds for that purpose, if the \nStates so choose.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

The Senate will be in order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment is a do-nothing \namendment. In some ways it could be harmful to the current blue ribbon \nprogram that is so excellent now in our country, because if this \namendment would pass, you would not be able to reward private and \nparochial schools who are doing an excellent job. A wonderful thing \nabout our blue ribbon school program is that it recognizes excellence \nacross the board and helps us. It will give them more than a blue \nribbon and a plaque; it will give them some financial incentive to \ncontinue to do good work.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Kempthorne amendment and \nthen to support our blue ribbon amendment, which is the underlying \namendment.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I greatly respect the Senator from \nLouisiana, but I totally disagree with the characterization of the \nSenator from Louisiana. This allows the States to finally utilize these \nfunds so they can make financial rewards to our schools as they should \ndo.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, could I have some order, please?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order? The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as this body knows, many on both sides \nof this aisle support blue ribbon schools because we believe that we \nshould begin rewarding excellence, funding results, and we should stop \nfunding failures. Blue ribbon schools are chosen by their States every \nyear. Some of them are public--many of them. Some of them are private. \nSome of them are parochial. When they achieve against the odds and when \ntheir students succeed, we call them to Washington and they come, 250 \nof them every year. We give them a beautiful, shiny plaque and a big \nblue ribbon and we send them home with nothing else but the plaque and \nthe blue ribbon. They are happy to get it, but what they really want \nand need are some resources to continue doing their good work.\n  So I think this is a better way to spend the $1.5 billion. Instead of \nhelping just a few people in America, we can help all of our schools \nand begin rewarding results. That is what this amendment does, the blue \nribbon school amendment. I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is certainly nothing wrong with \nan amendment that tries to improve blue ribbon schools. But the \namendment by the Senator from Louisiana guts the underlying premise of \nthe bill. What is substituted here is pretty simple. You have 250 \nschools that would receive a grant of $100,000, or you have 20 million \nchildren and 14 million families that will benefit all across the \nNation. In balance, there is just no comparison at all. So I would \nsimply say again her amendment guts the underlying premise we have been \ndebating for 6 months and exchanges assistance to 200-some-odd schools \nfor 14 million families.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not yet been ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today, Mr. President, and colleagues, is a very special \nday in America. We are celebrating here in the Senate, and millions of \npeople around our Nation are celebrating this special day. It is ``Take \nOur Daughters to Work Day.'' And mothers and fathers and aunts and \nuncles and friends are taking their special charges to work with them \nto see perhaps a side of life that some young girls do not get to see.\n  It is the sixth year that our Nation has celebrated in this way. I \nwanted to just say for the record that we have made a lot of progress \nin our Nation in the past 30 years. In 1968, only 20 percent of 18- to \n24-year-old women were enrolled in college. Today, thank goodness that \nnumber is climbing, and we are at 36 percent.\n  The median earnings for women in 1968 was only $18,500. Today, women \nearn an average of $23,000. We are making progress, but not enough.\n  I saw a statistic the other day that still 80 percent of all women \nwho work out of the home earn less than $25,000, earning 74 cents on \nevery dollar earned by their male counterparts.\n  In 1968, women owned fewer than 5 percent of the Nation's businesses. \nThat number has doubled, and I am proud to say that there are more \npeople employed by women-owned businesses than all the Fortune 500 \ncompanies in the country. So we are making progress.\n  Today is a day to honor the progress that is being made. But it is \nalso a day to encourage our young girls, particularly in the ages of 9 \nto 15, to reach for their dreams, to expand their horizons, to consider \nall the great options that are available for them as they think about \nbeginning to make choices about their careers. They can balance home \nlife and work life and they can chose careers that were unheard of just \na few years ago.\n  I hope some of these young girls who are here today with us will \nthink about the Senate, I say to our colleague from Michigan, to think \nabout encouraging more young women to run here for the Senate.\n  So I thank my colleagues for giving me this time to recognize this \nday. I want to welcome my niece with me today, Gracie Landrieu, who \ncame up--my daughter is only 10 months old, so she is a little too \nyoung to appreciate today. But she is going to be with me for a few \nminutes later today. But my niece, who is 10, can most certainly \nappreciate the great challenges before her. And I wish her all the \nbest, as we do all of our daughters across America.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3473-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3473-S3495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2303\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBingaman and Murray be added as cosponsors to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment provides a tax credit to\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nteachers who return to school to learn education technology. The credit \nwould be 50 percent of the cost of that training. The current situation \nacross our country is that educators are trying to find ways to use \ntechnologies to enrich the learning experience and to prepare students \nfor a world in which information technologies are increasingly woven \ninto the fabric of our life and our work.\n  School districts all over this land are making investments in \nhardware and in software and in connecting computers and in accessing \nInternet and in distance learning. I traveled around my State, and I \nhave spent a lot of time doing this, focusing on education technologies \nin the last 6 months. And I find, of course, as you would expect, there \nis a great variety in terms of how advanced school districts are when \nit comes to installing good computers, putting in the necessary \nsoftware, how many computers they have for their student body, how much \nso-called local area networks, how many of those they have in the \nschool connecting the computers to each other, how much access to the \nInternet in their school, to what extent are they connected to nearby \ncolleges or distant colleges and universities, and those kinds of \nefforts. A huge effort is being made with different degrees of success.\n  But what these school districts tell me universally is that where \nthey are falling short is in the development of their teaching staff in \nthe use of the technologies they are able to acquire. That is the \ncommon story I get from every school district--that we need to train \nour teachers in the use of these technologies. Typically, we find that \nonly about 5 cents of the technology dollar is going into professional \ndevelopment and 95 cents of the education technology dollar is going \ninto the hardware and software and connecters and the access.\n  This Government is spending a fortune, for instance, in the so-called \nuniversal service fund to provide every school that applies with a \ndiscount on their communication bills to access the Internet, for \ninstance, and on some of their internal linkages. But where we are \nfalling way below where we must be is when it comes to the training of \nour teachers, of our professional staff in the use of these \ntechnologies.\n  This first chart shows, as of the time that the statistics were taken \nin 1994--and we do not think too much has changed since then; but this \nis the last available year--how the States are doing when it comes to \nthe training of teachers.\n  How much education technology training do our teachers have? The U.S. \naverage, this red line on this chart, is 15 percent of our teachers; 15 \npercent of our teachers have at least 9 hours of training in education \ntechnology. That is it. In my State, only 10 percent of the teachers--1 \nout of 10--had at least 9 hours of training in their lifetime in the \nuse of education technology. That is a woeful story.\n  What it means is that with all of the dollars that are going into \nhardware and software and these other technologies that we are spending \npennies on, what is critically important is the skills to use the \ntechnologies which are provided. The most difficult skill of all is the \none that has been least acquired. That is the ability to integrate the \nmaterial which is now available through these technologies into the \ncurriculum. Very few teachers are accessing the information, the \nthousands of libraries now available to them through their computers, \nthe hundreds of field trips which they now can take in their classrooms \nif they know how to use these technologies. Until our teachers have \nthose skills and are given those opportunities, we are not using these \ntechnologies to their fullest or anywhere close to their fullest.\n  What this amendment does is, it says to those teachers who are \nwilling to go back for training, we will give you a tax credit of 50 \npercent of the cost of that training. Now, we already have a lifetime \nlearning credit of 20 percent that is a credit against the cost of \nhigher education. That has been a great advance. It is effective this \nyear. This amendment builds on that lifetime learning credit. It says \nfor those teachers who go back to gain the skills in the use of \neducation technology, they will get a 50 percent credit. It is a \nsignificantly increased incentive to obtain those skills which are so \ncritically necessary if we are going to make use of these technologies \nand if our children are going to have the kind of training and access \nto material which can only be given by their teachers, if they have \nthese skills.\n  The person who is the technology director for the Michigan Education \nDepartment is a man named Jamey Fitzpatrick. He was quoted as saying:\n\n       For every dollar we spend on computer hardware and software \n     in kindergarten through 12th grades, I think we would be \n     lucky if we saw five cents on the dollar spent on training \n     and support.\n       If we continue with those kinds of ratios we will never \n     realize the gain in student achievement that we think \n     technology has the potential to elicit. We obviously need to \n     put money into training.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Moseley-Braun be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What we do is leave most of the beneficial aspects of the \nunderlying education IRA bill in place--first of all, that is what we \ndon't do; what we do do, however, is we do not permit withdrawals from \nthat IRA for K through 12. That is the most controversial part of this \nbill, for reasons I will get to in a moment.\n  The rest of the provisions of this bill we do not touch. We don't \ntouch the expanded IRA relative to the cost of higher education. We \ndon't touch the extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided \neducation assistance in this bill. We don't touch the tax exclusion for \nwithdrawals from State tuition programs or the limited school \nconstruction provisions in this bill.\n  What we do, however, is not permit withdrawal from the IRA for the K \nthrough 12 expenses. We don't do that because this most controversial \nprovision of this bill, it seems to me, is severely tilted against \npublic schools. I want to show a chart that gives a picture of how \nserious this tilt is against public education in this IRA as it exists \nin the underlying bill.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee--and we have here a letter from \nthe Joint Tax Committee which lays out these numbers--according to the \nJoint Tax Committee, the majority of the tax benefit will go to the 2.9 \nmillion taxpayers with dependents in private school. The minority of \nthe tax benefit will go to the 35 million taxpayers who have dependents \nin public school. So, 35 million taxpayers, those with dependents in \npublic schools, get less than half the bill. The 2.9 million taxpayers \nwith children in private schools get 52 percent of the benefit. \nTranslated into dollars, in another way, the average taxpayer with a \nchild in private school gets a $37 tax deduction in the year 2002; the \npublic school taxpayer gets a $7 dollar deduction in the year 2002.\n  I want to read the provisions from the letter because that is \nreflected in this chart. The Joint Tax Committee says, ``We estimate \nthat of those eligible to contribute, approximately 2.9 million returns \nwould have children in private schools. We estimate that the proposed \nexpansion of education IRAs to withdrawals to cover primary and \nsecondary education would extend approximately 52 percent of the tax \nbenefit to taxpayers with children in private schools. We estimate that \nthe average per return tax benefit for taxpayers with children \nattending private schools would be approximately $37 in tax year 2002. \nConversely, we estimate that of the 38.3 million returns eligible, \napproximately 35.4 million returns would have dependents in public \nschools and that approximately 10.8 million of these returns would \nutilize education IRAs. We estimate that the proposed expansion of the \neducation IRAs would extend approximately 48 percent of the tax benefit \nto taxpayers with children in public schools with an average per return \ntax benefit of approximately $7 in the year 2002.''\n  I gather I have used my time, so I will not reserve the balance of \nit. I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment. As I stated yesterday, it \nstrikes at the heart of the Coverdell bill. It takes away the ability \nof parents to use educational IRAs to pay for expenses related to the \nschooling of their children between kindergarten and 12th grade.\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\n  Allowing parents greater resources to meet the educational needs of \ntheir young children is what the Coverdell bill is all about. Senator \nLevin proposes to take those resources away. Instead, he wants to \nexpand the lifetime learning credit for those who participate in \ntechnology training. No one can argue against the proposition that \nhelping teachers become more capable in technology is a good thing. We \nwant our students to understand the technology of the 21st century. We \ncertainly need to ensure that our teachers are proficient as well. But \nthis amendment is not the way to reach that goal. First, expanding the \nlifetime learning credit for teachers at the expense of expanding the \nIRAs for our children runs contrary to the needs and objectives of \nAmerican families. Mothers and fathers need increased wherewithal to \nsupport their children's educational goals. Mothers and fathers need \nstronger, more useful IRAs. They need the ability to use more of their \nown hard-earned money to take care of family priorities.\n\n  The Senate recognized this fact last year when we gave parents with \nchildren in grades K through 12 the ability to use educational IRAs. \nOur objective was to strengthen moms' and dads' ability to get the best \neducation possible for their children. Our objective made sense then, \nand it certainly makes sense today.\n  The Coverdell bill empowers families to make decisions that are in \ntheir best interests. It allows them to use their own resources for \ntheir own benefit. Remember, the money in question here belongs to the \ntaxpayers. They earned it, it's theirs, they will save it, and they \nshould be able to choose how it will be spent. Let them use it where it \nserves them best--on their children.\n  Mr. President, despite what some in this Chamber continue to argue, \nthe education IRA is not a boondoggle for the rich. The education IRA \nphases out for high-income taxpayers. Because of these phaseouts, the \nvast majority of the benefits will go to middle-income taxpayers. \nAccording to the National Catholic Education Association, almost 70 \npercent of the families with children in Catholic schools have income \nbelow $35,000, and almost 90 percent of those families have incomes \nbelow $50,000. These families, along with virtually all of the 38 \nmillion American families with children in public or private elementary \nand secondary schools, are the families that the Coverdell bill is \ndesigned to help.\n  At the same time, we should all take note that two-thirds of the \nindividual income taxes in the United States are shouldered by \ntaxpayers earning over $75,000 per year. So one can see that the \nCoverdell bill is focused on those families most in need of help.\n  As my colleagues know, the lifetime learning credit is a provision \nthat was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allows anyone \npursuing postsecondary education to take a tax credit each year equal \nto 20 percent of their qualified expenses. The lifetime learning credit \nis available to anyone who meets the income requirement. Full-time \nstudents can take the credit, as can any professional who wants to \ncontinue his or her education. And this includes teachers, engineers, \nor research scientists.\n  What Senator Levin proposes is to single out teachers and increase \ntheir lifetime learning credit to 50 percent for technology training. \nNot only would this come at the expense of students and their families, \nbut it would be inequitable among the professions. Why should a teacher \nreceive an increased credit for his or her additional education when an \nengineer is limited to the current 20 percent? More important, it \nemphasizes one type of teacher continuing education over another. And \nwhat is the basis of claim, for instance, that we should give a 50 \npercent credit for teachers to become more proficient in using and \nteaching technology, but only give 20 percent to those who take courses \nto become better reading or math instructors? Those skills are also \nvital to function in a society.\n  It is important to note that the Coverdell bill already includes a \nprovision that allows an employee, such as a teacher, to receive, tax-\nfree, employer-provided education assistance. In other words, the bill \nalready encourages a school to pay for its teachers to receive training \nsuch as contemplated by the Senator from Michigan. I believe we should \nleave this type of policy decision to the local schools. If a school \nattaches a high priority to the use of technology in the classroom--and \nwe hope they do--the school can send its teacher to a training class. \nThe best part of all is that the teacher would not have to pay anything \nat all--no expenses, no taxes. Under the Levin proposal, a teacher \nwould still end up paying half the cost of this additional education.\n  In summary, the Levin amendment takes the means to use expanded IRAs \nto educate children and it creates a more distorted and, I must say, \nmuch more complex learning credit. This is not what we want to do, Mr. \nPresident. If you ask the families of America how they would choose to \nuse the financial resources in question, I believe the vast majority \nwould make it clear that they want the opportunity to use their money \nto give them greater flexibility and power to meet the educational \nobjectives of their family.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the Levin amendment. The educational IRA is \nthe foundation of the Coverdell bill. This modification guts the bill \nat the expense of the children. For this reason, I oppose this \namendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and reserve any time that I may have left.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on this amendment \non both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Seven minutes on the \nSenator's side, and 5 seconds on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be very brief. I yield a minute of my time to \nbe added to the 5 seconds of the Senator from Michigan so that the \nSenator from Connecticut can have a word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this amendment. I have \nan amendment coming up that I will be addressing. But I think it is \nsuch an important amendment that our colleague from Michigan has raised \nhere. I think all of us have become much more highly sensitized to the \ncritical importance of the generation of students in our country who \nare computer literate. It is no longer a question of whether or not \nthat technology and the awareness of it is going to be important. It is \ncritical. I have made the assertion that what keyboards and computers \nbring to this generation is tantamount to what a ballpoint pen brought \nto my generation. Any child today not completing elementary and \nsecondary school without being computer literate is going to be totally \nunprepared for the 21st century economy.\n  Our colleague from Michigan has made it possible for the teachers of \nour Nation, who truly would like to become better prepared to instruct \nyoung people in the importance of this technology, to have the \nwherewithal to do so. This ought not to be a partisan debate in any \nway. It is a very thoughtful amendment, one that we all can be deeply \nproud of.\n  We are only some 500 days away from a new millennium, and Senator \nLevin has offered us a chance to make a difference for young people so \nthat they might be able to acquire these skills. I commend him for the \namendment and hope our colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, certainly the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Michigan is a thoughtful one. But as has been noted by the Finance \nchairman, it completely makes moot a core principle of the underlying \nbill, and for that reason I oppose it.\n  I don't dispute the numbers that are demonstrated in his chart, but I \nwould like to elaborate on them.\n  The education savings account essentially takes the education savings \naccount that was celebrated and signed by the President last year, $500 \nper year to be saved, and it could only be used for higher education. \nThe proposal before us takes that idea in its identical form and \nexpands the $500 to $2,000 and says you can use it in kindergarten \nthrough college. So it broadens the capacity of it.\n  These numbers refer to kindergarten through high school only and do \nnot\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\nlook at the cap in these accounts--that is very difficult to project--\nsaved for college. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, what that really means is that the tax relief, which is very \nmodest for those that are in public school, is about $250 million over \n5 years, and for those in private school it is about $250 million. \nThere are more families using it in public schools, as is noted on the \nchart. About 70 percent of what we estimate to be 14 million families \nwill use the savings account, and 70 percent of them will have children \nin public schools and 30 percent in private.\n  The reason it starts to equal itself in the distribution is that \npeople who have children in private schools recognize that they are \npaying for the public schools with their property tax base and they \nhave to pay for the private school education on top of that. So they \nhave to save more. They have a higher bar to reach. I agree. They will \ntherefore, likely save more, which means there will be more interest \nthat is earned, which means they would have a higher proportion of this \nvery small account.\n  In closing, I simply say that by offering a tax incentive over 5 \nyears of $500 million-odd, which is modest in this big picture, it \ncauses Americans to do a very big thing. They go out and save $5 \nbillion, all of which will be used for 20 million children no matter \nwhere they are in school--public, private, or home--to help get them \nready for the new century.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks and yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't think I have any time remaining. If \nI do, I will yield it. I thank my good friend for yielding that \nadditional minute to Senator Dodd, by the way. It was a generous \ngesture.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I was very glad to do so.\n  If I might, Mr. President, for administrative clarification, I \nbelieve the sequence of events will be something like this. We are \ngoing to now take up the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, and there will be a vote. I think the \nSenator would prefer that a vote occur after his debate. The Levin, \nBoxer, and Bingaman amendments will be stacked for early this afternoon \njust before the final vote. There are two more Senators who will debate \nfollowing the vote of Senator Dodd. I believe that is the description \nof the situation we have right now during the day.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2305\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 101, and to provide funding for part B of \n            the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), for himself, and \n     Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 2305.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101. FUNDING FOR PART B OF IDEA.\n\n       Any net revenue increases resulting from the enactment of \n     title II that remain available, taking into account the \n     provisions of this title, shall be used to carry out part B \n     of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1411 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our colleagues, \nSenators Leahy, Harkin, Kennedy, Wellstone, and Boxer, be included as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have in front of me a chart which \ndemonstrates what I think most Members of this body are familiar with; \nthat is, the rising cost of special education in our country and the \nrising population of students who are requiring special education \nservices.\n  Presently, for the special education needs of America, 55 percent of \nthe cost is being borne by our States, and 35 percent is being borne by \nlocal governments and local property taxes, and roughly 10 percent by \nthe Federal Government. It is the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA), endorsed and supported by those of us here in \nCongress, which rightly encourages and provides for the inclusion of \nall children who require special education services in the educational \nprocess of this Nation.\n  It is worthy of note that at the time the U.S. Congress passed the \nIDEA legislation, it was recommended that the Federal Government would \nprovide 40 percent of the costs of special education services. Several \ndecades later, the Federal Government is presently only contributing 10 \npercent of the costs of special education. Mr. President, special \neducation costs are rising. We are told nationally that these numbers \nare moving up. In 1991, special education costs were 17 percent of the \noverall education budget; they are now 19 percent of the overall \neducation budget.\n  I might also point out that the amount being spent on regular \neducation has dropped to 56 percent, down from 58 percent. Also, the \npopulation of special needs children is on the increase. The overall \npopulation of children in elementary and secondary schools has gone up \nabout 7.3 percent in the last few years, whereas the number of children \nrequiring special education services has jumped over 12 percent in the \nsame period of time. We have rising costs, rising population, and the \nFederal commitment to special education has remained static.\n  I mention this because I am offering an amendment that, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Georgia, would take the $1.6 billion from \ntax proposal that would provide $37 or $7 in tax relief for private and \npublic school families, respectively, and use that money to lower the \ncost at the local and State level for special education services. If \nthe Federal Government is to meet its full commitment of 40 percent to \nspecial education, it would need to provide $16 billion to state and \nlocal school districts, more than four times the current funding.\n  Let me quickly add that I commend the Budget Committee and others in \nrecent weeks and months who have actually increased spending on special \neducation. The total commitment to States is slightly lower than $4 \nbillion but is still substantially less than the $16 billion needed to \nmeet the 40-percent commitment.\n  I believe, given the scarce funding available to us, is that we would \nbe far wiser, with all due respect to the authors of this underlying \nproposal, to take that $1.6 billion and give it back to the States and \nlocal governments to reduce the rising cost of special education in \nthis country.\n  We are told that the underlying bill is about choice. I argue there \nshould be no choice when the needs of children with disabilities are \ninvolved. Private schools can simply accept or reject students that \nthey want or don't want. If your child is a special needs child, you \ndon't have a choice whether you would like to go to a private school. \nThe only school system that has to take you is a public school system. \nParents with children with special needs don't have those choices. \nProperty taxpayers, sales taxpayers, and State income taxpayers don't \nhave any choice; they have to pay their tax bills.\n  The only people I know of at this very moment who have a choice about \neducation are the 100 of us in this body. We have a choice to take $1.6 \nbillion and provide a $37 tax break for private school students and \ntheir families, a $7 tax break for the public school students and their \nfamilies, or we can help state and local school districts by providing \nthem with $320 per special needs child so that they can provide \nvaluable special education services. That is what my amendment does. It \nis saying, let's make a choice with rare funding dollars and apply them \nto help special needs children.\n  Let me share how big a cost this is and point out the situation in a \nnumber of States. In Colorado, the State must pay a 60-percent share \nfor special education services. In Connecticut, the State provides 59 \npercent of special education funding. In Maine, 33 percent; Michigan, \n60 percent; Missouri, 60 percent; Rhode Island, 59 percent; Virginia, \n68 percent. These are huge costs at the State and local level. I have \none community in my State, Torrington, CT, where 2 years ago the bill \nwas $635,000 for special education services.\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\n Two years later, it has risen to $1.3 million. Mr. President, the \ncosts associated with special education can often be staggering.\n  What I am saying is, if we think this is a national goal, to do \nsomething about special education, then we ought to be willing to help \nour local towns and our States to reduce their share of special \neducation costs. The $1.6 billion that my amendment would provide is \nnot going to pay the entire bill. It is, however, a move in the right \ndirection. But when you have very scarce funding, wouldn't it be wiser \nfor us to make the choice here today to reduce property and State \ntaxes, by saying here is $1.6 billion, which we know is not going to \nsolve the whole problem, but I want to give that money back to the \nStates, back to the local governments, to bring down the cost of \nspecial education services.\n\n  We made that promise, Mr. President. We said decades ago we would \nprovide 40 percent of the cost of special education, and we have never \nprovided more than 10 percent. There is a chance for us today to \nprovide, not $37, not $7 after taxes, but a $320 per child tax break in \nterms of reducing the cost of providing special education services.\n  It seems to me this would be a far wiser way for us to spend our \nmoney. I say after-tax dollars because I think there is some confusion. \nAgain, I say this with all due respect to the authors of the underlying \nbill. But the $2,000 IRA contained in Senator Coverdell's legislation \nis an after-tax proposal. It provides as much as if you put $2,000 in a \nsavings account and the interest that it earns, that is the money you \nget the tax break on, not the $2,000 principle. So when I say it \nprovides a $37 and $7 tax break, those are real numbers.\n  Recently, I looked at what the cost of private schools is in the \ngreater Washington, DC, area. They run anywhere from $10,000 to $17,000 \nannually. Why are we providing a $37 tax break for families who are \nalready sending their children to schools that expensive when the $1.6 \nbillion specified in this legislation could help lower property taxes \nand assist with special education?\n  Recently, when speaking with mayors in Connecticut, they often \nmentioned the high cost of special education services. By not \ncontributing 40 percent of special education costs, we are pitting \nfamilies against each other in these communities. I think every one of \nus probably knows someone, maybe in our own families, that has a \nspecial needs child. We know the concern, the fear, that a family goes \nthrough in discovering that a child requires special education \nservices. It is a critically important issue. But I am also aware of \nwhat happens in a community where you only have a handful of special \nneeds students and all of a sudden their services cost a bit more and \npeople get upset because it is their tax dollars that are paying for \nthat education. The school systems in our states need our assistance.\n  What we are offering here is some relief to State and local school \nsystems. It is not total relief. We have $1.6 billion over 10 years, \nwhat are we going to do with the taxpayers' money of this country? Do \nwe give it back to the communities in Connecticut and elsewhere that \nare struggling to meet the cost of special education? Or do I write a \n$37 check to someone who is sending their child to a school that is \ncosting $10,000 or $13,000 or $14,000 a year? I don't know how you \njustify it. I don't know how I can explain to my constituents not \nproviding some relief to their school systems for an area of great \nconcern and importance--special education.\n  That is the choice I get to make here in the next few minutes. Do we \ntake these dollars and return them to our States, return them to our \ntowns, trying to make a real difference for special education, or do we \ntake them to provide minor tax relief.\n  Now, again, let me mention briefly the role of public and private \neducation. At this very hour, all across our country, even on the west \ncoast where the Presiding Officer is from, children have started \nschool. There are 53 million children in elementary and secondary \nschools at this very hour all across our country; 48 million of them \nare in public schools and 5 million are in private schools. So we are \ntalking about $1.6 billion, $37 of which goes to students in those \nprivate schools, $7 of which goes for those in public schools.\n  I am a product in many ways of private education. My parents made \nthat choice. I respect them for having made it. However, my parents \nnever thought they should get a tax break for doing so. They understood \nthat this Nation had a special obligation to public education and \nparticularly the families with special needs children. I had to be \naccepted to the private schools I attended. They didn't have to take \nme. Private schools can reject anyone they want. Public schools cannot. \nPublic schools must accept these children. And you have that family \nthat has done everything right and, unfortunately, has a situation with \na child who requires special education services, and they, of course, \nwant that child to succeed. They don't have the choice of going to a \nprivate school. Private school is not going to take that cost on. They \nhave to attend a public school. Let us try to provide the valuable \nresources specified by this legislation to our local communities to \nhelp that family receive special education services for their child, to \nsay to the other property taxpayers in that town that we are going to \nprovide the 40 percent of special education costs we promised we would \nand never have.\n  One hundred of us here in the next 20 minutes or 15 minutes will be \ngiven the choice of deciding which is a higher priority. It is not a \nquestion of we would like to do everything. We can't do everything. \nBut, we have $1.6 billion and we are going to decide in the next 15 \nminutes where it is going to go.\n  Does it go toward a $37 tax break for someone who has their child \nenrolled in a private school, or does it come back to that community in \nmy State and other States all across this country to provide some \nneeded tax relief--at $320 per child--to begin the process of lowering \nthe cost of special education services and making a difference in our \ntowns and for these families. That is really the choice. That's the \nreal choice we have before us today.\n  Mr. President, let me ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and----\n  Mr. DODD. I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 15 minutes in \nopposition if he chooses to use it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there are so many numbers tossed \naround. Anybody listening to this debate must be somewhat befuddled. \nYou try to step back from it and look at the bigger picture.\n  First of all, the concern of the Senator from Connecticut about the \nfunding of special education is a real one, but he has already alluded \nto one of the major problems, and that is this mandate, which is one of \nthe largest mandates in American history, ordered by the Congress on \nlocal communities in 1975, and in 1975 the promise was 40 percent of \nthe funding would be Federal, 40 State and 20 local. Now, the other \nside, until 1994, was in control of the Congress and never sent the \ncheck.\n  Since we have been in the majority, last year we put in another $700 \nmillion. The Senate budget resolution placed special education as the \ntop priority. Republicans are seeking an additional $2.5 billion over \nthe next 5 years for educating children with disabilities. In fiscal \nyear 1997, the President requested $3.6 billion for this IDEA. Our \nCongress provided $4 billion for it. In fiscal year 1998, the President \nrequested $4.2 billion for this. We came up with $4.8. The President's \nproposal for 1999 proposes $4.8 billion a year for IDEA. Our resolution \ncalls for $5.3 billion, a $0.5 billion increase.\n  So, while the other side controlled the Congress, this promise was \nleft unfulfilled. Since we have controlled the Congress, we have begun \npaying down that obligation. In the Republican BOOKS proposal, we \nproposed fully funding it. The Budget Committee is moving rapidly in \nthat direction. We are not there yet. And we did it, and have been \ndoing it, without gutting other ideas.\n  So the additional money my friend from Connecticut talks about that \nought to be fulfilling this promise--it is being done. We are doing \nexactly what he has asked that we do, and--comma ``and''--we are trying \nto help 14 million American families individually take charge and help \nto connect them to the education of their children. We do not think it \nis mutually exclusive, you have to do this or you have to do\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nthat. We are doing both. So, since we have been in the majority, and \nthe Senator acknowledged it, we have been moving to try to fund IDEA.\n  This $1.6 billion that's referred to, that is tax relief over 10 \nyears, and the $37, of course, is a statistical average, as is the $7. \nBut it does not take into account the principal. The tax relief was \nonly accrued because of the principal. For $37, you have to have $1,000 \nin the account; for $7, you have to have $250. But what it means is we \nwill have taken this $1.6 billion in relief to the same middle-class \nfamilies that the President designated last year, the same criteria, \nsame concept, and the Joint Tax Committee tells us that because of that \nmodest tax incentive, these 14 million families over 10 years--that is \nthe 10-year number you are using--will save, in principal and \naccumulated interest, over $10 billion; 10 billion new dollars coming \nbehind education.\n  These $10 billion are not public dollars. They are private. They are \nwillfully volunteered by these families. So it means that public \neducation will get, over the next 10 years, in support of it, $5 \nbillion. And private will get $5 billion. And, yes, the private \nrepresents fewer families, but it still means, at the bottom line at \nthe end of the day, that there is $5 billion flowing behind public \nschools all across the country and there is $5 billion flowing behind \nprivate and home schools across the country.\n  Those are very smart dollars, too, because they are in individual \nfamily checking accounts where people know exactly what the frailty or \nproblem is of a given child. If it is a math deficiency, it is going to \ngo to hire a math tutor. If it is an inner city student who does not \nhave a home computer, it is going to purchase a home computer. If it is \ntransportation that is needed for an afterschool program that we all \nwant to encourage --it is smart dollars. Public dollars have a hard \ntime doing that, going right to the problem. If it is dyslexia or \nspecial education, it will flow right to it. And no school board is \ngoing to have to raise the property tax to get ahold of this $10 \nbillion, no State is going to have to raise income tax, and we are not \nhaving to raise taxes. This is volunteered money, and I think the value \nof the money is geometrically increased, it is probably worth three \ntimes other dollars because it is being driven right into the child's \nneed.\n  The point we do not talk a lot about here--and they are not in these \nfigures, either--is that the one distinction this savings account has \nis that it can accept contributions from sponsors--an employer, a \nchurch, a grandparent, a sister or brother, a neighbor, a benevolent \nassociation. And as people understand this and they begin to connect to \nthese ideas, there is going to be a lot more money in those accounts \nthan we have even envisioned.\n\n  Another point I would make about the savings account to my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, is that every time a family makes a conscious \ndecision to open a savings account--every time they do it--there is a \nmental connection to that child's education. And every month, for 20-\nsome-odd years, they will get a notice from some financial institution \nthat tells them the condition of that child's account. It will remind \nthem every month of the requirements and needs and will make them think \nabout what those children need.\n  I can certify that to be absolutely true because my dad and I did the \nsame thing for my sister's two sets of twins. We knew we were going to \nhave some problems with the financial burden. So we started putting a \nlittle away. It was not a huge amount of money when they had to go to \nschool--but it was a lot. And if this had been in place, it would have \nbeen twice what we had in that account. I think we got it up to $6,000 \nor $7,000. It would have been doubled. It could have been tripled if we \nkept it 30 years and used it for college. There is a special ed feature \nof this, too. Because if the child has a special educational need, it \nwill stay with the child until he or she is 30 years old.\n  So, my point is this. We agree that special ed needs attention and \nthe Congress has been a party in seeing to this, and it has created \nenormous problems and we are responding to it. I am just citing the \nnumbers here. But we are doing it, along with other reforms. We are \ndoing it with an education savings account. We are doing it with a \nschool construction proposal. We are doing it, helping employers fund \ncontinuing education for their employees. We are doing it and we are \nhelping support 21 States that have prepaid tuition programs for \nfamilies to help get ready for the cost of higher education. Mr. \nPresident, 17 more States are coming into the picture.\n  We are accomplishing the funding of IDEA--which we agree is \nimportant. But we are not stopping the other changes and other ideas to \nhelp families. My colleague mentioned somewhere, I believe, around 50 \nmillion are in our elementary and secondary schools. Mr. President, 20 \nmillion of them will be beneficiaries of these accounts, half of the \nentire population. Some will be more; some will be less. Some will save \nthe full amount; some will only save part of it. Some will accumulate \n$1,000; some will accumulate the entire amount. But they will all be \nhelped and they will all be reminded about the needs of those children\n  Like I said, we are funding IDEA. We are giving parents new tools. We \nare giving employers new tools. We are supporting the States with \nprepaid tuition programs. And we are building new schools. That is the \nunderlying motion here.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 12 seconds. The \nDemocratic side has 1 minute 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield a minute to my good friend from Rhode Island, and I \nask unanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I rise in very strong \nsupport of the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. I think it \nillustrates two important points.\n  First, the huge gap between what the Federal Government promised in \nterms of special education support to the States and what was \ndelivered. Even though, as the Senator from Georgia pointed out, we are \ntrying to do better, we can do much better. And using these resources \nrather than engaging in the private savings plan as the Senator from \nGeorgia proposes, but using these resources to assist special \neducation, I think, will be the best way to use these dollars.\n  The second point I think the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut illustrates is the critical role that public education \nplays in our country, because these students--typically these disabled \nstudents--are all public education students. Private facilities don't \ntake these individuals typically because they can't afford them and \nthey think they are disruptive. That is the essence of private \neducation. They can pick and choose.\n  A public school cannot. We have committed ourselves in this Congress \nto ensure that every child in this country, regardless of ability or \ndisability, has a free, excellent public education. But what that means \nin practice is that our public schools have to respond to large numbers \nof special education students, something to which private education \ndoes not respond. That is, I think, at the heart of this debate.\n  If we are going to have a public school system that we expect to give \neducation to all of our citizens, then we cannot siphon off resources \nto private education in the way that is proposed by these savings \naccounts. We have to match our orders and commands to the schools of \nAmerica and to educate all of our citizens with resources.\n  This amendment does that. It preserves a program that we have all \nstood up and said is vitally important to this country, both \neducationally and socially--and that is special education --and it does \nso by reinforcing public education. That is the way we should proceed.\n  I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his efforts in regard to \nthis amendment today.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my good friend from Rhode Island. Mr. President, I \nunderstand there will be a point of order raised against this \namendment. I regret that, because I am not asking to spend any more \nmoney than the underlying amendment does, but I realize this is a point \nof order that will be sustained. I will make an appropriate motion to \nvote on that.\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\n  I am sorry that is going to be the case, because I really do believe \nthat this is the one opportunity, a chance, after we all talked about \ntrying to do something, about reducing the cost to communities, to make \nthe choice to do so. But I need 60 votes, I am afraid, to prevail on \nall of that. When the appropriate motion is made, I will respond to it. \nI hope that will not be the case. I hope we can have an up-or-down vote \nas we have had on every other amendment.\n  I believe my time has expired, and if it has, I believe my colleague \nwants to make an appropriate motion.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, has the proponents' time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I do not believe we need to be in a \ndilemma where it is either/or--do this and not the education savings \naccount, or do the other.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is correct that I will raise a point of \norder. The Congressional Budget Office has told us this amendment \ncreates a new entitlement for special education, a program which has \nalways been discretionary since its creation in 1985. This spending \nwould be charged to the Finance Committee, which has already exceeded \nits allocation.\n  Therefore, we conclude that amendment No. 2305, offered by my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, violates section 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act because it provides for an increase to \ndirect spending beyond the allocation of the committee of jurisdiction. \nI, therefore, raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget \nAct against this amendment. I assume my colleague will move to waive.\n\n\n                     MOTION TO WAIVE THE BUDGET ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act so that the \namendment may be considered. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back my time in order to facilitate the two \nmotions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 2305, \noffered by the Senator from Connecticut. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 98 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Campbell\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that in the \nregular order we will now go to the amendment to be offered by the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2306\n\n   (Purpose: To improve academic and social outcomes for students by \n       providing productive activities during after school hours)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Akaka, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Inouye, Mr. Daschle, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2306.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n             TITLE ____--AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY\n\n     SECTION ____01.

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair inform me when I have \nused 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer my After School Education \nand Safety Act as an amendment to the Coverdell bill. I want to mention \nthose who are original sponsors of this legislation. They are: Senators \nMurray, Bingaman, Johnson, Lieberman, Sarbanes, Kerry from \nMassachusetts, Dodd, Durbin, Levin, Akaka, Kohl, Wellstone, Bryan, \nKennedy, Inouye, Daschle, and Moseley-Braun. I mention them because I \nam very proud of their support for this very important measure.\n  This is not a new issue. I presented this plan to the entire Senate \nduring the budget markup, and I am very pleased to tell you that my \namendment was adopted unanimously. I think most Senators understand the \nfact that after-school programs are very important for two reasons. \nFirst of all, our children need the mentoring help, our children need \nthe attention, and our children need the community support after school \nbecause it really increases their academic achievement.\n  Secondly, the FBI has told us that from the hours of 3 p.m. to 6 \np.m., juvenile crime goes way up because our children are joining \ngangs, and they are getting into trouble after school. We need to do \nsomething to keep them busy and to keep them out of trouble. That is \nwhy I believe I got such unanimous support for this legislation during \nthe budget debate. We have set aside $50 million in the budget for this \nprogram. Now we have a chance to authorize it.\n\n  I am very hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nnow follow though on the commitment they made in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, in this picture you can see some of the faces of what \nwe are talking about. These are children in a California after-school \nprogram in Sacramento. You can see from the looks on their faces how \nexcited they are about the work they are doing after school.\n  We have some others pictures to show you. This picture shows some of \nthe valuable mentoring that occurs in this after school program. These \nchildren are working in small groups with a teacher or volunteer. These \nchildren are learning a tremendous amount. In fact, the academic \nperformance of these students has dramatically increased as a result of \nthe attention that they are getting after school.\n  Here are some pictures of the children learning music. There was a \nnew study that just came out yesterday that says that children who \nengage in musical activities achieve higher levels of academic success. \nI see that our majority leader is on the floor. He had a group of \nsinging Senators and I think he realizes the value of music. Music \npromotes camaraderie and bring us together.\n  Here we see the children learning how to play the drums in an after-\nschool setting.\n  Finally, I have a picture of children working with one of the law \nenforcement officers who come into these programs.\n  Whether it is L.A.'s Best or Sacramento Start, whether it is the \nTenderloin Program in San Francisco, or our after school program in \nOakland, all of these after school initiatives desperately need some \nattention from our National Government. There is not one program in the \nDepartment of Education that is exclusively for after school, not one.\n  Through my amendment we have an opportunity to improve the Coverdell \nbill, a bill that started off as a very simple bill. Unfortunately, I \nthink that this bill is turning into an anti-education bill. I have to \nsay that with a heavy heart because I really thought that we would have \nsome bipartisanship.\n  But what has happened to this bill? I think what we have before us is \na bill that has been amended in such a way that it does great damage to \nour children. Let me explain what I mean.\n  We had a number of amendments that were rejected out of hand --\namendments to try to rebuild our schools. I understand why Senators who \nlike the underlying bill voted against that, but they have not reached \nacross the aisle to try to come up with any compromise on it at all.\n  Our kids are facing schools that are crumbling. We do nothing. We \nreject it out of hand. We don't work for compromise. We say no. We had \nan amendment simply expressing support for reducing class sizes that \nwas only debated for 3 minutes. That amendment passed. But then someone \nchanged the vote, and we rejected that. If you ask parents all over \nthis country, they will tell you that they want smaller class sizes.\n  So what provisions do we accept? We also voted on an amendment that \nessentially will prohibit the implementation of a program to test our \nstudents so parents will know if their kids are doing well or doing \npoorly and schools can be held accountable. To this, we say yes. To me \nthis is unbelievable. We have an education bill here is that is turning \ninto an anti-education bill, an antiparent bill, an antistudent bill. \nWe also have other amendments that did away with a whole series of \nprograms and made them optional for schools.\n  When Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon he said it was ``one small \nstep for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' This bill was one, tiny \nstep forward for education, and it has become a huge step backward for \neducation.\n\n  Listen to the list of the nationally recognized programs that are \ndone away with summarily in this bill.\n  Critical programs for disadvantaged kids including Title I; School to \nWork; Goals 2000; STAR schools; education technology; Eisenhower \nprofessional development, which is teacher training; safe and drug-free \nschools; magnet school assistance; telecommunications demonstration \nproject for math skills, a fund for the improvement of education. The \nJavits gifted and talented education funding to support programs for \nspecial children is done away with. The Eisenhower regional math and \nscience consortium is done away with. If you read President \nEisenhower's comments on what we ought to do in education in the \n1950's, he said, ``It takes more than guns to make us strong.'' We need \nstrong kids and we need them to learn. Yet now we are doing away with \nthe Eisenhower program.\n  We are eliminating the International Education Exchange, which \nsupports educational exchange programs. That is what the Gorton \namendment did away with, or made it optional. The Gorton amendment took \nthe National Government completely out of education. Education is the \nmost important thing in the world, and this bill is a giant step \nbackward.\n  We can improve this bill a little bit if we support the Boxer \namendment to support education and reduce juvenile crime.\n  I told you before that juvenile offenders commit crimes between the \nhours of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. That is why the police in my home state are \nsupporting\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nthe Boxer amendment. This includes bipartisan support from the chiefs \nof police of many, many cities in my State. California law enforcement \nunderstands that when it comes to our children, we shouldn't seek party \nlines. That is why I hope people will vote for this.\n  Let's hear what the police chief from Los Angeles says about the need \nto invest in our children:\n\n       Police leaders know that America's commitment to putting \n     criminals in jail must be matched by its commitment to \n     keeping kids from becoming criminals in the first place.\n\n  Here is another quote from our law enforcement officials.\n  ``Crime Fighters Support After-School Programs'':\n\n       We . . . call on all public officials to protect public \n     safety by adopting commonsense policies to: Provide for all \n     of America's school-age children and teens after-school \n     programs, and access to weekend and summer . . .\n\n  This statement is very, very clear. The organization that made this \nstatement--Fight Crime, Invest in Kids--has 170 of the Nation's leading \npolice chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors. Across the country law \nenforcement officials support after school programs.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will see a little bipartisanship. \nYou all voted for it in the budget. You know what we did. We cut \nGovernment travel to pay for this initiative to fund 500 after school \nprograms. The local school districts will design them. They will pull \nin community groups like Big Brothers and Big Sisters. They will bring \nin the business community.\n  Mr. President, we can keep our kids learning and keep them out of \ntrouble. There is no magic solution to solve all the problems that our \nNation is facing in terms of crime. But if we had to choose one way to \nfight crime it should be to keep our kids engaged when they are in \nschool.\n  I really look forward to this vote. I hope it will be bipartisan.\n  I yield 2 minutes to my friend, Senator Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 4 minutes 10 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I retain the remainder.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and \napplaud her great leadership on what I think is one of the critical \nissues in our Nation today.\n  I think it needs to be emphasized that the after-school program \namendment being offered by Senator Boxer is not an alternative to the \nunderlying Coverdell bill. Unlike other amendments that we have \nconsidered today, this is an add-on that is independent of the funding \nthat is committed to the Coverdell legislation.\n  I have been holding meetings all around my State of South Dakota, \nwhich is an overwhelmingly rural State. The Senator from California \nrepresents a State with large urban areas. One of the things that we \nshare is a very strong sense from parents, from child care providers, \nteachers and school administrators, and from everyone who follows this \nissue that after-school programs are among the most important items on \nwhich we should focus our attention.\n  In fact, the Republican Governor of my State has played a leading \nrole in our State in trying to better utilize our school resources, \nrecognizing that working moms are a larger and larger percentage of the \nwork force. Welfare is pushing more and more people, mostly working \nmoms, into the workplace because we have provided bipartisan support \nfor that goal. We have increasing numbers of latchkey kids in all of \nour communities, large and small. After-school programs for these \nchildren are either nonexistent or far too expensive. We have studies \nfrom our law enforcement officials indicating overwhelmingly that \nbetween the hours of 3 to 6 in the afternoon is the greatest amount of \njuvenile crime, alcohol and drug experimentation, and sexual \nexperimentation. All this takes place because we have an entire \ngeneration of young people in unsupervised settings, and these problems \nare becoming more widespread.\n  I applaud Senator Boxer and her effort to come up with an amendment \nthat not only addresses this key issue but does it in a way that does \nnot create new Federal bureaucracy, does not federalize anything but \ninstead utilizes local resources, leaves the options and the \nadministration and the decisions at the local level. Because of all of \nthese strong reasons, I think this is a very positive and constructive \ncontribution to the underlying legislation, and I certainly again \napplaud the Senator's leadership, and yield back the time to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have just been joined by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, who I believe rises in opposition to this amendment. I \nyield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to the Boxer amendment. My concern is \nthat while there is, without doubt, an acknowledged need for after-\nschool care and an acknowledged need for mentoring and tutorial-type \nprograms, this would be taking the wrong step in the wrong direction \nand would create another Federal program, which, in my estimation, \nwould be highly duplicative of existing programs, a multiplicity of \nFederal programs that already have been created for this purpose.\n  School districts already have the authority to establish after-school \nlearning centers, many already financed, and will benefit from \nadditional provisions of this year's budget for after-school programs.\n  Let me give just a few examples. The 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Act provides $40 million for rural and inner-city public \nschools to establish after-school programs. The Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Act allows money to be spent on after-school programs with a \ndrug and violence prevention component. The child care development \nblock grant and the community development block grant also provide \nmoney for child care, including after-school care. The Juvenile Justice \nAct will also target millions of dollars on prevention programs, \nincluding mentoring programs and after-school programs. It has already \npassed the House. These are just to give a few examples.\n  So I, once again, must object to the philosophy underlying the \nSenator's amendment to create another Federal program. While I agree \nthat one-on-one mentoring and tutoring is valuable, it will help \nimprove educational achievement of students, such tutoring is already \nallowable under at least 19 other Federal programs.\n  So I have listed a number of programs in which we have after-school \ncare provided. There are 19 programs that have tutoring and mentoring \ncomponents: AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve, VISTA, JUMP, the Juvenile \nJustice Mentoring Program, CAMP, the Migrant Education Mentoring \nProgram, TRIO, are all examples of existing mentoring and tutoring \nprograms that are out there already.\n\n  The Senator's amendment, in my estimation, would simply duplicate \nthese existing programs. In addition, we find there are a great many \nvolunteer organizations that are providing and supplying after-school \ncare currently. We are going to prohibit them, exclude them from the \npossibility of even applying for, competing for these grants. And so I \nthink that is a serious, serious weakness in the amendment as well. \nOrganizations like the YMCA would be ineligible to compete for the \ngrants even though they currently are doing a tremendous job in \nproviding after-school care in many cities and many school districts. \nSo to say it has to be school-based, run through the school, I think \nwould unfairly exclude those that are currently doing such a great job.\n  The application described in Senator Boxer's amendment is a laundry \nlist of paperwork. Read the amendment: identify goals, provide evidence \nof a collaborative effort, describe how the program would be \nadministered, demonstrate how the activities will utilize or cooperate \nwith programs, describe sources of other funds, provide a fundraising \nplan. All of these will require more bureaucrats, more administration, \nmore reports, additional costs, and it would in all of that duplicate \nwhat we already have out there.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n  I think it is the wrong thing for us to establish another Federal \nprogram when we have good programs there that need additional \nresources. We do not need to dilute that, diminish that by starting \nanother Federal program for after-school care for tutoring and \nmentoring.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider this, do not just vote for an \namendment because it has a good purpose, because it has a good goal in \nmind. Consider seriously that this program will be competing with a \nwhole host of Federal programs already designed to meet this need in \nour schools and among our young people. I think that need is being met, \nand it would be a mistake for us to create more bureaucracy and a new \nFederal program. I hope my colleagues will oppose the Boxer amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for \na question. As I understand what the Senator is saying, we have sort of \ngotten ourselves into this difficulty over the years by creating \nanother program and another program. How many programs did the Senator \nsay we already have?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. There are 19 existing programs for mentoring and \ntutoring on the books as well as a whole host of programs dealing with \nafter-school care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would advise the Senator from \nGeorgia has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  In reading the amendment, it appears to me this establishes a direct \nlink between the Department of Education--Federal--and a school. I do \nnot see from reading this that the grant process would run through the \nState's board of education or the district board of education. This \nwould be school to the Secretary.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is my understanding as well, which is another \nstep I believe in federalizing our local schools and removing the \ncontrol ultimately from the local schools.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I did think that was a philosophical problem, but I \nthink the more important issue that the Senator raises is this layering \nand layering and layering. We are struggling with that in every \ncomponent of the Government. I don't know how many programs we have for \nstudents. It just seems that we keep coming up with one after another \nafter another.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. With another new program, there is another layer of \nbureaucracy, another level of bureaucracy created. It really dilutes \nthe resources we have actually getting to those kids who are in need of \nafter-school caring and one-on-one tutoring.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas. \nI do want to address several of the remarks that were made by the \nSenator from California with regard to the legislation in general.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator indicated that the \nunderlying legislation could actually be harmful. I am puzzled by that \nstatement, somewhat stunned. And that we have not reached out.\n  The first point I make is that the underlying legislation, in great \npart, has been designed by a colleague of the Senator from California, \nMr. Torricelli, of New Jersey, who sits right next to her. The \nunderlying proposal has a significant component for new school \nconstruction. The legislation was designed and offered in the Finance \nCommittee by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, on the other side of \nthe aisle. The underlying proposal has a very key provision to enforce \nor reinforce States that have prepaid tuition to help children meet \ncollege costs, and that was designed by Senator Breaux, of Louisiana, \non the other side of the aisle. The underlying provision has a key \ncomponent to help employers help employees who need continuing \neducation, and that was either designed by Senator Moynihan from New \nYork or Senator Breaux from Louisiana.\n  So the underlying proposal, if you really want to add up just the \nfinancial impact, is 80 percent designed by the other side of the aisle \nand about 20 percent from our side. I guess in the general division of \nthe issues, it is about 50/50. But the underlying proposal will make \navailable to 14 million families and half the school population of the \nUnited States, or thereabouts, the benefits of education savings \naccounts that their parents or sponsors can open; will reinforce the \nprepaid tuition programs of 21 States in the Union, 17 of which are \ncoming on board; will support continuing education for 1 million \nemployees, 1 million students in these prepaid tuition programs, and \n250,000 graduate students.\n  I know we can have our differences about how to confront the issue of \neducation. It is good that we are having the debate. We all want to \nimprove it. We all want to get ready for the new century. But I don't \nthink it is accurate to suggest that the underlying proposition would \nbe harmful, A, or, B, that it is a partisan instrument, because it just \nis not.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 5 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Boxer's \namendment to the Education IRA bill because it will ensure schools \nacross our nation have the additional resources they need to establish \nand expand after-school programs for school-aged children. With more \nand more parents of school-aged children working outside the home, we, \nas a nation, must make a commitment to our children to ensure they have \nsafe and supervised places to be during the after-school hours. This \namendment would provide much-needed funding to schools to set up such \nprograms in their buildings or other public facilities, a cost-\nefficient way to provide children and teens with activities after the \nschool bell rings.\n  With youth at most risk of getting into trouble between 3 and 8 p.m., \nthis additional funding will help keep teens out of trouble during \nthese critical hours. I know how effective and important after-school \nprograms are, parents around the country know it and our law \nenforcement officers know it. In fact, a recent survey of nearly 800 \npolice chiefs from across the nation found that 90 percent of the \nchiefs viewed prevention as a key factor in reducing our nation's \njuvenile crime rates. In my opinion, the best crime reduction strategy \nis one which prevents crime from happening. The $250 million authorized \nin this amendment is a good investment, not only because it will \nprovide children with a safe haven, but also because it will likely \nlead to reduced crime rates in neighborhoods which choose to implement \nor expand their after-school programs.\n  I am particularly pleased with the flexibility provided in Senator \nBoxer's amendment. While no school is required to participate, those \nwhich do may use the funds for children of any age--from kindergarten \nthrough high school. Those schools which choose to participate would \nalso have the flexibility to decide what sort of programs to offer. For \nexample, schools receiving grants could engage in mentoring activities, \ntutoring or academic assistance programs, recreational activities or \ntechnology training. So long as a school offers at least two of these \nactivities, it would meet the grant's eligibility requirements. Schools \ncould also offer drug or alcohol prevention programs, gang prevention \nprograms, health and nutrition counseling and job skills training. \nThese broad categories of activities will allow the local schools to \ndecide how their children spend their after-school hours while ensuring \nthat the children and teens are engaged in productive activities.\n  Vermont is fortunate to have a wide variety of after-school programs \navailable for children, both on and off school campuses. I have been \nworking to ensure this diversity of programs continues. But, I hear \nagain and again from parents in Vermont that we need more after-school \nprograms for our state's children. Senator Boxer's amendment would \nensure one piece of the puzzle is better funded--after-\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nschool programs on school and public property. I plan to continue \npushing for other resources for after-school, evening and weekend \nprograms, including in S.10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \nAct of 1997. As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I have \nbeen fighting hard to ensure that S.10 has dedicated funding for a \nvariety of crime prevention programs. Senator Boxer's amendment is a \nperfect complement to these ongoing efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for a minute of my time to say \nsimply that Senator Coverdell criticizes my proposal because it is a \nnew program when he in fact is putting forward a new program. The issue \nis not about creating a new program. He doesn't like this program, he \nlikes his.\n  Senator Coverdell's proposal gives the average private school \nhousehold a $37 a year benefit; if you are in public school, you fare \nworse, $7 a year. And he likes the program. That is fine. But he \ndoesn't talk about these deleterious amendments that have made this a \nvery dangerous bill by canceling 20 programs that help our children \nread and learn. Programs created by President Eisenhower, Senator \nJavits, tried and true programs, are canceled, put in a block grant to \nlet the locals do what they want.\n  The fact is, the local districts like these programs yet this bill \nseeks to eliminate them. Other programs supported by local districts \nare rejected out of hand. The Senate rejects putting more teachers in \nthe classroom; rejects any national testing. This is a bill that has \nnow been amended in such a fashion it does harm to our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserved that 1 minute, if the Senator will take his \ntime now.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Please proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right, we will do that. I just ask the Senator, since \nhe has 5 minutes and I have a minute, if I feel compelled, will he give \nme an additional 60 seconds to respond to his concluding remarks?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield a minute of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is a good debater, so I want to have that \nopportunity.\n  But I also want to respond to the Senator from Arkansas. I am sorry \nhe is no longer in the Senate chamber. He has criticized this after-\nschool program because it is a new program. In actuality this is not a \nnew program. The after school programs that would be funded by this \namendment are going on. The local districts are doing a great job, but \nthey need help, and more want to do this.\n  The Senator from Arkansas criticizes this program yet his side of the \naisle agreed to it unanimously in the budget. We already debated this \nBoxer amendment, this exact same thing, in the budget resolution. The \nSenator from Arkansas didn't object to it then.\n  In addition the Senator from Arkansas cites a lot of programs that \ncould fund after school initiatives, but those programs are not \nexclusively for after school; they also could fund senior citizens, \nparenting skills, or employment counseling. There is no direct program \nthat responds to the fact that after school the crime rate soars and \ndoesn't stop until mom and dad get home.\n  Do you know how we pay for this program? By cutting the travel budget \nfor bureaucrats. This seems a reasonable price to pay to protect and \neducate our children after school.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator she has 1 \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do I have 1 minute remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her minute. She has a \nminute of the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will withhold until my \ncolleague completes his remarks.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I assume I have somewhere in the range of 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes left.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the first point I want to reiterate is, \nwe do have to acknowledge, apart from the amendments, that the points I \nmade a moment ago are all in the underlying bill: Education savings \naccounts for 14 million families, 20 million children. And I might \npoint out, those savings accounts will bring--when you use the figures \n$37 and $7, you are only talking about the interest that is saved \nbecause we didn't tax it in a given year.\n\n  When you talk about the savings accounts, you have to look at the \nprincipal, and what happens is, when we create them, Americans do very \nbig things and they go out and save, over a 10-year period, $10 \nbillion. That $10 billion--$5 billion will support students in public \nschools and $5 billion will support students in private schools, \nwithout us having to raise another dime. No taxes have to be raised, no \nproperty tax, no income tax. This is families stepping forward with a \nhuge infusion of money. We are building new schools; we are helping \nemployees with continuing education; we are helping millions of \nstudents with the costs of higher education.\n  To the amendment that the Senator has addressed, let me just say \nfirst, the amendment permitting block grants is totally voluntary; no \none is required to do anything. It is a 3-year experiment that says if \nCalifornia wants to keep the system the way it is, fine. If they would \nlike to experiment with the block grant, they might do that. If they \nwant to experiment with the grant going directly to the school \ndistrict, they might. But nothing is ordered.\n  Frankly, I am one of those who thinks the Federal system has become \nso ensnarled that it severely constrains and restricts local \ncommunities. We had a story here just the other day of a person--they \ncouldn't build new classrooms. They needed new teachers, but they had \nto have the classrooms to reduce class size. Because of Federal \nconstraints, they couldn't get it done. I think the idea of loosening \nthe flexibility is good.\n  With regard to testing, it is very controversial. There are many of \nus who believe national tests will set national curricula and that \nnational tests will be designed to enforce our current--could even be \ndesigned to ratify the current crisis we have.\n  My only question about national testing is this. Every week I read \nabout the condition of our fourth graders, our eighth graders, how we \ncompete with the international community. I do not find a shortage in \nthis country of understanding the crisis we have in grades kindergarten \nthrough high school. We know a third of the students get there and \ncan't read right. We know only four out of ten of the students in \ninner-city schools can't pass a basic exam. We know if we take all the \nschools and put them together, only 6 out of 10 can pass a basic exam. \nWe don't need any more testing. We need some innovation. We need some \nchange and reform like we are talking about. We know what is happening. \nWe are losing, as we come to the new century.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back my 20 seconds and dedicate my final \nminute to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is very generous. I thank him. In rapid \nfire, I will try to respond.\n  The underlying bill really does no harm. As amended, this bill does a \nhuge amount of harm, because it takes the National government out of \nthe whole issue of education for our children. It takes us backward, \naway from visionaries like President Eisenhower, who said the strength \nof the Nation lies in its children. The National Government, if it \ntruly cares about its children, should fill the gaps that are \nidentified by local government. And that is what is done away with in \nthe Gorton amendment.\n  Essentially, the Gorton amendment is saying to the people that \neducation is not important on the national level. We know if we scratch \nthe surface, many of our colleagues don't want a Department of \nEducation. That is what this is about. This takes away 75 percent of \nthe Department of Education's ability to at least in some way engage in \nthe educational programs helping children in kindergarten through grade \ntwelve. And to say that our children don't need any testing--you just \nask the parents if they want testing. How\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\ncan we talk about accountability without voluntarily testing?\n  So, in closing, I thank my friend for his generosity. I hope we will \nsupport this modest bill, to bring down the crime rate and lift up our \nchildren. It is paid for in the budget, and I look forward to a \nbipartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from California.\n  I think we are going to set the amendment aside for a stacked vote. I \nwithdraw my motion and will make the motion at the appropriate time. We \nwill be moving to debate on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to guarantee that we will have a vote on a \ntabling motion or an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have the Senator's word, and I am pleased with that. \nThank you.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe debate on the Bingaman amendment, it be in order for Senator \nCoverdell to offer a first-degree amendment regarding reading \nexcellence. I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in \norder to either amendment and, finally, that the vote occur on, or in \nrelation to, the Coverdell amendment prior to the vote on, or in \nrelation to, the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe vote on, or in relation to, the Levin second-degree amendment, if \nthe Levin second-degree amendment is defeated, the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of the Levin first-degree amendment, as \namended by the Ashcroft amendment, and the Levin first-degree amendment \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2298 and 2307, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder at this time to offer two amendments en bloc, an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator McCain on multilingualism and an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Dorgan regarding safer schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe reporting of the amendments, the amendments be agreed to and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, and that any \nstatements relating to these amendments appear at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2298 and 2307.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2298\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a study of multilingualism in the United \n                                States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. MULTILINGUALISM STUDY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that even though all \n     residents of the United States should be proficient in \n     English, without regard to their country of birth, it is also \n     of vital importance to the competitiveness of the United \n     States that those residents be encouraged to learn other \n     languages.\n       (b) Resident of the United States Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``resident of the United States'' means an \n     individual who resides in the United States, other than an \n     alien who is not lawfully present in the United States.\n       (c) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States (referred to in this section as the ``Comptroller \n     General'') shall conduct a study of multilingualism in the \n     United States in accordance with this section.\n       (2) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The study conducted under this section \n     shall ascertain--\n       (i) the percentage of residents in the United States who \n     are proficient in English and at least 1 other language;\n       (ii) the predominant language other than English in which \n     residents referred to in clause (i) are proficient;\n       (iii) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (i) who were born in a foreign country;\n       (iv) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (i) who were born in the United States;\n       (v) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (iv) who are second-generation residents of the United \n     States; and\n       (vi) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (iv) who are third-generation residents of the United States.\n       (B) Age-specific categories.--The study under this section \n     shall, with respect to the residents described in \n     subparagraph (A)(i), determine the number of those residents \n     in each of the following categories:\n       (i) Residents who have not attained the age of 12.\n       (ii) Residents have attained the age of 12, but have not \n     attained the age of 18.\n       (iii) Residents who have attained the age of 18, but have \n     not attained the age of 50.\n       (iv) Residents who have attained the age of 50.\n       (C) Federal programs.--In conducting the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall establish a list of \n     each Federal program that encourages multilingualism with \n     respect to any category of residents described in \n     subparagraph (B).\n       (D) Comparisons.--In conducting the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall compare the \n     multilingual population described in subparagraph (A) with \n     the multilingual populations of foreign countries--\n       (i) in the Western hemisphere; and\n       (ii) in Asia.\n       (d) Report.--Upon completion of the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall prepare, and submit to \n     Congress, a report that contains the results of the study \n     conducted under this section, and such findings and \n     recommendations as the Comptroller General determines to be \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment which \nwould mandate a study of multilingualism in the United States. This \namendment would direct the Comptroller General of the United States to \nidentify, examine and analyze the number of individuals who are \nproficient in English, but are also proficient in one or more \nadditional languages.\n  I believe that we can all agree that it is imperative for everyone in \nthe United States to be fluent in English in order to succeed in \ntoday's society. This is why we need to continue encouraging all \nmembers of our society to be fluent in the English language. However, I \nbelieve it is equally important for us to encourage all members of our \nsociety to understand English--Plus one or more additional languages. \nCurrently, I am working with members of the Hispanic task force in this \neffort to stress the importance of speaking English--Plus other \nlanguages. This study of multilingualism is a practical step in our \nefforts to encourage English--Plus the knowledge of many other \nlanguages.\n  As I have stated, English is clearly the common language in the \nUnited States and is an important aspect of our society and individual \nsuccess. However, it is equally important that we encourage and support \nefforts by individuals to become proficient in additional languages and \nbroaden their opportunities for success.\n  I wholeheartedly applaud people who have the capability to \ncommunicate in multiple languages. Not only do they posses valuable \nlanguage skills, but their knowledge of various languages affords them \na multitude of opportunities economically, socially, professionally and \npersonally.\n  The ability to speak one or more languages, in addition to English, \nis a tremendous resource to the United States because it enhances our \ncompetitiveness in global markets by enabling improved communication \nand cross-cultural understanding while trading and conducting \ninternational business. In addition, multilingualism enhances our \nnation's diplomatic efforts and leadership role on the international \nfront by fostering greater communication and understanding between \nnations and their people.\n  Foreign language skills also serve as a powerful tool for promoting \ngreater cross-cultural understanding between the multitude of racial \nand ethnic groups in our country.\n  The data collected from the study required by this legislation would \nenable us to identify the linguistic strengths and weaknesses in our \nsociety. Based upon this study we would be able to develop innovate \ninitiatives which would\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\npromote the importance of foreign language skills, while providing a \nbasis for expanding our nation's linguistic abilities.\n  The information we gather from this study will be invaluable in many \naspects of our society. It is important that we encourage and support \neverybody, no matter what their age, in learning one or more languages \nin addition to English, since the opportunities which exist for \nindividuals who can master additional languages are endless.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2307\n\n                  (Purpose: To promote school safety)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SAFER SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Safer \n     Schools Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 14601 of the Gun-Free Schools Act \n     of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 8921) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       (g) ``For the purposes of this section, a weapon that has \n     been determined to have been brought to a school by a student \n     shall be admissible as evidence in any internal school \n     disciplinary proceeding (related to an expulsion under this \n     section.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2298 and 2307) were agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe at this time the order of the \nday is to go to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. Is the amendment that I am proposing at the \ndesk, or should I send it to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator can send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2308\n\n              (Purpose: To provide for dropout prevention)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Bryan, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2308.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein and Senator Chafee. \nWhat I would like to do is very briefly describe what the amendment is \nand then yield to my colleague from Nevada for his comments. Then I \nwill come back and make further statements in behalf of the amendment.\n  The first obvious point is that there is a serious, pervasive dropout \nproblem in our Nation's schools. I see this in my State every day. I am \nsure each Senator who has visited schools in his or her State sees the \nsame problem. Over half a million students drop out of school each year \nbefore they complete high school, and they are joining a group of \nalmost 4 million young adults who have neither graduated nor are \ngetting a GED in lieu of graduation.\n  The second point is that dropout rates are disproportionately high \namong low-income and minority students. That is just a fact, which we \nwill get into more in the discussion in the minutes ahead.\n  The third point is that the cost of this dropout crisis far exceeds \nthe cost of preventing it. There may be some who suggest that my \namendment, by proposing to spend as much as $150 million a year, is \ngoing to bust the budget. I suggest that we are spending more on the \nproblem of unemployment, on welfare, on juvenile crime, on the \nincarceration of the 4 million undereducated young people than we are \nproposing in this amendment as a solution to the problem.\n  The fourth point is that there is no Federal funding targeted to help \nmiddle and high schools deal with this problem today.\n  The amendment would allow over 2,000 of the schools with the highest \ndropout rates in each State to compete for $50,000 restructuring \ngrants. That is what we are talking about, very small amounts of money \nthat would help these schools to begin the restructuring process to \ndeal with the dropout problem.\n  The fifth point is that the amendment does not add a new Federal \neducation program. Instead, it replaces an unfunded dropout \ndemonstration program from the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act.\n\n  Sixth, this amendment would provide funding to every State. It would \nallow local schools to determine what dropout prevention method works \nbest for them. We are not dictating the course or the steps each school \nshould take, but we are trying to assist them in beginning to take the \nsteps to deal with the problem.\n  Finally, reducing dropout rates needs to be a bipartisan national \neducation goal. It was identified as such in 1989. When President Bush \nmet with all 50 Governors in Charlottesville, it was the second \neducation goal we identified: At least 90 percent of our students would \ncomplete high school, would graduate. We have never had a serious \neffort to reach that goal. It is time we did. This amendment begins to \nmove us in that direction.\n  Before I go on to any further discussion, I yield to my colleague, \nSenator Reid, who has been a leader on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, I say to my friend \nfrom New Mexico, that I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair inform me when I have 30 seconds left?\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bryan be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I underline and underscore every word said \nby my colleague from New Mexico. This is a serious problem. The little \namount of money that we want to spend on this will save inordinate \namounts of money in welfare costs, costs to our criminal justice system \nand in our education system. This amendment, in my opinion, is the most \nimportant aspect of the legislation with which we have dealt. If we are \ngoing to do something about education, we have to slow down and, if \npossible, stop the dropout rate in our schools.\n  High school dropouts: Mr. President, unemployment rates of high \nschool dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. The \nprobability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high \nschool dropouts than for students who have finished high school.\n  The median personal income of high school graduates during prime \nearning years, 25 years to 54 years, is nearly twice that of high \nschool dropouts. That figure is startling.\n  The future of high school dropouts: What is the future? They may have \na job making a lot of money in lawn maintenance or working in a service \nstation. The median personal income of college graduates is more than \nthree times that of high school dropouts.\n  Among prisoners in the United States, 82 percent of the prisoners in \nthe United States never finished high school. That should send a \nmessage to this body loud and clear.\n  The children of dropouts have a much greater chance of dropping out \nof school.\n  The demographics of the State of Nevada and many Western States are \nchanging rapidly. In the State of Nevada, the Hispanic population is \nrising very rapidly, adding a great deal to the culture of the State of \nNevada, which is named after Hispanics--Nevada, snow-cap; Las Vegas, \nthe meadows.\n  The dropout rate among Hispanic students is 30 percent compared to an \noverall rate of 11 percent, about three times higher than any other \ngroup of people. The Hispanic unemployment rate is 11.3 percent \ncompared to 7.3 percent for non-Hispanics.\n  In 1991, Mr. President, 49 percent of all persons living in Hispanic \nhouseholds received some type of assistance. This is much, much higher \nthan any other group of people in the United States. This cries out for \ndoing something about dropouts, when the dropout rate is 30 percent, \nthree times higher than any other group.\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans will make up \nnearly 20 percent of the U.S. population by the year 2030. This bill is \nnot directed toward Hispanics, but Hispanics will benefit significantly \nfrom this legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need to make these changes. I congratulate and \napplaud the leadership of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Dropouts in high school are a problem we must address. We must do it \nsoon. The aim of our legislation is to encourage the type of innovative \nthinking that is working other places, adopt and use those programs \nthat work well. Each school would receive a little bit of money, \nbecause we found it only takes a little bit to make a great deal of \ndifference. I ask all my colleagues to join in supporting this most \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from New Mexico \nhas 7 minutes 39 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of that time \nand reserve the rest so that I can use the remainder to summarize after \nthe opponents have spoken.\n  But let me just go into this a little more in depth. I appreciate the \nstrong support of the Senator from Nevada. What this amendment tries to \ndo is to begin to focus our attention as a nation on what I see as a \nvery, very serious problem in our educational system. And that is the \nproblem that many, many of our students are not ever completing their \nhigh school education, in some cases are not completing their middle \nschool education. These students are leaving the schools in large \nnumbers, and we as a society are having to make accommodation to the \nfact that we have large numbers of young uneducated people coming into \nthe work force.\n  So what we are trying to do is to begin the process of focusing \nattention on it, begin the process of reversing this trend. Let me show \na few charts here, Mr. President, just to make the points.\n  This first chart is called ``Event Dropout Rates for Grades 10 \nthrough 12, Ages 15 through 24, By Race and Ethnicity.'' And this is \nthe period 1972 through October of 1995.\n  You can see on this chart that for the white non-Hispanic students, \nalthough they have had the lowest annual dropout rate of any group, \nthat dropout rate has been increasing, not decreasing, in recent years. \nSo this is a problem that affects everybody.\n  The non-Hispanic black students--that is this green line--it has been \ncoming down somewhat. The general trend is down. But it also is quite \nhigh and is not near where it should be.\n  Of course, the red line--which is the line that represents the \nHispanic students in our school system--it is by far the highest of \nthese lines and shows the seriousness of the problem. Dropout rates \nhave not declined in recent years. This is not a problem that is fixing \nitself; this is a problem that needs additional attention. Dropout \nrates are particularly adverse among the Hispanic population.\n  Let me show another chart here, Mr. President. You can see this is \ncalled ``The Status Dropout Rate.'' That indicates, rather than an \nannual rate, this is how many of our students have left school \nessentially before they graduate. You can see that this red line--\nrepresenting the Hispanic students in our school system--it is \nconsistently over 30 percent. We essentially are losing a third of the \nHispanic students in our school system before they complete high school \nunder the present circumstance.\n  There was recently a report done called the ``Hispanic Dropout \nProject Report, No More Excuses.'' That report makes the case very \nconvincingly that new strategies are needed, new efforts are needed, to \ndeal with this problem.\n\n  Let me show one other chart here, just because I know every Senator \nhere is concerned about his or her State in particular. This is a \nlisting of the dropout counts and annual rates for States by State, \nstarting with the State with the highest dropout rate. Unfortunately--\nand this, I am sure, is one of the reasons that the Senator from Nevada \nis so concerned about this issue--Nevada, according to this, had the \nhighest dropout rate in 1993-94. Next was Georgia, the manager's State, \nthat had an 8.7 percent dropout rate. And third was New Mexico, my own \nState, with an 8 percent dropout rate. That means, every year, 8 \npercent of the students in the school system drop out.\n  So over the period of 4 years of high school and even some part of \nmiddle school, we lose more than 30 percent in many of our schools.\n  These are crucial issues in my State. I run into this problem as I go \naround my State talking to parents, talking to school administrators, \ntalking to teachers, talking to the students themselves.\n  It is time for the country to act. It is not enough to just say, \n``This can get handled by the larger issues. We don't need to make \nspecial efforts with regard to this. It will take care of itself. As \nthe general educational system improves, maybe this problem will go \naway too.'' That is not an adequate answer. We need to do better than \nthat. The simple truth is that too many of our schools are not meeting \nthe academic, the vocational, or the other needs of students. Students \nare leaving those schools. They are bored with the watered down, \nrepetitive courses, and in many cases they are alienated by the very \nsize of the schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, I will reserve the \nremainder of my time until after the opponents have spoken.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield as much of our time as is \nnecessary to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who rises in \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, please notify me at 13 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment which would \ncreate a new program intended to lower dropout rates in our Nation's \nschools. It does replace a program that was in existence up until 1995. \nThat program is no longer funded, nor was funding requested by the \nPresident of the United States back in 1995, 1996, 1997, nor was it \nrequested by the Department of Education, as I understand. It is a new \nprogram, though, and I will come back to that.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment would amend title V of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize this new entity, and \nup to $125 million in that first year, with the objective which I \nobviously share; that is, reducing dropout rates.\n  Secondly, the amendment, as I mentioned, authorizes $125 million for \ngrants in that first year and authorizes an additional $25 million for \na national clearinghouse on dropout data.\n  In addition, it would create an office in the Department of \nEducation, it would create a new office of dropout prevention, and \nwould also allow for the creation of a dropout czar at the Department \nof Education to focus attention on this issue.\n  I say all of that because it is a new program not currently funded. \nIt is a Federal program. And that is important, because so much of the \ndiscussion that we have undertaken over the last 3 to 4 days and that \nI, as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on Education, \nhave reviewed over the last 6 months is that if there is one thing we \nhave too many Federal programs with too much overlap, and it is too \nconfusing and too burdensome. I think we have made great progress in \nthe last 2 days on this bill and in simplifying and streamlining with \nsome of the amendments as well.\n  The second point I want to come back to is that we do have a problem \ntoday in dropout rates, but we have made huge progress, huge progress, \nover the last 30 years. I have had the opportunity to go back and look \nat the statistics and the data in our task force. We need to do a lot \nmore. I encourage all of us, and maybe we can take it back to the Labor \nCommittee where we can really analyze this data and see what the trends \nmean.\n  But basically there are two points I want to make. I think we need \nfewer programs, not just another program, to address problems; and, No. \n2, real progress has been made in lowering the dropout rate among all \nsubgroups in this country, some more than others.\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n  The 1997 Digest of Education Statistics, produced by the National \nCenter for Education Statistics on this very issue, has a chart. \nContrary to what Senator Bingaman has said, let me go back and look at \nthe entire 36-year period, because I think it puts it in a much better \nperspective for us.\n  From 1960 to 1996, the dropout rate has fallen dramatically, from \n27.2 percent down to 11 percent. The dropout rate over this period of \ntime has fallen by much more than a half--almost by two-thirds. The \ncurrent dropout rate is 11.1 percent. In fact, if we look at the data \nfrom the last several years, we have not improved in science in the \nlast 30 years and we have not improved in math and we have not improved \nin reading. The one area we have improved in education in this country \nis lowering that dropout rate. I don't want to minimize the problem \nbecause I agree it is a problem, but we cut it not just by a quarter, \nnot just by a half, but almost two-thirds, down to 11.1 percent.\n  In the same 1997 Digest, we learn from 1972 to 1996, look at women of \nHispanic origin, the rate has dropped from 34.9 to 28.3--still too \nhigh. The intent of the amendment is to address the 28.3 percent, but \nit is the wrong approach, another Federal program. If we look at black \nmen, the rate has dropped from 30.6 percent in 1967 down to 13 percent \nin 1996. That is dramatic. Not by just half, but two-thirds. Currently, \nit is 13.6 percent. Women of all races, the rate has dropped from 26.7 \npercent in 1960 to 10.9 percent in 1996. I wish we could see that much \nprogress made in improvement in terms of science, math, and reading \nwhere we haven't seen any progress whatever. For men of all races, the \nrate has dropped from 27.8 percent in 1960 down to 11.4 percent in \n1996. So we have made huge progress over the last 30 years.\n  Senator Bingaman and I are both members of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee, and much of the data I refer to was reviewed in \nthe Senate Budget Committee task force. I do hope we have the \nopportunity, regardless of the outcome of this amendment, to go back \nand ask why the Hispanic dropout rate has gotten better but not as good \nas we would like and why for black men it has gotten remarkably better. \nI do not fully understand that and would like to find out in committee \nthrough hearings to see if we can address and if we can come up with an \noverall strategy.\n  I suggest we look at creative ways to assist all of our students. We \napproached that to some extent yesterday through the block grant, the \nGorton-Frist amendent yesterday, which really allows States and \nlocalities to identify problems like this which may not be in every \nlocality, which are not in every locality, every school district, but \nallow States and localities to identify for themselves what that \nproblem would be, and give them, through this block grant approach, the \nflexibility to decide how, for themselves, based on their priorities, \nbased on their needs, they can address that specific problem and spend \nthose education dollars that we provide. Clearly, our current system of \ncomplicated overlapping programs is not the answer, and therefore I \nhesitate and therefore oppose having another new Federal program in \nthis regard.\n  I have spoken a number of times about findings of the task force \nitself. It really comes down to having a fragmented Federal education \neffort; it ends up being uncoordinated. The General Accounting Office \nin our hearings presented testimony to the task force and noted how the \nFederal Government does target certain populations with a variety of \nFederal education programs. Again, the block grant approach through the \nGorton-Frist amendment still allows the existence of programs but you \ngive individual school districts or States the opportunity to use that \nmoney as they see fit or to keep those categorical programs.\n\n  The General Accounting Office, in this chart I will show briefly on \nthe floor, illustrates the problem that we have today by just having \nanother program. This chart shows target groups served by multiple \nprograms and agencies. In the middle is the target group which is aimed \nby the Federal Government called ``at-risk and delinquent youth.'' This \nis the area that the dropout rate potential student exists. Look what \nwe have today. Department of Agriculture has programs, Department of \nEducation has programs, Department of Health and Human Services has \nprograms, Department of the Interior has programs, and now we want to \nadd yet another program.\n  In fact, for this ``at-risk youth'' target group, we have 59 programs \nat the Department of Health and Human Services, 7 administered by the \nDepartment of Defense, 8 by the Department of Education, 4 by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, 9 by the Department of \nLabor, 22 by the Department of Justice, 3 by the Department of the \nInterior, 7 by the Department of Agriculture, and 8 by various other \nagencies. We have 127 Federal programs right now that are directed to \nat-risk and delinquent youth. We take it from 127 to 128. I think we \ncan't kid ourselves that by adding another new program to address this \nfundamental problem, that that will be the answer.\n  The task force also held a hearing on January 28 called ``Federal \nEducation Funding: The State and Local Perspective.'' It was made clear \nat the hearing that additional Federal programs, which have numerous \nregulations and are costly to administer, is just simply not the best \napproach. In terms of the Federal burden, the commissioner of education \nfor the State of Florida told the task force, using an example, that it \ntakes 297 State employees to oversee and administer $1 billion in \nFederal funds; in contrast, only 374 employees oversee approximately $7 \nbillion in State funds. The point being it takes almost six times as \nmany people to administer a Federal dollar as a State dollar.\n  For some reason, and it has been reflected on the floor over the last \n2 days, we had a problematic reluctance to ask the question, ``What \nworks, what doesn't work,'' and let us promote what works. I have been \ndismayed through the whole process of the last several months looking \nat education, looking at the sort of chart that you just saw where we \nhave 127 programs already designed to look at that at-risk youth. Is \n128 going to make a difference? I think not.\n  In summary, if you step away from it, we have a too-complicated \nFederal effort today. We don't need to have one more program in this \nalready incoherent structure. No. 2, we have data to show that we have \nmade, since 1960, dramatic progress, improvements in the dropout rates. \nStill, we have a problem. Still we need to address it. I argue that the \nbest place to address that instead of right now on the floor where very \nfew people have this data is in a committee, where you can debate it, \nlook at the data, analyze it, and say why is one group doing better and \none is not.\n  Third, the Senate did agree yesterday to the Gorton-Frist block grant \napproach which gives the opportunity for a State or a locality to \nobtain the same amount of funds and use those funds to address the \nspecific problem--whether it is the dropout rate or whether it is \ntechnology or whether it is more books, they get to choose.\n  For these three reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose and defeat \nSenator Bingaman's amendment. I look forward to working with him in the \nLabor Committee to address the issue that he has brought to the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senators \nBingaman and Reid today and I thank them for including my suggestions \nto be more explicit in how school districts use funds authorized for \ndropout prevention.\n  At my suggestion, Senators Bingaman and Reid added several specific \nstrategies to the activities authorized by their original amendment. \nUnder the original Bingaman-Reid amendment, funds would be authorized \nas grants to states and states would in turn award grants to public \nmiddle and secondary schools for activities like professional \ndevelopment and planning and research.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, schools could also use grants for \nremedial education; reducing pupil-teacher ratios; efforts to help \nstudents meet achievement standards, such as tutoring or enrichment \nprograms; and counseling for at-risk students.\n  I believe that the additions I suggested provide some concrete \nguidance to the states and represent specific, targeted strategies \naimed at the underlying causes of the dropout problem.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  Students at risk of dropping out need extra help and attention, such \nas smaller classes, counseling, and after-school academic programs and \nsummer school. They require more than the normal school program, but \nschools are strapped as it is and this new ``injection'' of funding can \nhelp schools provide these extra services.\n  For example, limited English speaking proficiency is a major risk \nfactor for dropping out school, especially for Latino children, \naccording to the General Accounting Office in their July 1994 report. \nFor Latino students born in the U.S., the dropout rate is 18 percent. \nFor newly immigrated Latino students, the dropout rate is 44 percent. \nFor African-American students the dropout rate is 12 percent and for \nAnglo students it is 9 percent, according to the National Center for \nEducation Statistics. Nearly one in five Latinos between ages 16 and 24 \nleaves school without a diploma [Hispanic Dropout Project, U.S. \nDepartment of Education, February 1998]. Whatever the numbers, in my \nview, one percent is too high for any group. Everyone needs a solid \neducation.\n  Other risk factors for dropping out are poverty, pregnancy, \nmotherhood, disruptive behavior, academic failure, and lack of skills, \nsaid the General Accounting Office and the National Center for \nEducation Statistics.\n  Dropping out of school can begin a downward spiral to delinquency, \nunemployment, disillusionment, drug and alcohol abuse and crime. \nDropping out forecloses opportunities for a lifetime--having children \nwho are poor and uneducated; lack of job skills; civic breakdown.\n  Public schools need help and the added resources of this amendment in \nan effort to bring concentrated attention to at-risk students and to \nprevent the downward plunge that can begin when children drop out of \nschool. We should not give up on these children but give them extra \nhelp to stay in school. This amendment can provide some help and I urge \nthe Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 3 minutes 27 seconds \nremaining and the opponents have 2 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to have the opportunity to summarize my \narguments at the end. If the opponents would go ahead and complete \ntheir opposition, I prefer that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think this would be the appropriate time for you to \ndo that and we will yield back and proceed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. You are planning to yield back your time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is there anything further from the Senator from \nTennessee?\n  Mr. FRIST. I reserve 30 seconds, but otherwise I have nothing \nfurther.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just respond to a couple of \npoints that were made by the Senator from Tennessee. He says we made \nhuge progress. That is not what the people in my State believe. That is \nnot what the school administrators and students and parents in my State \nbelieve.\n  The Department of Education report that just came out this year \nindicates their conclusion is that there has been no overall progress \nin lowering dropout rates during the last 10 years. That is the decade \nduring which we were supposed to be moving up to 90 percent of all of \nour students completing high school before they left school.\n  In 1989, when the Governors and President Bush met in \nCharlottesville, the goal was set at 90 percent. It was 86 percent \nthen. It is today 86 percent, according to the National Education Goals \nPanel. In the last 10 years there has been no progress, in spite of the \nfact that we have had this national goal.\n\n  Another part of the goal, in addition to getting 90 percent of our \nstudents to complete high school, was to eliminate the disparity in the \ndifferent groups in our society so that you didn't have such a large \ndropout problem among one group--in this case, the Hispanic students--\nand such a disparity between the problem with that group and other \ngroups. Clearly, those disparities have not been eliminated. The \nproblem is very much with us. It needs attention, and it is every bit \nas serious now as it was in 1989 when we established the national goal \nof getting to 90 percent.\n  The Senator from Tennessee says we have too many programs already. I \npoint out that my friend and colleague from Georgia is getting ready to \noffer another proposal here. We seem to have a double standard. When \nthe proposed new programs are brought up on that side of the aisle, \nthey are acceptable; when they are brought up on our side of the aisle, \nthere are too many programs. The reality is that there are no \nprograms--there is no Federal money focused on dealing with this \nproblem of dropout prevention. That is one reason we have never dealt \nwith it. It is not on the national agenda, it is not on the agenda of \nthe Department of Education, and, frankly, it is not on the agenda of \nmost of our States and school districts, and it needs to be.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to make progress on this, at some \nstage we are going to have to quit coming up with excuses. The title of \na report that came out this year was ``No More Excuses.'' To my mind, \nthat sums it up well. Let's get on with dealing with this problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back the opponent's time. I \nbelieve that would move us to the next order of business. This \namendment would be set aside for the stacked votes later this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is correct. The \namendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2309\n\n              (Purpose: To provide for reading excellence)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2309.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we have noted throughout this \ndebate, we have a lot of Americans who are exceedingly deficient in \nreading. When more than 40 million Americans cannot read a phone book, \na menu, or the directions on a medicine bottle, and only 4 out of 10 \nthird graders can read at grade level or above, new solutions are \nneeded--I might add, not programs, but solutions.\n  This amendment, based on Senate bill 1596, the Coverdell-Gorton \nReading Excellence Act, will help children learn to read. The reading \nexcellence amendment would focus on training teachers to teach reading. \nFewer than 10 percent of our teachers have received formal instruction \non how to teach reading.\n  My amendment would also send 95 percent of the funds associated with \nit directly to the classroom, which I know the Chair would applaud, as \nhe has been the author of the money-to-the-classroom legislation. It \nrequires that funds be spent on research-based reading instruction, \nmethods with proven track records. It provides extra tutorial \nassistance for at-risk children, as well as literacy assistance for \nparents, so they can be their children's first and most important \nteacher.\n  It is already funded. That is unique here. Two hundred and ten \nmillion dollars were set aside in the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill specifically for literacy work. However, this is \ncontingent on the passage of an authorization bill by July 1, 1998. The \nHouse has already acted and passed a Reading Excellence Act by voice \nvote on November 8, 1997.\n  President Clinton endorsed the Reading Excellence Act in his radio \naddress February 28, 1998, and has called on the Senate to act. This \namendment is a response to that call. I will read the actual statement \non behalf of the President of the United States:\n\n       But we need Congress' help to meet this goal.\n\n  The goal is that we are on track to give extra reading help to 3 \nmillion children at risk of falling behind.\n  He says:\n\n       But we need Congress' help to meet this goal. This past \n     November, the House of Representatives voted with bipartisan \n     support to promote literacy efforts in the home, the\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n     school, the community. Legislation with these goals is now \n     awaiting action in the Senate----\n\n  Not anymore--\n\n     which means $210 million in targeted assistance is now on \n     hold in Washington, not at work in our communities.\n\n  We are getting ready to end that.\n\n       So today I call on the Senate to pass this legislation \n     without delay. We need it. Our children need it.\n\n  That was the address of the President of the United States to the \nNation on February 28, 1998. This is the answer to the call. The \nresearch is overwhelming. Most recently, the National Research Council, \nat the request of the Department of Education, released a report \ncalling for a direct, systemic approach to teaching so that children \ncan learn to connect the letters of words to the sounds they represent. \nOur amendment does this by requiring that proven scientific methods be \nused, ensuring that 95 percent of the funds reach the classroom, and \nproviding teachers with the skills to help our children.\n  We should seize this opportunity, as the President requested, to put \nour children first, which, I might add, is the genesis of this whole \nunderlying proposal: Children first, system second. We have been \nfighting this system a long time, and we have bad numbers. It is time \nthat we put the kids first. This amendment is in complete sync with the \nnature of the underlying bill and does just that. We know you can't \nhave a free population, Mr. President, if it is uneducated. It denies \nthem the rights and privileges of American citizenship. If you can't \nread a phone book or a medicine bottle, you can't get a job. If you \ncan't get a job, you can't take care of yourself, you lose your \ndignity, you are robbed of everything that America is all about.\n  Mr. President, on April 17, 1998, I received a letter that was signed \nby Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape Communications; Carol \nBartz, chairman of Autodesk; John Chambers, president of Cisco Systems; \nEric Benhamou, president of 3COM; Floyd Kramme, a partner at Kleiner, \nPerkins, Caufield and Byers; and John Young, retired president and CEO \nof Hewlett-Packard.\n  It says a lot of good things about what we are trying to do here \ntoday, but the last paragraph is particularly poignant:\n\n       In our respective businesses, we are creating thousands of \n     jobs that our Nation's education system is not preparing \n     youths to fill. The 21st century economy will depend on one \n     resource more than any other--qualified people--and dominance \n     of the world economy in the next century will shift to the \n     nation that best educates its population. We are grateful \n     that the Senate Republican leadership understands the \n     seriousness of this challenge.\n\n  Mr. President, I can't think of a more fitting concluding amendment \nto the debate than the Reading Excellence Act. People have to be \nfunctional in our society. This amendment puts kids first. This \namendment helps American teachers to do this job. This amendment has \nbeen passed by the House. This amendment has been called on for \nenactment by the President of the United States and, through this \namendment, the leadership of the Senate. I hope that our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle in a continuing bipartisan spirit at the \nappropriate time will vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for those who may be in opposition, we \nhave some time, as I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not sure that I qualify for being in \nopposition because I will urge our colleagues to support this \namendment. I want to commend the Senator for giving some focus and \nattention on the floor of the Senate to the issues of literacy and \nliteracy training.\n  On next Tuesday in our Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords \nwill be having a hearing on our literacy legislation. It is his hope \nand certainly all of ours in the committee that we will pass out a \nstrong, bipartisan proposal that will incorporate a number of the ideas \nthat are included in the Coverdell amendment and a number of the ideas \nthat have been included in President Clinton's literacy proposal of a \nlittle over a year ago. As we all know, now that the President has \nasked the colleges of this country in the work-study program for those \nyoung people to devote time for literacy training, I take pride that \nour Massachusetts colleges are No. 2, with California being No. 1, in \nthe number of colleges where the young people who are benefiting from \nthe work-study program are actually involved in tutorial work. We have \ntried to get every one of the colleges in our State--there are 126--to \nbe involved in that tutorial work.\n  I think, the fact that this afternoon we are focusing on the issue of \nliteracy, hopefully we will pave the way for a bipartisan effort and \nfor an outcome that will result in our ability to utilize the $250 \nmillion which have been designated for literacy training as a part of \nthe budget of last year and was worked out in a bipartisan way. We may \nhave had differences on the number of the education issues that we have \nbeen debating in the past days, but I certainly hope that we can in \nthese next very, very few weeks have legislation out here that will \nhave a responsible literacy initiative.\n  Mr. President, we know that the Academy of Sciences has recommended a \nmodality for the development of literacy programs. If we take the \nCoverdell proposal, we will find it quite prescriptive in relationship \nto the range of initiatives that have been recommended by the Academy \nof Sciences that provide greater flexibility. How we eventually are \ngoing to come out on that issue remains to be seen. But the strong \nemphasis on the teachers that they be well trained to teach is \nsomething that we all would have common agreement on. The idea of the \nrole of the tutors under the President's program is an important role. \nI think under the Coverdell proposal we find that feature of it, \nhopefully, would be strengthened.\n  I think there is probably some difference in this body about the \nadministration of the program. Under the Coverdell proposal, you set up \na whole new bureaucracy effectively with your partnership program \nrather than working with the State programs. It is quite prescriptive \nin the naming of a number of members that will serve on various boards. \nYou have a number of States now that are doing some very, very \nimportant work. This would be a circumstance where I hope that the \nprogram would work through the State agencies that are in the Coverdell \nproposal.\n\n  I also believe that you have particular features in here where you \nhave the devoting of a good deal of money for assistance grants for \ntutors. I think most of those involved in literacy training feel that \nhaving a school-based system is a better use and a more effective use \nof the funds.\n  Mr. President, I hope that at the time we address this issue Members \nwill vote in favor of the Coverdell amendment. Then we will have an \nopportunity to vote after in terms of the Bingaman and Reid proposal. I \nhope that we will vote in favor of that as well.\n  I think the President's proposal and ones which will be advanced in \nour Human Resources Committee will give greater emphasis to volunteers \nand to tutors than would necessarily be the case in the Coverdell \nproposal.\n  We have under the leadership of our colleague and friend, Senator \nJeffords, the Everyone Wins Program, which is a reading program which a \nnumber of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been involved \nin at the Brent School on the Hill. We have good attendance from a \nnumber of our Members here where they go over and read each week to \nstudents. I think the kind of flexibility provided in the President's \nprogram as well as the kind of support for a number of school-based \nsystems has some additional credibility. I hope that we will support \nit.\n  I commend the Senator for giving focus and attention. I want to \npledge to the Senator from Georgia, as well as to our other colleagues, \nthat we will certainly work every way that we possibly can, those of us \non the Education and Human Resources Committee, to work under the \nleadership of Senator Jeffords who has really been a strong, strong \nleader on the issues of literacy long before many others in this body, \nand hopefully we will have a chance to all be together and join in \nsomething that can pass and be successful and\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nreally move us towards a country that has a real commitment towards \nliteracy.\n  It is interesting that, if you go back into the history of our \ncountry, in the early days of this Nation at the time of the birth of \nthe Republic we had a much higher rate of literacy than we have today. \nThat is rather surprising to many, many people. The reason was because \nof the reading of the Bible, because we had church-related efforts for \nliteracy in every community across the country in order that children \nwere going to be able to read the Bible. We had much higher degrees of \nliteracy at other times in our history than we have at the present \ntime. That is one of the areas where we have slipped. I think we need \nto call for focus, attention, energy, and I think some resources to \nreally galvanize the sense of voluntarism, which I believe is out \nthere, in an effective way to really make a dramatic impact on reducing \nilliteracy in the country.\n  I hope our colleagues will support that amendment. I commend him for \nbringing it. I pledge that we will try to work to find ways to get a \nmeaningful program.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls 6 minutes 59 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And they have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 7 minutes 8 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back here in \njust a minute so that we might proceed to a unanimous consent request \nto clarify for the Senate where we might head from here.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his remarks. As he has \nnoted, there are some differences remaining, but I pledge to work with \nthe Senator as we move forward on this amendment. There is still the \nconference. Maybe there are other differences that we might deal with \neven at that time. But I do appreciate the Senator's words in support \nof the amendment, and I am glad we are in a situation here where we \ncan, by and large, respond to the President. I think we would both \nagree at least on this point that there is nothing more important or no \nmore important skill than American citizens having the capacity to \nread. Again, I appreciate very much the genuine remarks of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the time on our side so \nthat I might proceed to a unanimous consent request if that is \nagreeable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take one moment. I hope we \ncan move forward. We may have a number of differences--probably will--\nin the conference, but this is an area where we really ought to try to \nget the best ideas that all of our Members have and then move it \nforward.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia on that. I \nknow I speak for all of the Members on our side on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee. No matter how the underlying legislation comes \nout, I will look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia and \nothers to make sure that we are going to get an effective bill. I am \nprepared to yield back the remaining time that I have.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back the time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We have now debated all outstanding amendments. I know \nthat may be hard to believe by anybody listening. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this next voting sequence occur beginning at 2:15, with no \nadditional amendments in order to the sequenced amendments and with 2 \nminutes of debate between each vote for explanation. I further ask that \nat the conclusion of the amendment debate Senator Byrd be recognized \nfor up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the voting series will be as follows: \nthe Levin amendment regarding vocational education, the Boxer amendment \nregarding after-school programs, the Coverdell amendment regarding \nreading and excellence we have just concluded, and the Bingaman \namendment regarding dropout prevention. It is my hope that following \nthe voting series the Senate could quickly move to third reading and a \nfinal vote on the Coverdell A+ education bill. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their continued cooperation and support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this bill. Some \namendments have been adopted, however, with which I do not agree, and I \nwould prefer that they had not been adopted. But that was the Senate's \nwill. Even so, I think this is a new approach and it is entitled to be \ntested. So I am going to support this legislation for that reason.\n  Mr. President, the Bible tells us that Solomon prayed for wisdom and \nknowledge. He did not pray for riches. He did not pray for honor. He \ndid not pray for the life of his enemies. He asked the Creator for \nknowledge and wisdom, and perhaps we in the Senate should do the same.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned by our Nation's failure to produce \nbetter students despite the billions of Federal dollars appropriated \nevery year for various programs intended to aid and improve education. \nTo put it simply, the sums of money invested in our Nation's education \nsystem continue to grow each year and, yet, the quality of our Nation's \nstudents does not keep pace.\n  Several Senators have championed efforts to improve the dilapidated \nstate of our Nation's school buildings, and I commend them for their \nleadership. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), over \nfourteen million students attend schools in need of major renovations, \nand I am concerned by this figure. Then, why, my colleagues may ask, \nhave I chosen to vote against an initiative to use Federal funds for \nconstruction of our Nation's school buildings? It is not because I do \nnot recognize the benefits or the need for better school facilities--I \ncertainly do. The GAO has estimated that the total bill for addressing \nthis problem nationally tops $100 billion. However, I have reservations \nabout the administration's approach to school repair and construction, \nwhich may be more appropriate for better-heeled school districts than \nare to be found in West Virginia and other rural States. Many poor \ndistricts do not have the ability to repay any loan, even an interest-\nfree loan.\n  We are right to be concerned about dilapidated school buildings in \nthis Nation. However, Mr. President, I believe that before the Federal \nGovernment embarks upon the new mission of providing massive amounts--\nand they will be massive amounts--of scarce Federal dollars for school \nconstruction, we should just step back and take a fresh look at why our \nstudents are not performing well scholastically. Is it due to aging \nschool buildings? No. Reasons much more fundamental than aging school \nbuildings underlie the poor academic performance by American students. \nIt is these problems which must be addressed.\n  Senators stand on this Floor and we argue about the benefits of tax \ncredits for education, we argue about funds for aging schools, we argue \nabout funds for private schools versus funds for public schools. Yet, I \ntell you that I believe we are all just talking past each other and \npast the problem. The problem is rather clear. It has two major \ncomponents. The problem with education in America has, as its root, (1) \nthe quality of our teachers, and (2) the quality of what they are \nteaching.\n  We have many good teachers and many of us owe more than we can ever \npay to our good teachers. I had dedicated teachers when I was a child. \nThey didn't get paid much back in those days. We came through the Great \nDepression. But they were dedicated. They loved the children that they \ntaught and they inspired us to excel. And a good teacher can do that, \ncan inspire his or her students to excel, to try harder, to work \nharder, and strive to be at the head of the class.\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\n  According to the Third International Math and Science Study, released \non February 24 of this year, ``U.S. 12th graders outperformed only two \n(Cyprus and South Africa) of the 21 participating countries in math and \nscience.'' This is deplorable, absolutely deplorable.\n  Why is it that from 1993 to 1998, education spending has increased by \n25 percent, and at the same time, results from the Third International \nMathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rank U.S. high school seniors \namong the worst participants in the areas of math and science? Why is \nthat? Why is it that in all three content areas of advanced \nmathematics, U.S. advanced mathematics students' performance was among \nthe lowest of the twenty-one participating nations? It is not because \nof lack of money.\n  James A. Garfield, one of the Presidents, said with regard to the \nvalue of a true teacher: ``Give me a log hut, with only a simple bench, \nMark Hopkins on one end and I on the other, and you may have all the \nbuildings, apparatus and libraries without him.'' He wasn't talking \nabout massive buildings, impressive halls and corridors. So why is it? \nWhy is it that in all three content areas, as I say, of advanced math, \nU.S. advanced--the best--math students' performance was among the \nlowest of the 21 participating nations? These are supposed to be our \nNation's stellar students, our Nation's best students. This is not to \nsay that all our students fall short. We have some excellent students. \nWe have some good schools.\n  I am 100 percent for education. In all my life I have endeavored to \npress to improve myself. I wanted to start at the beginning, start with \nmyself, improve myself. And I think I have--my colleagues know that. I \nalso wanted to help others. So, in 1969, almost 30 years ago, I started \na program in West Virginia to reward the high school valedictorians. \nAnd I started a program that is referred to as the Robert C. Byrd \nScholastic Recognition Fund. When I began it, I began it with money out \nof my own pocket. In the beginning, a $25 savings bond was presented to \neach high school valedictorian in the State of West Virginia. That was \nin 1969. After a while, I established a trust fund for purchasing the \nsavings bonds, which, in recent years, have been $50 bonds. I wanted to \nreward students--not the athletes, they get their rewards--but the \nstudents who work hard to excel in reading and in mathematics and \nalgebra and geometry and music and so on, encourage those students to \nexcel and to recognize them for excellence. As I say, we recognize the \ngreat athletes. We don't recognize the best spellers. Often I hear my \ncolleagues talk about their State's No. 1 standing in football teams \nand so on. The question that occurs to me is how well can they spell? \nHow well can they add and subtract and multiply and divide? How well \ncan they read? That is what we need to reward--the children who are in \nthe libraries and in the laboratories and who are working hard to \nimprove themselves, to get an education.\n  So I am 100 percent for education but I want to have some confidence, \nmore than I presently have, that my vote to spend the hard-earned \ndollars of taxpayers will produce a return to merit that investment. I \nhave been voting for Federal aid to education for decades--not just \nyears, for decades--since 1965, to be exact. That was the year in which \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed as well as the \nHigher Education Act. I have been supporting those acts.\n  But, we still seem to be losing the battle against mediocrity. I do \nnot want to vote against spending for education. But, Mr. President, \nwhen do we admit that we are doing poorly, and try something new? It is \nglaringly apparent from the results of the Third International \nMathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and other similar studies that \nincreased education funding does not necessarily translate--does not \nnecessarily translate--into higher student achievement levels. An even \nmore recent study, conducted by the Fordham Foundation, a private \norganization committed to quality-based reform of elementary and \nsecondary education, indicates the low quality of state standards in \nmath and science. In mathematics, the Nation flunks, with only three \nStates out of 50 receiving a grade of an ``A'', and just nine others a \ngrade of ``B''. In science, the United States is just mediocre, if we \ncan call it that, with nine States failing and seven earning ``D's''.\n  The Thomas B. Fordham Foundation found that our schools are also \ndoing a pretty dismal job of teaching history and geography. I quote \nfrom the foreword of the report on history: ``. . . the vast majority \nof young Americans are attending school in states that do not consider \nthe study of history to be especially important.''\n  Now think of that.\n  ``. . .the vast majority of young Americans are attending schools in \nstates that do not consider the study of history to be especially \nimportant.''\n  Napoleon said: ``Let my son often read and reflect on history; this \nis the only true philosophy.'' That was Napoleon.\n  ``No doubt some children are learning lots of solid history from \nexcellent teachers in fine schools. Their good fortune, however, \nappears to be serendipitous. State standards rarely constitute a \nceiling on what can be taught and learned. But it's not unreasonable to \nview them as the floor below which no child or school should fall . . . \nwhen it comes to history, most states have placed that floor where the \nsub-basement ought to be . . . in only a few instances is history \nitself the focus of the state academic standards that pertain to it. In \nmost jurisdictions, history remains mired in a curricular swamp called \n`social studies,' . . . ''\n  Social studies is all right. I don't have any quarrel with social \nstudies, but let's also have history. Let's don't substitute social \nstudies for history. There is no substitute for history.\n  History, of all things, is not thought to be important enough in many \nof our states to be taught as a separate subject, and that is most \nunfortunate.\n  Mr. President, merely continuing along this same path of \nproliferating education programs and investing more and more Federal \ndollars into our Nation's education system will not solve the problem \nof improving the quality of our Nation's students.\n  I congratulate our colleagues who work diligently on their committees \nto bring bills to the floor and manage the bills, who are highly \ndedicated to serving the students of the Nation and to improving the \nschools of the Nation and to getting better teachers. I congratulate my \ncolleagues for their efforts. They, too, must become discouraged.\n  On a fundamental level, however, there is something askew with the \nway we are approaching education in this Nation.\n  I started out in a little two-room schoolhouse along about 1923, when \nwe did not have hand calculators. Lord, have mercy--calculators? We did \nnot have them. We did not have computers or other high technology. We \ndid not have much money for supplies, just the bare essentials. We got \nby with spring water. We had only one bucket in the school room. A two-\nroom school; two buckets in the school. I was glad when the teacher \nchose me from time to time to go with another lad across the hill to \nthe spring to bring back the bucket of water. We all drank out of the \nsame bucket and out of the same dipper.\n  We didn't have any indoor plumbing. We had an outhouse--a couple of \nthem--and we didn't have electricity. When the storms came, we had to \nlight a candle or a kerosene lamp. So I do know something about so-\ncalled ``difficult'' conditions. I am one of those children who started \nout with the bottom two or three rungs of the ladder gone; they were \nmissing.\n  In those days, mathematics was about rules, memorized procedures, \nmemorized multiplication tables and other methodical tables. Science \nwas stern stuff. History was about dates and heroes. That is where many \nof us who went to school in the mountains and hollows of West Virginia \nlearned about our heroes, the people we wanted to be like.\n  There is where we learned about Nathanael Greene, one of Washington's \ntop generals, perhaps his top one. Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox; \nDaniel Morgan; Nathan Hale, who died on September 22, 1776, because he \nhad been asked by George Washington to go behind the British lines and \nto draw pictures of the breastworks and other military excavations, and \nso on. Hale was discovered the night before he was\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\nabout to return. He had these drawings in his pockets. The next \nmorning, he was executed.\n  He was asked if he had anything he would like to say. He had already \nasked for a Bible and a chaplain and had been denied both of those. He \nasked if he had any statement. He said, ``I only regret that I have but \none life to lose for my country.''\n  So there in our history books is where we children first learned \nabout American heroes, our heroes.\n  History was about dates and heroes. And with these basics, the United \nStates became a mighty industrial power, a leader in medicine, and a \nwinner of world wars. But, somewhere along the line, we seem to have \ngotten off the track. Today, our students have algebra textbooks that \ninclude discussions of chili recipes and hot pepper varieties. I made a \nspeech on this floor a year or so ago about this and brought the \nparticular so-called algebra book with me. And these textbooks do not \neven begin to define an algebraic expression until page 107--107 in \nthis particular book, so it is no wonder that our students do not fare \nbetter on international tests such as the TIMSS!\n  On Friday, March 20, I noted an article on the front page of the \nWashington Post, which reported a new trend among teachers to teach \nwithout the benefit of textbooks. The article discussed how teachers \nare increasingly relying on the Internet or on materials that they \nprepare themselves, and spurning the traditional student textbook. Now, \nwhat is the reason for this phenomenon? I quote from the Post piece, \n``Scientific knowledge is expanding so rapidly that many textbooks are \noutdated only a few years after they are published. Recent political \ndisputes''--get this; this is the Washington Post talking--``Recent \npolitical disputes over textbook content have made publishers wary of \noffending any interest group, and the result is that the books have \nbecome bland and shallow, some teachers complain. . . . Some teachers \neven cite a decline in children's reading skills as a rationale for \nabandoning the tomes.''\n  Mr. President, imagine that. Our kids can't read well enough to \neffectively digest a textbook. And furthermore, textbooks have become \nsuch worthless amalgams of touchy-feely, politically correct twaddle, \nthat many teachers are casting them aside in favor of doing the extra \nwork to prepare material themselves.\n  Mr. President, if we ever hope to improve the quality of students in \nthis country, it is essential that we recultivate an interest in \neducation for its own sake--education for education's sake--not only in \nour Nation's children, but also in their parents. Our Nation's ailing \neducation system is, in part, influenced by the parents of those \nchildren, and of young adults attending high school and college. \nParents need to take an active role in their children's education. \nWithout parental involvement, dumbed-down textbooks will continue to \ncreep into the local school systems, and it will be our children and \nour grandchildren who suffer.\n  I hope that we do not try to tell the American people that fighting \nover school vouchers or the size of an education IRA, or even the \nrepair of our school buildings will solve the problem of the often \nshallow, substandard, low quality education we are offering our kids \nthese days. I strongly suspect that our students' poor performance as \nscholars has a lot more to do with the general dissolution of the \nfamily structure, loss of respect for authority, rampant alcohol and \ndrug use by students even in the lower grades, and a pervasive change \nin attitudes about the value of discipline, than it does with \ndilapidated school buildings.\n  We can rebuild all the school buildings that we want, and, yes, I \nagree that we undoubtedly need to modernize and to rebuild some of \nthese structures, but let no one believe that school construction will \nsolve what is wrong with education in this country today. The problems \nassail us from many directions. How can our teachers teach if they have \nto create their own textbooks as well as attempt to maintain \ndiscipline, and please every interest group? When one considers the \nmeager salaries of teachers generally, and having to struggle against \nthe backdrop of a society that glorifies athletics and the attainment \nof any type of celebrity far more than it cares about scholarship, it \nis easy to see why good teachers are increasingly hard to come by. How \ncan mundane scholarship, which requires commitment and hard work on the \npart of the student, compete with sensational television and movies \nthat offer brutal murder, steamy sex, and filthy language as standard \ndaily fare for our young people? What in the world has happened to a \nsociety that is intent on rewriting every single discipline from \nalgebra to geometry to history to be sure that those essential basic \nsubjects are, first and foremost, absolutely politically correct? It \nhas taken us over lock, stock and barrel. We are pulverizing essential \nknowledge and facts to pulp, easily digested by even the laziest and \nmost undisciplined brains--baby pablum for the mind.\n  So, while we rage on here today about which political party will \ncapture the education issue, let us remember that we are only skimming \nthe surface with any and all of these well-intentioned solutions.\n  There is something much, much more fundamentally wrong with education \nin America today than a shortage of funding. The public school system \nhad better shape up, or else public support for it is going to \ncompletely erode. And I, for one, am willing to try some new \napproaches--new approaches--anything that may help our most precious \nresource.\n  The Democratic party is not our most precious resource. The \nRepublican party is not our most precious resource in this country. Our \nchildren are our most precious resource--our kids. And so I am willing \nto try some new approaches to achieve the kind of scholastic excellence \nthat our children need and deserve.\n  My only hope is that someday--someday--in some effective manner, we \nwill find the courage and the practical means to address what amounts \nto educational child abuse in this Nation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It should not make any difference whether the right approach is \nDemocratic or Republican. We ought to forget that stuff. That is mere \njunk partisanship. What matters is the education of our children.\n  There is no room for mere political jousting on a matter of such \nmomentous importance to our people and to our Nation. And that is \nexactly what the country is witnessing in Washington with regard to the \neducation debate--political jousting.\n  Mr. President, with U.S. high school seniors ranking 19th out of the \n21 countries in mathematics, and 16th out of 21 countries in science, \nwe must devote greater attention to stimulating excellence in \neducation. Getting back to the basics is the obvious starting point, \nand we better start now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, there \nare 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Parliamentary inquiry. First, I think it has to be \nsaid that was a startling speech by the Senator from West Virginia that \ncuts to the core. I do not think much else needs to be said.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now moving, by \nprevious order, to the votes. The first vote will occur on the Levin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Two minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncomments.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2303 to Amendment No. 2299\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The demands that are being made on teachers, as a matter \nof fact, are what is behind my amendment, which is to provide a credit \nto teachers who now have all these new technologies that are brought \ninto the schools to help those teachers go back to learn how to utilize \nthose technologies, should they choose to do so. These demands are \nhuge. We are putting a fortune into computers, software and connectors \nto Internet and everything else, but we are only putting pennies into \nthe professional development of our teachers.\n  This amendment would provide a 50 percent tax credit for the cost \nwhen\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nthose teachers go back for that training. It pays for it by not \nallowing the use of this new IRA in the K through 12 area because it is \nso skewed against public schools. That is the main point here. It keeps \nthe IRA increase for college education, and it keeps other parts of \nthis bill. But what it says is that withdrawals will not be permitted \nin the K through 12 grades because of the manner in which most of the \nmoney goes to private-school families, although they represent only 10 \npercent of the families with children in schools.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Levin amendment as it takes \naway the ability of parents to use educational IRAs to pay for K \nthrough 12 school expenses. It runs contrary to the whole purpose of \nthe Coverdell bill, which is to allow parents greater resources to meet \nthe educational needs of their young children.\n  Instead, Senator Levin wants to take these resources and expand the \nlifetime learning credit from 20 percent to 50 percent for those \nteachers who participate in technology training. A 20 percent lifetime \nlearning credit is already available to teachers for continuing \neducation, just as it is for members of other professionals. Let me \nremind my colleagues that the Coverdell bill already contains a \nprovision that allows teachers to receive tax-free technology training \nprovided by their employer, the school.\n  We all agree that it is vitally important for teachers to be \nproficient in the use of technology in the classroom, but this is not \nthe way to do it. This amendment takes the resources of an expanded IRA \nfrom our families, our children, and creates a more distorted and \ncomplex learning credit.\n  For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to \nvote against it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Michigan, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided, on amendment No. 2306.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How many votes are we \nhaving?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three additional votes.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Three weeks ago, my after-school bill was included in the budget \nagreed to by the Senate. It passed unanimously. Now what we are doing \nis authorizing the after-school program. It is paid for by cutting \nGovernment travel.\n  My friends, there is absolutely no national after-school grant \nprogram today. The after school program I am proposing today will have \ntotal local control. Community organizations and businesses will be \nbrought into school buildings that now get padlocked at 3 p.m. when the \njuvenile crime rate goes up. That is why 170 of the Nation's leading \npolice officers, sheriffs, and prosecutors endorsed after-school \nprograms, so we can lift up our children and raise their academic \nperformance, and keep them out of trouble. We cut Government travel to \npay for this program and use school buildings that are lying fallow.\n  I hope we will have a strong bipartisan vote for this amendment.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this is an old formula to identify a \nproblem and then you create a new Federal program that might solve it.\n  There is a problem. There is a problem with after-school care. The \nsolution is not to create yet another Federal program. We already have \nfour existing programs that allow for after-school care. One of the \nproblems with this amendment, or this program, would be that it would \nbe school-based, school-run, and, therefore, prohibit scores of \norganizations like the YMCA that are currently providing for after-\nschool care. They would be excluded entirely. There are 19 existing \nFederal programs that provide tutoring and mentoring for students on a \none-on-one basis. So it is simply unnecessary to start a new Federal \nprogram at a price tag of $250 million. I ask my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment of the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The question is now on \namendment No. 2309, offered by Mr. Coverdell. The Senator from Georgia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, may we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this is the reading excellence \namendment. It is designed to attack the reading deficiency. We have 40 \nmillion Americans who could not read a phone book or a medicine label. \nThe President of the United States called for this initiative to be \nadopted by the Senate. Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts spoke on \nbehalf of the amendment. In deference to time, it is my understanding \nboth sides will be agreeable to a voice vote, which I will call for \nafter we have heard from the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just commend Senator Coverdell \nfor focusing on the issue of literacy. As we know, President Clinton \nadvanced a literacy program in 1996. Our colleague, Senator Jeffords, \nhas been having the hearings on this literacy issue in his committee \nand has been a leader on literacy issues--child literacy, family \nliteracy, and adult literacy programs. I am very hopeful we will have a \ngood bill that will be strong and bipartisan in the very near future. \nSo I hope everyone will support this program.\n  I want to just mention quickly the concern that I have is that it is \ntoo prescriptive in terms of how it develops the programs. The Academy \nof Sciences has outlined a series of ways of doing it. I think we ought \nto consider that. It establishes a new State bureaucracy. I think we \nought to build on the States. The tutorial programs are not school \nbased, and I think they would be stronger if they were.\n  These are important issues, but what I think is enormously \nencouraging is that we have strong, bipartisan commitment to try to \nwork out in the very near future a strong bipartisan literacy program. \nI commend Senator Coverdell for developing this amendment and his \nstrong commitment to work with all of us. We look forward to working \nwith him to get a good, strong bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. My \nunderstanding is that the Chair is prepared to call for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2309.\n  The amendment (No. 2309) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2308\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, am I correct that the pending business \nis the vote on the Bingaman amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment tries to begin to focus \nnational attention and some resources on the problem of students who \ndrop out of school before they complete high school.\n  In 1989, when President Bush and the 50 Governors met and set some \nnational education goals for the country, one of those goals was that \nwe would have at least 90 percent of our students complete high school \nbefore they left school. At that time, 86 percent of our students were \ncompleting high school before they left. Today, it continues to be 86 \npercent. We have done absolutely nothing to reach this very important \nnational goal.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order? It is getting a little \nout of hand here. The Senator from New Mexico deserves to be heard, the \nsame as those on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank my colleague from \nKentucky.\n  This amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senator Reid, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Chafee. It is bipartisan. It is an important \nbipartisan issue. We have always before, at least since the national \ngoal was established in 1989, found excuses to not do anything to \nfollow up and achieve the goal. This time we need to go ahead and \ncommit some Federal resources to help local school districts solve this \nproblem. This amendment is a step in that direction. I hope very much \nthat people will support the amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator \nBingaman's amendment. Under the Senator's amendment, $125 million is \nauthorized for grants in the first year alone. It would create an \noffice of dropout prevention in the Department of Education. The \namendment would allow for the creation of a dropout czar at the \nDepartment of Education.\n  As Senator Frist so eloquently stated when the amendment was debated \nearlier, he suggested as chairman of the Budget Committee's task force \non education that we look to creative ways to assist all of our \nstudents, proposals such as the block grant, which the Senate agreed to \nonly yesterday, which will allow States and localities the flexibility \nto decide for themselves how to best spend education dollars.\n  Senator Frist argued that this amendment adds yet to the complexity \nof an already encumbered Federal Department of Education. I call on my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, prior to the noon hour today, the Senate \ncast a roll call vote on our colleague Senator Dodd's amendment No. \n2305 to H.R. 2646, the Coverdell Education bill. This vote to waive the \nBudget Act with respect to the Dodd amendment failed by a vote of 46-\n53. I was unavoidably detained in the Physician's Office of the \nCapitol, but would have voted against waiving the Budget Act. My vote \nwould not have altered the final outcome of the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so all Members will be aware of what we \nare talking about at this point--and I do not have a unanimous consent \nrequest ready at this moment, but I will have one momentarily for \nSenator Daschle to review--we will be having additional votes tonight. \nWe try to accommodate Senators' schedules, but we believe we can get an \nagreement for final debate on the education bill and then have a \nrecorded vote. That I presume would occur sometime around 7 o'clock, or \nearlier if some time is yielded back. That will be followed, if we can \nenter the agreement, by a debate of approximately 30 minutes on the \nresolution dealing with Northern Ireland and a vote after that.\n  I assume we will have then two additional votes tonight, and then we \nwill have a further announcement about the schedule on Friday, but with \nno recorded votes on Friday, and Monday with likely recorded votes, at \nleast a vote at 5:30 on Monday. But we will have that for each leader \nto review momentarily, and we will be asking for consent to that \neffect.\n  I yield the floor. Is any Senator seeking recognition?\n  I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In the interest of making sure we utilize all time that is \navailable, we have here and ready to speak Senators who are interested \nin the resolution with regard to Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3473-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3495-S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ACKNOWLEDGING THE HISTORIC NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Con. Res. 90) to acknowledge the historic \n     Northern Ireland peace agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  The Senator controls 15 minutes on his side.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I offer this resolution on behalf of myself, Senators \nKennedy, Moynihan; the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle; Senator Leahy; \nSenator Lautenberg; Senator Kerry; Senator Mack; Senator D'Amato; \nSenator Harkin; and Senator Biden.\n  Mr. President, today we are here considering this resolution when \nthere are renewed hopes for peace in Northern Ireland, hopes that \nspring from the successful conclusion of 22 months of negotiations on \nApril 10, Good Friday. I do not think it was mere coincidence that it \nwas during Holy Week, one of the most sacred periods in the Christian \ncalendar, that this small miracle occurred, the possibility of peace, \npolitical stability, and reconciliation for the 1.6 million people who \nreside in the six counties of Northern Ireland. Many people deserve \ncredit and congratulations for making this small miracle possible.\n  First, we should commend the individuals who participated in the \npeace process for more than 3 years and stayed the course. It took \ncourage on their parts, as Senator Mitchell noted, ``to compete in the \narena of democracy.''\n  I think it is fair to say that one of the giants over the years in \nNorthern Ireland and the Northern Ireland peace efforts has been John \nHume of Derry, a long-time civil rights crusader and respected leader \nof the Social Democratic and Labour Party. John Hume deserves great \npraise for his tireless efforts over the past 30 years to bring peace \nto his people. David Trimble, president of the Ulster Unionist Party, \nand Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, were also indispensable in \nmaking a final agreement possible.\n  They, along with other participants, deserve enormous credit for \ntheir persistence and determination, for their willingness to make \nhonorable compromises so that the people of Ireland can look forward to \na day when hatred and bloodshed are not part of their daily landscape.\n  Let me also take a moment, if I may, to mention a few of the other \nkey actors in this drama who warrant special recognition. First, \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair, who made the search for peace one of \nhis first priorities upon assuming office last year. He did so because \nhe believed that the people of Belfast ``deserve a better future than a \nlife of bloodshed, murder and disharmony.''\n  Equally important to the success of the process was the Irish \nTaoiseach Bertie Ahern, also was new to the office, who inspired trust \nand confidence in the nationalist community. They knew of his \ncommitment to ensuring that any final agreement would protect and \nguarantee the rights, freedoms, and traditions of the Irish Catholic \nminority in the north.\n  It goes without saying that the American people can be justifiably \nproud of the role played by President Clinton throughout the process. \nWere it not for the President's vision, perseverance, and unwillingness \nto give up on the negotiations, we would not be here today talking \nabout a new chapter in the history of Northern Ireland.\n  Perhaps President Clinton refused to be discouraged because he had \nlooked into the eyes of so many men and women during his visit to \nBelfast in 1995 and saw how deeply they yearned for peace, most \nespecially peace for their children.\n  Last but not least, there was Senator George Mitchell, our former \ncolleague, who shepherded the parties to an agreement. As someone who \nserved with Senator Mitchell, it came as no surprise to me that George \nfound a way to overcome what at times appeared to be insurmountable \ndifferences among the parties.\n  With patience, evenhandedness and acute political skills, Senator \nMitchell guided and empowered the parties to find common ground and \nfinalize an agreement.\n  The tireless efforts of Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith should also be \nacknowledged. She was there at every turn to keep everyone focused on \nwhat was happening throughout the process, and to ensure that at \nappropriate moments, the necessary encouragement from the United States \nwas forthcoming.\n  I should mention as well that our own colleague, Senator Edward \nKennedy of Massachusetts, played a very, very important role over many \nyears to encourage a political and peaceful resolution of the problems \nin the north.\n  There have been others of our colleagues here in this Chamber, \nSenator Moynihan of New York, Senator Leahy of Vermont, Senator Mack of \nFlorida, and in the other body Peter King of New York, Congressman Neal \nof Massachusetts, Ben Gilman, of New York, Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts \nall of whom have been deeply committed to finding a peaceful solution \nto Ireland's Troubles. I know there are others as well, but these are \nthe names that come to mind immediately who, for many, many years \nsought to bring\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nabout a political and peaceful resolution to the violence in the north.\n  The 67-page final document is a complex mosaic of provisions that \nendeavors to address the interests and concerns of the two Northern \nIreland communities, Protestant and Catholic, within a framework of \ndemocracy, justice and equal rights.\n  The April 10 agreement is in many ways the culmination of more than a \ndecade of efforts by the British and Irish governments to broker peace \nin the conflicted North. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Accord, the 1993 Joint \nDeclaration, and the 1995 New Framework for Agreement were all \nimportant milestones on the road to peace.\n  Perhaps the secret of success on this occasion was that all of the \nparties to the conflict were represented in the negotiations--each side \nsetting forth for itself its concerns and aspirations. Those concerns \nand aspirations have in turn been interwoven into the final text of the \naccord.\n  The August 1994, IRA cease-fire and the cease-fire by the Combined \nLoyalist Military Command that followed shortly thereafter created the \nopportunity for these all inclusive negotiations to take place.\n  There were clearly anxious moments over the last several years during \nthe quest for peace. To be sure, at times the setbacks and \ndisappointments that followed the promise of the 1994 cease-fire \nannouncements, left all of us despairing that the situation was without \nhope.\n  You will recall, for example, that the peace process was dealt a near \nfatal blow on February 9, 1996, with the detonation of an IRA bomb in \nLondon--a blast that injured scores of innocent people.\n  Frankly, until the restoration of the IRA cease-fire last July, the \nNorthern Ireland peace process had hit bottom, it had reached the point \nwhere, in the words of Irish poet Seamus Heaney, ``bad news is no \nlonger news.''\n  We are now once again at a turning point in the history of Northern \nIreland. The possibility of peace is as real as it has ever been.\n  As President Clinton has so aptly observed, ``to engage in serious \nnegotiations, to be willing to make principled compromises, requires \ncourage and creativity.''\n  The political leaders of Northern Ireland demonstrated that courage \nand creativity in finalizing this agreement.\n  It is now up to the people of Ireland--North and South--to ratify \nthat agreement in the upcoming referendums. More importantly, it rests \nin their hands and hearts to make the words on that 67-page peace \naccord make a difference in the daily lives of every man, woman and \nchild who calls Northern Ireland home.\n  On this day and in this Chamber, with what I hope will be the \nunanimous endorsement of every one of our colleagues, I pray, as \neveryone else does, that the people of Northern Ireland will have the \ncourage, wisdom and foresight to do that.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague, Senator Kennedy, is here on the \nfloor. If there is additional time, I ask unanimous consent for another \n5 or 10 additional minutes for people to be heard on this issue if it \nis appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues Senators Dodd, \nMoynihan, Kerry, Leahy, Lautenberg, Daschle, Mack, and D'Amato in \nsponsoring this resolution, which commends the many leaders responsible \nfor the achievement of the recent historic peace agreement in Northern \nIreland.\n  The agreement reached on Good Friday marks a turning point in the \nhistory of Northern Ireland. For too long, it has been a land \nsynonymous with bloodshed, violence and hatred. But now Northern \nIreland stands as an example to the world that agreement between \ndiffering ethnic and national groups is attainable.\n  The current Troubles in Northern Ireland began in 1969 and raged \nmercilessly in the following decades, to the great distress of the many \ncitizens there who wanted only peace and justice.\n  Many efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement over the years were \nunsuccessful. But finally, in December 1993, the two governments issued \na Joint Declaration, making it clear that if the groups resorting to \nviolence declared ceasefires, their political representatives could \njoin all-inclusive talks on Northern Ireland's future. The time was \nripe, and a hopeful formula for peace had been found.\n  I also want to especially credit John Hume, who for years tirelessly \nworked for peace in Northern Ireland. No one's contribution has been \ngreater. When the final history is written, the name of John Hume will \nstand first.\n  The courageous decision by President Clinton to grant a visa for \nGerry Adams to visit the United States in early 1994 was a key step \nleading to the decision by the Irish Republican Army to declare a \nceasefire in August of that year, and the Loyalist paramilitaries did \nthe same in October 1994.\n  In the years that followed, there were many obstacles, setbacks, and \ncrises to be overcome, but the parties never lost sight of the goal of \nthe peace.\n  A new British Government under Prime Minister Tony Blair was elected \nin May 1997, and a new Irish Government under Taoiseach Bertie Ahern \ncame to power in June. Both leaders and especially Secretary of State \nMarjorie Mowlan committed themselves to peace, and worked skillfully \nand effectively to achieve it.\n  Negotiations including Sinn Fein and chaired by our former Senate \ncolleague George Mitchell began, and Senator Mitchell's patience and \ndetermination were critical in guiding the talks to a successful \nconclusion.\n  Great credit also goes to Taoiseach Ahern and Prime Minister Blair. \nThey made Northern Ireland their high priority, and constantly urged \nthe parties to keep moving forward to agreement. President Clinton's \ncontinuing strong support was also indispensable in the success that \nwas finally achieved.\n  The participants in the talks also deserve great credit. They had the \ncourage to negotiate and to produce a fair agreement that reflects the \naspirations of Nationalists and Unionists alike.\n  On May 22, the agreement will be voted on in separate referendums by \nthe people of Ireland, North and South. Last Saturday, David Trimble \nsucceeded in obtaining the overwhelming endorsement of the Ulster \nUnionist Party for the agreement. I hope that the leaders of all the \nparties will work as hard and as effectively for a ``yes'' vote to \nconvince their followers of the merits of this agreement.\n  Hopefully, the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland will approve \nthe agreement in the referendums to be held next month, so that \nimplementation of the agreement can begin.\n  An Assembly must be elected. Changes must be made in the policing and \nthe criminal justice systems to reassure both Nationalists and \nUnionists that they will receive equal protection under the law. \nNationalists and Unionists will have to work together in partnership. \nAfter decades of animosity, this challenge is still very real, but \nNorthern Ireland's parties can rise to meet it, as the events of Good \nFriday have proved. And they will have the continuing support of the \nUnited States as they do so.\n  I thank the majority leader for scheduling this in an extremely \npressed time. Given the recent decisions that have been made, it is \nentirely appropriate that the Senate speak on this issue. We are very, \nvery appreciative of the majority leader giving us the time in a very \nbusy time to consider this resolution and support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I also thank the \nmajority leader. I know the pressures he is under. Everything is \nterribly important. As my colleague from Massachusetts said, he is \ngracious to allow us to bring this up at this particular time.\n  I ask--I know there are others, including our colleagues from \nFlorida, New York and others, who want to be heard on this issue who \nmay not be able to make it over to speak--that the Record be left open \nso their comments on the resolution appear prior to the adoption of the \nresolution.\n  If it is appropriate, I ask for the yeas and nays on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, for those Senators \nwho would like to have their statements on this resolution inserted, \nthat they be inserted at this point in the Record. I\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\nknow Senator Mack, who had gotten away before we made these \narrangements, would like his remarks included at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the \nResolution being debated on the floor this afternoon. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of this important statement of Senate support for the \nNorthern Ireland peace agreement. Like my colleagues, I believe the \nsettlement in Northern Ireland is an historic opportunity to bring \npeace to a remarkable people that have suffered from violence for far \ntoo long. And as a nation with deep cultural ties and personal \nattachment to Ireland, I believe we can all take a moment to be hopeful \nthat a new era of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is now \npossible.\n  First, I would also like to use this opportunity to offer my \ncongratulations to our former colleague George Mitchell for his role as \nIndependent Chairman of the multiparty talks. Despite long odds and \nnumerous setbacks, Senator Mitchell has demonstrated diplomatic skills \nthat can only be learned by being Majority Leader of the Senate. His \nactions have truly been a credit to our nation.\n  Mr. President, for the first time in centuries there is hope that a \nlasting peace can be achieved in Northern Ireland--I think our words \ntoday fail to capture the importance of this opportunity. The \nagreements that led to the April 10 accord are the result of brave \nactions by both Protestant and Catholic political leaders, and the \ndesire to find a solution to the cycle of violence that has virtually \nimprisoned all of the people of Northern Ireland for decades. I am \nconfident, when given the chance to vote in the May 22 referendum, the \npeople of Ireland will take the opportunity to send a strong message to \ntheir political leaders of their desire to continue to move forward in \nthis process.\n  In our euphoria over the recent agreements, we must not forget that \nlasting peace will only come with continued diligence. We must not \nallow the opponents of peace in Northern Ireland to use terrorism to \ndestroy what has been painstakingly built so far. Mr. President, with \nour strong support for this resolution we send an unmistakable signal \nof our willingness to continue to work with any and all people in \nNorthern Ireland dedicated to bringing about a peaceful and lasting \nsettlement.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. I rise as an original sponsor of the \nresolution acknowledging the historic Northern Ireland peace agreement. \nIn adopting this resolution, the Senate will demonstrate its strong \nsupport for this agreement which has been so long in coming.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1977, Senator Kennedy, Speaker \nO'Neill, then-Governor Hugh Carey of New York, and I joined together \nand issued this St. Patrick's Day statement:\n\n       We appeal to all those organizations engaged in violence to \n     renounce their campaigns of death and destruction and return \n     to the path of life and peace. And we appeal as well to our \n     fellow Americans to embrace this goal of peace, and to \n     renounce any action that promotes the current violence or \n     provides support or encouragement for organizations engaged \n     in violence.\n\n  Now, finally, one of the oldest conflicts in Europe has the potential \nof healing and being resolved. A courageous agreement has been reached \nin Northern Ireland. We in the United States Senate can be particularly \nproud of the role that our former colleague and leader George Mitchell \nplayed in mediating this agreement. He deserves no less than the Nobel \nPeace Prize.\n  The search for a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland has \nentered a most promising stage. This resolution indicates the strong \nsupport of the United States Senate for this historic agreement. May it \nfulfill our hopes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr, President, I rise today to commend the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), \nand the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) for introducing S. Con. \nRes. 90, which acknowledges the historic Northern Ireland peace \nagreement, and congratulates the individuals who made the agreement \npossible.\n  Just today, in my home state of Wisconsin, leaders representing all \nsides of the Northern Ireland peace process gathered in Milwaukee for a \nNational Symposium on Prospects for Peace in Northern Ireland, \nsponsored by the George F. Kennan Forum on International Affairs. Mr. \nPresident, this conference was planned long before the historic peace \nagreement was announced. I am pleased that the attendees were able to \ncome to Milwaukee with a viable agreement already on the table. The \nspeakers at today's conference, who were involved in the negotiations \nof the peace agreement, discussed both the agreement itself and \nprospects for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.\n  In light of this resolution, I want to repeat some of my remarks for \nthe peace symposium.\n  The recent agreement reached by the parties to the conflict in \nNorthern Ireland offers real hope for an end to three decades of \nviolence in that troubled land. This historic step is the product of a \nnew commitment to peace by parties on all sides of this longstanding \nconflict.\n  It is proper that this resolution commends President Clinton for \nmaking the search for an end to the conflict in Northern Ireland a top \nforeign policy priority. My former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, \ndeserves special recognition from this body for his leadership in \nhelping move the parties to an agreement. Above all, we commend the \nleaders from all sides of this conflict, many of whom worked tirelessly \non this agreement, and had the will to put ancient hatreds aside and \nmake peace their priority.\n  Now the success of the agreement rests in the hands of the people of \nNorthern Ireland, who continue to review the details and, eventually, \nwill have the opportunity to express themselves democratically through \na referendum. Let us hope that all the parties will be able to commit \nto this process and that none will turn to the sectarian violence of \nthe past. It is now the duty of all who seek peace to resist the \nefforts of those who may seek to undermine the accords through \nviolence.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe this \nagreement signals new hope for longstanding conflicts around in the \nworld. Just a few years ago, many saw the conflicts in South Africa and \nNorthern Ireland as intractable, but today one has been peacefully \nresolved and the other has made tremendous progress, as we recognize \nwith this resolution.\n  So, Mr. President, I am happy to support this resolution with hope \nfor the future, and commend the brave leaders who have taken a risk for \npeace in Northern Ireland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on Good Friday a landmark agreement was \nreached in Northern Ireland to start down the road to bring to an end \ndecades of violent hostilities, and reshape fundamentally the political \ninstitutions of that province. All Americans have reason to be very \npleased that the many competing political factions in Northern Ireland \nwere able to resolve their longstanding, bitter disagreements.\n  Today I want to express my particular appreciation of the splendid \nefforts of President Clinton's Special Advisor on Ireland, former \nSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell. It comes as no surprise to me \nthat those closest to these negotiations believe that were it not for \nthe tireless efforts of Senator Mitchell, this agreement would not have \nbeen reached. Having worked with Senator Mitchell for nearly fifteen \nyears on many complex issues, I can certainly attest to his unique \nability to forge an agreement that most thought unachievable.\n  Senator Mitchell's many fine attributes served him well in the U.S. \nSenate, and helped prepare him for the tremendous challenges he faced \nas chairman of the multi-party talks in Northern Ireland:\n  He has the patience to listen to the contentions of people whose \ndifferences have existed for some three hundred years. Twenty-two \nmonths of talks may well have worn out a less capable, less disciplined \nperson.\n  Senator Mitchell also brought with him to Belfast the Senate's \nrespect for full and fair debate. As chairman of these talks, he \nensured that all voices at the table were permitted to speak.\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nHe knew well that in the end, a successful agreement required that all \nparties felt that they had been listened to.\n  He possesses unrivaled negotiating skills. When needed, Senator \nMitchell called upon Prime Ministers Blair of Great Britain and Ahern \nof Ireland, as well as President Clinton, in order to urge the \nparticipants to keep the talks alive. He also had the strategic \nthinking to set a deadline to end the talks.\n  Senator Mitchell was persistent in bringing about this agreement. \nDespite the long odds, he never gave up in his core belief that newborn \nchildren in Northern Ireland deserve the same chance as his six-month-\nold son to have peace, stability and reconciliation.\n  Finally, Senator Mitchell believed in compromise. Unionists and \nnationalists were clearly far apart when these talks began, as they had \nbeen for decades. Senator Mitchell was able to forge an agreement that \ngave just enough to both sides so that each could declare victory. \nIndeed, this ability to bridge differences helped create our very \nnation, as our Founding Fathers crafted a Constitution that satisfied \nthe big states--that sought representation by population--and the small \nstates, that sought representation by states.\n  Mr. President, George Mitchell's accomplishment in Northern Ireland \nmakes us all very proud of him and proud of American values and ideals. \nIn announcing the Good Friday Agreement, he stated, ``it doesn't take \ncourage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head, or to murder an \nunarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the arena of \ndemocracy as these men and women are tonight.''\n  Senator Mitchell knows the value of this competition of ideas from \nhis days in this institution. He recognizes that a government which \nupholds this competition of ideas serves its people best. The people of \nNorthern Ireland have recognized this basic truth as well. We salute \nGeorge Mitchell, a true statesman who has helped begin the end of one \nof the world's most intractable conflicts.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 90, which acknowledges the historic \nNorthern Ireland Peace Agreement reached just two weeks ago.\n  Both the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United \nKingdom have worked for many years to facilitate a peaceful resolution \nto the conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost so many lives and \ncaused so much suffering. Ultimately, it was the willingness of the \nrepresentatives of Northern Ireland's political parties to adhere to \nthe principles of non-violence that helped create an atmosphere that \nled to this most historic agreement.\n  I commend all those who helped lay the groundwork for this \nachievement: Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and \nPresident Clinton for their dedication to the peace process. And I am \nespecially proud of my former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, for \nhis patient and herculean efforts to heal the deep wounds of this \ntragic conflict.\n  It will come as no surprise to my fellow Mainers and my Senate \ncolleagues that Senator Mitchell would be unduly modest in recognizing \nthe role he has played. As he noted, it may be true that the agreement \nalone ``guarantees nothing.'' But it does bestow the precious gift of \nhope upon a people who finally have ``the chance for a better future.''\n  In his quiet, understated way, George Mitchell brought individuals \nwho had been in conflict for the past thirty years out of the shadows \nof distrust and into the light of faith--faith in a nonviolent, \ndemocratic resolution. As one of the participants in the talks \ncommented, ``Here the United States sent one of its most able, skilled, \ntalented, humble politicians, a supreme diplomat, and frankly we didn't \ndeserve him.''\n  That is a poignant and appropriate tribute to a man who has helped \nbring the promise of peace to a region most deserving of its blessings. \nAs one who served with him in the Congress for nearly 15 years, I am \nproud to extend my gratitude to Senator Mitchell for his extraordinary \nwork. And I do so knowing that the honor which would please George \nMitchell most would be the true and lasting success of the remarkable \nagreement he helped to broker.\n  May the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement finally bring an end to the \nfear and suffering, and may the future of Northern Ireland be as bright \nas the spirit and potential of her extraordinary people.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it was Samuel Johnson who said in 1777 \nthat the knowledge that you will be hanged in a fortnight does wonders \nto concentrate your mind. In 1998, former Senate Majority Leader and \nMaine Senator George Mitchell proved the truth of this aphorism by \ngiving the Northern Ireland peace talks a deadline, placing upon these \nnegotiations the equivalent, if you will, of a ``sunset'' provision \nthat left the parties no alternative but finally to come up with a real \nsolution.\n  This deadline accomplished its purpose: it concentrated their minds \nwonderfully, and this led directly to the historic Stormont Agreement. \nSome years ago it scarcely seemed possible to imagine a Northern \nIreland in which children could grow up without fear of sectarian \nviolence and bloodshed. Today, however, this brighter future is not \nonly imaginable--it is very nearly here.\n  That Senator Mitchell should possess such statesmanship and political \nacumen is, of course, no surprise in my home state of Maine. Senator \nMicthell is greatly admired in this country for his work on behalf of \nMaine and on behalf of all Americans. Today, however, the people of \nNorthern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland--and peace-loving people \neverywhere--also owe Senator Mitchell a great debt for helping steer \nthese talks to their successful conclusion.\n  It is my great hope that with his statesmanship and steady hand, \nSenator Mitchell has now made it possible to achieve a real \nreconciliation in Northern Ireland--and for the Irish people to go \nabout building their future together, in cooperation rather than in \nconflict.\n  And I am very pleased that the Senate tonight will pass legislation \nexpressing our support for the Irish peace process and the brighter \nfuture represented by the Stormont Agreement.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in the \nUnited States Senate in congratulating the people of Northern Ireland \nfor their tremendous courage and perseverence which allowed for the \nsigning of the historic peace agreement. With continued political \nleadership and the inspiring dedication of the Northern Ireland people, \nI am optimistic that peace may be at hand.\n  I traveled to Northern Ireland this past January. In fact, I arrived \non the date that the latest initiative which led to the peace agreement \narrived: January 12. During three days there, as the parties reviewed \nthe details and held discussions with their constituencies, I developed \na deep admiration for the political leaders who eventually accepted \nthis agreement.\n  The concurrent resolution which we are submitting today seeks to \nthank all of the people who contributed to this peace agreement; I wish \nto personally thank all of the people who spent time listening to and \ntalking with me.\n  Mr. President, I learned a great deal about politics and courage from \nthe representatives of the political parties in Northern Ireland. I \nfound that politicians in Northern Ireland share many of the challenges \nthat politicians face in the United States Senate. Specifically, they \noften spend hours of each day in very difficult negotiations which may \nresult in dramatic changes in the lives of those they represent. \nFollowing these meetings, they face their constituencies and justify \ntheir actions. The difference, however, between our jobs and theirs \nlies in the stakes. These people literally risked their lives by \nengaging in the peace process; they risked their lives to endorse this \nagreement; and they continue to bear this risk as the process \ncontinues.\n  Mr. President, the American people recognize the incredible risks \nthese leaders take, and we thank them. To these brave men and women, \nhowever, the reward diminishes the risk. If this agreement succeeds as \nplanned, it may alter the course of history. Because of this brave \nsacrifice, the people of Northern Ireland have the promise of\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nsecurity, freedom, prosperity and an end to indiscriminate killings and \nterrorist acts.\n  Mr. President, our concurrent resolution thanks a lot of people. But \nfor me, the most inspiring people I met were outside of Belfast. The \nrole of the community leaders cannot be overemphasized. While the \nnegotiations proceeded in Belfast, at homes, neighborhoods and towns \nacross the region, people were building local relationships which \ncrossed borders and communities. These are the true heroes of the peace \nprocess. The people I met are making changes and making a differences \nwhere they live. They support the political process, but were not \nwaiting around for anything coming from the capitals. Spending time \namong the people in the border regions, with the strongest faith in \ntheir abilities to make a difference in their own towns and \nneighborhoods, I became convinced that peace had a chance in Northern \nIreland.\n  I salute all of the people of Ireland and Norther Ireland today who \nhave labored for peace. They are the driving force behind the peace \nprocess, and they will make it work.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have a few remarks I would like to make on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kennedy and Dodd for their \ncomments. I thought it appropriate today, without another day going by, \nthat the U.S. Senate express itself on this very important issue on \nbehalf of the American people. That is why we made sure that we brought \nit up and had these few minutes to discuss this resolution, and that we \nput on the Record our salutations to those who have been involved in \nthese negotiations. We offer our congratulations to all the \nparticipants in the negotiations. I think they deserve recognition for \ntheir willingness to make honorable compromises in order to reach this \nagreement.\n  I think particular credit goes to our former colleague, Senator \nGeorge Mitchell, for his persistence and his doggedness. Frankly, I \nwasn't sure that it could be pulled off, but he stayed with it. I think \nwe owe him a debt of gratitude for his work.\n  Also, of course, I commend Prime Minister Tony Blair and Taoiseach \nBertie Ahearn for their involvement and leadership. I believe the \nAmerican people are proud of the contributions the United States and \nour President have made to this effort. We hope it will lead to \napproval in the May 22 referendums. Most of all, we hope it will lead \nto a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. That is the desire and that is \nthe prayer of the people in Northern Ireland, in America and, \nhopefully, throughout the world. I endorse this resolution.\n  I have no further request for time. I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been \ncommunicating. We do have an agreement we think is a fair way to \nconclude the debate on the education bill and also an agreement with \nregard to how the State Department reorganization conference report \nwill be considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3495-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Coverdell \nA+ education bill be advanced to third reading and that there be 3 \nhours 40 minutes of remaining debate time, to be equally divided in the \nusual form; and that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the Coverdell A+ bill.\n  I am hoping that Senators have had an opportunity to say what they \nneed to say on this. Those who want to make closing remarks will be \nfree to do so under this agreement, but it would be all right with the \nmajority leader and the Senate if we did not have to use the full 3 \nhours 40 minutes. At that time, we will have a recorded vote, if this \nagreement is entered into, on the education bill, followed by a vote on \nthe Irish resolution.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday, the Senate \nbegin consideration of the conference report to accompany the State \nDepartment reorganization bill under the consent agreement of March 31, \nand that the vote occur on adoption of the conference report at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, April 27, with 10 minutes of debate remaining for \nclosing remarks to be equally divided just prior to the vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate reconvenes on \nMonday, April 27, following morning business, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the NATO enlargement treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we will \nhave two votes back to back around, I presume, 7:30, hopefully. Then we \nwill have the State Department reorganization debate on Friday, with no \nrecorded votes. The next recorded vote after tonight will be at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday. We will have no other subject debated on Monday other \nthan NATO enlargement. We will stay on NATO enlargement until Senators \nfeel they are prepared to vote. Hopefully, by having that debate Monday \nand votes on amendments perhaps on Tuesday and Wednesday, we can come \nto a conclusion on Wednesday, but we will not hurry this most important \nissue and deliberation of the Senate with regard to the NATO \nenlargement treaty.\n  Therefore, that will be the schedule for the remainder of this week \nand through some part of Wednesday of next week.\n  I yield the floor, and we can now begin the debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3499-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3499-S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order just stated, the Senate will \nnow resume discussion and debate of H.R. 2646.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to speak \non this bill. I take this opportunity to do so now.\n  Prior to yesterday, it was my full intention to vote for this bill. \nAfter yesterday, I regret to say I have some serious problems with it \nand cannot vote for it at this time, but I will, if the problems are \nremedied, vote for this bill when it comes out of conference.\n  Let me speak just briefly about what the problems are and then why I \nthink the Coverdell-Torricelli bill is so important and groundbreaking.\n  Yesterday, this body accepted on a 50-to-49 vote an amendment to \nconvert over $10 billion in currently targeted Federal education funds \nto a block grant to States. With adoption of this amendment, our \nefforts to direct limited Federal funds to national priorities are \nobliterated. Funds for disadvantaged students, funds to make schools \nsafe and drug-free, funds for meeting national student achievement \ngoals--virtually gone.\n  For ESEA Title I, the bill as it now stands deletes important \nrequirements:\n  Requirements for student performance standards and assessment, \nsomething that I believe is vital if we are going to change the \ndownward trend of public education in this country.\n  Requirements for evaluating a program's effectiveness. How could \nsomeone oppose that?\n  Requirements to take corrective action if programs are not effective. \nYou mean, don't change a program if you find out it is not effective?\n  And requirements that Federal funds not supplant State and local \nfunds. That was the Gorton amendment.\n\n  Secondly, that same day the Senate adopted, on a 52-47 vote, an \namendment which would prohibit voluntary national testing of students. \nLast year, this body worked out a bipartisan compromise on reading and \nmath testing\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nunder which States and local school districts could participate in \nnational achievement tests, if they wished, voluntarily. Many, \nincluding several school districts in California, have agreed to \nparticipate. A good thing. Without national tests we have no way of \ncomparing student performance, therefore, the success of individual \nStates in educating their students from State to State. This was the \nAshcroft amendment. It would abolish these voluntary tests.\n  Both of these amendments run counter to my very strong education \nbeliefs. And more importantly, I believe they obliterate any chance of \na veto being overridden by this body. I think that is really too bad, \nbecause I was one Democrat who was planning to vote to override a \nPresidential veto if necessary because I believe the Coverdell-\nTorricelli bill breaks important ground which I, frankly, am pleased to \nstand and support and defend.\n  I have heard the bill called a lot of things: ``A voucher system.'' \nIn my view, it isn't. A ``subsidy to private institutions.'' In my \nview, it isn't. A ``gift to the wealthy.'' In my view, it isn't. I have \nheard it said that it is ``bad education policy.'' I disagree. ``Bad \ntax policy.'' I disagree.\n  What this bill is, is an encouragement to save for education in a \nsociety that lives on credit and saves very little. In my book, that is \ngood. I intended to vote for this bill.\n  Last year, as you all know, we had the IRA savings accounts for \nhigher education of $500. Both political parties thought that was good. \nThat would be extended to $2,000 and extended down through elementary \nschool by this bill, whether the family that saves wants to spend that \nmoney in a public institution, a private institution, a religious or a \nparochial institution. I think that is good, sound public policy.\n  I have heard it said this is only for the rich. I suppose the reason \nfor that is because these special savings accounts would be available \nto couples earning under $150,000 and single people earning under \n$95,000. And some people say, ``Why should we give them any benefit?'' \nWell, let me tell you, in my view, saving for education makes sense, \nwhether you make $30,000 a year or $90,000 a year. It is good and we \nshould encourage it. Of course, it may not be politically correct, but \nif it makes education a higher priority or a little easier, even \nbetter, what is wrong with that?\n  Let me speak for a moment on how Americans save.\n  The U.S. personal savings rate has been dropping for some time. In \n1997, it fell again from 4.3 percent in 1996 to 3.8 percent in 1997. \nThe U.S. household personal savings rate for 1996 was 4.4 percent; \ncompared to Japan, with its troubled economy, at 12 percent; Germany at \n11.4 percent; France at 12.8 percent; and Italy at 13 percent. So the \nUnited States saves about two-thirds less than any of these countries.\n  I'll give you an example of what is good about this bill. Let us say \nyou are a struggling single mother, as I was at one point in my life. I \nearned less than $30,000 a year. I was a single mother with a young \nchild. I could not save; that is true. Nonetheless, if I had had an \nuncle who saw an incentive like the tax incentives in this bill, and \nsaid, ``Aha, she's got problems now. Let me start a savings account for \nher little girl,'' I would have appreciated it. This savings incentive \nwould be available to a parent, a grandparent, an uncle or an aunt.\n  So if a grandparent can contribute to a grandchild's education, when \nthe mother of that child only earns $25,000 or $30,000 a year, what is \nwrong with that? That is good. And if they want to spend that savings \nin a private school, in a public school, in a parochial school, I say, \nwhat is wrong with that?\n  I am a strong supporter of public schools, but I must tell you that I \nreject the thinking that says there is only one way to look at \nstrengthening education, that is that you can only push it in one \ndirection. What this underlying bill does is to encourage people to \nsave for education and then use their savings for education.\n  What I like about this bill is it does just that. It says, if you \nsend your child to a public school, you can use this bill perhaps to \nbuy them a computer. You can use this bill to get them tutors or to \nsend them to a special after-school program or you can use this bill to \nbuy their school uniforms. Or if you are lucky enough or want to send \nyour child to a private school, yes, you can use this money you saved, \nor the child's grandparent or the child's aunt or the child's uncle \nsaved, you can use that to educate this child.\n  In a country where public education and other education is weak, why \nwouldn't we want to encourage savings for education? In the first \nplace, families can talk about it. ``Oh, I'm going to contribute to a \nsavings account for my granddaughter. And here's where it's going to \ngo. And here's how it's going to be used. And when she needs it, here's \nwhat's going to be there.'' I think that is healthy for this country.\n  I commend both authors, both Senator Coverdell on the Republican side \nand Senator Torricelli on the Democratic side. I think this is an \nimportant bill. The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that 58 percent \nof the tax benefit would accrue to those taxpayers filing returns with \nchildren in public schools. Fifty-eight percent would go to families \nwho have children in public schools. So I do not believe this is a \nbailout for the rich. I do not believe it will help only the affluent.\n  In California, a high-cost State, the cost of a home mortgage, a car \nloan, insurance premiums, clothing, recreation, are all high. Believe \nit or not, families that earn $90,000 a year have a hard time saving.\n  In California, out of the 13 million tax returns filed, 10.4 million, \nor 78 percent, of these returns reflect earnings under $50,000. The \naverage per capita income in California in 1998 is $28,500. Here is \nwhere the grandparents or an aunt or an uncle could really help out.\n  Additionally, one out of every four students in a California school \nlives in a single-parent home. Again, 25 percent of the students are in \nsingle-parent families.\n  I was in Los Angeles, meeting with a group of African American mayors \nof cities surrounding Los Angeles this past week, and a woman whom I \nvery much respect from Watts, California, came up to me and said, \n``Hey, Dianne, tell me about this bill. Does this mean that if I can \nsave this money, I can save it for my grandchild?'' And I said, ``Yes, \nAlice, it sure does.'' And she said, ``That sounds pretty good to me.'' \nWell, I have to tell you, it sounds pretty good to me, too.\n  Only 51 percent of California's homes have a personal computer. Among \nLatino households, only 30 percent own a computer.\n  In my State, we rank 45th out of 50 in student-to-computer ratios, \nwith 14 students for every computer, compared to the national rate of \n10 students for a computer. We rank 43rd in network access. Our \neducation technology task force has called for an $11 billion \ninvestment to put technology into K through 12 classrooms. Computers in \nthe home can supplement those in the classroom. And this is a way for a \ngrandparent, an uncle, a niece, to help with that.\n  Another important part of the Coverdell-Torricelli bill that no one \nis talking about are the incentives for college education. This bill \nhelps in three ways. First, it increases the allowable contributions to \neducation IRAs that we created last year for college education. It \nraises them from $500 to $2,000. That is important in California \nbecause tuition is so high now, even in public institutions. This makes \nit possible.\n  Second, again, it expands those who contribute to include those other \nthan parents. These changes should encourage many more Californians to \nsave for a college education. I say let's try it. Let's watch it. Let's \nsee what happens.\n  Finally, the bill allows interest earned in qualified State tuition \nplans to be exempt from Federal taxation. This could increase \nparticipation in California's new Scholarshare Trust Program. Effective \nJanuary 1, 1998, this program authorizes participants to invest money \nin a trust on behalf of a specific beneficiary and it defers payment of \nState and Federal income taxes on interest earned, on investments in \nthe trust, until benefits are distributed. Any California family or any \nperson can open an account and distributions are authorized for all \nexpenses of attending college. In the view of the Postsecondary \nEducation Commission, the bill before us could enable Californians to \nsave $25 million annually in Federal taxes, savings that can then be \ndevoted to education.\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n  Let me just indicate increases in college tuition are outpacing \nincreases in income. Total expenses during the 1997-1998 school year to \nattend the University of California at Berkeley were $13,169--a year; \nat UC San Diego, $13,400; California State, Chico, $10,000. For private \nschools, the cost in 1996-1997 of attending my alma mater, Stanford, \nwas $30,410--when I went there, we ran costs of about $1,200 a quarter. \nNow it is $30,000 a year; at Occidental, $26,000; University of the \nPacific, $25,000.\n  California's public colleges and universities have been told to \nprepare for a 24 percent increase in enrollment by the year 2005, which \ntranslates into almost half a million additional students. The \nCalifornia Postsecondary Education Commission has predicted that our \npublic college and university system will need about $1 billion in new \nrevenues per year through 2006 to maintain existing facilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has spoken 15 \nminutes. She can seek more time if she so desires.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This bill is not the end-all, be-all solution to the \nproblems of our schools. But it is a good step.\n  It is my intention to vote against this bill at this time because of \nthe two additions I cited earlier. If the Gorton and Ashcroft \namendments come out in conference and the appropriate tax incentives to \nsave for education remain, I will vote for this bill and I will vote to \noverride a Presidential veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The U.S. Senate is about to pass a bill that deals \nwith education and then send it to the President.\n  Now, when I go back to Minnesota--and when I am in Minnesota I try to \nbe in a school every 2 weeks--here are some of the questions that \nstudents might be asking me about this education bill.\n  ``Senator,'' or ``Paul,'' will this legislation reduce the class size \nor the size of our classes so that our teachers will be able to give us \nmore attention so we won't have to sit on a radiator because there is \nnot enough room in the classroom?'' By the way, I don't speak just for \nMinnesota but I speak for a lot of schools I visited in this country. \nMy answer will be no, though I would like to be able to say to those \nstudents yes, because I know how important class size is to whether or \nnot they receive a good education.\n\n  ``Senator, will there be any money to renovate our school?'' I was \njust meeting with a group of students from one of our schools, a middle \nschool in Minnesota, the community of Cambridge. They were talking \nabout some of the problems that they have. ``Senator, will there be any \nmoney to rebuild our schools?''\n  Or as I think about some of the schools I visited around the country, \nand if I was talking to other children, they might be saying to me, \n``Senator, the roofs are caving in, the building is decrepit, the air-\nconditioning doesn't work during the warm spring months, the heating \nsystem doesn't work well during the cold weather months. Is there any \nmoney to invest in the infrastructure, because we don't have the wealth \nin our communities to do this?'' My answer will be, ``No, not in this \npiece of legislation.''\n  ``Senator, will this bill train teachers to use technology so they \ncan incorporate that into their teaching--because we are hearing that \nit is so important for us to be technologically literate to compete in \nthe economy. Will that happen?'' And my answer will be no.\n  How about other people who work with children, people who are down in \nthe trenches? This is their life's work. This is their passion. They \nsay to me, ``Senator, did you in this education bill put any money into \nearly childhood development so that when children reach kindergarten \nthey will be ready to learn?'' And the answer will be no.\n  Then another question will come: ``Senator, what about after-school \ncare?'' I think about the Boxer amendment. ``Did you put any money into \ngood community-based after-school care programs?'' A lot of us with \nteenage daughters and sons worry a lot about where they are and whether \nor not there would be something positive for them to do after school. \n``Did you all do anything in this legislation to help us?'' And the \nanswer will be no.\n  Then to make matters worse, with some of the amendments that have \npassed, I heard my colleague from California speaking, now we have \nblock grant amendments that passed. So as a national community, what we \nused to say was we are a nation. We do not want to grow apart, we want \nto grow together. We make certain commitments here in the Senate and \nhere in the House of Representatives representing our Nation. We are a \nnational community with certain values and priorities. By golly, one of \nthem is title I. We want to make sure that children who come from \nfamilies in difficult circumstances--low and moderate income and other \nproblems--get some additional support, and our schools get some \nadditional support so they can give these kids some additional help.\n  Now there is no assurance that will happen. There is no assurance \nthat we will have the same commitment to safe and drug-free schools. We \nnow have with this piece of legislation $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion--\nwhat we have done is not just a money issue. It is not just a lack of \ninvestment in crumbling schools. That is not there. It is not just the \nlack of investment in smaller class sizes. It is not there. It is not \nthe lack of investment in enabling teachers to get more training for \nuses in technology. It is not there. It is not just a great step \nbackward where we don't invest the money in public education.\n  I don't know what slice of the population we are talking about, but I \nwill tell you there are not a lot of Minnesotans who can just take \n$2,000 and put it into savings. What about the vast majority of people \nwho don't have those dollars, who are concerned about the communities \nthey live in and the schools their children go to, public education?\n  This isn't a great step forward for public education or education for \nchildren; this is a great leap backward. Now we have done something \nelse, I say to my colleagues who supported this initial framework. What \nwe have done through amendments passed on this floor is undercut what \nhas been a historic national community commitment to title I, to \nchildren who need that additional help. This is not a step forward; \nthis is a great leap backward.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you, this piece of legislation is a piece \nof legislation that does not do well for many, many children in our \ncountry. We should be able to do much better. If we were to think about \nthe best kinds of things we could do to make sure that children would \ndo well, that we could have good education for all of our children, we \nwould have put a lot of emphasis on smaller class size, and there is no \nemphasis on it; a lot of emphasis on early childhood development, and \nthere is no emphasis on this; a lot of emphasis on after-school \nprograms, and there is nothing in this legislation; a lot of emphasis \non rebuilding crumbling schools.\n  What kind of message do you think these children get when they walk \ninto these dilapidated buildings? The message is that we don't value \nthem. But there is nothing in this legislation that deals with that. \nMr. President, what we also would have done is, we would have focused \nnot just on the children, but we should be focusing also on the parent \nor parents. The two most important explanatory variables in determining \nhow well children do are the income status and the educational status \nof their parent or parents. We don't put the emphasis on that. We don't \nput the emphasis on making sure there is health care there and good \njobs and family income. We don't put the emphasis on smaller class \nsize. We don't put emphasis on rebuilding crumbling schools. We don't \nput emphasis on preschool, early childhood development or after-school \nprograms. What we do is undercut and wipe away a major commitment that \nwe have made to the title I program and funds for kids from low- and \nmoderate-income families.\n  This piece of legislation is not a great step forward; it is a great \nleap backward from a commitment to public education, from a commitment \nto children and families all across the\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nUnited States of America, from a national commitment to making sure \nthat we expand opportunities for all of the children in our country.\n  This piece of legislation doesn't do that. It may pass, but it will \nbe vetoed by the President. And I will say to my colleagues that I am \nsorry, because I guess, with the exception of some Senators who have a \ndifferent view, this is by and large a difference that we have on the \ntwo sides of the aisle. I look forward to this national debate. We will \nbe debating education. In a way, this exercise--I would not call it \nmeaningless. People spoke. But the truth of the matter is that \neverybody knows the President is going to veto this bill. He has made \nthat clear. In that sense, all of us have felt a little uneasy about \nthis week. But the debate will go on, because this issue of education, \nthis issue of our children, whether our children will get good \neducational opportunities so they will do well in their lives--this is \nan important issue to families in North Dakota, Connecticut, Minnesota, \nand all across the country.\n  As a Democrat, I am telling you, we are going to take this issue out \nand about the country. We are going to have a discussion, dialog, and \ndebate. This piece of legislation, especially with these amendments, \nrepresents a huge step backward, and I want people in the country to \nunderstand that on this issue, the differences between the Democrats \nand Republicans makes a huge difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the Senator time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have been authorized to confirm the \ntime allocated to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, and yield \nmyself up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator is recognized for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nthe Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act, which I am pleased to \njoin Senators Coverell and Torricelli in cosponsoring, and also to urge \nmy colleagues to give this bill a full and fair hearing before making \nup their minds on it.\n  The core of this legislation is similar to a provision that passed \nboth houses of Congress as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, but \nwas stricken out before the President gave his final approval. The \nTaxpayer Relief Act authorized the creation of an Education IRA that \nwould allow parents to set aside up to $500 each year in a tax-free \naccount to help pay for their children's college education, a provision \nthat I cosponsored. Senator Coverdell succeeded in adding an amendment \nthat would permit parents to also use this Education IRA to pay for \nelementary and secondary education costs, but that provision was \nultimately dropped from the final version of the Taxpayer Relief Act at \nthe request of the Administration.\n  The bill we are considering today, H.R. 2646, mirrors the modifying \namendment that Senator Coverdell offered. It would increase the annual \ncontribution limit for the Education IRA up to $2,000, and then expand \nthe definition of ``qualified expenses'' to also allow families to \nwithdraw money from the account without penalty for K-12 expenses, such \nas tutoring, tuition, books, uniforms, computers and special services \nfor disabled students. Like the original Education savings account, \nthis expanded version would be targeted at the broad range of working \nand middle class families with dependents under 18 years old, limiting \neligibility to those households with annual income of less than \n$160,000.\n  Judging this proposal on the merits, it makes eminent sense. At a \ntime when parents are growing increasingly concerned about the quality \nof K-12 education their children are receiving and when many educators \nare trying desperately to spur greater parental involvement in their \nchildren's schooling, the expanded Education savings account would \nencourage parents to invest directly in their children's education, \nfrom kindergarten all the way through to graduate school, and take a \nmore active role in the lives of their sons and daughters. And at a \ntime when many parents are seeking more choices for their kids, \nespecially for the students who are trapped in failing and unresponsive \nlocal schools, this bill would help make private or parochial school a \nmore affordable option for those families who decide that is the best \nchoice for their child, or in some cases, the only chance to get a \ndecent education.\n  For the average family, this plan would provide a significant \nincentive to set aside some of their savings for the myriad costs they \nmay face in helping their children reach their full potential, such as \nthe after-school math tutoring an underachieving child needs to reach \ngrade level, or the new computer a budding programmer needs to upgrade \nhis skills, or the special classes a dyslexic students needs to take to \novercome her disability, or even the price of tuition a family needs to \npay to ensure that their child can learn in a safe, disciplined \nenvironment. According to an analysis by the Joint Tax Committee, if a \nfamily with annual income of $70,000 contributed the maximum each year \nto the expanded IRA, they would accumulate a savings of more than \n$17,000 by the time their first child was age seven, while saving \n$1,000 in taxes. By the time that same child was ready to start high \nschool, the account would be worth $41,000, and the tax savings would \ntop $4,300.\n  Those are significant sums of money, which could be used for \nimmediate needs when children are growing up, or in many families, \ncould be reserved primarily to help meet the financial burden of going \nto college. The choice is up to each individual family on how to spend \ntheir money--which is an important point to stress, that we are talking \nabout after-tax income, not the ``government's'' money, not a tax \ncredit or even a deduction. It is the parent's money, not the \ngovernment's. The modest tax benefit we are proposing would simply \nreward them for saving for their child's future, which is exactly why \nwe passed the original Education savings account with strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is all reasonable and sensible, which leaves me puzzled as to \nwhy some are attacking this bill as if we were proposing to destroy \npublic education in this country as we know it. Judging from the \noverheated rhetoric we have been hearing, this plan is little more than \na backdoor attempt to funnel money into private schools at the expense \nof public schools and create a new tax shelter for the wealthy. It \nwould ``do nothing to improve teaching or learning in our public \nschools,'' in the words of one group; instead, it would ``undermine \nsupport of public education,'' in the words of the another. And a third \norganization seethed that this bill is really ``private and parochial \nschool vouchers masquerading as tax policy.''\n\n  For those of us who have fought the school choice battles in the \npast, the nature and vehemence of these criticisms is familiar. Last \nfall, for instance, we called for the creation of a small pilot program \nhere in Washington, D.C., that would have authorized $7 million to \nprovide 2,000 disadvantaged children with scholarships to attend the \nschool of their choice, without a dime away from the amount requested \nby the D.C. public schools. For that Secretary of Education Richard \nRiley, a man I truly admire, went so far as to suggest that our bill \nwould ``undermine a 200-year American commitment to the common \nschool.''\n  But what is surprising in this case is how utterly disconnected the \ncurrent criticisms are from the bill we are considering today. Let's \nstart with the fact that this measure does not remotely resemble a \nvoucher or scholarship plan, nor does it target aid to private schools. \nThis is a savings account bill, one that simply raises the contribution \nlimit for the existing education savings account and gives parents the \nchoice to use some of those savings for K-12 expenses. It is \nunequivocally neutral on its face--it does not distinguish between \npublic school parents and private school parents. It is meant to help \nall parents, and the truth of the matter is that the clear majority of \nparents who are expected to take advantage of it--70 percent, according \nto the Joint Tax Committee--will have their children in public schools. \nTo suggest otherwise is to ignore the growing variety of educational \ncosts that many public school parents face these days, and overlook\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nthe tens of thousands of parents who are turning to places like Sylvan \nLearning Center to help improve their children's skills.\n  The critics of the education savings account legislation are also off \nbase when they proclaim that it would do absolutely nothing to help \npublic education. To see why, I would urge my colleagues on both sides \nto re-read the President's major educational priorities. Both the \nPresident and the Secretary have rightly argued that stimulating \ngreater parental involvement is critical to reaching all seven of the \nAdministration's top goals, particularly when it comes to improving \nreading proficiency. The Secretary believes it is so essential that he \nestablished a broad-based national initiative--the ``Partnership for \nFamily Involvement in Education''--to better engage parents. The bill \nwe are debating today, H.R. 2646, will help by encouraging parents \nacross the country to save for the future and take a more active role \nin their children's schooling. It will not singlehandedly raise test \nscores or prompt millions of new parents to join their local PTAs. But \nis will complement and reinforce the work that the Secretary and many \nnational and grassroots education groups are already doing, and for \nthat reason it is worthy of our support.\n  Perhaps the most vexing criticism of this super Education IRA plan is \nthe notion that it will only benefit the wealthy. The language of the \nbill explicitly refutes that point, and I would urge my colleagues to \nread it for themselves. They will see that it precludes any individual \nparent with income above $110,000 or any couple above $160,000 from \ncontributing to an expanded IRA. I would also urge my colleagues to \nrefer again to the Joint Tax Committee's analysis of the bill, which \nprojects that 70 percent of the tax benefit from the expanded IRA will \ngo to families with annual incomes less than $75,000--middle class \nfamilies. And I would urge them to consider the provision in the bill \nthat allows any corporation, union, or non-profit organizations to \ncontribute to IRAs for low-income students. The growth of donations to \nprivate scholarship funds across the country--more than $40 million has \nbeen raised since 1991 for programs in more than 30 cities, including \none in Bridgeport, Connecticut--suggests that there are many generous \ngroups who would be interested in lending their support to an Education \nIRS for a disadvantaged child.\n\n  Mr. President, in making these points, I harbor no illusions. I \nrecognize that a relatively small number of poor families will likely \nbenefit from the expanded IRAs, and that these accounts will primarily \nhelp middle and upper middle class families who have the means to \nmaintain them. But that is a significant chunk of our populace, and \nmost of them are financially stressed in trying to meet the costs of \nhome, family and school. If this bill can spur them to invest in their \nchildren's education and generate parental involvement, then it will \nserve a valuable purpose.\n  Moreover, I would also say to my colleagues that if they truly want \nto target aid to disadvantaged children who are not being well-served \nby the status quo, then they should support legislation that Senator \nCoats and I have sponsored that would establish low-income school \nchoice programs in several major cities. These pilot programs would \ngive thousands of poor students the opportunity to attend a better \nschool and realize their hopes of better future, while providing us as \npolicy-makers an opportunity to examine what impact this kind of \nnarrowly-targeted, means-tested approach would and could have on the \nbroader education system. Many of the supporters of the bill we are \ndebating today also have expressed strong support for the Coats-\nLieberman bill, so it's just not accurate to suggest that the sponsors \nof the education savings account legislation are merely interest in \nhelping the well-off.\n  Nevertheless, the opponents of this bill continue to insist that we \nare wrong no matter what the facts say. Last year, many of my \nDemocratic colleagues and many of the leading educational groups voiced \ntheir strong support for the original Education IRA as a boon to middle \nclass families struggling to pay for college. Today they turn around \nand attack the same concept with the same income caps--let me repeat, \nthe same exact income caps--as a sop to the rich. The difference, of \ncourse, is that parents would have the choice to use the savings from \nthe expanded IRA for K-12 expenses for public and private schools \nstudents, or college or both.\n  That distinction is so significant to our cities that they are \nwilling to eliminate the part of the A+ Accounts bill that would \nincrease the contribution limit for the IRA from $500 to $2000, which \nwould give millions of parents an even greater incentive to save for \ncollege, in order to prevent us from providing a modicum of relief for \nelementary and secondary costs. That facet of the bill has gotten lost \nin all the hyperbole of this debate, and it bears repeating: Beyond \nallowing parents to use the IRA to pay for K-12 expenses, this measure \nwould significantly enhance their ability to meet the burden of paying \nfor college. In fact, according to the Joint Tax Committee, the clear \nmajority of the additional $1.64 billion in tax benefit that this bill \nwould extend over the next 10 years would go to families who are saving \nfor higher education, a very important purpose for them and for our \ncountry in this education age. That is something that the critics of \nthis super Education IRA are reluctant to acknowledge. According to \nthem, practically every last penny from this bill will end up in the \ncoffers of private elementary and secondary schools. On the contrary, \nmost of the money saved will go to colleges and universities.\n  Hearing these misdirected attacks, I can't help but ask why so many \nthoughtful, well-intentioned educational groups are engaging in so many \nlogical contortions to bring down this bill. To answer that question, I \nwould repeat the simple theory I offered last fall during the rancorous \ndebate over the D.C. scholarship bill: Love is blind even in public \npolicy circles. I fear that our critics are so committed to the noble \nmission of public education that they have shut their eyes to the \negregious failures in some of our public schools and insisted on \ndefending the indefensible. And they are so conditioned to believing \nthat any departure from the one-size-fits-all approach is the beginning \nof the end for public schools that they refuse to even concede the \npossibility that offering children a choice could give them a chance at \na better life while we are working to repair and reform all of our \npublic schools.\n  In this week's debate, we are seeing this reflexive defensiveness \nagain. We are not discussing a voucher bill. We are not attempting to \ngive nay Federal money to private schools. We are proposing a modest \nplan to help families--not public school families, or private school \nfamilies, but families of all kinds--provide the best educational \nopportunities for their children. It sounds a lot like the G.I. bill or \nthe guaranteed student loan program, which we all support. But because \nsome parents who take advantage of these accounts and the small tax \nbenefit we are offering will choose to send their children to private \nschools, this bill is seen as anathema by some.\n\n  Mr. President, as the consideration of this bill proceeds, I would \nappeal to my colleagues to lay down their rhetorical arms and listen--\nnot to be bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill, but to the people we are \ntrying to help. Yes, they want smaller class sizes, and yes, they want \nsafer and sturdier public schools, and yes, they want better-trained \nteachers. But those are not reasons to oppose this bill. In addition to \nseeking more money to improve our public schools, parents increasingly \nare demanding more choices for their children--be it in the form of \npublic school choice, charter schools, or scholarships for low-income \nkids to attend a quality private or parochial school. And they are \nseeking more of a focus on results rather than a defense of the system \nand all who function in it.\n  Poll after poll confirms this. For the sake of this debate, let me \ncite just a few. A recent survey by the Center for Education Reform \nfound that 82 percent of parents said they would support efforts to \ngive them the option of sending their children to the public or private \nschool of their choice. A much-quoted study done by the Joint Center \nfor Political and Economic Studies last year found that 57 percent of \nAfrican-Americans and 65 percent of Hispanics\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nfavor the use of vouchers to expand opportunities for low-income \nstudents. And even Phi Beta Kappa, which is openly skeptical of private \nschool choice, found in its annual poll on public attitudes towards \npublic schools a slim plurality of Americans would now support a \nprogram using tax dollars to pay tuition at private school for some \nchildren. If my colleagues need any more evidence, I would point them \nto the mushrooming charter school movement, where parents and teachers \nhungry for alternatives to the status quo have started more than 700 \nnew schools from scratch over the last five years, with hundreds more \nto open next fall.\n  The bill we are considering today cannot and will not guarantee \ngreater choices for every family. But it does offer a progressive \nresponse to the public's pleas for innovative educational solutions \nthat focus less on process and more on children. That, in my mind, is \nwhat is truly at stake here in this debate. We cannot walk away from \nour responsibility to fix what ails our public schools, to set high \nstandards, and demand greater accountability in meeting them. But in \ndoing so, we must not be so defensive in our thinking that we \nreflexively rule out innovative options that deviate a scintilla from \nthe prevailing orthodoxy.\n  That is why I have urged my colleagues to give choice a chance. That \nis why I have urged this body to give charters a chance, which I am \nproud to report we did last year in raising Federal funding by 60 \npercent for this fiscal year. And that is why I am appealing to my \ncolleagues today to give this Education IRA bill a chance. By doing so, \nwe can prove that it is possible to encourage parents to invest in \ntheir children's future without disinvesting in our common schools. And \nhopefully we can begin to change the dynamic of what for too long has \nbeen a disappointingly dogmatic and unproductive debate on education \npolicy in this country and lay the groundwork for a new bipartisan \ncommitment to putting children first.\n  Mr. President, again, this bill is part of a host of responses to a \nreality to, I think, all of us here in this Chamber, which is that \nwhile we have many extraordinarily positive things going on in our \nsystem of education in this country, while we have tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands, of gifted and, I would say, heroically \nsuccessful teachers, while we have excellent schools--public, private, \nand faith-based--in our country, the fact is that the status quo in \nAmerican elementary and secondary education is not working for millions \nof our children.\n  The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, spoke today with eloquence, \nwith force, and with truth about the extent to which education, which \nhas always been the way in which we have made the American dream of \nopportunity real for generations of our people, and which is even more \nnecessarily so today because of the highly informational, technological \nage in which we live--how that ticket to a better life is being \ndeprived to millions of our children today, who are going to school in \nbuildings that are in shabby shape and schools that are unsafe--not \nonly are the buildings unsafe, but it is unsafe to be there in many \ncases. Too often, they are taught--and I use the word advisedly--by \nteachers who are not prepared in the subjects that they are supposed to \nbe teaching. Too many parents are wanting to help their children more, \nbut they are too burdened economically to find a way to make that \nhappen. Class sizes are too large, and professional development of \nteachers is not what it should be.\n  Mr. President, I view this A+ Act, these A+ accounts, as one \nthoughtful, progressive response to that problem. It is not the \nsolution to the problems that face American education and our children \ntoday. The fact is that there is no one answer to those problems. And \nthe shortcoming of the debate that we have had here and the political \njousting that is going on here--too much of it partisan--is that this \ndebate is being framed as if it were a multiple-choice question on an \nexam for which there is only one right answer. That is not reality. \nThere is not one right answer. The underlying bill here--the A+ \naccounts--is a thoughtful part of an answer. Many of the amendments \noffered, such as one regarding school construction, and class size, and \nSenator Boxer's on after-school education, are all part of the \nsolution. And there are other decent, constructive, thoughtful answers \nto the crisis.\n  I hope we can find a way--and I hope it is after we pass this bill, \nwhich I strongly support--to put aside the jousting and figure out a \nway to sit down together and find common ground that is aimed at \nbenefiting the millions of schoolchildren in this country who are not \nbeing adequately educated today. That is going to require all sides to \ndrop some of the orthodoxies, to drop some of the prejudices, to drop \nsome of the political reflex instincts at work here today, and to go \nforward not to develop issues for the next campaign but to develop \nprograms for the next school year for our children. That is the way I \napproach this legislation.\n  This is similar to a provision that passed both Houses of Congress as \npart of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 but was stricken out before the \nPresident gave his final approval. The Taxpayer Relief Act did \nauthorize the creation of an education savings account that would allow \nparents to set aside up to $500 each year in an after-tax account to \nhelp pay their children's college education--a provision that I was \nproud to have cosponsored. The income limits in that proposal were \nexactly the same as in the proposal before us today. That proposal \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support. No one called it a sop to the rich at \nthat point, because it certainly was not. It was a helping hand to \nmiddle class families who are trying to send their kids to college to \nbetter educate them and to figure out how to do it without putting an \nenormous financial burden of debt on their backs.\n\n  Senator Coverdell and Senator Torricelli have had the imagination to \nsimply take that idea and increase the amount of money that could be \nput in up to $2,000, and make it, as the debate has made clear, \napplicable to elementary and secondary education as well as college, \nand to make it available for use by parents for both public school \nstudents and for students of those parents who choose to send them to \nprivate or faith-based schools.\n  This bill could be called ``the private GI bill.'' It is really, in \nprinciple, no different than the GI bill that is one of the great \naccomplishments of the American Government in the postwar period. I say \n``private'' because the money isn't governmental, the money is the \nparents'. It is the families' own money that they put into the \naccounts. Then they decide how they want to use it to benefit their \nchild's education and to put their child on a path to self-sufficiency \nin this technological information age.\n  Some people talk about this bill as if it were the beginning and the \nend for public education. How could that be so? This is the beginning \nof an assist to parents of working middle class families, to encourage \nthem to save some money so that they can help us better educate their \nchildren. Our priority in this country has been and always will be \npublic education. That is where most of our children will be educated. \nThat is where most of our effort must be put. But the crisis that \nplagues too many of our schools today forces us to focus on results. \nWhat are the results of the education system? What are we getting for \nthe money we are putting into it and not on protecting the status quo?\n  I view this not as a revolutionary proposal. Not at all. It is a \nmodest, thoughtful, progressive, cost-efficient way to help parents \nbetter educate their children. Let's not forget that one of the \nelements of the administration's education program is to get parents \nmore involved in their children's education.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reread the \nPresident's major education priorities. Both the President and the \nSecretary of Education have rightfully argued that stimulating greater \nparental involvement is critical to reaching all seven of the \nadministration's very worthy, right on target, top education goals, \nparticularly when it comes to improving reading proficiency. The \nSecretary believes it is so essential that he established a broad-based \nnational initiative, a partnership for family involvement in education \nto better engage parents.\n  The bill we are debating today I am convinced will help by \nencouraging\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nparents across the country to save for the future and to take a more \nactive role in their children's schooling. It will not singlehandedly \nraise test scores or prompt millions of new parents to join their local \nPTA. But it will complement and reinforce the work of the Secretary of \nEducation, the great work that he and many national and grassroots \neducation groups are already doing. For that reason alone, to encourage \nmore parental involvement in our children's education, I think this \nproposal is worthy of support.\n  Mr. President, as I see you in the Chair, the Senator from Indiana, \nit reminds me to make this point. Some have said that this bill is a \nsop to the rich because of the income limits. In my opinion, it is a \nhelping hand to the middle class working families. The reality is that \nthe poorest families in our country probably will not have the money. I \nhope they can find some to put into these tax-free education savings \naccounts.\n  But I appeal to my colleagues. If you really want to help give a \nboost to poor children, if you are looking for a program that targets \naid to those who are most disadvantaged, please take another look at \nthe low-income school scholarship choice programs that the Senator from \nIndiana and I have tried in vain to convince 60 of our colleagues, 58 \nbesides ourselves, to support so we could at least give these programs \na test. Those programs are totally means tested. There is no sop to the \nrich there--not even a helping hand. It is to the middle class and \ndirected totally to the poorest of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, let me make two final points. I listened very \ncarefully to my colleague and friend, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, who is troubled by at least two of the amendments that have \nbeen put forward, both of which I voted against, one by the Senator \nfrom Washington and the other by the Senator from Missouri. Her \ndecision, which I respect, is to vote against this bill because of \nthose amendments.\n  My decision, because of my strong support for the underlying bill, \nthe idea of these empowering education savings accounts, is to vote for \nthe bill with the amendments, although I oppose the amendments, but to \nappeal to all of our colleagues who will sit on the conference \ncommittee on this measure to remove those amendments, to bring them \nback on another day, so that they do not jeopardize the enormous \naccomplishment that we can make by passing the underlying bill.\n\n  I want to say specifically with regard to Senator Gorton's amendment \non block grants that he spent a lot of time on it and he did a lot of \ngood work. It is a very thoughtful proposal. It is significantly \nimproved--if I could use that judgmental term at least in my frame of \nreference--from the last time he presented it to the Senate. I know he \nhas met with education groups about it. But the reality is, in my \nopinion, that it is too large a change. The underlying bill, that is \nsignificant, as I have said, is not revolutionary. Senator Gorton's \namendment is revolutionary. I think appropriately it ought not to be \npassed after a brief debate as an amendment to another bill; it ought \nto be considered in the fullest of time next year, when the Congress \nwill take up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  The final point is this: I hope beyond the effort to take these \ncontroversial amendments off, which are guaranteed to bring a \nPresidential veto, that the conferees will break out of the tug-of-war \nmode that the two sides are in and see if we can't find common ground. \nI have great respect for the Senator from Georgia, whose imagination \nbuilt on the education savings account, the bill we passed last year, \nand made it into this excellent A+ account proposal. I know he has not \nspent the time which he has, as well as Senator Torricelli and others, \njust to pass a bill that is vetoed by the President and nothing \nhappens. I know him well enough to know that he is not looking--if I \nmay speak directly--for an issue, he is looking for an accomplishment, \nas all of us are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my colleague from Georgia for simply an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield another 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  My appeal is that when this bill passes, as I am convinced it will, \nthat the conference committee, or meetings outside the conference \nmeeting, including representatives of both parties, both Chambers, and \nthe administration, sit down together and see if we can't put a package \ntogether that includes these education savings accounts, the A+ \naccounts, and opens the door and includes some of the proposals that \nhave been made by some of my Democratic colleagues in this debate and \nare favored by the administration.\n  I think that is the way to have the result of all of this debate this \nweek to be more than noise and issues to carry into the campaign. That \nis the way to have this debate result in some real change, some real \nhope of reform in America's educational system, and, most specifically \nand in a more personal way, some real hope for a better future for the \nmillions of children in America who are not being given that chance for \nproficiency because we are not giving them the educational tools they \ndeserve.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Cleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend the senior Senator from \nGeorgia, my dear colleague and friend, Senator Coverdell, for his \nstick-to-itiveness in bringing this issue to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. He has worked hard on the Parent and Student Savings Account \nAct. This bill is the product of many long hours of hard work and \ncompromise and collaboration, and Senator Torricelli and other members \nof the Finance Committee deserve praise for bringing this issue to the \nfloor.\n  I would like to state for the record that I had planned to support \nfinal passage of the Parent and Student Savings Account (PLUS) Act as \nreported out of Committee. In addition to the education savings account \nprovision in the bill, H.R. 2646 contains a number of measures that \nfurther increase education opportunities for students, including the \nexpansion of employer-provided education assistance to cover graduate \ncourses, an allowance for individuals to make withdrawals from State \ntuition program accounts on a tax-free basis, and a provision providing \nan increase in the small issuer rebate exception for bonds used to \nfinance school construction, all of which I strongly support.\n  And I also support the education savings account provisions, \nespecially the expansion of the credit for savings for college \neducation, which have caused most of the controversy on the bill. While \nthe Parent and Student Savings Account (PLUS) Act as reported by \nCommittee was a modest and moderate bill and certainly was not the \nfinal answer to the education problems currently facing our country, I \nbelieve that by making additional resources available for education \nthis bill represented a step forward and I had every intention of \nsupporting it.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday the Senate voted, by a one vote margin, to \nattach an amendment to this bill which I can not support, and which is \nneither modest nor moderate in impact. Senator Gorton's block grant \namendment greatly concerns me and I believe that it is a risky \nexperiment that will undermine the legitimate, but limited, federal \nrole in support of public education.\n  Senator Gorton's amendment would block grant funds for about one-\nthird of the programs administered by the Education Department \nincluding those for bilingual education, Title I programs which are \ntargeted to poor, disadvantaged school districts, Safe and Drug-free \nSchools, and education technology. Some of these programs date back to \nthe Eisenhower Administration. We cannot turn back the clock on \nprograms such as these. The Gorton amendment will undermine the federal \ncommitment to improve the nation's schools and opens the doors for \nabandonment of national commitments to\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\ndisadvantaged and disabled students and other priorities established \nover the years by a bipartisan consensus in Congress.\n  In spite of the fact that this idea was first advanced many months \nago when the Senate took up last year's education appropriations bill, \nno hearings have been held on this block grant proposal nor has there \nbeen any committee review of its impact. As I stated earlier, this \namendment affects one- third of the federal education programs and \nwould, in effect, radically restructure the administration of over $10 \nbillion of federal education dollars. I believe that it is premature \nand irresponsible for this body to pass legislation that would make \nsuch sweeping changes to the federal role in education based on thirty \nminutes of debate.\n\n  As a strong supporter of state and local decision-making I fully \nsupport our current educational system which vests most authority for \neducation at the level of government closest to students and parents, \nusually local school boards, with the federal role largely limited to \nthe provision of supplemental financial assistance. However, I also \nbelieve that federal involvement, while limited, is necessary and that \nthe Department of Education provides an appropriate oversight function \nto ensure basic educational standards, civil rights protections, \nprogram quality safeguards as well as overall accountability.\n  I realize that there are many problems with today's schools. Our \nschools and our children, unfortunately, mirror many of the problems of \nour times. Drugs, gangs and weapons have infiltrated many of our \nschools and are adversely affecting our children. Student educational \nattainment is too low in far too many of our school systems. Combating \nthese problems will take the best efforts of parents, teachers, \nadministrators and governments at the local, state and federal level.\n  In addition to Senator Gorton's amendment I also am very concerned \nabout Senator Ashcroft's amendment which will prohibit spending Federal \neducation funds on national testing. I believe that voluntary national \nachievement tests will empower parents and local school districts to \nassess how well their students are performing. Such measures will give \nparents insight into how their children are doing and how well their \nchildren's school is doing. From the voluntary tests, we will be able \nto determine if a child needs help, if a class needs help and if a \nschool needs help. In direct conflict with the bipartisan compromise on \nnational testing so painstakingly crafted last year, the Ashcroft \nAmendment will deny states and localities the right to utilize \nvoluntary national tests to measure student learning and improve \neducation so that all students will meet high academic standards, \nparticularly in math and reading.\n  Again, I would like to reiterate that I would have voted for the \nCommittee-approved version of H.R. 2646, which was a modest and \nmoderate pro-education bill. However, due to the adoption of the block \ngrant and national testing amendments, in my view the current version \nof this legislation does more harm than good and I cannot in good \nconscience vote for it.\n  I say to Senator Coverdell, who has put in many, many hours on behalf \nof this legislation, if these objectionable amendments are removed in \nconference, and I hope they will be, I will be pleased to vote for the \nconference report.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nNew Jersey whatever time he will need, but I also take this moment to \nacknowledge the enormous work he has provided as a principal cosponsor \nfrom the beginning. He has been tireless, dedicated, thoughtful, and a \ngreat ally.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for yielding \nthe time and for his very gracious comments and, very importantly for \nthe country and for the States, his extraordinary leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I will concede that when this debate began I believed \nwe were entering upon something very important, that after years of \nfooling ourselves about the quality of education in America, the Senate \nwas about to undertake a broad and comprehensive debate--indeed, a \ndiscussion that could last not simply for this year or this Congress \nbut through the decade--about how we fundamentally reform education in \nAmerica, a debate in which everything was relevant and all subjects and \nproposals would come forward but one, and that is the defense of the \nstatus quo, because if there is one aspect of American life today that \ncannot in its entirety be defended, it is the quality of education that \nwe are giving our children.\n  The process of education in America today stands like a dagger at the \nheart of this country. It is time to speak the truth to parents and \nchildren alike, because it is not simply that the education of our \ncountry is not of a quality to compete, the problem is more \nfundamental--because many parents, working hard, paying their taxes, \nhelping their children, believe they are being educated to world-class \nstandards when they are not.\n  The simple answer to the question, what can be said about the future \nof a country where one-third of its students may enter the work force \nfunctionally illiterate, 40 percent of fourth graders cannot meet \nminimum standards of math, 40 percent of eight graders cannot read at \nbasic levels, the simple truth is a country that is teaching its \nchildren to those standards has a very limited economic future and \ncannot maintain its current quality of life or perhaps even social \nstability.\n  That is the sad truth about our country today. And so I believed that \nwhen Senator Coverdell brought this legislation forward, we would be \nlaying the foundation for an extensive debate about what we do about \nprivate and parochial schools, what we do about the public schools, \nthat we would incorporate the best of President Clinton's ideas and \nthat of the Democratic and Republican leadership and set out an agenda \nto carry us through the years in this great debate.\n  It was sadly, it appears, Mr. President, not to be. There are aspects \nabout the Coverdell legislation that have been said so many times and \nyet it is as if those who do not agree simply do not want to \nhear. Among those, sadly, I must say, my friend and a man that I admire \nas much as any in this country, the President of the United States, \nBill Clinton. I heard the President yesterday say this is another form \nof a voucher, it is support for the wealthy, it is an abandonment of \nthe public schools.\n\n  It is worth stating one more time before this debate concludes so, no \nmatter what the vote and however people may choose to cast their votes, \nwe understand the simple truth. No one ever contended that the \nCoverdell legislation was an answer for every problem of education in \nAmerica. If you are voting for it because you believe in one vote you \nsolve all problems, you will not only be disappointed but you will be \ndishonest in casting your vote. It is one idea to deal with one set of \nproblems. It does these things. But not as its critics have contended.\n  Last year this Senate voted to establish savings accounts for college \neducations. In that instance, as on this day, we did not want this \nbenefit to go to the wealthy alone. With limited resources, we wanted \nthis benefit to go to middle-income people and working families. So we \nestablished income limits, $160,000 for a family, $110,000 for a single \nparent. Those are the same limits that are in this bill. If you came to \nthis floor last year establishing savings accounts for college, \nbelieving you were targeting these resources to the middle-income \npeople--and you did--on this day you have the same chance with the same \nlimits of providing the same opportunity to the same families. This is \na middle-income program. Yet it is argued this is just another form of \na voucher.\n  Senator Coverdell and I differ on the question of vouchers. He \nsupports them. I do not. In either case, this is not a voucher. A \nvoucher is a system whereby you take a drawing right upon Government \nmoney and you transfer that money from a public school to a private \nschool. Under the Coverdell proposal, all the money being made \navailable is your money. It is a family's savings, not the \nGovernment's. The public schools will not receive one dime less, not \none dime less because we establish these accounts. All we are using, or \nallowing to be used, is the family's own money.\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  At the end of the day, as Members of the Senate come to this floor to \ncast their votes, the issue is really more simple than it might \notherwise appear. Senator Coverdell's proposal will provide a net \nincrease over these years of $12 billion in new resources for American \neducation, public and private. Who among us, knowing the test scores of \nour students, the quality of their instruction, the challenge to our \ncountry, would argue that this $12 billion should not be made available \nwhen it draws nothing from the Treasury, puts no restraint upon our \nresources, but simply allows families to join the fight for a quality \neducation?\n  Now the question arises, of that $12 billion, what else does it \nbring? Because, you see, not only is it not drawing upon Government \nresources but it draws upon another powerful idea. Through most of the \nlife of this country, the education of a family, a child, a whole \ngeneration, was not seen as the responsibility of a school board or a \ngovernment alone. It was grandparents and aunts and uncles, employers, \na whole community was part of educating a child. Somehow, through the \nyears, education became a government issue alone. The government will \nalways be central to education, in raising the resources and hiring \nteachers and assuring quality, but part of the genius of this proposal \nis that through these savings accounts, on every holiday, on every \nbirthday, on every occasion, aunts, uncles, grandparents, employers, \nlabor unions, churches, can also put their money in these accounts to \nhelp educate these children. It is an invitation to the American family \nand community to get back into the process of educating American \nchildren.\n\n  Yet, it is argued, those who may now concede maybe it doesn't just go \nto the wealthy, and maybe after this final argument they will concede \nmaybe it is not government money, maybe it doesn't hurt the public \nschools--but what does it do for most American students who have these \naccounts? It bears repeating, because it goes to the heart of the issue \nof educational quality. I hope these accounts allow us to maintain a \nsystem of private education--be they Yeshivas or private or parochial \nschools, so parents have a legitimate choice of where to send their \nchildren. That choice and that competition has served America well in \nevery other aspect of American life. I doubt it is a complication and I \ndoubt it will fail to provide quality in education, as it does in all \nother areas of American life.\n  But the fact of the matter is, too, these accounts are not just about \nmaintaining a private school system in the country free of \nconstitutional challenge by not using government money. The simple \ntruth is, 90 percent of the students in America go to public school. We \ncannot begin to deal with issues of educational quality unless we also \ndeal with public schools. Simply because most of these students go to \npublic schools, by logic most of this money will go to public school \nstudents. The Joint Committee on Taxation has informed the Congress \nthat 70 percent of this money, 70 percent of the beneficiaries of this \nmoney, will be public school students. Because under the proposal of \nSenator Coverdell, this money is available not simply for tuition to \nprivate schools, but after-school activities: Transportation after \nschool, the hiring of tutors, home computers, books, software.\n  It is an acknowledgment that education in the 21st century is not any \nlonger just about a teacher, a desk, and a student. Learning will take \nplace throughout the day, throughout the year, in many avenues of \nlearning. How many middle-class and working-class families in America \ncan afford to buy home computers, pay the cost of hiring a public \nschool teacher to teach in the evening or after school when a child is \nhaving trouble with her studies? How many can buy the software so a \nstudent can do the research? How many can afford the after-school \ntransportation, the uniforms, the athletic equipment, things that a \ngeneration ago as students we took for granted? They are not available \nanymore. Or they weren't necessary then, like tutors or home computers. \nBut they are necessary now.\n  For those who come to the floor and argue about the social justice of \nit, whether or not this is being made available to the broad majority \nof Americans, consider this. There is a new dividing line in America of \nopportunity and it is access to knowledge and education. Mr. President, \n60 percent of American families do not have home computers. Their \nability to research, to write, to learn when they are not in school, to \nbe competitive, is being compromised. Public education, the great \nleveler in America, can have two tiers--those families who have money \nfor these ancillary purchases and those who do not; those who can \nafford tutors and those who do not, to participate in advanced math and \nscience.\n  Under the Coverdell proposal, these accounts are available to ensure \nthat those 60 percent of Americans who do not have access to this \ntechnology can buy it through these accounts. Indeed, it is worse than \nit appears on its face. In the minority communities, 85 percent of \nAfrican American families do not have access to home computers. This is \nan opportunity, it is an avenue where many of these families--\nadmittedly not all--many families can save their own money to prepare \ntheir students.\n  Yet it will be argued by people of good faith who genuinely care \nabout education, who will come to this floor and argue that, well, it \nmay do those things, some students in the public schools may get home \ncomputers, some may get tutors, and in the private schools some working \nfamilies may be able to keep their children in schools who couldn't do \nit otherwise, but it won't help everybody, it won't help a third of the \nstudents, 20 percent of the students, 10 percent of the students. They \ncould not be more right. I have not heard Senator Coverdell argue, and \ncertainly this Senator has not argued, that this is a prescription that \nwill help every student in every way in every educational problem in \nAmerica.\n  I challenge one Senator to come to this floor with one idea that will \ndo that. This is a single idea, not the last idea. It may not even be \nthe best idea, but it is an idea that does help the problem of \neducation in America. Let me address that for a moment, if I can, \nfrankly in a partisan sense.\n  For many years, members of my party proudly have been able to contend \nthat the issue of education in America, in access and in quality, \nbelonged to the Democratic Party. Indeed, from student loans to student \nlunches, title I through the vast array of 40 years of education \nprograms, much of those programs were authored by Democrats in this \nCongress. It is one of the things that led me proudly to be a member of \nthe Democratic Party.\n  But if at this late date in our Nation dealing with our education \nproblems we are about to engage in a partisan competition, if there is \nto be an upward spiral of competition in ideas for who can serve the \ncause of quality education, then it is a debate not only worthy of the \ncountry, but important for our future.\n  Education savings accounts need be neither a Republican nor a \nDemocratic idea. Last year in establishing such accounts for college, \nthey were authored by President Clinton himself. This year, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Breaux, Senator Biden, myself, and others have \njoined in this effort with Senator Coverdell to establish these \naccounts. This does not mean that we subscribe to the notion that this \nis a replacement for either the President's program or other proposals. \nIndeed, I began my remarks today by stating some profound \ndisappointment. This legislation is worthy of being passed. It would be \nbetter if Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's legislation for school \nconstruction were included. With two-thirds of American schools in \nfundamental disrepair, needing serious construction, the Federal \nGovernment should be involved, and the President's proposal, as \nadvanced by the Senator from Illinois, should be included.\n  Senator Kennedy's proposal, in advancing the proposal of President \nClinton for 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size to 18, should be \nincluded. Senator Levin's proposal for technology training for teachers \nwould better prepare our schools and should be included. Senator \nMurray's proposal for class size; Senator Boxer's proposal for after-\nschool activities.\n  I am going to support Senator Coverdell's proposal, because I believe \nit is a worthwhile contribution, but I also\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nconcede this: This Senate could have done better. We may be addressing \none important proposal and making one valuable contribution, but we \ncould have made many valuable contributions. We could have made this \ngenuinely bipartisan and further advance the cause of quality \neducation.\n  Finally, let me say that on this day when the vote is complete, I \nwill join with Senator Lieberman, Senator Cleland, Senator Breaux, and \nothers in a letter to the majority leader, because it is still not too \nlate to have this educational debate be genuinely bipartisan to avoid a \nconfrontation with President Clinton and to achieve something real in \nthe process of education reform.\n  The majority has the power in the conference committee to maintain \nits provisions to eliminate voluntary Federal testing standards across \nthe country. The majority will have the votes and the power in the \nconference committee to impose block grants on the Department of \nEducation under the title. That power exists, but it will not lead to \nthe cause of bipartisanship or more comprehensive education reform. It \nwill ensure a Presidential veto, frustrate those of us who have fought \nfor education savings accounts, and deadlock this Senate in further \nconsideration of improving educational quality in the United States.\n\n  I urge the majority leader in the conference committee to use his \ninfluence to have those provisions removed, to allow Senator \nCoverdell's proposal to stand on its merits in which we can privately \nengage in a conversation with the President and convince him in one of \nthe great ironies of this debate. Senator Coverdell's proposals are not \nonly consistent with President Clinton's goals for education in \nAmerica, they, indeed, spring from the same roots as his own programs \nlast year for college education.\n  Finally, I want to state my great admiration for Senator Coverdell, \nhis tenacity and his creativity in having brought the Senate to this \npoint. I know he must share my disappointment in that all of our \noptimism for bipartisanship, our hope for a thorough educational debate \nin which we could have engaged in a competition of how together we \ncould improve the quality of our schools rather than having sought \npartisan advantage--it has been a disappointment, but we make progress \nwhere we can, remembering Edison's words that discontent is a necessary \nelement in progress. We have had our share of discontent. Senator \nCoverdell, in the passage of his legislation, will at least have a \nshare of progress as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciate his \neloquence. Again, I extend my thanks for his dedication and just \ntenacious strength in terms of promoting this legislation. I listened \nintently to his description of the circumstances, and I applaud his \nmoment here in the Senate. Thank you.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I listened carefully to the debate, as we have called \nit, over the course of the last few days, and to the comments of the \nSenator from New Jersey. I regret to say he is correct in saying this \ncould have been a great debate, but it wasn't; this could have been a \ngreat bill, but it isn't.\n  The truth is that over the course of the last days, the Senate has \nfundamentally avoided a real discussion and a real engagement on the \nsubject of American education. What has happened essentially has been a \nvery partisan and very political exercise. I do not believe that was \nthe design of the Senator from Georgia, and I know it is not his fault. \nBut I regret that, as I am sure he must regret it, because we know this \nis a bill that, in its current form, is going to be vetoed by the \nPresident of the United States, and I believe it ought to be vetoed by \nthe President of the United States.\n  I have previously said on the floor of the Senate that I do not think \nthe idea of savings accounts is a bad idea, and there are ways to \nconstruct a savings account that makes sense. But if the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation tells us, even though you can distort the figures \nand say, ``Well, X percentage of this is going to go to people in \npublic school, yes, it is going to go to families whose kids are in \npublic school''--it is still the high-income earners in America; the \nfact is over 70 percent of the benefits of this are going to go to the \ntop 20 percent of income earners. You cannot rationalize that by \nsaying, ``Well, 48 percent of it is going to go to public school people \nand 52 percent is going to go to private school people.'' The 48 \npercent of public school people who are going to get it are not the \npeople who most need it and not the people, generally speaking, who \nreflect the crisis of our schools.\n  I come to the floor perhaps from a different place than some of my \ncolleagues, because I am prepared to say the public education system of \nthis country is fundamentally imploding for a lot of different reasons. \nThere are wonderful bright spots, so-called blue ribbon schools. We can \ngo out, pin them up and award benefits to ``Teacher of the Year'' with \nsalutations in Washington--and they are marvelous teachers, \nextraordinary teachers, as are the vast majority of teachers in the \nsystem. But no one can deny the hard realities of what we know is \nhappening in the system.\n\n  When you look at the fact that 2.6 million kids graduated from high \nschool a couple of years ago, and fully one-third of them graduated \nwith a level of reading that was below a basic satisfactory reading \nlevel and only 100,000 of the 2.6 million had a world-class reading \nlevel, how can anybody in their right mind sit there and defend that \nsystem?\n  The Brookings Institute recently released statistics that show a very \ndamning reality with respect to the number of people who are teaching \nin their fields, so to speak. The number of teachers in our public \nschool system who are actually teaching math who majored in math or are \nteaching science who majored in science is deplorable. It is \nextraordinary.\n  It is no wonder that all across America we have parents who are \ndesperate about the situation, who are trying to find ways to vote with \ntheir children, in a sense, by taking them out of the public school \nsystem and putting them into parochial school, teaching them at home, \nor putting them into a charter school and hence there is an enormous \nsurge in America among our parents looking for safety, looking for a \nsanctuary for their children, looking for the certainty of adequacy of \neducation.\n  Everybody in the U.S. Senate ought to admit that. But having admitted \nit, the question is then, what are we prepared to do about it? What we \nare doing here has the potential to, in fact, undermine the capacity to \nfix the places where 90 percent of the children of this country go to \nschool. Ninety percent of the children of this country are in public \nschool today. But 90 percent of the benefit of this bill does not go to \npublic schools. A minimal percentage of the benefit of this bill is \ngoing to go to the people who most need it, in the places that they \nmost need it, for the reasons that they most need it.\n  It is not enough to talk about putting more teachers into our \nclassrooms if the teachers are not the right kinds of teachers, if the \nteachers do not get paid the right amount of money, if you cannot \nattract the right kinds of teachers because you do not pay them the \nright amount of money, if you do not put them in a school situation \nwhere there is the minimal level of safety so they can function in a \nway that does not put them at jeopardy, at risk of life and a whole lot \nof other things that are part of the problems in the public schools of \nAmerica. We have a lot of people who are prepared to abandon that \nbecause of those problems rather than try to fix those problems.\n  But you cannot build enough charter schools, you cannot provide \nenough vouchers to save a whole generation from the current crisis of \neducation in this country for that 90 percent of our kids who are in \npublic school. You cannot do it. And what this bill amounts\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nto is a Band-Aid, a tiny little Band-Aid on a system that needs triage, \na system that is basically floundering, but part of the reason that it \nis floundering is because this is what we do.\n  We come to the U.S. Senate and we do not debate the real problems of \nhow you turn this system around. What do you do in a school that is \nfloundering in the inner city where parents do not have the options of \na private school, where there is no place to take their voucher, where \nthere is no place for them to somehow find a place that is a sanctuary \nfor their children? Do you abandon that school?\n  Well, the Senator from Illinois tried to come in here and say, \n``Let's not abandon that school. Let's provide the resources to \nguarantee that that school can be fixed up and decent.'' What did we \ndo? The U.S. Senate rejected that. The U.S. Senate is suggesting that \nit is OK to help those people for whom a tax benefit is a benefit, and \nif you do not get the benefit of the tax benefit, too bad. Sure that is \ngoing to save some kids. I do not deny that. That is really nice for \npeople who can take advantage of that benefit. But what about all the \nrest of the people who are stuck in that system who do not even have a \nway of filing a tax return and getting a tax credit, don't know \nanything about an IRA, can't put away enough money to have an IRA or \nwho are stuck in a system, as they are in Washington, DC, or elsewhere, \nthat just does not function?\n  I am going to be the first person to say that we have to talk \ndifferently about the whole education system. We have to talk \ndifferently on our side of the fence about the things that we have been \nstuck in the cement on ideologically, about things like tenure and a \nwhole lot of other third rails of American politics.\n  And we also have to ask our friends on the other side of the aisle to \nface the reality that those 90 percent of our children who are stuck in \nthose public schools desperately need us to help them have schools that \nfunction, that do not freeze them out of the classroom or bake them out \nof the classroom, to give them the opportunity to be able to learn, and \nthat learning is a function of a whole bunch of things.\n  Every blue ribbon school I visited, the first thing I have noticed \nis, boy, do they have a wonderful principal. And almost without \nexception, that principal is operating outside of the normal workings \nof the system. They work to deal with the school committee. They work \nto deal with the parents. They work to deal even with the union, and \nteachers can be moved when they need to be moved. And, by God, you get \na school that works all of a sudden.\n\n  What we ought to be talking about is how we make every public school \nin the system fundamentally a charter school within the system. We \ncould do that if we really wanted to. We could do that if we were not \nstuck in this sort of, gee, we are going to fight for vouchers, and we \nare going to be over here, and we are going to protect the people who \ndo not like the vouchers, and, by God, we are going to talk past each \nother in the most important debate that this country has faced. That is \nwhat we are doing.\n  This is the single most important subject in front of the country, \nbecause we have kids who come to school today in the first grade who do \nnot even have the capacity of a first-grade level to read numbers, to \nrepeat colors, to recognize shapes. And that is where the problem for \nour teachers begins, with a whole different set of children. People who \nsit there and say, ``Gee, our school system ought to be the way it was \nwith the little red schoolhouse,'' are not willing to acknowledge that \nwe are living in a very different world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 4 additional minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. The problems that our teachers face today are different \nfrom anything that ever existed previously in our lives. Kids come to \nschool with different baggage. And teachers are expected to perform a \nwhole set of functions which they are not able to perform, which they \nhave not been trained to perform, and in many cases which they are \nsimply not allowed to perform because the political correctness of the \nschool system or the political correctness of the school boards, and \nthe politics of it, deny them the ability to be able to do the things \nthat you can do in some of these other schools.\n  I think people who are looking to those other schools, for example, \nare right. They are right. You have to look around to where education \nis really happening. You have to look to where kids are coming out with \nhigher test scores, with better values, with a better sense of \ndiscipline, with a sense of order, and with opportunity in their lives.\n  But why is it that we are incapable in the Senate of finding the \nability to look for the common ground where we could find the best of \nwhat happens in parochial schools, the best of what happens in charter \nschools, the best of what happens in blue ribbon schools, and make it \nhappen in all of our schools?\n  We did not try in this debate, in my judgment, because I think the \nSenate was busy talking past each other, creating a lot of 30-second \nadvertisements for campaigns and fundamentally setting up a structure \nwhere the kids are once again the victims of our unwillingness to meet \nthese issues.\n  We need a lot of fundamental reform in our school system, and I will \nspeak considerably to that over the course of the next weeks. But I \nregret that in the course of this debate good ideas were left \nlanguishing.\n  Let me give you an example. There was one amendment that passed by 63 \nvotes which provides incentives for States to establish and administer \nperiodic teacher testing and merit pay programs. I am for that. I voted \nagainst it though. Why did I vote against it? Because it takes the \nmoney from teacher training programs for the very people who are trying \nto improve, who are in the system today, who have to have ongoing \nefforts in order to meet the standards that we want them to meet.\n  So why could we not guarantee at least that we would protect the \ncurrent structure sufficiently and find the capacity to provide the \nmerit pay and have the testing? And I think that what has happened \ngenerally here is the process of robbing Peter to pay Paul, because we \nare unwilling to acknowledge the size and complexity of the overall \nreform effort that is necessary.\n  My hope is we will come back to this effort after the President has \ngone through his effort. Or perhaps the conference committee will \ntotally rewrite this with a miracle. My hope is we will come back and \nwrite a bill that will adequately reflect the full measure of reform \nthat is necessary and, most importantly, the full measure of commitment \nto the public school system of this country.\n  My friend from New Jersey said this is not a voucher system. Well, it \nis not. It is not a direct voucher system. But you cannot tell me if 52 \npercent of the benefit goes to people in private schools and all of a \nsudden they are getting $2,000 instead of $500, that that will increase \nsupport for the public school system when they now have increased \ndollars in their pocket to send their kids to more private schools. It \nis a backdoor voucher system. It is providing a savings account that, \nin effect, has the impact of a voucher system because it strengthens \nparochial and private at the expense of the public school system and \ndiminishes the base of support, the foundation for that system.\n  I will vote against it. I hope the Senate will come back to have a \nreal debate on education in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment I will yield to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, but I do want to point out to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that so far, until we hear from Senator Gregg, the \nSenators who have come to the floor to speak about the education \nsavings account in a favorable forum were Senators Byrd, Feinstein, \nLieberman, Cleland, and Torricelli--all Democrats. Despite the \ndifficulty we have had, this has been a very significant bipartisan \ndebate--not as partisan as the Senator characterized.\n  We will next hear from the first Senator on our side of the aisle in \nsupport, No. 1.\n  No. 2, you are right when you say these statistics are befuddling. \nBut at\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nthe end of the day, over a 10-year period over $10 billion gets saved \nin these accounts. Half goes to children who are in public schools and \nhalf goes to children in private. The construct of who benefits is \nidentical, to the exact same people who were defined in the education \nsavings account that the President and we adopted last year. It is \nidentical. It is the same targeted community, same targeted community.\n  The point that neither one of us can really settle, I believe it is \nstatistically insignificant, the number of people --there will be some \nwho will change schools because of the savings account. I think it is \nvery limited. In other words, the reason that half this money--they \nrepresent a third of the people, but half the money in private, is \nbecause those folks are already paying the public school system and \nthey know they have a higher tuition, so they save more.\n  In that sense it skews 50/50. But it is still $5 billion going to \npublic schools and $5 billion going to help students in private.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is exactly what I said in my comments: 52 percent \nversus 48 percent. That is almost even. But when you take that 48 \npercent and look at their income levels, you have the largest \npercentage----\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Those are the same income levels as set in the IRA for \nhigher education which has been celebrated by both parties and the \nPresident.\n  Mr. KERRY. A second point is most of those people are putting away \nfor higher education because they have no place to put it in terms of \nthe public school unless they might choose to spend it on a computer or \nsomething, but there is no proof they will do that. There is no proof \nhere as to how people will be able to spend their money. I will not get \ninto how you go down that road.\n  The underlying component of this that is so disturbing, after you \nfinish that analysis, is this, and I think the Senator from Georgia \nwill have to acknowledge it. You are still leaving that vast 90 percent \nout there, most of whom in the worst situations are stuck in situations \nwhere this will not improve their lives, their education, their \ncapacity to move forward. That is the great dilemma that so many of us \nhave with this.\n  As I said, I like savings accounts. I want to vote for a savings \naccount. I cannot do it in the structure that has been put in this \nbill. That is my regret.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to come back to it. I did want to respond \nto the Senator. I appreciate the Senator giving me an opportunity to \nrespond.\n  I now yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nto speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the floor leader, and I wish to congratulate the \nfloor leader for his excellent work in moving this bill forward. This \nis a very important piece of legislation for improving the quality of \neducation in this country, and specifically for empowering parents to \nhave more of a role in choosing how their child is educated and being \nsure their children have the resources to obtain the type of education \nwhich parents want for their kids. It really is not a radical idea. It \nis a very reasonable idea. So reasonable it is hard to understand why \nthere would be opposition to allowing parents to be able to save more, \nto use that savings for the benefit of their children, to educate their \nchildren. So I certainly congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his \nexcellent work in bringing this legislation.\n\n  I wanted to speak on a couple of specifics and then generally on the \nbill. There was an opportunity which I was going to undertake, along \nwith Senator Gorton, to offer an amendment to try to clarify some of \nthe issues relative to IDEA, especially in the questions dealing with \nthe teacher role, in dealing with children who have special education \nneeds but turn out to be violent. We did pass the IDEA reauthorization \nbill last year, which I worked hard on. I was proud to participate in \nit.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Education has not followed the \nrather explicit instructions from the Congress on how regulations \nshould be issued under this bill. As a result, the question of how we \ndeal with the school situation involving a child who is a physical \nthreat to other children in the classroom and to the teacher has not \nbeen properly addressed. My amendment would have addressed that. It was \nan amendment which I worked on. Senator Gorton was the prime mover of \nsuch an amendment earlier last year, although it was the same \namendment.\n  The issue here, of course, is making sure that such language, should \nit be brought forward, does not allow school systems to in any \narbitrary or capricious or inappropriate way bar the special-needs \nchild from the classroom. That would be absolutely unacceptable.\n  I headed up a school that dealt with special-needs children, and I \nunderstand, I think, this issue as well as anyone who is addressing it \nhere in this Senate. I am very sensitive to the importance of making \nsure that nothing happens which would undermine the capacity of the \nchild who is mainstream, and who is gaining from that mainstream \nexperience, to receive that experience they have under the law.\n  There is also a need to address the fact that in instances of true \nphysical violence, teachers, principals, other children in the \nclassroom, find themselves sometimes put in a position where they have \nno way of adequately dealing with a child who is a physical threat to \nthem. In fact, there have been a lot of instances which reflect this \nproblem.\n  Without the Department of Education addressing the issue, which it \nshould have addressed, it is probably going to be appropriate to \naddress the issue in some other form such as this. We decided not to \nmove forward on that because we did not want to complicate this bill \nany further than it had already been complicated, and therefore we--\nSenator Gorton and myself--reserved our amendment on that point.\n  I must say, the special education community, which I have worked with \nrather aggressively over the years--I have been probably their greatest \nchampion on a number of issues, specifically on getting funding and on \nworking on the last bill--has reacted, I think, overreacted to the \nproposal. They did not see the proposal. They simply characterized it \nand went forth to inform their constituency--misinform their \nconstituency would be more accurate--as to what it would have done, \nwhich is ironic and inappropriate considering the support I have given \nthat community.\n  On the second point, which was the number of amendments which we saw \nhere which were an attempt to basically move dollars from this \nCoverdell approach from the A+ plan into special education, a number of \namendments were brought forth, and specifically the Dodd amendment, \nwhich I wanted to address because I didn't have a chance in the 15-\nminute limitation of time to respond on these points. I have led this \nfight in the Senate now for 3 years--well, actually since I got here, \nbut I have actually been successful over the last 3 years--to try to \nincrease funding for special education. The Federal Government made a \ncommitment that it would do 40 percent of the cost in special \neducation. When I arrived here, having served as Governor, that \ncommitment was not being fulfilled. In fact, the Federal Government was \nonly doing about 6 percent of the cost of special education.\n\n  The fact that the Federal Government was failing to do its share of \nspecial education costs was having a disproportionate and unfair impact \non the local school systems, and it was especially, in my opinion, \nputting the special-needs child and the parents of the special-needs \nchild in an untenable position in local school board meetings, where \nthey were being looked at as siphoning off resources from other \nactivities of the school systems. They had every right to those \nresources, but unfortunately because the Federal Government wasn't \npaying the cost of that education, those resources had to come from \nother places. So the Federal Government has been totally irresponsible \nin this area of funding special education.\n  As a result of my efforts and the efforts of Senator Lott, first we \npassed a commitment to fully fund special education to 40 percent, and \nwe followed that up with making the Budget Act make that statement, and \nfollowed it up by having the first bill put forth by\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nthe Republican Senate being S. 1, a commitment to full funding for \nspecial education. Then we followed all those words up with hard \ndollars. Two years ago, we increased the funding of special education \nby almost $700 million. We followed that up with another almost $700 \nmillion--I think it is over $700 million in the first year. We have \ndramatically increased funding in special education, not as far as we \nneed to go, but we have done that. The Republicans did that. We had no \nsupport from the administration on this initiative and only marginal \nsupport when it came to the actual votes on those budgets from the \nother side of the aisle on this initiative.\n  So we have a track record of having delivered on this issue. The \ngreat irony here--another great irony--is that the amendments brought \nforth by the other side of the aisle were paper amendments meant to \npaper over, I think, the irresponsibility of this administration and \nthe other side of the aisle on the issue of special ed because, once \nagain, just a few weeks ago when we passed the budget in this body, we \nsaw that the administration and the other side of the aisle were not \nwilling to put their name on the line on the cause of special education \nand funding special education.\n  The Republican budget increases special education by $2.5 billion. I \ndon't think any Democrats--or maybe one or two--only a small number of \nDemocrats voted for that budget. The President's budget that was \nbrought forward and voted on in committee increased special education \nfunding by a measly $35 million--$35 million. That was basically a \nnonexistent event that would have probably been used for administrative \noverhead down at the Department of Education. That $35 million probably \nwould never have seen the light of day in any school system.\n  So we made the commitment, and when it came to casting the vote, we \ncast the vote to increase special education funding. Now this cause has \nbeen taken up by the Speaker of the House, who talked about this, and \nthe chairman of the House committee on this issue, and again the \nmajority leader is aggressively pursuing it as well as myself. We \nintend to fulfill our obligations for special education funding as a \nCongress under Republican leadership.\n\n  So when we saw these amendments coming at us, we had to almost smile \nat the political grandstanding of it because that is what they were, \njust political grandstanding. If those folks really want to fund \nspecial education, we are going to give them the chance to do that. We \nare going to be bringing bills out here that do that. I wish they had \nbeen there on the budget amendment. Please take those votes and those \namendments for what they were, which was trying to paper over their own \nlack of effort in this area in the face of what was a hard action on \nour part of delivering hard dollars out to the school systems for \nassistance to special education.\n  On the bill overall, what we have here is a choice between the status \nquo--and I have heard basically almost an unlimited defense of the \nstatus quo from those folks who oppose this piece of legislation--and \npeople who want to empower parents to have more of a role in the \neducation of their children. Now, I know that money is a factor in \neducation. We all know that. I know that the building is a factor in \neducation. I know that the number of kids in a classroom is a factor in \neducation. I will tell you something. In my experience, and I think \nprobably in the experience of anybody who is going to be honest, the \nsingle most significant impact on a child's education is the parental \ninvolvement and the parental activity. What this bill does is it brings \nthe parents into the process more aggressively. It gives the parents a \nnew tool to be able to help their children out as they try to move \nthrough this maze of education which we thrust at them.\n  Why would we not want to do that? Well, I can't think of any reason. \nThis is a parent-empowering amendment and proposal. The opposition \nreally comes from people who seem to think that this threatens the \nstatus quo. That is where the opposition is coming from. They see this \nas a threat to some structure that presently exists out there. That has \nbeen the basic underlying theme of the opposition. Well, is the status \nquo so good? Is it so extraordinary and doing such a wonderful job that \nit should not be shaken a little bit? This is not a big shaking up; \nit's just sort of a little vibration. I am not sure this would appear \non the Richter scale, but it is a significant and good step. It is a \ngood step, but it is not a dramatic shaking up of the status quo. I can \nthink of some things we should do to dramatically shake up the status \nquo, and hopefully we will. But this is a step in the right direction. \nIt is a parent-empowering step, confronting the defenders of the status \nquo on education.\n  I have to tell you, the status quo in education isn't cutting it. We \nknow that as a society. Parents know it. Businesses that are trying to \nhire people coming out of our educational system know it. Regrettably, \nthe world is seeing it. We have gotten to a point really where, in many \ninstances, in many of our most cutting industries that are producing \nthe jobs in this country, they are having to hire people from outside \nof the country because they don't have the educational expertise to do \nit, or they don't have enough educational expertise in this country. So \nthe status quo is not working. We need to take some new, original \napproaches. Clearly, the proposal before us, the A+ accounts, is an \nattempt to empower parents to do something, to give parents an \nopportunity to do something to help their kids get a better education. \nWhat an appropriate purpose that is.\n  We had a whole series of amendments and other ideas on how we should \nimprove education. We had an amendment to build more schools, an \namendment to change the teacher ratios, and an amendment to do after-\nschool planning. These were all nice ideas, but they don't belong in \nthis body. These are ideas that belong in a school board meeting. If \nthese Senators want these ideas to move forward, they should go back \nhome to their school board meeting and suggest it. These are local \ncontrol issues. We should not be taking resources out of the local \ncommunity, sending it to Washington, draining it off from the one \nprogram in Washington that we are not funding, which is special ed, \nwhich should be funded, and sending it back to the community and say \nthat they have to do this or that with those dollars. You have to build \na building, or you have to cut down your class size, or you have to do \nan after-school program with those dollars. That is a local control \nissue. That is where it belongs, in the local school board. They make \nthose decisions.\n  Let's give the local communities the flexibility to have the \nresources, and let's give them the resources to have the flexibility to \nmake decisions as to whether they want a new school building or new art \ncourse or a foreign language course, or whether they want a new teacher \nwho teaches some sort of high-grade technical computer science.\n  The local school board knows best on that. But for us here in \nWashington to basically be taking the resources out of the local \ncommunity by not fully funding special education and then telling the \nlocal school board that we are going to send the resources back covered \nwith strings and directions, and, by the way, all of the things the \nlocal school board traditionally has control over, but we decide to \ntake them over in Washington because we know better than you do. It is \nabsurd. But it is classic Washington. I am glad that all of those items \nwere defeated because they should have been defeated. Let's defeat them \nand send them back to the local school board.\n  Again, I congratulate the Senator from Georgia. He has brought \nforward a concept and an idea that is going to empower the parents to \nbe able to help their kids get a better education. I cannot think of \nany better sentiment or any better purpose for any bill. I look forward \nto its final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. He was for a long time a Governor, and \nhe is someone who understands the issues very adroitly. I appreciate \nvery much the comments he came to the floor to make this evening.\n  I conferred with the other side. Senator Gorton has another calendar \nevent that he needs to attend to. So we will turn to the Senator for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am given to understand from the debate \non\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nthe floor this afternoon that I have made many new friends along with \nthe Senator from Georgia. Senators on the other side of the aisle who \nwere totally unable to find a good word for his bill over the course of \nthe last month or two have suddenly said how desperately they wish to \nvote for his bill if it were not for the Gorton amendment having been \nadded to it.\n  Mr. President, the Gorton bill basically takes $10 billion a year of \nFederal money for our public schools, of which about $2 billion is used \nby bureaucrats today, and says that we prefer classrooms to \nbureaucrats. We would like to allow each State, if it wished to do so, \nto say that the whole $10 billion went into our schools rather than to \nhave roughly $2 billion of it siphoned off by Federal and State \nbureaucrats.\n  I suppose it is perfectly appropriate for Members of this body to \nbelieve that without those bureaucrats in Washington, DC, and in our \nState capitals, all of that money would be wasted; that our school \nboard members, our superintendents, our principals, our teachers, and \nour parents, don't know what they are doing and that we must set \nnational priorities for them and tell them there are certain things \nthey must spend the money--that we have collected from them and \nreturned to them--on.\n  That, however, has not been the argument against the Gorton amendment \nso far. More than one Member this afternoon opposing it talked about \nhow it damaged disabled children. It doesn't include the aid for \ndisabled children. It is not affected by it at all. It is totally \nirrelevant to that subject. Others have said how it destroys the fight \nagainst drugs in our public schools, or for safety, or for mathematics \neducation, and the like.\n  Mr. President, it may very well be that, for example, the principal \ndebater against this, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, knows more \nabout what the Boston schools need than does the Boston school \ncommittee, but I am reasonably confident that he does not know more \nabout what the Wenatchee, WA, school district needs than do the \nteachers and parents and school board members in Wenatchee, WA.\n\n  That amendment takes about one-third of the money, $10 billion out of \n$30 billion a year that goes to the Department of Education here in \nWashington, DC, for common school education, and it says that States, \nlike that system of Federal regulation and the narrow Federal \ncategorical aid program, are perfectly free to retain it without \nchange, but that those States that think that either their States or \ntheir local school districts might possibly do better without those \nFederal regulations and with more money will have that option for a 5-\nyear period. The State can adopt the policy under which it is the State \neducational agency that makes the determination as to how this money \ncan be used, or the States can opt.\n  It is my preference, and was the only option a year ago when I first \nproposed it and this amendment was agreed to, that each of the 14,000 \nschool districts in the United States can make those choices for \nthemselves. It may be that the Wenatchee school district, or any other, \nwill feel that the precise requirements and the exact amount of money \nin the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act is what the Wenatchee school \ndistrict ought to spend on that subject. But if it were allowed to make \nthose choices, that school district might decide that it wanted to \nspend more money on that subject from the Federal Government, and \nperhaps in a slightly different way than the set of Federal regulations \nset out for every school district in the country, and it might, if it \nis very fortunate, decide that it could get by with less and put more \nof that money into teaching English, or mathematics, or computer \nsciences.\n  Mr. President, I suppose one can say that to allow that kind of \ndiscretion would be disastrous to our schools; that there is no way \nthat it is appropriate for us to trust those local school board members \nwisely to spend the money collected here in Washington, DC, and send it \nback for school purposes. But I believe that if there is to be an \nargument against that, it ought to be on the basis of what the \namendment says and not the statements of those who have not read it.\n  To repeat. It does essentially two things. It takes this $10 billion \nand says each State may continue the present system, may have a State-\nbased system or may have a local-based system for a period of 5 years, \nat the end of which time, I think, perhaps we might know a little bit \nmore about what works best.\n  It does something else. It says that this bill stays in effect only \nas long as Congress keeps, modestly at least, increasing the amount of \nmoney it puts into our schools. I would have thought many on the other \nside of the aisle would have liked that effective guarantee, a real \nincentive for us to do our job for education. Evidently, however, there \nis in this body a view not widely shared in the United States, a view \nthat the present system is so close to perfect that we do not dare \nexperiment with it; that we are doing so well with our Federal \npolicies, that we are so successful that we should not experiment with \nthem at all. For those who believe that bureaucrats are more important \nthan classrooms, or at the very least that bureaucrats here in \nWashington, DC, should run our classrooms, and that they should retain \nliterally billions of dollars that could otherwise be spent in the \nclassroom, opposition to the amendment was appropriate and taken well.\n  But for those who believe that there is not only great concern, \nperhaps the greatest concern, for children in a given part of the \nUnited States on the part of those children's parents and their \nteachers, their principals, their school board members, and a degree of \ncompetence and knowledge about what those communities and schools need, \nthis amendment offers a new chance and a real experiment. It isn't \npermanent. Can I say that there is no question but that it will be a \nbetter system? Of course not. I think it will be. I am sure we will \nlearn when there are States that accept each of these three \nalternatives.\n  But to say that it is some kind of disaster, to say that without this \nguidance, without these requirements from the Department of Education \nin Washington, DC, without our wisdom, 100 Members of this body, with \nall we know about schools, that we will irretrievably damage the \neducational fabric of this country is simply wrong. I regret having \ndeprived my friend and colleague from Georgia of so many friends and so \nmany supporters. I strongly support his bill, as he does mine.\n  But it does seem to me that there ought to be enough tolerance in \nthis body, enough faith in the American system that we are willing for \na period of time to let some States in this country try to operate \nunder State-mandated rules and others to let school districts make \ntheir own decisions. The amendment that a small majority of this body \npassed yesterday does just exactly that, nothing less and nothing more.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take just a couple of minutes. I \nunderstand that the Senator from Georgia will be yielding time to the \nSenator from Florida. But before he does that, let me take a couple of \nminutes to respond to some of what I have heard.\n  There have been interesting discussions on the floor of the Senate \nabout this legislation, and it is clear that different Senators see \nthis issue from a different perspective. Many people come to the floor \nto talk about public education. Well, our proud tradition of public \neducation began in this country in 1647. The Colonists in Massachusetts \nfirst developed tax-supported public schools, and we have had from that \ntime on in this country an understanding about the desire and \nobligation to create a network of taxpayer-financed public schools in \nthis country.\n  I defy anyone to come to the floor of the Senate and show me a \ncountry anywhere in the world that is as successful as this country has \nbeen, that has produced as many scientists and engineers, as many \nmathematicians, as many well educated men and women coming from our \npublic school system. In fact, even today, do you know a country out \nthere that you would like to trade places with, a country with a better \neconomy than ours?\n  Oh, you can point to some areas where you might say, gee, this \ncountry has a better education system than ours. Many countries take \nonly its top students and run them up the ladder and say to one group \nof students, you\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nare more appropriately going into another area, and to the best group, \nwe say we are going to direct you toward higher education. And we are \ngoing to compare that group to the American students, the students that \nhave universal opportunity. What a great tradition we have of affording \nevery young boy and girl in every school entering every classroom door \nthe opportunity to be the best they can be because our public education \nsystem gives them that opportunity.\n  It is interesting to me that there is a kind of ``blame America \nfirst'' notion that somehow nothing works here. Again, tell me, with \nwhat country would you change places? I have two children in public \nschools. They are wonderful public schools. Both have wonderful \nteachers. I am enormously proud of what they are doing. They are doing \nharder work in those public schools in both grades than I did--much, \nmuch harder work than I did when I was in school.\n  I also read to a young boy in the Everybody Wins Program. Yesterday, \nmy power lunch for an hour was reading with a young third grader in a \nschool here in Washington, DC. And I understand the challenges of \ndifferent schools. Some have more resources than others. I understand \nthat not all is right with our education system. We have plenty of \nchallenges, some external and some internal, in our education system.\n\n  A week ago yesterday I was in the school in Cannon Ball, ND, on the \nStanding Rock Indian Reservation--in a public school in a public school \ndistrict with a very poor tax base. This is a school with 145 students \nand 40 teachers and staff--180 people in a school, part of which is 90 \nyears old and has been condemned as a fire hazard. 180 people using 2 \nbathrooms and 1 water fountain; second graders, third graders, fourth \ngraders, fifth graders in a choir room that is about 12 foot by 12 \nfoot, that they can only use occasionally because the stench of the \nsewer gas seeps into the classroom and drives them into another \nclassroom. The other classrooms are only 8 foot by 12 foot in many \ncases, and the children sit in desks only a half inch apart with their \ndesks touching because there is not enough room in that school and in \nthose classrooms. And too many students they simply put in an open \narea, and one teacher will teach two classes at the same time by \nspending 15 minutes talking to one group and then 15 minutes talking to \nanother group of students, in the same room, and by going back and \nforth all day long.\n  The question I ask is, Who defends this underlying bill where we say \nhere is the priority of need in education? It is a tax subsidy. The \nmajority of the money from the subsidy will go to the parents of fewer \nthan 10 percent of the children in this country who attend private \nschools. That is the priority of need identified in this bill. And the \nquestion of school construction and modernizing the school buildings so \nthat the wiring will allow kids to access the Internet, those \npriorities somehow don't matter; they apparently represent some ranking \nof need well down below the tax issue.\n  We are told, if we talk about the desperate repair and construction \nneeds, that what we are talking about is decisions that ought to be \nmade by the local school board. In this case, the local school board \ndoesn't have any money. They have no tax base with which to issue bonds \nto repair this school. And there are plenty of other schools like it. \nTo the second grader that I mentioned earlier this week, little Rosie \nTwo Bears at that Cannon Ball school, who says, ``Mr. Senator, will you \nbuy me a new school,'' I say, ``Well, we are talking about that in \nWashington, DC.''\n  Can we provide some help perhaps to that school district to deal with \nschool construction, to give those kids some help? It seems to me the \npeople who are defending the current legislation are saying that issue \ndoesn't matter to us, that ought to matter to somebody else. Crowded \nclassrooms, too few teachers, crumbling schools, those issues don't \nmatter to us; they belong in some other debate.\n  In fact, the amendment that was offered by Senator Gorton, who just \nspoke, is an amendment that says let us take a substantial amount of \nmoney in the Department of Education and block grant it. That is a seed \nthat comes from the same garden planted by those who want to abolish \nthe Department of Education. In fact, abolishing the Department of \nEducation is a part of the 1996 Republican national platform. They want \nto eliminate a national role in education, but they don't want to say \nthat publicly. They don't want to offer it publicly on the floor of the \nSenate, so they do something slightly different called a block grant.\n  And I say to them, if you want to do that, why be a tax collector? \nWhy collect the taxes, run it through Washington and send it back in a \nblock grant. That's like passing an ice cube around; all you do is get \na smaller cube every time you pass it. If you decide that safe and \ndrug-free schools is not a program of national interest and national \nimportance and you want to tell the States this is not something that \nrepresents a national interest, it is fine if 5 schools or 5 States \nwant to do it, and if 45 States want to do it, that's OK, too; we will \nsend you all the money for it, and you do whatever you want. If we \ndecide there is not a national interest in having safe and drug-free \nschools or title I or, for that matter, a half dozen other programs, \nthen why would we collect the tax money for it and send it back? Why \nnot say to the local districts, you collect the taxes and you decide \nhow to spend it. That is the way the system ought to work.\n\n  We don't run the local school boards and we should not. We have done \nsome targeted financing in certain areas that have been enormously \nsuccessful. For example, with title I we have provided specific \ninvestments and opportunities for the very lowest income kids in this \ncountry. Those investments would not have been made and could not have \nbeen made by the local school districts. They are very important, and I \nam enormously proud of what we have done in this and other areas.\n  Do I believe we should take those programs apart and block grant \nthem? Absolutely not. Why take a giant step backwards? The defenders of \nthe legislation before us are the folks who come here and say, ``Well, \ngee, we should not worry about that. We are a U.S. Senate. This is not \na national issue.''\n  If education and achievement and competitiveness in the international \narena is not a national issue--I am not talking about running the local \nschools; that is a local issue--then I do not know what is a national \nissue.\n  So, I say to my friends who come here to speak in defense of the \ncurrent bill, Rosie Two Bears was in school today in a school that in \nmost cases none of you in this room would send your children to. That \nschool is not going to get fixed with any help from us, despite the \nfact that President Clinton called for it in his State of the Union \nAddress. I support this effort, and I think a number of others in this \nChamber support some initiative to provide incentives to those school \ndistricts that don't have the opportunity and don't have the resources, \n``We are going to help you a bit,'' because we believe that any kid who \nwalks through any classroom anywhere in this country ought to have the \nexpectation that they are going into a room that they can be proud of, \na room in which learning will take place, a room in which education \nwill prosper, a room in which young minds will blossom. That is not the \ncase today in some areas, and we know it.\n  I have great respect, incidentally--I have said this on a couple of \noccasions--for the Senator from Georgia. He has handled himself with \ngreat skill in this debate, and I have great respect for him. However, \nwe differ with respect to the priority of needs. That's the only place \nwe differ. I see our priorities as very different than he does. I would \nlike very much for us, if we have $1.6 billion, to debate about what we \ndo with the $1.6 billion. Let us consider the range of needs that \nrepresent what we think are the national needs in education and then \nstart at the top, pick No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, and identify what we can \ndo.\n  We don't do that. We bring this bill to the floor and we say, no, we \nare not going to deal with the top priority needs. We are going to \nestablish tax subsidized accounts, 52 percent of the benefits of which \nwill go to parents who have fewer than 10 percent of the kids in \nschools and say that is what represents our priority of need. I just \nsay to you I think this shortchanges a\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nlot of children in schools in this country. I regret that we have been \nprevented from having the kind of debate we should have had on these \nissues.\n  Thirty minutes of debate on our side--30 minutes on this question of \nschool construction as a national priority--because that is what we \nwere told was allowed to us under the time agreement for an issue of \nsignificant national importance. This was not the kind of free and open \nand aggressive debate that we ought to have had on the range of \npriorities of needs that exist in education in this country today. It \ndidn't happen this time. Maybe it will happen in the future. I think \nthe Senator from Georgia will win this vote and lose the battle. \nBecause this bill will be vetoed. But then perhaps we will be able to \ndebate the entire range of needs and try to determine from that debate \nwhat kind of priorities we can achieve from each side.\n  I am not somebody who believes only one side has wisdom. I think, \ninstead of getting the worst of what each side has to offer in this \nChamber, both can offer. The only way to do that is to have a real \ndebate, not a debate based on very narrow one-sided rules, but a debate \nin which we guarantee everyone in this Chamber can bring up the best \nideas and we can have a real competition of ideas on the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my good \nfriend from North Dakota but, in deference to time--there will be other \nchances to do it--I am going to yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida. I might add, I think, as I listened to the \nSenator's remarks--he dwelled on construction. There is a key component \nof school construction in the underlying bill and its author is the \nSenator from Florida. So it is opportune that he would be here at this \nmoment.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first to my good friend from Georgia and \nto my good friend from North Dakota, I wish to express my commendation \nfor the quality of debate that is taking place this evening and that \nhas taken place throughout the period of consideration of this \nlegislation. This is, as we will all agree, important business that we \nare about. I believe that we all start from a desire to see that the \nyoung people of our Nation have the best possible educational \nopportunities. We may differ on the details of how we think we can \nachieve that objective, but we should respect our individual desires to \nachieve that goal.\n  It is ironic that we are having this debate on this week as we mourn \nthe death of our former colleague, Senator Terry Sanford. Senator \nSanford, in the earlier part of his career, was the distinguished \nGovernor of North Carolina, from 1961 to 1965. During that period, he \nformed an alliance with the then-president of Harvard, who had written \nextensively on the needs of education in America in the postwar period. \nThen-Governor Sanford took the leadership in establishing an \norganization called the Education Commission of the States. The purpose \nof the Education Commission of the States was to assist in the national \ndebate to rationalize what should be the role of the Federal Government \nand the individual States in meeting the educational needs of American \nyouth.\n  It was agreed by the founders of the Education Commission of the \nStates, under the leadership of Governor Sanford, that the primary \nresponsibility for education in America is and should be at the local \nand State level. But it was also recognized that there were important \nnational goals of education which justified a Federal participation. \nWhat were some of those national roles? One, which was particularly \nsearing at the time of Governor Sanford, was the issue of civil rights; \nthat the National Government had a responsibility of assuring that all \nchildren had their full, legal civil and human rights protected within \nthe education setting; that education should be an opportunity \navailable to all American youth. The Education Commission of the States \nrecognized that the Federal Government had a particular role in higher \neducation, specifically in assuring access to higher education for all \nAmerican children.\n  We had just come through the period of the GI bill, at the end of \nWorld War II, and we were learning, as a Nation, the benefits that we \nhad secured by the fact that millions of Americans who previously had \nno chance at higher education suddenly were given that opportunity and \nthat that opportunity should not be limited to that one generation who \nfought and won World War II, but should be a permanent part of our \nnational commitment to its own future. And a third important area was \nat-risk children, children who did not come into this world with the \nbenefits and opportunities to be fully competitive and were going to \nrequire additional assistance because of their circumstances which were \nbeyond their control.\n  Those have traditionally been some of the priority areas that have \ndefined what should be Federal policy for education. I believe that as \nthey were in the early 1960s, they continue in the late 1990s as \nimportant principles to determine what should be the Federal role in \neducation.\n  For that reason, I am pleased with much of what is in this \nlegislation, but concerned about other important provisions. I am \nconcerned, for instance, about a theme that is running through several \nof the amendments that we have adopted, which essentially says that \nthis thoughtful construction of a Federal role in education is no \nlonger relevant, that we can treat all Federal education funds as if \nthey are fungible, that they can serve any purpose that a State \ndetermines, that there is no longer an appropriate, focused Federal \nrole in these areas such as access to higher education and at-risk \nchildren.\n  We have adopted not just in one place but in several places \namendments, language that says essentially, notwithstanding any other \nlaw or provision, that any Federal education funds can be used for the \nspecific object that the authors of that amendment thought were \nappropriate.\n  I do not believe that is tolerable education policy. It is not \npolicy. It is the denial of a rational policy to direct Federal \neducational actions and resources.\n  For that reason, I am going to vote for this bill, but I will \nannounce at this point that if this bill should come back from the \nconference committee containing these what I consider to be troublesome \nprovisions, I will have to vote against the conference report. I \nbelieve there is a sufficient amount of good in this bill that it is \nnot appropriate at this stage to pronounce its death; that, rather, we \nshould try, with the opportunities that will be available to us in the \nnext few weeks and with the confidence that I have in a person such as \nSenator Coverdell--that we will be able to keep what is constructive \nand what is consistent with our tradition, keep those things that \nSenator Sanford would be pleased to have as part of his legacy of \neducational policy for America, and discard those that are not \nconstructive and not consistent with our traditions.\n  Let me focus on those areas in which I believe there is substantial \ngood embedded for our education and consistent with our tradition.\n  The fundamental thrust of this legislation is to increase the access \nto higher education. While much has been made of the amendment that \nbears the specific name of the Senator from Georgia as to its role in \nelementary and secondary education, if anyone looks at the actual \nnumbers and how this will play out in the planning of the American \nfamily, the reality is that the program is going to have its principal \nutility in preparing a family to meet those enormous costs that are \nassociated with higher education, and, thus, its principal contribution \nis going to be in making it possible for families to save and plan and \nprepare for the cost of college and university. And that is a good \nthing. We are going to spend approximately $1.7 billion to accomplish \nthat.\n  But that is not the only area in which we are going to encourage \naccess to higher education. There is another provision in this bill \nwhich was sponsored by the senior Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, which happens to have a cost over the same time period of \napproximately $2 billion, more than the cost of Senator Coverdell's \nprovision.\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n  What will that provide? That will extend the current provision in the \nlaw that says an employer can provide higher education tuition to one \nof its employees so that that employee can increase his or her skills \nand wisdom and contribution both to the company and to his or her own \ngoals, and that that employee will not have to take into the employee's \nincome the value of that tuition provided by the employer.\n  That is clearly a provision aimed at making more certain, more \nstable, our concept of access to higher education through cooperation \nbetween employers and employees.\n  There is another provision which I have been active in advocating, \nand that relates to State programs through which families can purchase \ncontracts to pay the tuition and, in the case of many States, the room \nand board for their child or grandchild or nephew or niece in advance \nof the time that that child is ready to enter college or university.\n  These plans, which now are in place in 21 States and will add another \n13 States before the end of 1998, vary but have some similar elements. \nThose elements generally include the ability to purchase at a point in \ntime the tuition for a child prior to the time that child is ready for \ncollege and, thus, lock in the tuition at its current level. Thus, the \nfamily is able to avoid tuition inflation, which has been running \nsubstantially higher than inflation in the general economy and higher \nthan increases in family income.\n  It also provides an effective means by which families can plan and \nsave for that large cost. It also fundamentally changes the nature of \nthe question that a child will ask as they are growing towards college \nyears. They no longer will have to ask the question, ``Will I be able \nto afford to go to college?'' Instead, they will ask the questions \n``Will I be prepared to go to college? Will I work hard enough? Will I \nmake adequate grades? Will I be able to distinguish myself so that I \nwill be admitted to the college for which I have already made financial \npreparations?''\n  I think that will be a very important step toward increasing the \nlevel of motivation and quality of learning.\n  There has been a cloud over these plans, the plans that Senator \nLandrieu sponsored when she was the Treasurer of the State of \nLouisiana, the plans which many Members of this Senate have been \ninvolved with in their individual States, and that cloud was that the \nInternal Revenue Service has said these plans are taxable and, \ntherefore, sent a chilling signal to States considering the \nestablishment of the plan and individual families' participation.\n  In the last two years, in what I think were very wise decisions, this \nCongress eliminated the taxability of the plans on an annual basis. \nThat is, as the interest accrued in the account for a particular child, \nthat accumulation would no longer be subject to Federal income \ntaxation.\n  The provision that is in this bill, which happens to have \napproximately the same cost to the Federal Treasury of $1.7 billion as \nthe underlying provision of the Senator from Georgia, will say that \nwhen the funds are transferred at the time of commencement of college \neducation from the State higher education tuition trust fund to the \nindividual university to which the student is now going to be enrolled, \nthat that transaction will also be nontaxable. So the family can be \nassured that every dollar that it invests, every dollar that is \naccumulated in the fund during the period that the child is maturing to \ncollege age, will be used for that child's education.\n  I believe that with the adoption of this provision, we will find many \nmore States that will establish a State plan and many more families \nthan the over 700,000 who are currently participating will participate \nin this means of preparing for their child's higher education.\n  At the end of the day with this legislation, we will have Senator \nCoverdell's bill which will provide one means through an educational \nsavings account to prepare for higher education, we will have Senator \nMoynihan's provision that will provide for the adult who is studying \nthrough the financial assistance of his or her employer, and we will \nhave State-based plans fully tax free providing another vehicle by \nwhich Americans, youth and adult, can see that they will have the \nresources to meet their goal of higher education.\n  That is a good thing. That is consistent with the role of the Federal \nGovernment which we have established at least since the GI bill in \nWorld War II and the definition of the Federal role in education as \nestablished by then Governor Terry Sanford.\n  Another issue which is a very serious one, for which Senator Dorgan \nhas just made an excellent plea, is the issue of school construction. \nThis is a national crisis. The General Accounting Office completed a \nstudy a couple of years ago which indicated the cost of bringing \nexisting schools up to appropriate educational standards was in the \nrange of $110 billion to $120 billion. There is not a comparable figure \nas to what is the cost of building new schools to meet the demands of a \ngrowing student population and to keep class size at reasonable levels, \nbut the best estimate is that it is at least the equal of that cost of \nrehabilitation.\n\n  I believe that this is an area in which the Federal Government has a \nrole and needs to play a more effective partnership with the States. We \nare already doing a significant amount to assist the States. We are \nproviding that States have access to tax-free financing when those \nfinancings are done directly to a public agency for purposes of public \neducation.\n  In this bill we have a provision which may be arcane but which will \nbe significant, particularly to many small and rural school districts. \nAnd that is a provision that builds upon action taken a year ago in \nwhich we allow a school district that issues no more than $10 million \nper year in tax-exempt bonds to keep the difference between the \ninterest that is earned as a lender of the funds prior to paying \nconstruction vendors and the interest which it pays to the bondholders.\n  As an example, a typical school district might issue a bond issue and \npay 6.5 percent interest to bondholders who do not have to pay tax on \nthis interest received. For the period of time before it actually \nbegins to spend that money to construct a school, it may be able to \nloan that money for 8.5 percent. This would allow the school district \nto keep that 2 percent differential, which is referred to as arbitrage.\n  This proposal will make this arbitrage rebate exemption available to \ndistricts issuing up to $15 million in bonds, rather than the current \n$10 million. This will be particularly valuable to those small school \ndistricts who only occasionally are in the business of building that \nelementary school that they may only construct once every 50 years in \norder to meet their needs.\n  Another important provision which I think will be, if adopted, the \nbeginning of a new and creative approach to public education \nconstruction assistance from the Federal level is called the private \nactivity bonds. Private activity bonds are bonds issued by a public \nagency on behalf of a private concern in order to serve a public \npurpose. These bonds today are primarily used in areas such as \nairports, seaports, mass transit facilities, water and sewer \nfacilities, solid waste disposal facilities, housing for low-income and \naffordable housing. Those are the kinds of areas in which this type of \nfinancing is currently available.\n  By the adoption of a provision which is in this bill, we will make \nthis available for the first time to public schools. The irony is that \nunder provisions that are already in effect, private schools, both at \nthe higher education level and at the primary and secondary level, are \nbenefiting by private activity bonds. This creates parity by allowing \npublic schools for the first time to participate directly in private \nactivity bonds.\n  Some examples of how this might work--let me give an example that is \ncurrently in a stage of finalization in Orange County, Orlando, FL, \nwhich is the home of one of the most rapidly expanding school \npopulations in the country.\n  I ask if I could have 3 more minutes to close.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 3 more minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  In the Orange County school district a proposal that is close to \nbecoming a reality involves the school district working with the \nprivate developer\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nwho will build a public school which will be co-located with a YMCA \nfacility. The school district would make payments on the building at 2 \npercent interest for 5 years. At the end of that 5-year period the \nschool district will receive the building and lease out space to the \nYMCA, a creative example of financing co-location, being able to use \nthe school as a means of meeting a variety of the needs of the children \nof that community. This use of private activity bonds will accelerate \nthe creativity and innovation of school districts, particularly those \nthat are facing crushing demands by escalating student population. This \nprovision in the legislation before us has a cost of approximately $400 \nmillion. If I had a criticism, I would say both of these provisions, \nthe one for the small and the rural schools and that for the fast-\ngrowing schools, are inadequate to the challenge. But in the one case \nit is building on progress that we made last year, on the other it is \nstarting a new departure which I think will have tremendous long-term \nbenefit.\n  So it is for provisions like those that I will vote for this \nlegislation. It is my hope, as I indicated, that with the good will and \neffort of people like Senator Coverdell, and Members of my side of the \naisle, that in conference we can take the ideas that are consistent \nwith our tradition of a Federal role in education, build upon them, \nshape them, and bring them to the point that they can serve important, \nconstructive purposes for the youth of America; with those ideas which \nmay have been introduced, I would say, more for theater than for \nserious public policy, they can be discharged and will not cause the \ngood ideas to be placed in jeopardy.\n  I want this legislation to become law. I want to see the benefits in \nterms of access to higher education, school construction, and the other \nvaluable provisions which are included in this bill to be made \navailable to the children and communities of America. Therefore, I will \nvote for this legislation. And I wish it well as it moves on to the \nnext stages of its journey.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge that the work of \nthe Senator from Florida has been immense. All of the provisions that \ndeal with school construction in the underlying bill have been \nbasically the genesis of the Senator from Florida. He has been \nconsistent and persistent, and I want to compliment that work here this \nevening while he is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     state prepaid tuition programs\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia in a brief colloquy to discuss extending to all private college \nprepaid tuition plans the same tax treatment that public college \nprepaid plans receive.\n  Currently, 16 states, including my home state of Alabama and the \ndistinguished Senator's state of Georgia, have established prepaid \ntuition plans that allow resident families to lock in today's tuition \nrates for tomorrow's education. Income taxes on the accrued interest in \nthese accounts are deferred until the account is cashed in to pay for \ncollege and these taxes are paid at the student's tax rate, which is \ntypically lower than that of their parents.\n  Mr. President, as valuable as these plans are, however, there are \ndrawbacks. Specifically, the plans typically cover only in-state public \nuniversities. Therefore, if a student decides to attend an out-of-state \nschool or even an in-state private school, then the savings accrued in \nthe prepaid plan are less valuable because states typically redeem only \nthe principal and some nominal interest to account for inflation.\n  Mr. President, as my good friend from Georgia would agree, this \nplaces private schools at a distinct disadvantage vis-a-vis their \npublic counterparts.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, the Senator from Alabama is correct. Under \ncurrent law, private colleges are at a distinct disadvantage to their \npublic counterparts.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I would like to \nask the Senator from Georgia further, to clarify for me, that under \nthis legislation, H.R. 2646, the A+ Education Savings Account Bill, is \nthere no provision in the bill to place private college prepaid tuition \nplans on equal ground with public prepaid tuition plans?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Alabama is correct. Under this bill, \nHR. 2646, the A+ Education Savings Account Bill, there is currently no \nprovision that would provide the same type of tax treatment for parents \nand students to use for private college and university state pre-paid \ntuition programs.\n  Mr. President, I have met with the Heritage Foundation, and informed \nthem that it is my intention to work to include private colleges and \nuniversities into this bill in Conference so they will be eligible for \nparents and students who choose to attend these private universities \nand colleges by using state pre-paid tuition programs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would just like to convey to my good friend from \nGeorgia, that I was prepared to offer an amendment to his bill that \nwould remedy this inequity, by providing private schools the same fair \nand equitable treatment as is currently provided to public institutions \nof higher learning.\n  However, it is my understanding that the Senator from Georgia plans \nto work with the Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Senator Roth, and \nour other colleagues during the conference on this bill to fix this \ndisparity and provide a level playing field for private universities \nand colleges. Is this a correct characterization of the Senator from \nGeorgia's intention to do so?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would say to my good friend from Alabama, that he is \ncorrect. I am committed to fight for the adoption of this provision in \nconference.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague for \nhis strong support on this issue and I look forward to working with him \nthrough conference and in support of this bill once it returns to the \nFloor.\n\n\n                    Same-gender Education Amendment\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to engage my colleague, \nSenator Torricelli, in a colloquy with regard to my recently-passed \nsame-gender education amendment to the Coverdell-Torricelli A+ bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Senator \nTorricelli and my other colleagues who voted in favor of this important \namendment yesterday. I think the Senate's strong 69 to 29 vote in favor \nof this amendment sent a strong signal that same-gender education \nshould be made available as an option to parents and their children \nenrolled in public schools. I understand, however, that you have \nadditional questions about the amendment and the issue of same-gender \neducation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank Senator Hutchison, thank for setting aside \nthis time today, and for her leadership on this issue in the Senate. I \ncertainly share your support for making same-gender education available \nto more parents and their children. The benefits of same-gender \neducation have been demonstrated in the context of private and \nparochial schools, and the evidence is strong that these same benefits \nawait public education, if the legal uncertainty surrounding this issue \nwere lifted.\n  That is why I was pleased to support your amendment--to allow schools \nto move forward with same-gender programs, if they deem appropriate, \nand not with the fear that by doing so they risk losing federal \nfinancial support. Nevertheless, during the debate on your amendment, \nconcern was raised as to the legal status and impact of your amendment, \nand some claimed your amendment allowing same-gender education funding \ncould lead to discrimination against one sex or the other. Could you \nplease elaborate as to why you believe that your amendment complies \nwith both Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal \nProtection Clause of the 14th Amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator Torricelli very much for his \nstatement and for his very important question. States, school \ndistricts, and individual public schools all over the country have \neither tried to implement same-gender programs and have been forced to \nend them, or have been dissuaded from even trying by the threat\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nof lawsuit or termination of federal funds by the Department of \nEducation.\n  The fundamental purpose and intent of my amendment, then, is to make \nit clear to these schools that it is the will of Congress that they be \nallowed to institute voluntary same-gender programs if they believe it \nwill help further their important mission of educating students of both \nsexes. In no way, however, could this amendment possibly allow \ndiscrimination against either girls or boys.\n  As you know, the text of my amendment is straight forward. It simply \nadds same-gender schools and classrooms as one of the allowable uses \nfor federal funds under Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. As you also know, Title VI is a very flexible block-\ngrant program that can be used for virtually any education reform \neffort a school district wishes to try, arguably including same-gender \nprograms. But in order to receive Title VI funds for a same-gender \nschool or classroom, the amendment requires that school district offer, \nquote ``comparable educational opportunities for students of both \nsexes.'' This requirement is completely consistent with the \nrequirements of both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. What is the opinion of the Senator from Texas on how \nTitle IX and the Equal Protection Clause impact same-gender education?\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits sex-\nbased discrimination by any school receiving federal funds. However, by \nexplicit omission, Title IX does not apply to admissions at same-gender \npublic schools. This is confirmed by Department of Education \nregulations that allow public, same-gender schools, as long as \ncomparable courses and facilities are offered to both sexes. That word, \n``comparable,'' is the precise word used by the Department in their own \nregulations. They do not say ``equal''--they say ``comparable.'' My \nguess as to why they chose not to use the word equal is they came to \nthe same conclusion as I did when drafting my amendment--that ``equal'' \nmeans ``the same,'' and that requiring two or more schools or two or \nmore classrooms, (same-gender or coed), to be exactly the same would \npose a nearly impossible administrative and legal burden for any school \nofficial to meet. It also simply misses the point that in some respects \nthe educational needs of boys and girls are different, and that these \ndifferences cannot and should not be ignored. An all-girls or all-boys \nschool that simply ignored the fact that they were teaching only boys \nor only girls would be an exercise in futility, and educators know it. \nEnforcing some ``equalness'' standards, then, would not only fail to \nclear the way for schools to try same-gender programs, it would very \nlikely ensure the end of such efforts in the future.\n  I would also note that the language of Title IX simply exempts \nadmissions to same-gender public schools; it does not go on to say that \nthis exemption only applies if a school meets either a comparability or \nan ``equalness'' standard. So ensuring that same-sex schools afford \ncomparable opportunities for both sexes, as my amendment does, in fact \nstrengthens the existing protections of Title IX against gender \ndiscrimination in schools.\n  With regard to same-gender classrooms within co-ed public schools, \nthe Department of Education requires that there be a sufficient showing \nthat a single-sex class is necessary to overcome past discrimination \nagainst one sex. But this purely agency-created requirement is nowhere \nto be found in the language of Title IX, and is in fact contrary to the \nlanguage and intent of the statue. It seems clear that Congress would \nnot allow same-gender schools but prohibit same-gender classrooms, \nabsent some onerous and ambiguous showing of past discrimination. This \ndefies logic and the legislative history of Title IX. So, at least with \nregard to the use of the education reform funds identified in my \namendment, I would seek to reverse this unnecessary and overly \nburdensome department-imposed requirement.\n  In fact, it was our colleague, Senator Collins, who pointed out how \nburdensome this requirement really is. She recounted how she had \nvisited an all-girls math class in Presque Isle, Maine. Despite the \ntremendous results she described in terms of watching girls really \nexcel at mathematics, the school was forced to undergo a host of, as \nshe described them ``regulatory hoops'' in order to be allowed by the \nDepartment of Education to continue to foster this success among girls \nin math. This is both unnecessary and unwise if we truly want to \nencourage achievement.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I also noted during the debate that someone cited the \nrecent Supreme Court case involving the Virginia Military Institute in \nclaiming that your amendment did not meet the standard for equal \nprotection of the laws of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. How \nwould you respond to that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. As you know, in that case the Supreme Court struck \ndown the state-supported VMI because the state of Virginia failed to, \nquote ``provide any comparable single-gender women's instituion.'' My \namendment follows the Supreme Court's own language and requires that \nprograms offer ``comparable'' opportunities for both sexes.\n  I should also highlight that while the VMI case is certainly in \nkeeping with my amendment, it was a case about higher education, which \nclearly involves different considerations with regard to the different \nneeds of male and female students than elementary and secondary \neducation. The only major case in which the Supreme Court directly \ndealt with the Equal Protection Clause as applied to K-12 education was \nin Vorchiemer, which involved a challenge to an all-girls academy in \nPhiladelphia. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a Third Circuit \nruling that this single-gender public school did not violate Title IX \nor the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The court in that case \nexplicitly held that there are legitimate differences between boys and \ngirls that can justify separate educational programs in order to \nprovide the best education possible.\n  I appreciated the questions that were raised about this amendment, \nand I sincerely wish to engage them to see how we might best address \ntheir concerns. I hope our discussion here today has been helpful in \nclarifying some of these questions, and I would certainly be happy to \nanswer any additional questions you or other individuals may have.\n  The one point I do not wish to get lost in this discussion, however, \nis that you and I and the other supporters of this amendment simply \nwish to protect single-gender education as an option. If someone is \nopposed on principle to single-gender education, that's fine. They can \nkeep their children in a co-ed environment and even oppose single-\ngender education when their local school board brings it up. But the \ndecision will be made at the local and individual level. Parents and \ntheir children and administers serving the community will choose, and \nthat is what this effort is all about.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator again for taking the time to \nclarify some of these points on her amendment. I look forward to \ncontinuing to working with you to provide families with greater \neducational opportunities.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this week the Senate has been debating a \nproposal that would enable families to invest in tax exempt savings \naccounts. The funds from these savings accounts could be used for \neducational expenses from kindergarten through college, including the \ncost of tuition at private and religious schools.\n  I voted against this proposal in the Finance Committee, and I intend \nto vote against it today. If the President vetoes this bill, I will \nvote to sustain his veto.\n  At first blush, this proposal sounds appealing. Why shouldn't parents \nbe encouraged to save for their children's education? The problem is \nthat the ``encouragement'' the proposal would provide, costs more than \n$1.6 billion over 10 years and, according to the Treasury Department, \n70 percent of the benefits go to the richest 20% of Americans. That is \nmoney that would be better spent on improving public schools, \nparticularly low-income, urban schools where most of the problems \nexist. Also, it permits families to use funds from these tax-exempt \naccounts to pay for tuition at private and religious schools. Doing so \nwould mean that the federal government is subsidizing private and \nreligious education.\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\n  I believe that the Federal role in education must be to support \npublic schools. Nearly 90% of students attend public schools. Our \nnation's public schools are required to take children who come to \nschool at any time of the year, children with disabilities, children \nwhose primary language is not English, children with disciplinary \nproblems, and children with low IQs.\n  Private schools have the ability to select the smartest and the least \ndifficult students, with the fewest challenges to overcome. Families \nwho send their children to private schools typically come from higher \nincome levels, yet it is these families who would receive the greatest \nbenefits from education savings accounts.\n  There have been a number of amendments to this bill. Some of the \namendments that I opposed have merit, and I would like to take a moment \nto explain my reasons for voting against them.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun offered an amendment that would have provided \ntax incentives to help pay for school construction. Although her \namendment failed, Senator Moseley-Braun has been very successful in \nmaking us all aware of the deteriorating conditions of our nation's \nschool facilities. I voted against her amendment because I believe her \napproach would be very difficult for the IRS to administer, and I have \nconcerns about using Superfund taxes as an offset.\n\n  Senator Gorton offered an amendment, and, although I have serious \nconcerns about its effect, he has highlighted an important problem with \nfederal education funding. I share his view that states should have \nsome flexibility in spending federal education funds. They should be \nable to target these funds to schools with the greatest needs, but I \ndon't agree that $10 billion should be given to the states in block \ngrants without the appropriate committees holding a single hearing. \nAlso, the Commissioner of Education in my state had very serious \nconcerns about the impact of this amendment. Next year, when the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is up for reauthorization, I \nhope that consideration is given to Senator Gorton's point of view and \nthat appropriate hearings are held.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Murray's desire to encourage \nsmaller class sizes, particularly in the primary grades. In fact, in \n1987, I introduced a bill that would have created a demonstration \nprogram on small class sizes. Regrettably, the Labor Committee never \nheld hearings on my bill. I voted against Senator Murray's amendment \nbecause I am concerned about providing short term federal support for \nhiring new teachers. How would the school districts pay to keep 100,000 \nnew teachers after the federal funding expired? This is a question \nposed by representatives from local school committees in Rhode Island \nwhen they visited my office earlier this year.\n  Finally, I voted for Senator Ashcroft's amendment to prohibit federal \nfunds from being used for national testing. Unlike many of my \ncolleagues, I am not opposed to national testing. Parents should be \nable to compare their child's performance with children across the \nUnited States. Parents should be able to compare the performance of \ntheir child's school with schools across the state and throughout the \nnation. Nevertheless, I agree with Senator Ashcroft that it is \nCongress' responsibility to authorize a national testing program before \nfederal funds can be used to implement such a program.\n  Regardless of the outcome, we have had a good debate on a very \nimportant issue, namely the federal roll in education in America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I rise \ntoday to oppose, H.R. 2646, the A+ Education Savings Account Act. I am \npleased to see that we in the Senate are discussing educational issues. \nIt is an important debate that the American people need to hear. \nHowever, I simply don't believe this bill takes our nation's education \nsystem in the right direction.\n  One of my highest priorities is preparing Montana's children for the \nchallenges of the 21st Century.\n  Education is the only way to improve our economy and keep our kids \nin-state working at good jobs that help them achieve the kind of future \nwe want for all Americans.\n  In the area of education I have taken it upon myself to do more than \nlegislate. Because legislation can only accomplish so much. I have \nworked hard to put over 350 surplus computers in Montana schools. I've \nencouraged companies to donate funding for computer hardware and \nsoftware. I've prepared a comprehensive guide on technology funding \nwhich has been distributed statewide.\n  My office also conducted and compiled a survey of Montana schools' \ntechnology needs. And I hold weekly internet chats with students \nthroughout Montana.\n  In working toward ensuring that every child has strong technological, \nverbal, written , math and critical thinking skills, I have visited \nover 100 schools during the last year. A lot of these schools are \nbarely making ends meet. Often times teachers and principals are put in \nthe agonizing position of deciding between new books or computers. New \ndesks or a new furnace. While our public schools are in such straits I \nbelieve it is unfair to subsidize attendance at private schools.\n  These institutions are charged with educating all children, not just \nthose who are able to pay or who meet certain requirements.\n  Public education is a mainstay of our democracy. It is the great \ndemocratizer of the American people. Ninety-seven percent of children \nin America attend public schools. Public education is a promise to all \nchildren: if you work hard and commit yourself fully, you can receive a \nquality education. And you can achieve anything.\n  Public education is a promise of opportunity--a promise of open \ndoors. And that is a promise which should be our number one priority to \nuphold.\n  Unfortunately H.R. 2646 will not open the doors of educational \nopportunity for the average American family.\n  This bill would primarily benefit those who are already most able to \nafford a private education. Those making less than $50,000 per year, \nwill receive a tax cut of only a few dollars from this bill.\n  Wealthier families who are in a much better position to save money, \nwill have much larger accumulations of tax-free earnings.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 52% of the tax benefit \nfrom this bill would go to the 7% of families whose children attend \nprivate schools. The other 48% of the benefits would go to the 93% of \nthe families whose children attend public schools. The average benefit \nto a family with children in private schools would be $37 while the \naverage benefit for families with children in public schools would only \nbe $7.\n  Expanding the definition of qualified education expense will result \nin revenue losses of $760 million over five years and $1.6 billion over \nten years. That's money that could be better invested in improving \ncrumbling school buildings, buying computer equipment, paying teachers \nmore and making classes smaller in our public schools.\n  Public education faces more challenges today than ever before. But \nrather than diverting precious resources and students from our public \nschools we need to face these problems head on.\n  Simply abandoning public education does a disservice to every \nAmerican--it breaks the promises that our country is founded on.\n  By any measure, the schools in my own state are doing a good job. In \n1997 Montana continued to top the nation in ACT scores (fourth highest \nin the country) and our state's SAT scores continued to be 37 points \nabove the national average in math and 40 points above the national \naverage in verbal skills.\n  Montana, like nearly half (47%) of the states, has a policy \nprescribing class size.\n  Since 1970 Montana and national student/teacher ratios have stayed \nvirtually parallel, with Montana maintaining a ratio of about two fewer \nstudents per teacher than the national average. Beginning in the mid-\n1990's Montana's statewide ratio of 14.8 students per teacher is only \none fewer that the national average of 15.8 students per teacher. Class \nsizes in most of Montana's middle and larger sized school districts are \nroughly equal to the national average.\n  Unfortunately the salary scale for Montana teachers has not kept pace \nwith the national average. In 1996 our\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\neducators were paid 16% less than the national average.\n  Federal funding plays an increasingly important role in public \neducation. After stagnating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, \nFederal revenues now pay more that 10% of Montana's public schools \ncosts; or 2% more than in 1983. Unfortunately, during this period state \nrevenues committed to education have declined. In 1993, state revenues \npaid for 53.8% of school costs but have now fallen to around 49% of \ntotal school expenditures.\n  Montana is not willing to rest on its education laurels. Our State \nBoard of Public Education is evaluating new standards for math and \nreading proficiency.\n  The State Superintendent of Public Instruction recently stated that \n``(i)t's time to raise the high bar on education'' by forging ahead \nwith development of new standards for science and communications, \nEnglish, writing, speech and debate.\n  Rather than providing tax benefits for those who can already send \ntheir children to the best schools, we need to invest in education \nsystems like Montana's that have a proven record of success while \ninsuring that public schools that do not perform well are held \naccountable for their performance.\n  We are called upon today to discuss our nation's education system. \nAnd I welcome the debate that all sides will give. However, I urge my \ncolleagues to support public education--support the promise that we \nhold out to all children regardless of faith, race, income or ability.\n  Oppose the A+ Education Savings Account Act. And hold open wide the \ndoor of opportunity for all America's children.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am here today to support the A+ \nEducation Savings Accounts bill the Senate is currently considering.\n  Many Americans, including single mothers and low and middle income \nfamilies, face the dilemma of how to afford the best possible education \nfor their children. The A+ bill is good legislation that gives all \nfamilies education opportunities they may not have otherwise.\n  During my years as a United States Senator, I have learned that the \ntrue measure of the legislation we propose and pass comes from my \nconstituents in Idaho. A letter from a northern Idaho school teacher \nnamed Brad Patzer perfectly expresses why the Senate should pass this \nbill. The Patzer family has one child in 2nd grade and the other in \nkindergarten. I would like to share with you an excerpt of Mr. Patzer's \nsentiments regarding the educational future of his two children. Brad \nwrote, ``. . . I believe that the power of choice needs to rest with \nparents and I agree that this IRA would provide more equal \nopportunities for those willing to make their children's education a \npriority.''\n  The Patzers, like most parents, do not want their children's \nimpending education costs to prevent them from receiving the highest \nquality education. They want flexibility to make good choices both \nabout day to day K-12 educational expenses and the future enrollment of \ntheir children in college. This legislation accomplishes these goals.\n  The A+ Education Savings plan will aid families and school districts \nall over the country. As we contemplate the rising costs of education \nmany would believe those comments are solely directed to higher \neducation. As we have learned in recent years, however, parents are \nhaving equal difficulty in paying for their kids elementary and \nsecondary schooling. The A+ legislation begins by increasing the \ncurrent contribution limit of $500 for educational IRA's to $2000. The \nscope of this IRA is also expanded to allow contributions to be used \nfor day to day elementary and secondary education as well as future \ncollege costs. This provision allows parents to save for their future \ncollege expenses while at the same time covering expenses during their \nchild's younger years. For example, if a family deposited an original \n$2,000 in an A+ account at the time of their child's birth, they would \nhave a savings of $4,522 by the time the child reaches kindergarten. \nAnother provision in this bill would establish a tax free status for \nstate-sponsored prepaid tuition programs, allowing students to withdraw \nfrom an account, tax-free, that was established years before the \nstudent approached his or her college years.\n  In addition, the A+ bill proposes a new, and creative method for \nconstructing schools. The private sector would be allowed to use tax \nexempt financing to build schools, and would then be able to lease \nthose facilities back to local school districts. After a designated \nnumber of years the facilities would then become the property of the \nleasing school district. In the bill's current form, Idaho is \nauthorized to issue up to $10.2 million of these new type of bonds; $5 \nmillion for wherever the need is the greatest and another $5 million \nfor high growth school districts. Under the bill, however, only a few \nschool districts would be eligible to utilize this bond. I have raised, \nwith the floor manager of the legislation, my concern that economically \ndepressed school districts, not just high growth areas, should also \nreceive special consideration. To be issued, however, these bonds must \nconform to conditions imposed by Idaho state and constitutional law. \nThe floor manager of the bill, the senior Senator from Georgia, has \nsaid he is willing to work to see whether this issue can be addressed \nwhen this bill goes to conference with the House of Representatives. \nThe measure retains current federal law that allows school districts, \nwith voter approval, to issue an unlimited amount of tax-exempt bonds \nfor school construction.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the A+ bill allows for the establishment of a \ntax-free savings account for each American child. It also contains a \nspecial provision for the use of such accounts for children with \nspecial needs. Specifically, the bill waives the age limit for children \nbenefiting from such accounts for those students with special needs. I \nfeel this is an important acknowledgment of the financial concerns \nwhich can come with being the parent of such a child. We reauthorized \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act because we wanted to \nimprove the way we educate special needs children. This provision will \nhelp parents expand on what we have already done.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues for their support of my \nStudent Improvement Incentive Grant amendment. This amendment provides \nstates with a new option for how to use their federal education \ndollars. Under my amendment, states will be able to use these funds to \nreward schools which demonstrate excellence. Such a system will help \ncreate competition between schools to encourage improvement in \neducation. Most importantly, in creating this new option, we did not \nincrease federal regulation, federal spending, or federal oversight of \nour schools.\n  I support the pending legislation because it gives parents more \nfinancial tools to meet education needs. The bill creates educational \nsavings accounts which allow parents to place as much as $2,000 per \nyear, per child in a designated savings account. These after-tax, non-\ngovernment dollars would earn interest at a tax-free rate and could be \nused for education expenses (home computers, tutoring, tuition) \nassociated with any K-12 school. With help of my amendment we have also \nestablished a precedence to raise the level of excellence within our \nschools. This legislation is not the sole answer to the future of \nAmerica's education, however, it is a step in the right direction. I \nwould urge my colleagues to recognize the significant role this \neducational savings plan could have in the future of many American \nstudents and their families. I would urge my colleagues to support and \npass this legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2646, \nthe Education IRA Tax Bill. I oppose this bill for three reasons. First \nof all, it is does not meet the education needs of America's children. \nSecond, it does not support the mission of either public or private \neducation. Third, it does not meet its stated goal of providing \neconomic relief to America's families.\n  Mr. President, this bill is ineffective in serving the education \nneeds of our children. One of my priorities as a Senator for Maryland \nis standing behind our kids. I believe this priority should also be at \nthe heart of the Senate's agenda. The bill before us does not reflect \nwhat America's priorities in education should be.\n  Let me state clearly that I believe that education should be a non-\npartisan issue about what is good for our\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nkids and the future of our country. Fighting for education does not \nmean pitting our schools or our people against one another. It should \nnot be about private schools vs. public schools, or wealthier people \nvs. people with more modest means of educating their children.\n  This is not what education is about. This is not what the business of \nthe Senate is about. We are here to do the very best we can for ALL of \nthe people of America, not just a select few. We have a duty to help \nALL of the children of America to prepare themselves for the 21st \ncentury.\n  We need to be able to look toward a future that promotes a \nsustainable, robust economy. A key element to our future is educating \nthose who will be governing our future. We need to invest in our \nchildren's education so that they can skillfully navigate our country \ninto the ever expanding world markets. They need the skills to become \nproductive members of our workforce. Our children need the educational \ntools that allow them to understand the complicated economic mechanisms \nthat govern our modern world.\n  While the Coverdell IRA bill purports to be a pro-education bill, it \ndoes nothing to improve the education of the majority of our students. \nCoverdell does nothing to ensure our kids have the tools they need to \ncope with these important issues as future leaders and hardworking \nadult citizens of our country.\n  Support for public education must be the priority for federal \ninvestment. Coverdell represents an actual divestment in public \nschools. The Coverdell bill costs $1.6 billion dollars over the next \nten years and gives the majority of the benefits to only 7% of the \nfamilies with children in school. Even those benefits are meager ones. \nFor example, the average family with children in private schools stands \nto benefit only $37 a year in tax exclusions.\n  This $1.6 billion can be much better spent following an agenda that \ntruly gets behind our kids. The Senate should support and pass \nlegislation that offers real solutions to address the problems faced by \nour schools.\n  Students cannot learn in overcrowded schools that are falling down \naround them. Schools in every state in this country are in desperate \nneed of repair. This year, K-12 enrollments reached an all-time high of \n52 million children and they will continue to rise. It is estimated \nthat we will need to build 6,000 new schools by 2006 to maintain \ncurrent class sizes. Leaky roofs and overcrowded classrooms are the \nreal problems that need to be addressed, not whether an average $37 per \nyear tax benefit is what is best for Americans and education.\n  We should target scarce federal resources to finance the construction \nand modernization of our public schools. These are the schools that 93% \nof our children attend. These schools will help many communities \nprovide modern, well-equipped schools that can be wired for computers \nand technology so the children can get the education they need to \nsucceed in the 21st century. These are also the same schools that may \nhouse after-school education and safety programs which our children \nneed.\n  We need to place our priorities on hiring new teachers. I supported \nSenator Kennedy's amendment to hire 100,000 new teachers and to make \ncertain that they are well qualified in the areas we need them most.\n  Under the 1994 Crime bill, we agreed to add 100,000 cops to police \nforces throughout the country. My own state of Maryland has added over \n1,200 cops--who are out in the community fighting crime. I know what a \ndifference they've made in preventing crime, and in ensuring that those \nwho commit crimes are apprehended. Our streets are safer because of \nthis program. Think what a difference 100,000 new teachers could have \nmade. I am disappointed that this amendment was not approved.\n  The Coverdell bill does not meet any of these dire education needs--\nfor school repair, for school construction, for more teachers and \nsmaller class sizes. It is silent on these critical needs.\n  The Coverdell bill is ineffective in supporting the mission of either \npublic or private education. I believe that public education--the \nchoice of 93% of America's families--must not be shortchanged by the \nfederal government. But let me be clear that I support our private \nschools as well. I am a proud product of parochial schools. What I am \ntoday I owe in large measure to the sisters who educated me in \nBaltimore's parochial schools. They nourished my intellect, and they \nnourished my spirit.\n  So I know about the value of private schools and I support private \nschools. But I believe there are better ways to support private school \neducation. The federal government already provides substantial \nassistance in support of private education. There are a range of \nfederal programs that private schools can take advantage of which are \ndesigned to serve a variety of school student and teacher needs.\n  For example, there are 366 private schools in Maryland that take \nadvantage of ``Innovative Programs,'' a federal program available to \nboth private and public schools. Innovative Programs supports a broad \nrange of local activities in eight primary areas including technology, \nreform implementation, disadvantaged children, literacy programs, \ngifted programs and some Title I and Goals 2000 activities or programs. \nI believe that better use of the resources tied up by this bill--some \n$760 million over the next five years--could be better used through \nsupporting existing programs that benefit both public and private \nschools.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation is ineffective in providing \neconomic relief to America's families. I know how hard many families of \nmodest means struggle to give their children the best education \npossible. The Coverdell bill has been presented as a tool to give these \nfamilies some financial relief. But, that is a hollow promise. The \naverage family with children in private schools would receive tax \nrelief of only $37.00 a year. $37.00, Mr. President. I know that every \ndollar counts, but $37.00 a year is not going to make much of a \ndifference in the average family's budget.\n  The bottom line is that the education IRA will not fix our crumbling \nschools or help us bring qualified teachers into our classrooms. The \neducation IRA will not bring the information superhighway to public \nschools. In fact, it will bring very little benefit to the majority of \nAmericans and no benefit at all for Americans who cannot afford to \ncontribute money to these savings accounts.\n  For these reasons, I must oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to cast my wholehearted support for \na very important piece of legislation for our children and our nation's \nfuture, H.R. 2646, the A-Plus Education Savings Account Act. As my \ncolleagues know, this bill would provide families with the economic \nfreedom to save their own money, tax-free for their children's \nelementary and secondary educational needs.\n  I am excited that the Senate is about to pass a bill which addresses \nthe unique educational needs of all our children while making \nsignificant strides toward improving their academic performance. This \nbill is an important step toward returning to parents and communities \nthe means and responsibility to provide for their children's education. \nThis is why I support the A+ bill and will continue to support \ninnovative, flexible programs which focus on the best interests of our \nchildren, our future.\n  As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I have consistently \nworked with my colleagues to ensure passage of this bill and have \nlooked forward to the day when it would pass the full Senate.\n  Unfortunately, I will be unavoidably absent for the final vote on \nthis crucial education measure. I am very disappointed that the vote on \nfinal passage for this measure was unexpectedly delayed. If I had been \nable to be present this evening, I would have voted yes for this bill.\n  Again, I want to reiterate my commitment for this bill and regret my \nabsence for witnessing the passage of such a monumental measure. \nFinally, I would like to take a moment to applaud the leadership of my \ncolleague, Senator Coverdell and his staff for his commitment to this \nproposal. He has fought tirelessly on behalf of our nation's children \nand should be commended for his efforts.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I encourage my colleagues to support \nlegislation which will open doors to education opportunities for \nparents and children throughout our nation.\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n  Education savings accounts are a sensible step toward solving the \neducation crisis in America by allowing families to save their own \nmoney to pay for their child's educational needs.\n  This bill would empower parents with the financial tools to provide \nfor all the needs they recognize in their children--needs that teachers \nor administrators should not be trusted to address in the same way that \na parent can.\n  These accounts would provide families the ability to save for extra \nfees, tutoring, home computers, S.A.T. preparation, transportation \ncosts, or in cases of violent incidents, would allow a family to \nconsider another public or private school.\n  This kind of tax relief is especially important for parents who are \nworking two jobs with no extra time to help with homework, or those who \ndo not feel adequate in their own knowledge to tutor their children.\n  As parents, I know that my wife and I were the best judges of our \nchildren's needs because we truly cared about their future.\n  And as all parents realize, I knew that I was in the best position to \naddress those needs.\n  As a small businessman, I would have welcomed an opportunity to \naccrue tax-free interest to help pay for more opportunities in \neducation for my children.\n  Far too many parents find that their hopes to provide the best \neducation for their children are crushed as they realize the costs \ninvolved in accomplishing this task.\n  Contrary to popular myth, 75% of the children who would benefit from \nthis bill are public school students. The new estimates released by the \nJoint Tax Committee appear to disprove the claim that public school \nrevenues would be reduced by A+ accounts.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that by the year 2000, 14 million \nstudents will be able to benefit from this bill, with 90 percent of \nthose families earning between $15,000 and $100,000 a year.\n  This savings is not reserved for the wealthy but instead lifts the \nburden from our nation's hard working lower and middle class families.\n  This bill is good for families--it's good for schools--especially \npublic schools.\n  Since parents would be spending their own money, it fuels parental \ninvolvement in their children's education.\n  And because it gives them increased resources that can be used for \neducation at their own child's school, it encourages parental \ninvolvement in the schools as well.\n  Tax-free savings accounts may not fix our nation's education system, \nbut they will give parents an opportunity to make a difference for \ntheir own children and their own community's school.\n  Our tax code has always encouraged various deductions and credits for \ninvestment in physical capital, but why have we never encouraged \ninvestments in human capital?\n  Education for our children is the most worthwhile investment we \nhave--one that we should protect and foster growth.\n  This bill is a positive step towards reform and choice in our public \nschool system.\n  Why anyone would vote against tax relief for America's families and \nimproving education for all of our nation's children at the same time \nis difficult for me to understand.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, for introducing this \nbill.\n  I believe that the working families in our states will thank us for \nhanding them an opportunity to invest in their own children.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nCoverdell bill. This bill will undermine our public schools and provide \nthe bulk of the tax breaks to wealthy individuals.\n  Mr. President, before I talk about the Coverdell bill, I want to make \ntwo points. First, I am not opposed to tax cuts for families which help \nthem make ends meet and invest in their children. For example, last \nyear I supported the $500 family tax credit and the HOPE Scholarship \n$1,500 tax credit for college tuition both contained in the 1997 \nTaxpayer Relief Act. I also believe that we can enact further targeted \ntax cuts for hard working middle class families this year without \ntapping the surplus.\n  Second, I am not opposed to private schools. In fact, I commend the \nteachers and administrators in private schools for their work. And I \nstrongly support the mission of the private schools in my State. \nCatholic, Jewish, and other parochial and private schools provide an \nexcellent education to thousands of New Jersey children.\n  But I am also a strong supporter of our public school system, because \n93 percent of all children go to public schools. They come from all \ndifferent, racial, ethnic, religious, disability, academic and \nfinancial backgrounds. They are generally poorer than children who go \nto private schools. They tend to live in unsafe neighborhoods--\nsurrounded by crime and drugs. They mostly attend schools that are in \nneed of great repair. Many have no textbooks and ancient computer \nequipment that does not provide them access to the internet.\n  Mr. President, these children should be our highest priority. And I \nwill never give up on them.\n  I strongly believe in educational equity--the ability for all kids to \nhave access to an excellent education with modern facilities and \ntalented teachers. But the Coverdell bill will only make our \neducational system less equitable. If we pass it, we are turning our \nbacks on our public schools.\n  Mr. President, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, I must tell \nmy colleagues that Federal budgeting is a zero sum game. And since this \nbill effectively spends money to help private schools, we cannot spend \nmore for public schools. It is that simple.\n  Unfortunately, our public schools have enormous financial needs. For \nexample, our schools need a tremendous amount of modernization. In \nfact, our existing school buildings are in such poor shape, the General \nAccounting Office estimated that we need to spend $112 billion on \nrepairs and renovations. Fourteen million children--mostly from poor or \ninner-city school districts--attend schools that need extensive repair \nor replacement.\n  But the needs of our public schools do not stop here. They need \nmodern computers. They need to be hooked up to the internet. They need \nmore teachers to reduce class size. That is why the President proposed \nhiring 100,000 new teachers. We also need greater funding for educating \ndisabled children. And the list goes on and on. That is why the 93 \npercent of all American children who attend them should be our number \none priority.\n  Mr. President, this bill is also unfair as a matter of tax policy. \nWhile we are awaiting final figures from the Treasury Department, I \nwould like to point out the tax distribution of last year's Coverdell \nbill. Under last year's Coverdell bill, the average tax benefit for the \nrichest 20 percent of all Americans would be $96. But do you know what \nthe average tax benefit would be for the lowest 20 percent of all \nAmericans? One dollar! One buck!\n  Mr. President, this means that the richest Americans would get \nninety-six times the tax break that the poorest Americans would get \nunder the old Coverdell bill. Now, I understand that this new Coverdell \nbill is slightly modified, but I understand that the same dramatic \ninequity still exists.\n  We simply should not pass a tax bill that is so skewed toward the \nrich. Any tax relief should be focused towards middle class Americans--\npeople who work hard to raise their families.\n  Mr. President, the Democratic alternative to this bill meets part of \nour educational needs in an equitable manner. It will provide tax \nincentives for employer paid education and pre-paid college tuition \nplans that exist in many states. It also provides $22 billion for \nschool modernization. This will mean that thousands of schools across \nour country will have better science labs, safer classrooms and smaller \nclass size.\n  If we pass the Democratic education plan, along with the President's \nproposals to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size, increase the \nnumber of tutors available and create new education opportunity zones, \nwe will see real improvements in our educational system both public and \nprivate.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has indicated that he \nwill veto the Coverdell bill. It will hurt our public schools and \nprovide a tax break\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nfor the rich on top of it. When it comes to our public school children, \nthis bill says ``let them eat cake.''\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation for the sake of the \nmillions of children who walk through the public school door house \nevery day and seek a solid physical and educational foundation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I, before I yield time to the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, inquire of the Senator from Georgia--those we \nknow on our side who have requested time include Senator Biden for 5 \nminutes; Senator Kennedy for 5 minutes; and Senator Daschle for 10 \nminutes. That represents the list of all of those we know who will be \nhere to speak.\n  Could the Senator from Georgia indicate to us the list that he has so \nwe might determine when we might be headed for a vote?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My list is Senator Domenici, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, and my closing remarks. We are 15 minutes or less. \nThat would put a vote around 7:30.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if that is the case, it might be useful \nfor Members to understand that some time in the next 35 minutes or so \nwe might be heading toward a vote. So with that, I yield the 5 minutes \nto the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to be clear, on my time I would like to yield \npart of my time to Senator Bingaman on a Steve Schiff memorial we want \nto introduce. We will not take much time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Fine.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have listened to and been involved in \nthis debate now for weeks before this got to the floor, and since it \nhas gotten to the floor, and now in the final moments. And I find \nmyself in an unusual position. I think the claims made by everyone on \nboth sides of this issue are greatly exaggerated.\n  Although I have voted against vouchers, and have voted against direct \nfunding to private schools, I strongly support, and have since I got \nhere in 1973, the use of the Tax Code to indirectly assist private \nschools.\n  My friend from North Dakota talked about how the public schools are \ngetting short shrift, but so are the private schools. The private \nschools I went to were Catholic grade schools where the average income \nI expect was lower--I know it was lower in the neighborhood I lived \nin--than the average income in the public schools. I will not belabor \nthis, mainly because no one is interested and, secondly, because I do \nnot have the time.\n  I think when we get here on the floor and people say, this is really \nabout priorities, I agree. And if the debate really were whether or not \nto spend this money for aiding higher and elementary and secondary \neducation, all three--and about $300 million of this bill is for \nsecondary and elementary education through the Tax Code--I would say \nthat is a legitimate debate.\n  The truth is, most of the people who are voting against this are \nvoting against it because in principle they don't think the Tax Code \nshould be used this way, period. They have no desire under any \ncircumstance--and they think it is anathema to our system--to help even \nindirectly private schools.\n  So I find myself in strong disagreement and in a distinct minority in \nmy party on that view. Consequently, I voted against a whole lot of \nthings I have supported for 20 years, because most of the initiatives \nthat were brought up that I supported were in lieu of--in lieu of--this \nuse of the Tax Code, this IRA, which is going to be a very, very small \namount of money for most people, by the way.\n  Then having done that--and I do not in any way suggest that the \nsponsor of this legislation had this in mind--along came an amendment \nthat trumped everything for me. I have always been an extremely strong \nsupporter of public schools. I have supported education for the 25 \nyears I have been here. With every major education initiative, I have \nplayed a small part, at least in my vote, along with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who has been the leader in this body on education issues \nsince I have been here.\n  So along comes an amendment by Senator Gorton that essentially \nemasculates the notion of Federal participation in the education \nprocess in our country. I am not suggesting that he is not \nphilosophically committed to the notion that there should be no \nDepartment of Education, that it should all be local. But, I think that \nis malarkey. I think that is absolutely ``brain dead'' in terms of what \nthis country needs. That is my view.\n  So now I am faced with a dilemma. I want to support this bill. But, \nin helping a little tiny bit those parents who send their kids to \nprivate schools--over the objection of my friend Senator Kennedy and \nothers--in the process, from my perspective, I would be voting to \nemasculate the Federal responsibility in education by shifting all \nprograms to a block grant.\n  I find it ironic, by the way, all this talk from Republicans about, \n``We don't want any directed education programs, we want block \ngrants,'' and then everyone voted for a Republican-sponsored amendment \nto create a new directed Federal Government education program which is \nnot a block grant.\n  At any rate, I can no longer support this bill. It really makes me \nangry with myself that I can't vote for this bill. All these years \ntrying to get a little bit of fairness, in my view, for private and \nparochial schools. It is just about to happen, and I can't vote for it \nnow because it undermines everything I have believed about the role of \nthe Federal Government in education for the last 25 years.\n  So I say to my friend from Georgia, who has been straight up with me, \nupfront with me, the whole way--our offices are across from one other--\nalthough we met on this and strategized on this, and, I think to the \nchagrin of my Democratic colleagues, although I helped play a part in \ngetting this bill to the floor, now I can't vote with him.\n  Now, if you go to conference and this is dropped--that is, the \nfoolishness of the Gorton amendment--and the bill comes back here \nwithout the Gorton amendment in it, I will vote for it and I will vote \nto override a Presidential veto. But I cannot vote for it in its \npresent form.\n  The reason, Mr. President, I wanted to vote for the Education IRA \nproposal is because I believe in it. I have always believed--and I \nvoted as far back as 1978--that we should find some way to help \nfinancially those parents who wish to send their children to the school \nof their choice.\n  That does not mean that I support every effort to provide tax dollars \nor tax breaks to support private education. But, I have supported--and \nwill continue to support--reasonable, appropriate, constitutional \nmeasures that do not take money away from the public schools to help \nmiddle-class and lower-income families who choose an alternative to \npublic schools.\n  Let me also say that my support for this bill--and similar \ninitiatives--should in no way be viewed as an abandonment of public \neducation. Yes, there are some supporters of this bill who believe that \nthere should be no Federal role in education or that the Federal \ngovernment should not help States fund public education or that we \nshould decrease our commitment to public education. I have not, do not, \nand never will subscribe to that philosophy.\n  I have supported and will continue to support increasing funding for \npublic schools and for programs to help the public schools--Title I for \ndisadvantaged children, Goals 2000 academic standards, safe and drug \nfree schools, special education, school construction, and smaller class \nsizes, to name a few examples. Public education must be our top \npriority. But, no matter how much those on both sides of this issue try \nto make it so, this is not an either-or choice--where you either \nsupport public education or you support families who choose an \nalternative to public schools. That is a false choice.\n  Now, having said all that, Mr. President, let me explain in some \ndetail why I believe it to be true--why I believe this bill is \nreasonable and appropriate, and does not undermine public education. In \ndoing so, I need to review some of the provisions of this bill, which \nmy colleagues are familiar with. I do this because as I have talked to \npeople about this bill--and as people have talked to me--it is clear \nthat there is a lot of misunderstanding about it. So, let me take a few \nminutes to explain exactly what this bill is and is not.\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n  This bill is not is a voucher bill. It does not provide a voucher or \ngrant to pay for private schools. This is not a tuition tax credit \nbill. It does not give a tax write-off for the costs of tuition at \nprivate schools. And, this is not a bill to aid private schools. It \ndoes not give private schools a dime of tax money.\n  What this bill does is simply say that the interest earned on a \nfamily's savings that are used for education will not be considered \ntaxable income. Let me be more specific.\n  Last year, we established Education IRAs for higher education. This \nwas a proposal that I had originally introduced in 1996 as part of my \ncomprehensive bill--known as the ``GET AHEAD'' Act--to make college \nmore affordable for middle-class families. Under last year's tax bill, \nfamilies can now put up to $500 per year into an Education IRA and if \nthat money is later used to pay for the costs of higher education, the \ninterest on that savings will not be taxed.\n  This bill does two things to build on last year's law. First, it \nincreases the amount that can be put into the account each year from \n$500 to $2000. Second, for families with incomes under $160,000, the \nbill allows funds in an Education IRA to be used--without having to pay \ntax on the interest--for the costs of a child's education at any \nlevel--elementary, secondary, or higher education--and at any school, \npublic or private, or for home schooling expenses.\n  There is no tax deduction for the amount put into the savings \naccount. And, there is no tax deduction for the entire cost of a \nprivate school education. Those are myths. This bill simply says that \ninterest earned on Education IRAs--which already exist for higher \neducation--will not be taxed if the money is used at any level of \neducation. What is the harm in that? I see none. We are simply \nexpanding existing Education IRAs so that people can use their own \nmoney to pay for elementary and secondary education costs.\n  Now, Mr. President, here is something interesting. The cost of this \nproposal is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $1.6 \nbillion over ten years, paid for by closing loopholes in the current \ntax law--not by taking money away from public schools. But, about $1.3 \nbillion of the cost is expected to result from Education IRAs used to \nhelp finance the cost of a higher education. Only $300 million--and, \nremember, that's over a 10-year period--would result from Education \nIRAs used to help pay for elementary and secondary education. In other \nwords, less than 20 percent of the cost of this proposal is a result of \nEducation IRAs being used for elementary and secondary education \ncosts--what all the hullabaloo has been about--and some of that would \nbe used by families with children in public schools.\n  Let me repeat that. Under this bill, Education IRAs can be used to \nhelp families whose kids attend public schools. If parents need to buy \ntheir kids public school uniforms, they can use this money. If parents \nneed to buy their kids a computer, they can use this money. If a child \nneeds an after-school or summer tutor, parents can pay for that tutor \nusing this money.\n  How is that a disaster that will befall this nation's public school \nsystem? The answer is, it is not. That is a rhetorical exaggeration by \nopponents of this bill, who are trying to have it both ways. On the one \nhand, they claim that this bill is significant because it will \nundermine public education, and on the other hand, they argue that this \nbill is meaningless because the tax benefit for the average family, \nthey claim, will be $37 per year. Which is it--significant or \nmeaningless? It cannot be both.\n  The truth is, this bill in the aggregate will have only a marginal \nimpact. But, to some families, it will be a real help. And, so I \nbelieve that this bill is an appropriate way to reach a desirable \ngoal--assisting parents who wish to send their children to the school \nof their choice.\n  Finally, Mr. President, although I support this bill, let me say that \nI am disappointed with the way the Republican leadership chose to bring \nup this bill. I am disappointed because we did not use this opportunity \nto have a serious debate on education in this country. By any measure, \nas I just noted, this bill will have only a small impact. And, it will \nhelp primarily--not exclusively, but primarily--families whose children \nattend private schools. I support it out of a sense of fairness.\n  But, meanwhile, there are 45 million public school children in this \ncountry. And, we have schools that are falling down, classes that are \novercrowded, and children who have nowhere to go and nothing to do when \nthe final school bell rings at 3:00 in the afternoon. Even if the \nEducation IRA proposal becomes law--which I think it should, and I hope \nit will--it is not a fix for the problems of America's schools, and we \nshould not pretend otherwise. No matter how important I think this bill \nis, it is not about making our public schools better. We could have put \nmore money in building and repairing schools. We could have put 100,000 \nnew teachers in our elementary school classrooms to reduce class size. \nWe could have funded after-school programs to help keep kids off the \nstreets and away from crime. We could have done all of these things in \naddition to the Education IRA proposal. But, we did not.\n  We have missed the opportunity to think big and have instead gone \nforward with a bill that gets by with something small. Nonetheless what \nis being done here is important, and I look forward to voting for it if \nthe Gorton amendment is dropped.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici and Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1978 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very important education bill \nbefore us today.\n  It is a revolutionary education bill.\n  It encompasses a major philosophical shift.\n  This legislation is as significant as when we, as a society, decided \nthat it was okay, in fact desirable, to teach girls to read. It is as \nbig of a philosophical shift as when the Supreme Court struck down \nseparate but equal schools in the 1960's.\n  This bill stands for the proposition that during a time when our \ntechnological capability is undergoing exponential change, education \nalso needs exponential change not incremental tinkering.\n  To understand the magnitude of this proposed change, start with old \nadage ``follow the money.''\n  The Gorton amendment takes the money and provides three different \npaths for it to follow. Instead of a myriad of overlapping programs, \neach with its own set of guidelines, principles, and educational \ncommandments, states are given maximum flexibility. Flexibility not \nonly on ``what'' to do with the federal education dollars but ``how'' \nthose federal dollars should be delivered to states.\n  States can opt to send funds directly to local school districts minus \nthe federal regulations; or--states can decide they want their federal \nmoney to be sent to the state education authority without federal \nregulations or--states can opt to continue to receive federal funds \nunder the current system.\n  States are supposed to be laboratories for government experiments. \nThe Gorton amendment allows this experimentation so that Congress will \nhave some concrete examples and data to see how each approach works.\n  This bill stands for the proposition that the best decisions \nregarding education are local decisions and this amendment gives the \nfederal purse to the local decision makers.\n  This bill stands for the proposition that our schools need to do \nthings differently. Too many kids are merely getting ``social \npromotions'' to keep them in a class with their age group regardless of \nwhether they have learned their lessons. It is a sad state when many of \nour graduates can't read the diplomas they receive at graduation.\n  Too many schools don't teach the basics any more, and what they do \nteach isn't taught very well.\n  Another important philosophical shift encompassed in this legislation \nis the long-overdue, common-sense revelation that it is reasonable to \nexpect teachers to pass a competency test before we can expect our \nstudents to be able to pass tests. I am pleased that this bill includes \na provision providing for teacher testing and merit pay.\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\n  The bill now includes an amendment to provide new grants to states \nthat (1) test K-2 teachers for proficiency in the subject area they \nteach and (2) has a merit based teacher compensation system.\n  In line with my belief that teacher competence is key to improving \nAmerican education, this bill creates incentives for states to \nestablish teacher and merit pay policies.\n  I believe the best teachers should be rewarded for their efforts to \neducate our children. A little competition in our public schools would \nbe a good thing for rewarding these teachers who excel at their \nprofession and motivating those who may need to improve their \nperformance.\n  The MERIT amendment would use the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram (Title II) to provide incentive funds to states that establish \nperiodic assessments of elementary and secondary school teachers, \nincluding a pay system to reward teachers based on merit and proven \nperformance.\n  The legislation would not reduce current funding for the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program. Incentives will be provided to states \nthat establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. The amendment \npermits the use of federal education dollars to establish and \nadminister these programs.\n  The Eisenhower program, established in 1985, gives teachers and other \neducational staff access to sustained and high-quality professional \ndevelopment training. In 1998, the Congress approved $28.3 million, $10 \nmillion more than in 1997, for the Eisenhower program to provide in-\nservice training for teachers in core subject areas.\n  The President requested $50 million for the Eisenhower program in \n1999, an increase of $26.7 million above the $28.3 million provided in \n1998. New Mexico received $2.4 million in 1997 for all 89 school \ndistricts. The President funds his 1999 request at the expense of Title \nVI, Innovative Program Strategies, which New Mexico also heavily \nutilizes. He requests no funding for this program, which received $350 \nmillion in 1998.\n\n  This is but one step forward in our bid to improve the educational \nperformance of American students. This amendment supports the principle \nthat all children deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent and \nqualified teachers.\n  This bill also builds upon the education savings accounts enacted \nlast year. It expands the amount of money that can be saved and expands \nits uses to include K-12.\n  About 14 million individuals are expected to sign up for these \naccounts by the year 2002. Contributions can be saved to cover college \nexpenses or used when needed to pay for a wide range of education \nexpenses during a student's elementary and high school years. Examples \nof eligible expenses include text books, computers, school uniforms, \ntutoring, advanced placement college credits, home schooling, after-\nschool care and college preparation courses.\n  A tutor can make the difference between success or a student falling \nhopelessly behind.\n  A computer can open the world, as well as cyberspace to a child. \nChildren growing up in homes with computers will be the achievers. I am \nafraid children growing up in homes without computers will be at a \ndisadvantage. This bill will allow money from an education savings \naccount to be spent on a computer, software, and lessons on how to use \nthe computer.\n  The bill has several solid worthwhile provisions.\n  It raises the limits on annual contributions to an education IRA from \n$500 to $2,000 per year, and allows accounts to be used for K-12 \nexpenses. The bill allows parents or grandparents to make the \ncontribution in after-tax money each year.\n  The Accounts would grow with interest, and withdrawals for \neducational expenses would be tax-free. A+ accounts, as under current \nlaw, are targeted to middle income taxpayers. Eligibility phases out \nbeginning at $95,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. \nUnder these terms almost all New Mexicans would be eligible to set up \none of these accounts.\n  The bill allows parents to purchase contracts that lock-in tomorrow's \ntuition costs at today's prices. This bill would make these savings \ncompletely tax-free.\n  Families purchasing plans would pay no federal income tax on interest \nbuild-up. Under current law, state-run programs allowed tax-deferred \nsavings for college. However, savings in such plans, when withdrawn, \nare taxable as income to the student. This provision would benefit one \nmillion students.\n  Twenty-one states have created tuition plans. New Mexico has not yet \nimplemented one but it does have a proposal under consideration. If the \nstate finalizes it pre-paid tuition plan future students would be able \nto benefit. Pre-paid tuition plans are a great way to secure the \nfuture.\n  The bill extends through 2002, the exclusion for employers who pay \nfor their employees' tuition and expands the program to cover graduate \nstudents beginning in 1998. The exclusion allows employers to pay up to \n$5,250 per year for educational expenses to benefit employees without \nrequiring the employees to declare that benefit as income and pay \nfederal income tax on the benefit. One million workers including \n250,000 graduate students, would benefit from tax-free employer-\nprovided education assistance provision.\n  The bill also creates a new category of exempt facility bonds for \nprivately-owned and publicly operated elementary and secondary school \nconstruction high growth areas. The bill makes $3 billion in school \nconstruction bonds over five years. This is enough to build 500 \nelementary schools.\n  I hope the Senate will complete its work quickly on this bill and \nthat the President will sign it.\n  Mr. President, this education bill is a revolutionary education bill. \nWhen you look at it on its four corners as it has finally passed the \nSenate, it is not nibbling around the edges. It is asking we make some \nfundamentally different decisions about the Federal involvement in \npublic education.\n  I am not sure everybody understands that the Federal Government's \ninvolvement is about 7 percent. So when we talk about our U.S. \nGovernment having an impact on education for kindergarten through 12, \nabout 7 percent of the money spent in the public schools across this \nland comes from the Federal Government. That means 93 percent comes \nfrom the States, municipalities, counties, boroughs and the like.\n  From what I can tell, the Federal Government has been doing too much \ndictating for 7 percent of the resources that they give to the States, \ntoo much of a heavy hand trying to dictate outcomes with very little \nmoney. One of the worst examples of the Federal Government's \ninvolvement is when we decided we should help the disabled young people \nget into the mainstream of our public schools, a wonderful idea. Then \nwe said we will pay 40 percent if you pay 60 percent. To this day, to \nthis night as we stand here on the floor, the Federal Government has \npaid 9 percent, yet we impose regulations. The latest ones on the IDEA \nbill that implements our desire to help public education mainstream and \neducate disabled young people, this 9 percent has for many schools \ndictated such onerous mandates that some today are willing to violate \nthe law in order to get before a judge to show that some of what we are \ndoing is so arbitrary that it is not even common sense.\n  Now, frankly, the revolution is twofold, as I see it. One, we are \ngoing to take a third of our public education money and say to our \nStates: You have three options. You can take this one-third of our \nfunding, a number of programs, and leave it just like it is. You can \nstay with these categorical programs where we put up a tiny bit of \nmoney. We have bureaucracy and regulations coming out of everybody's \nears as we try to impact on education with a little sliver of money, \nwith a marvelous purpose and goal attached to it. So, one, you can take \nit and keep it that way. The other is, you can say: State of New \nMexico, State of Alabama, you send that money right to your school \ndistricts to be allocated to them proportionately and let them decide \nhow to use the money in the best interests of their problems. Third is \nfor the State to say: We will administer the money to the school \ndistricts and let them spend it the way we dictate. In all events, it \nis a marvelous research project. There is no downside for our kids.\n  What we are doing is not working. So for those who stand up and worry \nabout\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nthis new change, what is working today? Things are getting worse. We \njust had a TIMMS report that looked at our math and science kids, and \nit said the following, plain and simple: Up to the 5th grade, we are \ndoing great. From 5th to 12th, we go right off the log, like the \nTitanic, into the ocean.\n  We are at the bottom of the heap by the time the 12th grade arrives \nin the United States of America, the highest technology and science \ncountry in the world. We are sitting around worrying about one-third of \nthe programs that we have been dumping on our school systems with \nhighfalutin goals, and we are saying to the school systems that you can \ndecide where to put that money. The other two-thirds we will leave the \nold way.\n  Now, that is a revolution worth putting right before the public and \nseeing what happens. The other one is a little bit of a movement in the \ndirection of merit pay and expanded teacher education. Both of them are \nrevolutionary ideas and neither of them will harm anyone--in \nparticular, the young people of our country. The chances are they will \nhelp our young people.\n  I know the President is going to veto this bill, but I am as positive \nas anything that the change in public education from the U.S. \nGovernment will start with this bill. This bill is going to start a \nchange that is going to be borderline revolutionary. We are either \ngoing to do more and accomplish more, or essentially we are going to \nfind out why not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican approach these days often \nseems to be ``one ideology fits all.'' They want to privatize \neverything. They want to privatize Social Security, they want to \nprivatize Medicare, and now they want to privatize education, and that \nwould be their biggest mistake of all.\n  People ask why this bill is so important and why this debate has been \nso hard-fought. The answer is clear. This is not just another ordinary \nbill, or ordinary day, or ordinary vote in the life of the Senate. The \nRepublican Party is making a massive mistake, a mistake of truly \nhistoric dimensions, if they turn their backs on public schools, if \nthat is the clear signal they are sending the country by pushing this \nmisguided bill, because its fundamental purpose is to aid private \nschools, not help public schools. We all know that public schools have \nproblems, but our goal should be to fix those problems, not ignore them \nor make them worse.\n  Over the past few days, the Senate has had the opportunity to correct \nthe defects in this bill and direct scarce resources to the public \nschools that have the greatest need. But at every turn Republicans have \nchosen to make this bad bill even worse. The bill uses tax breaks to \nsubsidize parents who send their children to private schools, and it is \na serious mistake. It diverts scarce resources away from public schools \nthat have the greatest need. It undermines the important Federal role \nin education, and it bans voluntary national tests. It does nothing to \nimprove public schools. It does nothing to address the serious need of \npublic schools to build new facilities and to repair crumbling existing \nfacilities. It does nothing to reduce class sizes in schools. It does \nnothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms across the \nNation that will be needed. It does nothing to provide after-school \nactivities to keep kids off the streets, away from drugs, and out of \ntrouble. It does nothing to help children reach high academic \nstandards. It does nothing to improve the quality of education for \nchildren in public schools.\n\n  On issue after issue, the Republican bill undermines Federal support \nfor education, and that is irresponsible. We know what it takes to \nachieve genuine education reform. The place to start is by resoundingly \nrejecting this defective bill that destroys the national commitment to \nimproving education for all students.\n  The challenge is clear: We must do all we can to improve teaching and \nlearning for all students across the Nation. We must continue to \nsupport efforts to raise academic standards. We must test students \nearly so we know where they need help in time to make that help \neffective. We need better training for current and new teachers so that \nthey are well-prepared to teach to high standards. We must reduce class \nsize to help students obtain the individual attention they need. We \nneed after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available \nto students. We need greater resources to modernize and expand school \nfacilities to meet the urgent need of schools for modern technology and \nup-to-date classrooms.\n  We cannot stand by and enact a regressive bill to help private \nschools at the expense of public schools. It is clear that our \nRepublican friends are no friends of public schools. This Republican \nanti-education tax bill is wrong for education, it is wrong for \nAmerica, and it is wrong for the Nation's future.\n  Public education is one of the all-time great achievements of our \ncountry. Education is the key that unlocks the golden door of \nopportunity. Great leaders of a century and more ago understood that. \nThey understood what may be the greatest experiment of all in American \ndemocracy. They insisted on free public education for all, and in doing \nso they laid the solid foundation that made this country the most \npowerful and most successful nation on earth in this century. None of \nus--no Republican, no Democrat--should retreat from that basic bedrock \nprinciple. Yet, this unacceptable bill does that. It hangs a sign for \nall to see on the front door of every public school in America: Abandon \nhope, all ye who enter here. Get out while you can, public schools have \nfailed. Find a private school that will take you in and we will \nsubsidize the cost.\n  I categorically reject that view. Public schools have not failed. \nPublic schools are still the backbone of American education, and they \nalways will be. Let's solve their problems, not abandon them. Let's \ndefeat this bill and make a fresh start to do all we can to help our \npublic schools.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would the Chair inform us as to the current status \nregarding time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats control 41\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nthere are 8 minutes 49 seconds left for the Republicans. I heard some \ndiscussion earlier about yielding that back.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I am the last \nspeaker on our side, and then we have one speaker left on the \nRepublican side. It is with that understanding that I will yield such \ntime now as I may consume.\n  First of all, let me begin by commending the distinguished senior \nSenator from Massachusetts for his eloquence again just now and for his \nremarkable leadership on this debate for the last several days. He has \nbeen our quarterback, and he has been a real inspiration to many of us. \nI thank him, and I thank all of our colleagues who have done so much to \ncontribute to this debate, who have done so in a civil way, who have \ndone so in an enlightened way, who have done so with every good \nintention about raising the level of debate and talking about these \ncritical issues, recognizing the significant difference of opinion that \nexists between our parties on this important matter of national \nconcern.\n  This debate started out as really a difference of opinion on how we \ncommit about $1.6 billion in resources to education. I have noted in \nthe past that I have great admiration for the Senator from Georgia and \nhis interest in pursuing ways in which to improve to education. I \ndiffer with him strongly on this particular issue. We have noted on \nmany occasions as we have made reference to his approach that the \noriginal design of this legislation did little to address the real \nproblems we have in education. We have argued on this floor on many \noccasions whether, with $1.6 billion, we should give tax relief largely \nto those in the most successful quintile of our economic strata. I am \ntold about $37 in tax benefits would go to the top 20 percent of income \nearners in our country.\n  The question is, is that the best way for our Federal Government to \ncommit\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nthese hard-earned tax dollars? Should we provide that kind of tax \nrelief, as laudable as the intentions might be and as a different an \napproach as it might be? Certainly we want to encourage saving. \nCertainly we want to find ways to reduce the overall cost to all \nAmerican families of education. The question is, is this the right way? \nIs this the best way?\n  There are those who have argued that if you do not favor the status \nquo, that this is the approach we ought to be subscribing to. Mr. \nPresident, I have to say, probably of all the things that have been \nsaid on the Senate floor with regard to this issue and this debate, \nthis is the one which perhaps I feel most vehement opposition to.\n  I am an ardent opponent of the status quo in many respects. I oppose \nsimply accepting our current situation as fact. We know that there are \nthings we can do, that we must do. In an information age, we cannot be \ncontent to simply sit back and say, yes, this is the best we can do. We \ncan't be content when we are not number one when it comes to math and \nscience. We can't be content when we know that there are people who are \nnot getting a good education because we have not made the right \ncommitments.\n  I defy anyone to challenge those of us who believe there is a better \nway than the underlying bill that somehow we are defending the status \nquo, because that could not be further from the truth. As evidence of \nthat, I guess I would suggest, No. 1, that you look at the array of \namendments that we have offered that would have changed the status quo, \nbeginning with, first and foremost, the single most consequential \nreduction in property tax that we have considered on the Senate floor, \nat least in my lifetime. As much as $10 billion in potential property \ntax relief could have been part of this legislation. In my state of \nSouth Dakota, we could have reduced property taxes by as much as $25 \nmillion. If we had passed the Moseley-Braun amendment, we could have \nrelieved the burden on state and local taxes, including property taxes, \nby $10 billion. We didn't have the votes. The majority voted against \nreducing property taxes by $10 billion. I want to change the status \nquo. That would have done it. That would have done it, in addition to \nrecognizing the fact that three out of four school districts in this \ncountry have at least one school that is in dire need of repair.\n  I spoke to people in a school district not long ago who shared with \nme the fact that, when the winds in South Dakota exceed 40 miles an \nhour, the school has to be evacuated. When the winds in South Dakota \nexceed 40 miles an hour, they have to go home. We had a chimney that \nfell through the third floor of one of our schools in Hartford, SD. I \ncould go on and on.\n  The fact is, we have an incredible problem with regard to \ninfrastructure. While we legitimately commit, as we must, to highways, \nto bridges, to airports, and to the array of infrastructure challenges \nwe have--and I am a strong supporter of the effort to do that--we ought \nto be committing to infrastructure for the most important part of our \npopulation, our children. You want to change the status quo? We should \nhave voted to support the Moseley-Braun amendment. You want to support \nchange in the status quo? We should have supported the after-\nschool program supported and offered by the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. You want to change the status quo? We should have \nrecognized that we have to go out and find over 100,000 new teachers in \nthe next 3 years. That is real change in the status quo.\n\n  Now our Republican colleagues have come back with proposals of their \nown to change the status quo. As the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nhas just acknowledged, the real question now is, do we privatize public \neducation? Because that is exactly what we will do if this bill passes \nand is signed into law. We would privatize public education.\n  So while we started out with a bill that promised to do very little, \nwe have ended up with one that would do real damage. We've gone from \ndoing almost nothing for public education to doing serious damage to \nthe fundamental appreciation of the importance in democracy of \neducation as we have known it for 200 years. We do damage. If this \nlegislation was ever signed into law, we would do serious damage, \nbecause we would abolish the promise of universal education for the \npeople of the United States as we have known it. This promise has been \nlargely responsible for the democracy that we have enjoyed with all of \nits richness. We would abolish all remedial education for disadvantaged \nchildren. We would abolish safe and drug-free schools. We would abolish \nthe opportunities for schools to come to the people of the United \nStates asking for assistance to acquire new technology in their \nclassroom. We would abolish Goals 2000, which would set some goals for \nthe whole country to achieve as we recognize the importance of the \ninformation age. We would abolish teacher training in math and science. \nWe would abolish magnet schools. We would abolish school-to-work. We \nwould abolish the ability to use voluntary national achievement tests \nin order to empower parents to find out just how their students are \ndoing. The abolition of all of those tools and more are incorporated in \nwhat we are about to pass tonight.\n  Mr. President, this is a lost opportunity. Yes. But far more than \nthat, during the debate on this bill, we have gone from doing little to \ndoing damage--damage to our public educational system, damage to the \nopportunities that children all over this country ought to have when \nthey walk into a classroom. We would abolish the national role in \npublic education.\n  So the question tonight that we must ask ourselves is, do we support \nthe continued role of public education, recognizing, as we do, the need \nto move beyond the status quo and fundamentally and radically find ways \nin which to improve upon the tradition of public education in this \ncountry? Do we do that? Or do we privatize education? Do we privatize \nit and take away whatever role the people of the United States have \nwhen we consider our educational challenges in the years ahead? That is \nthe question.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote a resounding no on final passage of \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I'm pleased that we are moving toward \npassage of this significant bill. The importance of giving American \nfamilies the resources and means they need to educate their children \nmust be above politics.\n  Before I get into the specific benefits of the bill, let me remind my \ncolleagues that with the exception of several school construction bond \nprovisions--which were newly added this year--all of the concepts in \nthis bill should be very familiar.\n  Mr. President, these concepts should be familiar because we have \nalready endorsed them. The base provisions in the bill--which include \nthe increase in the maximum allowable contribution to an education IRA, \nthe use of the IRA for elementary and secondary school expenses for \npublic and private schools, the tax-free treatment of state sponsored \nprepaid tuition plans, and the extension of tax-free treatment for \nemployer provided educational assistance--all received bipartisan \nsupport from the Senate as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the \nbill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the \nAdministration, these particular elements failed to be included in the \nfinal version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Today we will show our commitment to these provisions--and to enact \nwhat this body has already determined makes good sense for American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this tax bill is not \ndesigned to answer all of the education-related issues that face this \ncountry. Those issues are too varied and complicated to be addressed by \nthe federal government. They need to be solved at the state and local \nlevel--by schools, teachers, and parents working together.\n  Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts \nthat have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to improve \nthe tax code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help \nAmerican families help their children. These are much needed tools.\n  Over the past 15 years, tuition at a four year college has increased \nby 234%. The average student loan has increased by 367%. In contrast \nmedian household income rose only 82% during\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nthis period and the consumer price index rose only 74%.\n  Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet \nthe costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. The \nSenate recognized the importance of these provisions less than one year \nago, voting in favor of them. I hope that my colleagues continue to \nrecognize just how important they remain. The American people are \ncounting on us.\n  The various provisions of this bill are important measures that will \naid our students and parents.\n  The first major change in this bill increases the maximum education \nIRA contribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two \nlevels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it \nis essential that we provide American families with the resources to \nmeet those costs.\n  I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits \nof the American people, and there are few things more important than \nthe education of their children. Not only will saving in this way \nincrease our investment capital, it will increase American's education \ncapital as well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is \nshort-sighted.\n  By using the tax code to encourage individual responsibility for \npaying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the \neducation IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to \nsave for their children's education.\n  Mr. President, the next major change that this bill makes to \neducation IRAs is that it allows withdrawals for education expenses for \nelementary and secondary schools and for both private and public \nschools.\n  As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a \nparent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about \nhis or her child's education--to decide basic questions such as how the \nchild should be educated and where the child should attend school.\n  This bill recognizes that just like for secondary schools, we should \nnot establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary \nschools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the \ntaxpayer who funds the education IRA--that it is the parent who puts \nhis or her hard-earned money into the education IRA.\n  Mr. President, it seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the \nparent should be able to choose how to spend that money.\n  Mr. President, another provision in this bill makes state-sponsored \nprepaid tuition plans tax-free, not simply tax-deferred. This is a \nsignificant distinction, because it allows students to withdraw the \nsavings that accumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts without \npaying any tax at all. It means that parents have the incentive to put \nmoney away today and their children have the full benefit of that \nmoney, without any tax, tomorrow.\n  As I have already mentioned, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition \nplans in effect, and the other six are in the process of implementing \nsuch plans This means that every member of the Senate has parents and \nstudents back home who either benefit from this plan right now, or will \nbenefit from this plan soon.\n  Mr. President, the Coverdell bill also extends tax-free treatment of \nemployer provided educational assistance for graduates and \nundergraduates through the year 2002.\n  This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for \nworking students. Over one million workers across America receive tax-\nfree employer provided education. This allows them to stay on the \ncutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them, individually, \nbut their employers and the economy as a whole. With the constant \ninnovations and advancing technology of our society, it is vitally \nimportant that we continue this program.\n  The various provisions that I have just described are all ones that \nmembers of this body approved last year. They made sense then. They \ncertainly continue to make sense today.\n  Mr. President, the Coverdell bill does even more than address the \ncosts of attending school. In response to concerns from Members on both \nsides of the aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to \nprovide targeted relief in the area of school construction.\n  The first provision is directed at high growth school districts. It \nexpands the tax-exempt bond rules for public/private partnerships set \nup for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school \nfacilities in these districts. In general, it allows states to issue \ntax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per state resident. Each state would be \nguaranteed a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of these tax-\nexempt bonds. In total, up to $600 million per year in new tax exempt \nbonds would be issued for these innovative school construction \nprojects.\n  This provision is important because it retains state and local \nflexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it \ndoes not force the federal government to micro-manage school \nconstruction.\n  Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That \nprovision is designed to simplify the issuance of bonds for school \nconstruction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on \ninvestments unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated \nto the Federal government. However, there is an exception--generally \nreferred to as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to \nissue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage \nrebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for \ngovernments that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds \nduring the year.\n  The provision in the Coverdell bill increases the small issuer \nexception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the \nbonds are issued to finance public schools.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Coverdell bill contains numerous \nimportant provisions for the American family. As I have said already, \nmany of these measures are ones that the Senate passed last year.\n  Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line dealing with \nthe costs of a quality education, must have been disappointed last year \nwhen we failed to give them all the tools that they needed. American \nfamilies understand the need for these measures. They have now been \nwaiting for a year. I am pleased today that we will, once again, \naddress the needs of American families and students. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Coverdell bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who made so many eloquent statements on behalf of the \nunderlying bill. As is obvious, this has not been easy for them. They \nhave been at odds with their Members in the caucus. We all understand \nthat takes considerable courage. The Senator from Delaware, who \nexplained the dilemma that he faced--and that I accept, but I \nappreciate his comity and the efforts to work through this long journey \nvery much, even though he cannot vote with us at this point.\n  To my adversary, the other manager, it has been a very civil debate. \nWe even ended up in agreement on the reading excellence amendment. I \nappreciate the comments that came.\n  I would particularly like to associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, a very moving statement. It \nreminded me of my father. That is another relationship. He began his \ncareer as a coal truck driver in the Midwest. But when the Senator from \nWest Virginia described the schoolroom in which that excellent mind of \nhis was educated, I wish everyone could have heard it. While we all \nwant excellent facilities, it isn't necessarily the key component in \neducation. His came from a two-room building with two buckets of \nwater. My dad's was one room. It likewise had no heat nor facilities. \nBut that is for another day. I would admonish everybody to read the \nspeech, though.\n\n  Mr. President, the underlying bill is focused on children. In all \nthese debates, sometimes it is buildings, it is tax policy, but at the \nend of the day what we are talking about is the desire of all of us to \nhave the youth of our country be given a chance to fully participate in \nthe greatest democracy in the history of the world.\n  At one point in the debate I indicated that an uneducated mind is not \ncapable\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nof enjoying the full benefits of American citizenship and an uneducated \npeople cannot and will not remain free. A core stanchion of American \nliberty envisions a citizen who can think well and participate. When we \ndeny them those opportunities, as the Senator from West Virginia \nindicated we have been doing in growing numbers, we are condemning \nthese people to something less than full American citizenship. The \nfirst thing they are denied is economic liberty. And when they are \ndenied economic liberty, which is the second stanchion of American \nfreedom, they are pushed to the periphery of society and before long \nthey are pushed into those components of society that are a risk to the \nsafety of persons and property, another component of American liberty.\n  So at the center of maintaining our democracy is the duty for each \ngeneration to make sure that all of its youth are capable of \nparticipating in American citizenship.\n  It has been alleged that public education is being abandoned here. I \nwould like to point out that of the economic underpinnings of this \nbill, over 90 percent of it supports public education, whether it is \nschool construction, whether it is assistance through an education \nsavings account to come to students that attend public schools, whether \nit is support of all of our public institutions in State prepaid \ntuition policy, whether it is aiding employers in continuing education \nfor their employees. A very small component, albeit a meaningful \ncomponent, of the funding of this bill deals with helping families \nwhose children are in private schools. But it is simply wrong to \ncharacterize this as abandoning public education. Far from it. It is \none of the most significant new energies behind public education we \nhave seen in a long time here.\n  Just to reiterate--we talked about these children--there are about 53 \nmillion children in our elementary and secondary schools. The Joint Tax \nCommittee has repeatedly said that 14 million American families will be \nbeneficiaries of the savings account. That means nearly half of the \nentire population in elementary and secondary schools will receive some \nbenefit. We also know that because of the work to help prepaid State \ntuition, a million university students will be helped. And we know \n250,000 graduate students will benefit from these programs that we are \ntalking about here today, that 1 million American employees will \nbenefit from helping employers assist them in continuing education, and \nthat at least 500 new schools in high-population areas and rural areas \nwill be helped here.\n  This is a very large piece of legislation affecting literally \nmillions of Americans across the country on the basic belief that an \neducated mind is an absolute essential requirement for full citizenship \nin this American democracy.\n  Mr. President, I know we have had our differences. I think this is \nthe beginning of a long debate. It could be upwards to a decade. I am \npleased that the minority leader has agreed that the status quo is \nunacceptable. If we have at least achieved that, it has been a major \nbreakthrough.\n  In closing, I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nfor an incredible amount of patience. The hour is near.\n  On behalf of the leader, for the information of all Senators, these \nnext two votes will be the last votes of the evening. The Senate will \nconvene tomorrow at 10 a.m. and debate the State Department \nreorganization conference report under the parameters of the consent \nagreement of March 31. However, no votes will occur during Friday's \nsession of the Senate.\n  On Monday, the Senate will debate the NATO treaty beginning at 12 \nnoon. It is the leader's hope that we will have vigorous debate and, \nhopefully, even have a few amendments offered on Monday.\n  I announce to my colleagues that the next vote will occur at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, April 27.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage of the \neducation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is a holy day, Yom Hashoah. It is a \nday set aside every year to remember the victims of the Holocaust.\n  I had the privilege of starting this Yom Hashoah morning with an \nextraordinary group of people, the Founders of the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial Museum. Founders are men and women from across America who \nhave given at least $1 million to the Holocaust Museum.\n  This week, as we mark the fifth anniversary of the opening of the \nmuseum, it seems an especially appropriate time to recognize the \nincredible gift the Founders, and all the museum's supporters, have \ngiven our nation.\n  We are indebted to them all--particularly to Miles Lerman, chairman \nof the museum council, and Ruth Mandel, the council's vice chair, and \nto my dear friend Abe Pollin, the chairman of this year's Founders \nReunion.\n  One of the sages of the Torah told us more than 200 years ago that \nGod could have created plants that would grow loaves of bread. Instead, \nhe created wheat for us to grow and mill and transform into bread. Why? \nBecause He wanted us to be able to take part in the miracle of \ncreation.\n  That is what the Holocaust Museum Founders have done. They used stone \nand steel and sacred artifacts, rather than wheat. But they have \nunquestionably experienced the miracle of creation.\n  Simon Dubrow, the great Jewish historian, was one of the 6 million \nJews murdered in the Holocaust. He was killed in the Latvian ghetto of \nRiga by a Gestapo officer who had once been his student. His dying \nwords were ``Schreibt und farschreibt.'' ``Write and record.'' He \nbelieved to the end that truth and memory ultimately would triumph over \nthe evil of the Holocaust.\n  Through the leadership and generosity of the Holocaust Museum \nFounders, his prediction has come true. Many in Congress remain in awe \nof the fact that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has raised $320 \nmillion since its inception. That's a part of the museum's story that \nisn't fully known or appreciated.\n  The Holocaust Museum has not only demonstrated that public/private \npartnerships can work--it has set the standard for such partnerships. \nMuch has changed since that bitter cold, rainy day 5 years ago when the \nHolocaust Museum was dedicated.\n  Before the museum opened, I understand that the most optimistic \nestimates were that 700,000 people a year would walk through its doors. \nThat first year, and every year since, I am now told, 2 million \nvisitors have come to the museum--5,000 people every day. Before the \nmuseum opened, I well remember that there were some who questioned \nwhether it should be built on the National Mall, since the Holocaust \ndid not take place in our country.\n  Today, the Holocaust Memorial Museum is a fundamental part of this \ncity. Not only does it belong on the Mall, but it gives a deeper \nmeaning to the other great memorials there. Ask anyone who has been \nthrough the museum and they will tell you. The Washington Monument and \nthe Lincoln Memorial have never looked so beautiful--and freedom and \ndemocracy have never seemed as precious--as they do when you emerge \nfrom the darkness of that extraordinary building.\n  Elie Weisel has said, ``Survivors are understood by survivors only. \nThey speak in code. All outsiders could do was come close to the \ngates.'' That is what the Holocaust Memorial Museum allows us to do: to \ncome close to the gates; to see; to grieve; and, finally, to learn, so \nthat we can pass the knowledge on from, generation to generation, about \nwhat can happen when intolerance and hatred are allowed to spread \nunchecked.\n  Elie Weisel is right. We cannot walk on the shoes of the victims, or \nthe survivors. But we can see their shoes--that heartbreaking room full \nof dress shoes and work boots and baby shoes. And it is one of the many \nparadoxes of the museum, that in looking at something as simple as \nthose shoes, we can begin to feel the profound tragedy of that terrible \ntime.\n  Anyone who has been there knows, the Holocaust Museum is not an easy \nplace to visit. The images in it are not images of beauty, but of \nincomprehensible evil. People always spend longer in the museum than \nthey expect. And they leave shattered. But they also leave changed. It \nis one of the few museums in the world that has the capacity to change \npeople fundamentally.\n  It teaches many lessons. One of the most profound lessons is about \nthe horrors that can be unleashed when we deny the basic humanity of \neven one person. Another is what can happen to democracy when we are \nnot vigilant in its protection.\n  The museum also teaches us about the necessity of leadership \ndedicated to preventing intolerance, hatred and oppression. For members \nof Congress, that is an especially important lesson. And the presence \nof the museum on the mall is a constant reminder of it.\n  Perhaps the most dramatic example of its influence on Congress was 2 \nyears\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nago, when we debated how the United States should respond to the \nhorrors in Bosnia. There were times during that debate when it was as \nif the victims of the Holocaust were looking down from the Senate \ngalleries, reminding us of the moral imperative: Never again. I doubt \nwe would have felt their presence so strongly, had it not been for the \nmuseum.\n  But evil is not always as obvious as it was in Bosnia, or Rwanda, or \nPol Pot's Cambodia. The Holocaust Museum reminds us that the early \nwarning signs are more subtle--and, often, closer to home. That lesson \nis particularly important for people who are entrusted to write the \nlaws that guide this great nation.\n  When you walk down that first long, dark corridor, and see the step-\nby-step dismantling of German democracy, you understand in a deeper way \nwhy we must never again allow books to be burned, or laws to be written \nthat permit discrimination and expropriation.\n  The last time I visited the museum I stopped on the way out to read \nwhat people had written in the ``comments'' book. None of the comments \nwas very long. The museum has a way of leaving many people without \nwords for a while.\n  Among the short messages, there were two that especially stood out. \nBoth were written in what appeared to be the handwriting of teenage \ngirls. One said, ``The museum taught me the meaning of democracy.'' The \nother said simply, ``I will remember this for the rest of my life.'' \nWhat an extraordinary gift the Founders have given those young women, \nand everyone else who has visited these first 5 years!\n  I understand the museum is now taking advantage of the Internet and \nother new technologies so that people in my home state of South Dakota, \nand all over the world, can ``visit,'' even if they can't come to \nWashington. I've been told the website gets 100,000 hits a day! That's \nmost impressive.\n  By reaching out in this way, the museum is not only fulfilling our \nmoral responsibility to ``write and record'' the story of the Holocaust \nand its victims. It is also creating a stronger America. And, in the \nprocess, it is redefining what museums, and public-private partnerships \ncan be, and what they can accomplish.\n  The poem that is written on the wall behind the shoes declares, ``We \nare the shoes. We are the last witnesses.'' In the 5 years since the \nmuseum opened, 10 million new witnesses have been created--one for \nevery person who perished in the Holocaust. Five years from now, there \nwill be 10 million more. And, like the young woman who signed the book, \neach of them will be remembered for the rest of their lives.\n  The Founders, and all the supporters of the Holocaust Museum, have \nindeed taken part in the creation of something very, very rare. Today, \non this holy day of Yom Hashoah, as we remember the victims of the \nHolocaust, the Congress and the people of the United States thank them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3529-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMY RESERVE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for the past week, the United States \nArmy Reserve has had a number of events to help celebrate the 90th \nanniversary of their founding. Appropriately, the United States Senate, \nled by Senator Helms who was joined by 28 of our colleagues, passed a \nresolution last night commending the Army Reserve and its citizen-\nsoldiers on an impressive heritage and on the invaluable contributions \nthey have made to keeping the United States free and safe.\n  As a former Army Reservist, I was naturally interested in reading \nthis resolution and I am certain you can imagine my surprise when I \ndiscovered that it was also a tribute to me and the service I rendered \nthe United States as a Soldier. I was, and am, humbled and flattered by \nthis very touching gesture, you have touched the heart of this old \n``trooper'', and I thank each of you for your kind act.\n  I join each of you in commending all those who have served in the \nArmy Reserve throughout its 90-year history, particularly those men and \nwomen who serve today. In this era of skrinking force structure and \ndefense budgets, we will increasingly rely on our reserve forces to \nmeet the security and foreign policy goals of the United States. We \nshould be grateful that there is no shortage of patriotic Americans \nwilling to endure the hardships and demands of reserve service, we are \nall better off their efforts. I am certain that I speak for the entire \nBody when I say that we appreciate and value the work and contributions \nof the Soldiers of the Army Reserve and stand ready to assist them \nhowever we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3530-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3530-S3531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF FORMER SENATOR TERRY SANFORD\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, as it has for the past three \ndays, the South mourns the passing of one of its greatest leaders. \nTerry Sanford, former Governor of and United States Senator from North \nCarolina, passed away on Saturday, April 18, 1998.\n  From 1961 to 1965, Governor Sanford forged a remarkable record as one \nof America's most progressive governors. His great passions were \neducation, civil rights, and social justice. Perhaps his bravest act as \nGovernor, and the one that posed the greatest political risk, was to \nencourage the people of North Carolina to accept the winds of change \nthat swept the South during the 1960s.\n  In a 1963 speech, for example, he implored the people of North \nCarolina to end job discrimination against blacks and announced the \ncreation of a biracial panel, the North Carolina Good Neighbor Council, \nto work toward that end. He also appointed many black North Carolinians \nto important positions in his administration and publicly supported \nschool integration.\n  The other hallmark of Governor Sanford's administration was his \ncommitment to education. He pushed state lawmakers to provide more \nmoney to schools and laid the foundation that has helped make the North \nCarolina higher education system one of the best in the world. As a \ntrue intellectual and lover of the humanities, Terry Sanford understood \nthe importance of ideas for their own sake. But he also was a practical \nman, and he realized that a well-educated populace is crucial to \nattracting new corporations and creating good jobs. Thanks to his \nvision, North Carolina now is home to one of the best-educated \npopulations in the nation, and it is a leader in creating high-paying, \nhigh-tech jobs.\n  From 1969 to 1985, Senator Sanford was President of Duke University. \nHe was one of that institution's most vigorous and successful \npresidents, inspiring loyalty and love among faculty and students and \nhelping the University increase its endowment and improve its \nresources. As President of Duke, Terry Sanford did great things for not \njust the students, but all the people of North Carolina. Under his \nhand, Duke joined North Carolina State and the University of North \nCarolina as part of the vaunted Research Triangle, which has generated \nhigh-tech jobs for North Carolina and helped the state secure a \nreputation as one of the best locations in the country for companies \nand their workers. President Sanford dedicated himself completely to \nDuke; he was driven to serve the school by the same passion for \neducation and material and intellectual progress which had guided his \ngovernorship.\n  Discontent with the direction in which our nation was headed and the \nseemingly intractable problems that had beset the political process \ndrove Senator Sanford to offer himself for the Democratic nomination \nfor President in 1972 and 1976. Although both his candidacies were \nunsuccessful, Terry ran with conviction and courage. Above all, he ran \nto oppose those who offered no alternative to confusion other than \ndarkness, who would have replaced idealism with cynicism, and who \npracticed the politics of division rather than unity.\n  Terry Sanford achieved national office in 1986, when the people of \nNorth Carolina elected him to the United States Senate. During his \nterm, Senator Sanford was one of the ablest and most conscientious \nlegislators this body has ever seen. He maintained his well-deserved \nreputation for decency, integrity, and intelligence; continued to show \ngreat interest in education and social policies; and never flagged in \nhis commitment to the public good.\n  After being narrowly defeated for reelection in 1992, Senator Sanford \nreturned to Duke University, where he taught courses on public policy \nand government. As an outstanding educator, he continued to enrich his \nstudents' lives and devote himself to the dissemination of knowledge.\n  Mr. President, Terry Sanford's death is a loss for North Carolina, \nthis nation, and this Senate. He embodied the\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nbest of public service and education. His tremendous accomplishments \nwere recognized and appreciated for over 30 years by the people of \nNorth Carolina. Increasingly, they have been recognized throughout the \nnation as well. In 1981, for example, a Harvard University study named \nTerry Sanford one of the ten best governors in the nation in this \ncentury. This was high praise, but Terry surely deserved it.\n  With his passing, our nation has lost one of its most tireless public \nservants. We in the Senate have lost a cherished colleague and loyal \nfriend. Fortunately for us all, Terry Sanford's legacy will live on in \nthe educational institutions of North Carolina to which he gave so much \nand in the example he set for those of us who aspire to public service.\n  Mr. President, of everything that has been said and written about our \ndear friend Terry Sanford, no one has said it better than Governor Jim \nHunt of North Carolina, in the eulogy he delivered at Senator Sanford's \nfuneral. At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nGovernor Hunt's eulogy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Eulogy by Gov. Jim Hunt at the Memorial Services for Terry Sanford, \n                             April 22, 1998\n\n       In the words of a great Methodist hymn: ``Oh, for a \n     thousand tongues to sing our Great Redeemer's praise.''\n       Indeed, our thousand tongues are here today to praise our \n     Redeemer and one of His most magnificent gifts to the people \n     of our state and our nation.\n       I know that I speak for many of you when I say very simply: \n     Terry Sanford was my hero.\n       I'm sure that Terry Sanford has already has his orientation \n     with the Lord. And it is not a one way conversation. And I \n     suspect that by now he has almost certainly given the Lord a \n     few good ideas for improving Heaven.\n       At a time when we struggle about whether government should \n     act, let us remember the words of an uncommon man who could \n     think great thoughts and make them a reality. In one of his \n     books, Terry wrote:\n       ``Indeed, if government is not for the express purpose of \n     lifting the level of civilization by broadening the \n     opportunities in life for its people, what is its purpose?''\n       And he added:\n       ``Government is not something passive, not our kind of \n     government. It has built into it the spirit of outreach, the \n     concern for every individual. Look at the verbs in the \n     Constitution's Preamble--establish, insure, provide, promote, \n     secure. All these connote action, and all suggest that we \n     must constantly be striving to improve the opportunities of \n     our people.''\n       And act he did. Strive to improve opportunities for our \n     people he did.\n       Imagine what North Carolina would be like if we had not had \n     Terry Sanford striving for us these many years.\n       Imagine what North Carolina would have been like in the \n     1960s if we had not had a Governor who believed in bringing \n     people of all races together. If we'd had a Governor like \n     other states' who appealed to the worst rather than the best \n     in us. Imagine no Terry Sanford.\n       Imagine what North Carolina would be like without the \n     Research Triangle Park. Imagine no Terry Sanford.\n       Imagine what North Carolina would be like without the \n     community college system or the School of the Arts. Imagine \n     no Terry Sanford.\n       Imagine what North Carolina would be like had he not set \n     national excellence as the goal for this great university--\n     and for that other one just up the road. Imagine no Terry \n     Sanford.\n       Imagine what North Carolina's schools would be like if a \n     great Governor hadn't had the courage to pass a tax for \n     school improvements--an act of courage that cost his own \n     political ambitions dearly. Imagine no Terry Sanford.\n       It is truly unimaginable. You cannot imagine North Carolina \n     without Terry Sanford.\n       Forty years ago, no one could have imagined what North \n     Carolina would become.\n       No one, that is, but Terry Sanford.\n       He once wrote:\n       ``The governor, by his very office, embodies his state. He \n     stands alone at his inauguration as the spokesman for all the \n     people. His presence at the peak of the system is unique, for \n     he must represent the slum and the suburb, his concerns must \n     span rural poverty and urban blight. The responsibility for \n     initiative in statewide programs falls upon the governor. He \n     must energize his administration, search out the experts, \n     formulate the programs, mobilize and support and carry new \n     ideas into action.''\n       Terry, you set the goals and our sights very high. So high \n     that we often wonder if we can meet your standard. But your \n     good works, your words and your spirit tell us every day, in \n     every way, that the goal can be ours. That the struggle is \n     worth it.\n       When we leave today, we will leave the body of our hero in \n     this chapel.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to congratulate the \nUnited States Army Reserve on its 90th anniversary and to recognize the \ncontributions of my good friend Strom Thurmond who served in the \nReserves for 36 years.\n  Many of you know Senator Thurmond's distinguished record in war and \nin peace and the contributions he has made to this institution. He, \nlike the thousands of soldiers in the Army Reserves today, is an \nexample of the best in America.\n  Some years ago, I was a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer in the \nUnited States Army Reserve. I served for thirteen years in one of our \n82 Alabama Reserve units and organizations, located in one of 19 cities \nand in 24 Reserve Centers spread across Alabama. Today, Alabama is home \nto approximately 7000 Army Reservists representing nearly 3\\1/2\\% of \nthe total Army Reserve Force. I am particularly proud of the fact that \nwe have the 81st Regional Support Command and the 87th Division \n(Exercise) headquartered in Birmingham, a unit which commands and \ncontrols soldiers in a number of surrounding southern states.\n  Like any major element of the Armed Forces, America's Army Reserve \nhas a great history. Let me share just a small portion of that history: \nCreated by statute on April 23, 1908, first of the Federal reserve \nforces created by Congress, a trained and ready force of citizen \nsoldiers bringing relevant skills into the military, an integral part \nof today's global power projection strategy, a force which deploy's \n20,000 reservists to 50 countries annually, a force which has mobilized \nand deployed 70% of the reserve forces to Bosnia for Operation Joint \nGuard, a force which contributed over 90,000 soldiers to Operation \nDesert Storm, one of which was my Chief of Staff, Armand DeKeyser, and \na force which is found in all 50 states, U.S. territories, in Europe \nand in the Pacific region.\n  Mr. President, we have much to be proud of in America tonight. We can \nadd to that list the United States Army Reserve whose birthday we \nquietly celebrate. Happy Birthday to the men and women of the Army \nReserves. Men and women who quietly man the ramparts of freedom. You \nare always there when America needs you. For this act of selfless \ndevotion, we as a nation ought to be truly grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3531-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR.

His selection as Fire Chief demonstrates the town's \nconfidence in Mr. Brunelle and their faith in his able service and \nleadership to the residents of the community.\n  Hyannis and Massachusetts are proud of Harold Brunelle's appointment \nas Fire Chief. I congratulate him on this distinction, and I look \nforward to working closely with him in the years ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the announcement of Chief Brunelle's \nselection by the Board of Commissioners of the Hyannis Fire District \nand an article from the Barnstable Register on Chief Brunelle's \nselection may be printed in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3532-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BONNIE SUE COOPER\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Representative Cooper accomplished \na great deal during her tenure as Chairwoman of ALEC. She succeeded in \nstrengthening ALEC's policy-making operations. She also heightened \nALEC's profile among both legislators and the private sector. ALEC \nthanked Representative Cooper for her hard work by choosing her as the \n1997 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Freedom Award. The gratitude \nbestowed on Representative Cooper for her excellent service and \ncommitment to principle is reflected in the award. Previous recipients \nof this prestigious award include former President Ronald Reagan.\n  While Representative Cooper's tenure as Chairwoman of ALEC has ended, \nher legacy to this important organization of State Legislators lives \non.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Children's \nMental Health Week which will be held the week of May 4-10. ``Putting \nOur Voices Together For Children'' is the theme of 1998's Children's \nMental Health Week. The Missouri Department of Mental Health and the \nMissouri Statewide Parent Advisory Network will serve as co-sponsors of \nthe week; these organizations were instrumental in the establishment of \nthe first ever Children's Mental Health Week in 1992.\n  Children throughout the United States have been diagnosed with \nemotional and behavioral disorders. And yet, some estimate that only \none third of the children are able to receive proper treatment and \ncare. The reason for Children's Mental Health Week is to provide our \ncommunities with additional information and understanding of these \ndisorders. The week serves to help spread valuable information that \nwill ultimately aid our children and our future.\n  During Children's Mental Health Week, green ribbons will be \ncirculated throughout cities to spread the message of support for our \nchildren. Numerous events will be hosted to honor Children's Mental \nHealth Week, as well as a two day conference for the spread of further \ninformation on children with mental health problems. The week will \nconclude with an awards ceremony to thank those who make a difference \nin working for children with emotional and behavioral disorders.\n  I would like to thank all the diligent workers who have dedicated \ntheir time and energy to help the children who suffer from mental \ndisorders. My best wishes of support and gratitude are extended to the \norganizers of Children's Mental Health Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3532-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3532-S3533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHANKING AILEEN ADAMS FOR HER SERVICE AS DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                  JUSTICE OFFICE FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year we have had to say farewell to \nAileen Adams as she leaves the post of Director of Department of \nJustice Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and returns to California. \nThree years ago, Aileen was appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate. During her time in Washington, I worked with Aileen and OVC \non a number of matters and came to know Aileen as a dedicated advocate \nfor crime victims. Her vision and dedication have been extraordinary. \nAileen will be sincerely missed, although her legacy will benefit \nvictims of crime for years to come.\n  Before coming to the Department of Justice, Aileen had served as the \nlegal counsel for the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica Hospital \nfor 10 years. In that position, Aileen demonstrated her leadership and \ninnovation with the creation of Stuart House, an interagency center for \nsexually-abused children.\n  As Director of OVC, Aileen focused on assisting local and state crime \nvictim programs around the country and improving crime victims services \nin the federal system. Aileen's leadership has helped over two million \ncrime victims across the country and around the globe. In just this \npast year, OVC has administered over $528 million and supported more \nthan 2,500 victim assistance programs.\n  Aileen's dedication has impacted rural areas such as Vermont. She has \nhelped sharpen the focus on rural crime and domestic violence and \nsupported a rural crime initiative which will study and enhance \nservices available to rural crime victims.\n  Among the victim assistance programs pioneered by Aileen was the \nestablishment of the National Victim Assistance Academy last year. This \nAcademy provides training on victims' rights and services and draws \nupon expertise of professionals ranging from law enforcement officers \nto rape crises counselors. Over 200 victim advocates and professionals \nhave graduated from the Academy and have taken their skills back to \ntheir communities, where they continue outreach work for the benefit of \nvictims.\n  Under her leadership, a group of international experts joined to \ndraft a manual to implement the United Nations Declaration of Basic \nPrinciples of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. Among \nother things, this manual is a step toward ensuring that crime victims \nare treated fairly and that they are assisted throughout the globe.\n  I had the opportunity to work with Aileen and the many dedicated \nmembers of her staff on a number of matters over the last few years. In \nthe aftermath of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma \nCity, Aileen and OVC were among those immediately on the scene to \nprovide assistance to the victims. Together we have found ways to \nextend and expand that victims assistance over time and to enact \nlegislation to allow victims and their families greater opportunity to \nattend and observe the trials of those charged in connection with that \nhorrendous crime.\n  We worked together on the Victims of Terrorism Act that I added to \nthe bill passed by the Senate in June 1995, in the wake of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing, to improve our law recognizing the rights and needs of \nvictims of crime. We also worked on the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act that was enacted in April 1996. We were able to make \nfunds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and \ncompensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents \nmight otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime \nvictims compensation program or its victims assistance services. We \nalso filled a gap in our law for residents of the United\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nStates who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur \noutside the borders of the United States.\n  In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local \nvictims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they \ncan know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and \nwane with events. Accordingly, we enacted an important provision to \nincrease the base amounts for States' victims assistance grants to \n$500,000 and allowed victims assistance grants to be made for a 3-year \ncycle of programming, rather than the year of award plus one, which was \nthe limit contained in previous law. We were able to raise the \nassessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the \nneeds of crime victims.\n  We worked to improve the church burning legislation and to increase \nthe stability to victim assistance and victim compensation program \nfunds.\n  Aileen was helpful in consulting with me and other Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee on the victims provisions of S. 15, a youth crime \nbill, so that the rights of victims of juvenile crime to appear, to be \nheard and to be informed would be protected. Those provisions have now \nbeen incorporated in the juvenile crime bill ordered reported by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In addition, Senator Kennedy and I incorporated a number of her \nsuggestions in S. 1081, the ``Crime Victims Assistance Act.'' That bill \nwould reform the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional \nrights and protections for victims of federal crime. In particular, the \nlegislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be \nheard on the issue of pretrial detention, on plea bargains, at \nsentencing, on probation revocation, and to be notified of a \ndefendant's escape or release from prison. The legislation goes further \nthan other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress \nby including enhanced penalties for witness intimidation, an increase \nin Federal victim assistance personnel, enhanced training for State and \nlocal law enforcement and officers of the Court, development of state \nof the art systems for notifying victims of important dates and \ndevelopments in their cases, and the establishment of ombudsman \nprograms for crime victims.\n  I know that crime victim advocates in Vermont join me in thanking \nAileen for her service. I was delighted that Aileen could come to \nVermont to keynote the restorative justice conference in Vermont last \nJune. Our Vermont advocates are well aware of the extraordinary efforts \nat OVC and have worked with OVC to create greater opportunities for \nrural programs. With support from OVC, Vermont has been able to \nimplement its victims programs for outreach to underserved populations \nand coordinate among providers and allied professionals.\n  I was especially proud when the recent site visit to Vermont resulted \nin the Justice Department concluding that ``Vermont's programs are \nsetting the standard for outreach to under served populations and \nservice coordination among providers and allied professionals.''\n  Aileen Adams has dedicated her service to the needs of crime victims. \nShe has made a difference. She has improved federal programs for \nvictims of domestic violence, victims of terrorism, and crime victim \nassistance generally. She has helped create a strong funding source for \ncrime victim compensation and assistance programs. She has worked to \nexpand crime victims rights. Most importantly, she has made a \ndifference in the lives of crime victims all across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3532-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3533-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3164.

Mr. President, a little more than 20 years ago, Congress \nenacted legislation which created the American Folklife Center at the \nLibrary of Congress. The legislation enjoyed broad bipartisan and \nbicameral support. The legislation I am introducing today will provide \npermanent authorization for the Center so that the Center may continue \nits work to preserve and share the collections of traditions which \nexemplify the diverse heritage of millions of ordinary Americans.\n  The collections of the American Folklife Center contain rich and \nvaried materials from my state of Mississippi and every state in the \nNation. These materials document the diversity of the folk traditions \nof the many people who make up our nation. The Folklife Center serves \nas a national repository of traditional culture and is used by scholars \nfrom around the world as well as schoolchildren, teachers, and \ngenealogists.\n  The Congress has charged the American Folklife Center to preserve and \npresent American Folklife for future generations. Providing the Center \nwith permanent authorization will give the Center the security it needs \nto carry on its good work, continue its educational services, and \nstrengthen its world-class collections. Permanent authorization will \nalso allow the Center to engage the public's support of its collections \nthrough long-range planning and fundraising.\n  American folklife is the traditional expressive culture shared within \nthe many familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, and regional groups \nin the United States. It is the very basis of family and community \nlife. I hope we can permanently authorize the Folklife Center so that \nthese wonderful collections will be available to future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 1972. A bill to reform the laws relating to Postal Service \nFinances, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                THE POSTAL FINANCING REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a bill that I \noriginally introduced last fall--the Postal Financing Reform Act of \n1998. This bill is designed to do three things: allow the Postal \nService to deposit funds in private sector institutions, invest in open \nmarkets--with Treasury approval of investment choices, and allow the \nPostal Service to borrow from private credit markets.\n  For almost two decades now, the Postal Service has been self-\nsupporting. With a yearly budget near $60 billion, and just $100 \nmillion appropriated to provide free mailing for the blind, free \noverseas voting, and reduced postage rates for certain nonprofit \nmailers, continuing U.S. Treasury control over Postal Service banking, \ninvesting, and borrowing is no longer necessary or justified. \nNonetheless, when I first introduced the Postal Financing Reform Act \nlast fall, specific concerns were raised by some in the postal \ncommunity, and I agreed to make changes that were suggested. The Postal \nFinancing Reform Act of 1998 incorporates these changes. Specifically, \nthe revised 1998 Act reverts back to existing law bill language that \nwould have potentially allowed the Postal Service to invest in its \nprivate sector competitors, and to benefit from an increased borrowing \nceiling at the U.S. Treasury.\n  Current law prevents the Postal Service from obtaining the most \nfavorable combination of prices and services and results in added \noperating costs. Under this new approach, the Treasury Department would \nretain much of its current oversight, but it would no longer be the \nsole provider of certain financial services to the Postal Service.\n  The Postal Financing Reform Act of 1998 proposes four significant \nchanges to current law. First, section two of the bill amends Title 39 \nof the U.S. Code to authorize the Postal Service to deposit its \nrevenues in the Postal Service Fund within the U.S. Treasury or any \nFederal Reserve banks or depositories for public funds. The requirement \nto obtain the Secretary of the Treasury's approval before any funds be \ndeposited elsewhere would be eliminated, just as this approval is no \nlonger necessary for other quasi-public agencies like the Tennessee \nValley Authority (TVA).\n  Section three continues the provision of existing law which requires \nthat the Secretary of the Treasury approve any investments the Postal \nService may make in non-Government securities. At the same time, it \nwould permit the Postal Service to invest in U.S. Government \nobligations on its own accord, without unnecessary constraints, thus \nenabling the Postal Service to take advantage of favorable conditions \nin the Government securities market.\n  Section four removes the control of the Secretary of the Treasury \nover the Postal Service's financial borrowing decisions. The Postal \nService would still be required to consult with the Secretary regarding \nthe terms and conditions of the sale of any obligations issued by the \nPostal Service under section 2006(a) of Title 39, and the Secretary \nwould still exercise a power of approval over the timing of a sale of \nobligations.\n  Finally, section five of the bill removes the ability of the Postal \nService to require the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase Postal \nService obligations. It merely permits the Secretary of the Treasury to \nbuy Postal Service obligations upon the Postal Service's request.\n  I have heard from many sources that reforms in the Postal Service \nshould be made. Though I have decided to refrain from undertaking \ncomprehensive reform, I have selected instead a simple, straightforward \ncorrection of an out of date practice that would reduce costs and help \nhold down future rate increases, without increasing risk to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Those who believe the Postal Service should operate as efficiently as \npossible, thus reducing fees charged to consumers, should support this \nbill. So, too, should those who profess to see the Postal Service \ntreated more like a business.\n  I think it is time to act on this issue. I invite Senators to \nconsider this proposal for reform and support this effort to ensure a \nmore efficient and financially sound U.S. Postal Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Section-by-Section Analysis--Postal Financing Reform Act of 1998\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       The short title of this Act is the Postal Financing Reform \n     Act of 1998.\n\n\n      section 2. end of treasury control of postal service banking\n\n       This provision would amend 39 U.S.C. 2003(d) by enabling \n     the Postal Service to have sole discretion to deposit its \n     revenues in the Postal Service Fund within the U.S. Treasury \n     or any Federal Reserve banks or depositories for public \n     funds. This amendment enables the Postal Service to deposit \n     its funds as it deems appropriate, and take advantage of \n     banking and other modern financial services in the open \n     market that are unavailable from the Treasury Department.\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n                 section 3. postal service investments\n\n       This amendment to 39 U.S.C. 2003(c) ensures continued \n     oversight of any non-Government investments made by the \n     Postal Service. It continues the provision of existing law \n     which requires that the Secretary of the Treasury approve any \n     investments the Postal Service may make in non-Government \n     securities. At the same time, it would permit the Postal \n     Service to invest in U.S. Government obligations on its own \n     accord, without unnecessary constraints, thus enabling the \n     Postal Service to take advantage of favorable conditions in \n     the Government securities market.\n\n\n   section 4. elimination of treasury preemption of borrowing by the \n                             postal service\n\n       This amendment to 39 U.S.C. 2006(a) removes the control of \n     the Secretary of the Treasury over the Postal Service's \n     financial borrowing decisions. The Postal Service, however, \n     must consult with the Secretary of the Treasury for a \n     reasonable period of time, as determined by the Postal \n     Service, regarding the terms and conditions of the sale of \n     any obligations issued by the Postal Service under section \n     2006(a). The specification of a ``reasonable'' time, rather \n     than a specific number of days, is intended to ensure that \n     the consultation process is concluded in a commercially \n     reasonable time, and does not unduly restrict the borrowing \n     flexibility of the Postal Service. The Secretary will \n     exercise a power of approval over the timing (but not the \n     other terms) of a sale of obligations. At the end of the \n     consultation period, the Postal Service may proceed to issue \n     obligations to a party other than the Secretary, and the \n     Secretary cannot block such action, regardless of whether the \n     Secretary has approved such third-party sale. This provision \n     should allow the Postal Service to minimize interest expense \n     by obtaining the most cost efficient service available.\n\n\n      section 5. elimination of postal service ``put'' on treasury\n\n       Section 2006(b) of Title 39 allows the Postal Service to \n     require the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase obligations \n     of the Postal Service up to a limit of $2 billion. The \n     amendment removes the ability of the Postal Service to \n     require the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase Postal \n     Service obligations. It merely permits the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to buy Postal Service obligations upon the Postal \n     Service's request. Removing this ``put'' on the Treasury will \n     be consistent with the purpose of directing the Postal \n     Service borrowing to the private sector where it will be able \n     to take advantage of a broader market, albeit with the \n     requisite constraints.\n       Since the decision to buy is at the discretion of the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, there is no longer a need to place \n     a dollar limit on the amount of Postal Service obligations \n     that the Treasury can purchase. The total limit on Postal \n     Service debt in Section 2005 should apply.\n\n\n                       section 6. effective date\n\n       This Act will become effective 90 days after enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1973. A bill to amend section 2511 of title 18, United States \nCode, to revise the consent exception to the prohibition on the \ninterception of oral, wire, or electronic communications; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the telephone privacy act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Chafee, \nHollings, Boxer, Torricelli, and Wellstone, to introduce the Telephone \nPrivacy Act of 1998. The issue of telephone privacy thrusts itself into \nthe news every so often. I have introduced similar legislation twice \nbefore, because these concerns have been with us since Alexander Graham \nBell installed the first party line.\n  In the early '80s Charles Wick was the head of USIA. He freely \nadmitted that he had recorded more than eighty conversations with then \nPresident Reagan and former President Carter, cabinet members and many \nothers. None of those people knew that Mr. Wick had recorded their \nconversations. I was absolutely appalled to learn that such conduct is \nperfectly legal. I have been trying to correct that gap in the law ever \nsince.\n  Usually, we hear about this issue after some incident where an \nunsuspecting person has suffered harsh personal consequences after a \nprivate conversation has been recorded and disseminated. The Speaker of \nthe House himself was recently recorded by a third party while speaking \non a cellular phone. If that call had been made on an ordinary phone, \nany party to the call could have recorded it without informing the \nSpeaker or anyone else--and it would have been perfectly legal. He \ncould have broadcast it on the evening news and published the \ntranscript in the New York Times. This should be repugnant to almost \neveryone and yet it is all quite legal. My two previous efforts to make \nsuch conduct illegal failed. I believe that in the present environment \na majority of our people think it is time to correct this abomination.\n  Sixteen states have outlawed the taping of phone conversations \nwithout the consent of all parties to the call, but the federal law has \nnot caught up with those states. Until a bill like mine becomes law, \nrecording of personal conversations will be legal, so long as one party \nto the conversation is aware of such recording.\n  How many Americans are aware that it is legal for the private \ntelephone conversations of any person in this country to be monitored \nand even recorded without his or her consent? Indeed, how many Senators \nknow?\n  Americans cherish their privacy as nothing else. One of the reasons \nthe President's popularity is so high is people believe his privacy and \nthe First Lady's privacy has been unfairly invaded.\n  How many times have we heard a recording on television or read a \ntranscript in the newspaper where one of the parties makes some \nembarrassing revelation, confident that the conversation is \n``private,'' never suspecting that he or she was being recorded?\n  I am not talking about authorized law enforcement surveillance. I'm \nnot talking about calls to 911. I'm not talking about employers who \nmust monitor calls made by employees in the course of their duties and \nmy bill makes no change in the law regarding Caller ID technologies. My \nbill would also allow victims of phone threats to record \nthreatening calls. This bill retains all of the existing exceptions to \nthe law that allow our law enforcement agencies and intelligence \ngathering agencies to carry out their important duties unimpeded.\n\n  I want to emphasize that the only change this bill is intended to \nmake to the status quo is this: subject to existing exceptions, under \nmy bill, the interception of wire and electronic communications will be \npermitted only where all parties have consented, rather than allowing \nonly one party to make that determination. Existing penalties for \nviolations of the law will remain unchanged.\n  The current law leaves a huge hole in the rights of telephone users. \nWe have tolerated that gap for many years, but those have been years in \nwhich communications technology has exploded. In 1998, the technology \nto intercept and record telephone calls and other wire communications \nis available to almost everyone--you can do it with an ordinary \nanswering machine. Much of our lives is now conducted over the \ntelephone. Too much of our privacy is at risk.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income any Alaska Permanent Fund dividend received by a \nchild under age 14; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nalleviate an IRS paperwork hassle that confronts every citizen of \nAlaska who has a child. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, when this nation was facing the oil crisis of the \n1970s, Alaskan oil from Prudhoe Bay was in large part responsible for \nallowing our nation to bridge the oil crisis and overcome the blackmail \nthe world faced from the OPEC cartel. The state of Alaska made a \nforesighted decision at that time that it would take a portion of the \noil royalty money and place it into a trust fund for the benefit of the \ncitizens of our State.\n  This trust fund has grown significantly in the past two decades and \nhas allowed the state to issue dividends to every citizen of the state \neach year. Mothers, fathers and children are all entitled to an equal \nshare of the dividend. Yet when it comes time to file tax returns, \nevery family with a child in Alaska is forced to file a separate tax \nreturn for the child based on the fact that the child's only income is \nthe permanent fund dividend.\n  Children under 14 must pay income tax it they have investment income \nof more than $650. If their investment income is greater than $1,400, a \nspecial ``kiddy tax'' is levied that taxes the child's income at the \nparents' highest tax rate. The kiddy tax was designed for one simple \npurpose: To prevent high income taxpayers from shifting income to their \nchildren for tax avoidance purposes.\n  Mr. President, in the case of nearly every child in Alaska, there is \nno effort for parents to shift income to their children. A two-year old \nis required to file a tax return simply because the state had the \nforesight to invest state oil royalty income for the benefit of all \nit's citizens.\n  In recent years, the annual Permanent Fund dividend checks have \naveraged nearly $1,000 per person. For a two-year old child who \nreceived that dividend, the child's parents are responsible for having \na tax return prepared for the child that will show a tax liability of \n$52.50. As all of my colleagues know, filling out tax returns has \nbecome ever more complicated. Fewer and fewer individuals are filling \nout their own returns. Instead, they are having to pay professional \nprepares to fill out these returns.\n  In fact, IRS reports that returns filled out by paid prepares are a \nrecord high this year--54% of all returns filed had been prepared by \nprofessionals. For an Alaskan family with two children, that means a \npaid preparer must fill out three separate tax forms--one for the \nmother and father and one for each of the two children. How much \nadditional cost does the prepare charge for the additional returns? The \nsimplest form to file--the 1040 EZ costs $16.50 at the local H block. \nFor two children that's an additional $33, on top of the costs of the \nparents' return.\n  And what does it cost the IRS to process that return? I've heard \ncosts that range from $5 to $30. I don't think anyone knows the real \nanswer.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that families with children under \n14 in Alaska are subjected to additional IRS paperwork and filing \nrequirements simply because their children's permanent fund dividends \nare subject to a few dollars of federal income tax.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would exclude from income \npermanent fund dividends received by children under 14. This will \neliminate the paperwork burdens that families in our state face simply \nbecause their children receive a dividend from the state. Although I am \nsure this will be scored as losing a modest amount of revenue, about \n$50 for every Alaskan child, IRS will have to process far fewer tax \nreturns from Alaska's children and parents in Alaska will not have to \nincur additional tax preparation fees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being not objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCOME TAX EXCLUSION FOR ALASKA PERMANENT FUND \n                   DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY CHILDREN UNDER AGE 14.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to items \n     specifically excluded from gross income) is amended by \n     redesignating section 138 as section 139 and by inserting \n     after section 137 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 138.

A bill to increase public awareness of the plight of victims \nof crime with developmental disabilities, to collect data to measure \nthe magnitude of the problem, and to develop strategies to address the \nsafety and justice needs of victims of crime with developmental \ndisabilities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           the crime victims with disabilities awareness act\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator \nLeahy to introduce the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to achieve three basic goals: first, \nto increase public awareness of the plight of crime victims with \ndevelopmental disabilities; second, to start collecting data to measure \nthe extent and nature of the problem; and third, to develop strategies \nto address the safety and justice needs of these victims.\n\n  Research in foreign countries has found that persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 times higher risk of \nbecoming crime victims than those without disabilities. Studies in \nCanada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that crime \nvictims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization, \nbecause so few of the crimes against them are reported. Unfortunately, \neven when crimes against victims with disabilities are reported, there \nis sometimes a reluctance by justice officials to rely on the testimony \nof a disabled person, further making these victims a target for \ncriminal predators.\n  What do we know about similar crimes in the United States? Amazingly, \nlittle if any. No significant studies have been conducted in the United \nStates. In fact, the Bureau of Justice Statistics in their annual \nNational Crime Victims Survey does not specifically collect data about \ncrimes against persons with disabilities.\n  Research needs to be done in the United States to (1) understand the \nnature and extent of crimes against persons with developmental \ndisabilities; (2) assess how the law enforcement and justice systems \ncurrently respond to crimes against the developmentally disabled; and \n(3) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promise for making \nour law enforcement and justice systems more responsive to crimes \nagainst persons with developmental disabilities.\n  Our legislation today would accomplish these three research goals. \nOur legislation would direct the Attorney General to contract with the \nNational Research Council through the National Academy of Sciences' \nCommittee on Law and Justice to develop a research agenda to increase \nthe understanding and control of crime against persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities. The National Academy of Sciences would \ndevelop a research agenda that includes convening an interdisciplinary \npanel of nationally recognized experts on crime victims with \ndisabilities and related fields, to define and address critical issues \nto understanding crimes against people with developmental disabilities. \nTheir research would focus on preventive, educative, social, and legal \nstrategies, and recommend methods for addressing the needs of \nunderserved populations.\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n  An authoritative report resulting from this process should provide \nsome important answers.\n  In addition, the bill would direct the Attorney General to begin \ncollecting data for the National Crime Victims Survey of crime victims \nwith developmental disabilities. The Attorney General is asked to study \nand report to the States and to Congress on how the States may collect \ncentralized databases on the incidences of crimes against the disabled.\n  One reason why this issue is so important, and why this legisation is \nnecessary is because there are more and more people with developmental \ndisabilities. The factors behind this rising population include poor \nprenatal nutrition and care, increases in child abuse, and substance \nabuse during pregnancy.\n  I am hopeful that the research called for in this legislation will \nhave broad, positive national policy implications. Greater knowledge \nabout victims with developmental disabilities will help service \nproviders target programs more effectively. Victims and their families \nwill have a better understanding of crime risks. Justice and social \nservice policy makers will have a greater understanding of how, where, \nand when these crimes occur, the characteristics of victims, and how \nthese crimes affect victims and their families. Law enforcement may \ngain information on how to improve investigative and prosecution \nstrategies, and how to use victims' testimony in conjunction with other \ncase evidence. Clearly, what we're trying to do with this legislation \nis to raise considerably the national profile of this issue among \nresearch agencies and the academic community, and to continue to define \nand develop solutions to this problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nrecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crime Victims With \n     Disabilities Awareness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) although research conducted abroad demonstrates that \n     individuals with developmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 \n     times higher risk of becoming crime victims than those \n     without disabilities, there have been no significant studies \n     on this subject conducted in the United States;\n       (2) in fact, the National Crime Victim's Survey, conducted \n     annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the \n     Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data \n     relating to crimes against individuals with developmental \n     disabilities;\n       (3) studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain \n     consistently show that victims with developmental \n     disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of \n     the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, \n     there is sometimes a reluctance by justice officials to rely \n     on the testimony of a disabled individual, making individuals \n     with developmental disabilities a target for criminal \n     predators; and\n       (4) research in the United States needs to be done to--\n       (A) understand the nature and extent of crimes against \n     individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (B) describe how the justice system responds to crimes \n     against the developmentally disabled; and\n       (C) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promises \n     for making the justice system more responsive to crimes \n     against individuals with developmental disabilities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase public awareness of the plight of victims \n     of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (2) to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of \n     crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; \n     and\n       (3) to develop strategies to address the safety and justice \n     needs of victims of crime who are individuals with \n     developmental disabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``developmental disability'' has the \n     meaning given the term in section 102 of the Developmental \n     Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6001).\n\n     SEC. 4. RESEARCH AGENDA.\n\n       (a) Request for Contract.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall \n     submit a request to the National Research Council, that the \n     Committee on Law and Justice of the National Academy of \n     Sciences, acting through the National Research Council, enter \n     into a contract with the Attorney General to develop a \n     research agenda to increase public awareness of crimes \n     against individuals with developmental disabilities and to \n     reduce the incidence of crimes against those individuals.\n       (b) Research Agenda.--The research agenda developed under \n     this section shall--\n       (1) address such issues as--\n       (A) the nature and extent of crimes against individuals \n     with developmental disabilities;\n       (B) the risk factors associated with victimization of the \n     developmentally disabled;\n       (C) strategies to reduce crimes against individuals with \n     developmental disabilities;\n       (D) the manner in which the justice and social service \n     systems respond to crimes against the developmentally \n     disabled, and the means by which that response can be \n     improved;\n       (E) the personal and social consequences of victimization;\n       (F) the importance of place and context in understanding \n     crimes against the developmentally disabled; and\n       (G) the means by which to achieve a better understanding of \n     the interaction between caregiver, victim, and other \n     circumstances in improving public safety; and\n       (2) include an analysis of various methodologies for \n     addressing the issues described in paragraph (1), which may \n     include--\n       (A) appropriate longitudinal designs to increase \n     understanding of its causes;\n       (B) rigorous evaluation research designs to inform and \n     improve prevention, intervention, and control efforts;\n       (C) a multidisciplinary approach to measuring the nature \n     and frequency of crimes against the developmentally disabled, \n     and the personal and social consequences of those crimes;\n       (D) survey data and analysis efforts that better describe \n     the victimization experiences of the developmentally \n     disabled, the context in which victimization occurs, and the \n     social and institutional responses to these experiences; and\n       (E) the development of a Federal research response and a \n     coordinated research strategy by Federal agencies.\n       (c) Panel of Experts.--In developing the research agenda \n     under this section, the Committee on Law and Justice shall--\n       (1) convene and consult with a panel, which shall be \n     composed of--\n       (A) nationally recognized experts on victims of crime who \n     are individuals with disabilities, in the fields of--\n       (i) law;\n       (ii) services to individuals with disabilities;\n       (iii) criminology;\n       (iv) education;\n       (v) direct services to victims of crime; and\n       (vi) the social sciences; and\n       (B) crime victims with disabilities who are members of \n     diverse ethnic, social, and religious communities; and\n       (2) focus primarily on preventive, educative, social, and \n     legal strategies, including addressing the needs of \n     underserved populations.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit to \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives a report describing the research agenda \n     developed under this section.\n       (2) Report.--The Attorney General shall ensure that--\n       (A) the report submitted under paragraph (1) is \n     disseminated widely in governmental, nonprofit, and academic \n     arenas, including by seminars, briefings, and the Internet; \n     and\n       (B) shall make not less than 100 copies of the report \n     available upon request to nonprofit organizations free of \n     charge.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $375,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine in \nintroducing the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. This \nlegislation will address and strengthen our services for disabled \nvictims of crime throughout our country.\n  It is important that we focus attention on the needs and rights of \ncrime victims not only during this week, National Crime Victims Rights \nWeek, but throughout the year. For the past several years, I have \nworked hard with others to make improvements in the law and provide \ngreater assistance to victims of crime.\n  My involvement with crime victims rights began more than three \ndecades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, \nVermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have \nworked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one \nthat respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic \nviolence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already \nvictimized.\n  The needs of victims of crime are many and must be addressed in a \nnumber of ways, including strengthening law enforcement and education, \nimproving and increasing services for victims, and protecting the \nrights of victims. Today I am proud to again have the support of the \nVermont Center for Crime Victim Services in focusing attention on the \nneeds of crime victims with disabilities with the Crime Victims With \nDisabilities Awareness Act.\n  Research conducted abroad has shown that individuals with \ndisabilities have a four to 10 times higher risk of becoming a victim \nthan do individuals without disabilities. Despite these findings, there \nhave been no significant studies on this subject conducted in the \nUnited States. The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act we are \nintroducing today will rectify this omission.\n  The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act proposes to have \nthe Committee on Law and Justice of the National Academy of Sciences \nconduct research so as to increase public awareness of victims of crime \nwith disabilities, to understand the nature and extent of such crimes, \nand to develop strategies to address the safety and needs of victims of \ncrime with disabilities. This Act directs the Attorney General to \nutilize statistics gathered from this study for inclusion in the \nNational Crime Victims Survey. The Crime Victims With Disabilities \nAwareness Act also directs the Attorney General to submit a report \ndetailing the means by which each State can establish and maintain a \ndatabase on the incidence of crimes against individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime \nvictims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to \nhave played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act \nof 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and \nRestitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been able to \nmake.\n  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress acted to ensure a \nright of allocation for victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse \nand to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime victims. No \namount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of being the victim \nof a crime, but we should do all that we can to see that victims are \nassisted, compensated and treated with dignity by the criminal justice \nsystem.\n  I was the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act that was passed by \nthe Senate in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and became the \nbasis for the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act signed into law in \nApril 1996. We were able to make funds available through supplemental \ngrants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and \nmass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the \nresources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its \nvictims assistance services. We also filled a gap in our law for \nresidents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence that occur outside the borders of the United States. In \naddition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local \nvictims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they \ncan know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and \nwane with events. And we were able to raise the assessments on those \nconvicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime \nvictims.\n  Last year, I cosponsored the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. \nThat legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing \nthe fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony \nduring the sentencing phase of that trial. As a result of that \nlegislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to \nobserve the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to \nwitness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact \ntestimony at the sentencing phase of that trial were able to do so.\n  The Crime Victims Assistance Act, legislation that I introduced this \npast July with Senator Kennedy, builds upon the progress made over the \nlast several years. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal \nRules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections \nfor victims of federal crime. This bill would provide crime victims \nwith an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention \nand plea bargains, an enhanced right to a speedy trial and to be \npresent in the courtroom throughout a trial, an enhanced right to be \nheard on probation revocation and to give a statement at sentencing, \nand the right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from \nprison. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' \nservices by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing \ntraining for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, \nand establishing and ombudsman program for crime victims.\n\n  With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress, the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act could be enacted this year and we could mark a \nsignificant and immediate difference in the lives of victims throughout \nour country. I hope that the Senate will turn to this important measure \nwithout further delay. Unfortunately, one consequence of the effort to \nfocus attention on proposals to amend the Constitution has been to \ndissipate efforts to enact effective victims rights legislation over \nthe past two years. The momentum we had built over the last several \nyears has been dissipated by this focus to the exclusion of statutory \nreform.\n  While we have made great improvements in our law enforcement and \ncrime victims assistance programs and have made advances in recognizing \ncrime victims' rights, we still have work to do. This week is National \nCrime Victims' Rights Week. Crime victims advocates across Vermont and \nthe nation are commemorating this week with ceremonies, awards and \nproclamations. I am honored to have received recognition from the \nVermont Center for Crime Victims Services and the Vermont Network for \nDomestic Violence and Sexual Assault during National Crime Victims \nRights Week in 1996 and a Congressional Leadership Award from the \nNational Organization for Victim Assistance. Each year at this time our \nhearts go out to the families and victims of crime. Each year I try to \nhelp focus attention on those who work so hard every week of the year \non behalf of all crime victims in crime victims' assistance and \ncompensation programs.\n  There are many individuals in Vermont who I would like to thank for \ntheir expertise and advice in addressing victims' rights and services, \nincluding Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for \nCrime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont \nNetwork Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. Their hard work \nand dedication have made a real difference in the lives of people who \nsuffer from violence and abuse.\n  In May 1997, the Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime \nconcluded that ``Vermont's programs are setting the standard for \noutreach to undeserved populations and service coordination among \nproviders and allied professionals.'' Vermont's leadership\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nwas also recently recognized with its selection for participation in \nthe Department of Justice Rural Victim Services 2000 project. The \nVermont Center for Crime Victim Services will administer this grant to \nconduct the first systematic survey of what rural crime victims need. \nThe more informed we become of the needs of victims, the more we can \nadapt services to make them more effective and efficient.\n  I commend all those in Vermont and across the country who are \ncommitted to assisting crime victims.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1977. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct \na study and issue a report on predatory and discriminatory practices of \nairlines which restrict consumer access to unbiased air transportation \npassenger service and fare information; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n         the consumer access to travel information act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nwill benefit consumers and small businessmen and women who must travel \nby air. The bill I am introducing today, the Consumer Access to Travel \nInformation Act of 1998, will reverse an increasingly anti-consumer, \nanti-competitive trend in airline travel across the country.\n  For three years, the major airlines have been moving to gain more \ncontrol over the airline travel ticket distribution system. While this \neffort may seem harmless, the ramifications to consumers are \nsignificant. Currently, most air travelers get their information from \none of the 33,000 travel agencies around the country. These agencies \nprovide consumers with unbiased and comprehensive air travel \ninformation, i.e., the best flight at the cheapest fare. Without that \nindependent source of travel information, there is no doubt that \nconsumers will be paying more, in many cases, substantially more for \nair travel.\n  The Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998 is a \nreasonable, and balanced bill that is significant not only for what it \ndoes, but also for what it doesn't do. This legislation would simply \nrequire the Secretary of Transportation to investigate the behavior of \nmajor airlines, including discriminatory and predatory practices of \nairlines which target travel agents, other independent distributors, \nand small airlines. This is authority that the Secretary currently has \nunder the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, but has thus far not \nelected to use. This bill makes certain this investigation is \nundertaken. If it is determined that anti-competitive, discriminatory \nor predatory practices exist, the Secretary must report to Congress \nthose steps the Department intends to take to address such practices.\n  What this legislation does not do is regulate the airline industry. \nIn fact, this legislation is a wake up call for the industry. As the \nfor-profit hospital and HMO industries discovered, if consumers are \ndisregarded, and anti-competitive activities are encouraged, the heavy \nhand of regulators and anti-trust remedies will soon follow. This \ninvestigation by DOT may bring to light practices that the airlines \nthemselves may not even realize exist. It is far better to have DOT \nlook into these issues and have them addressed now, than to have \nCongress begin pursuing more proactive legislative remedies in the \nfuture.\n  Travel agents provide critical services to air travelers, and air \ntravelers depend heavily upon travel agents to provide an accurate, \nbroad selection of schedules, fare quotes, and ticketing services for \nall airlines. Agents quote schedules and fares, and provide ticketing \nservices, to consumers on major U.S. airlines, small U.S. airlines, \nlarge and small international airlines, and start-up airlines.\n  The travel agency community and other independent ticket distributors \nare the only efficient, independent and comprehensive sources of \ninformation for airline travel options. Travel agencies and other \nindependent distributors comprise a considerable portion of the small \nbusiness sector in the United States, employing over 250,000 people. \nOver 50% of travel agencies are owned by women or minorities.\n  Every industry study conducted since the 1960's has concluded that \ntravel agents can process reservation and ticketing transactions in any \nmedium more efficiently than can airlines. Just this year, one of the \nworld's largest and most efficient airlines announced the closing of \nall of its U.S. ticket offices in favor of the efficiencies of the U.S. \ntravel agency industry.\n  So why are multi-billion dollar airlines putting the squeeze on the \nmom and pop travel agencies? Unfortunately, the answer lies beyond just \nsucking more revenue from the travel agent. The biggest threat to the \ncurrent airline oligopoly is the young, upstart airlines. Wherever \nthese airlines operate, the major air carriers' prices are competitive. \nWherever these airlines do not operate, the consumer pays monopoly \nprices. Small domestic airlines, many international airlines, and \nstart-up airlines heavily depend upon the travel agency distribution \nsystem. There is no alternate distribution system available to these \ntypes of airlines. A less ubiquitous, less independent travel agency \nmeans less business for, and less competition from, the smaller \nairlines.\n  As part of the effort to consolidate their market power, the airlines \nbegan to focus on the ticket distribution system. Twice in the last \nthree years, the major airlines have initiated and supported reductions \nin travel agent commissions on the sale of air travel. In February \nalone, total travel agent commissions on domestic travel dropped 21%. \nMore reductions from airlines, and greater travel agent losses, are \nexpected. The number of travel agencies has decreased for the first \ntime since World War II, and many more closings are expected as agency \noperating reserves are exhausted.\n  As travel agents are forced out of the industry and airlines secure \nmore direct consumer business, consumer alternatives will continue to \ndecrease, resulting in significantly higher consumer travel costs. \nMajor airlines have generally misrepresented the reason for agency \ncommission cuts, citing a need to reduce expenses and pass savings on \nto consumers. In fact, airline ticket prices have steadily increased, \nthere have been no consumer benefits, airlines are posting record \nprofits quarter-after-quarter, and consumers are paying the highest \nairfares in history.\n  Commissions are not the only way in which the airlines are using \nanti-competitive practices to pressure the travel agents. For example, \nconfidential business information generated by travel agents, such as \nmarketing, bookings, and sales data, is routinely shared by the \nairlines.\n  Considering airlines regard themselves as competitors of travel \nagents, this is an intolerable situation for the travel agents.\n  Another example of unfair treatment is the use of promotions, \nconcessions, and benefits that airlines can pass on to consumers that \nare denied to travel agents. In addition the airlines operate the \nAirlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), which controls both who can \nbecome a travel agent and the settlement of funds between travel agents \nand the airlines.\n  Internet travel servicing, one ticket distribution alternative which \nholds great promise for consumers, is also being dominated by the major \nair carriers. As a practical matter, travel agents have already been \nexcluded by airlines from selling tickets booked by electronic means. \nAs with conventional distribution, Internet consumers have very limited \nability to view consolidated electronic schedule and fare information, \nmuch less interpret the rules, restrictions and penalties attached to \nsuch lower fares as might be found.\n  That is why, Mr. President, Congress must pass the Consumer Access to \nTravel Information Act of 1998 before consumers are hurt further, and \nbefore there is an overwhelming cry to reregulate air travel.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) To foster and preserve competition, national \n     transportation policy should support the continuation of \n     widespread, convenient, and efficient public access to \n     unbiased comparative air transportation passenger service and \n     fare information.\n       (2) The traveling public relies upon unbiased comparative \n     air transportation passenger service and fare information \n     provided by independent retail travel agents and other \n     independent sources.\n       (3) Concentrations of market power, restrictions on entry, \n     and predatory and discriminatory practices of airlines impair \n     consumer access to independently distributed unbiased \n     comparative information about air transportation passenger \n     services or fares.\n       (4) If not corrected, such practices will seriously \n     restrict consumer access to the independent and unbiased \n     service and fare information provided by travel agents and \n     other independent sources.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       Section 40101(a) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(16) Ensuring that consumers may obtain unbiased \n     comparative information from travel agents and other \n     independent sources about air transportation passenger \n     services and fares in an efficient and convenient \n     manner.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY; REPORT.\n\n       (a) Study.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation \n     (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall undertake a study of the availability to consumers of \n     adequate unbiased information about air transportation \n     passenger services and fares. The study shall include an \n     investigation of the following practices:\n       (1) Air carrier policies that deter or prevent travel \n     agents or other independent sources from using competitively \n     efficient phone systems, computer reservation systems, or \n     other electronic systems to communicate or consummate \n     transactions with the public.\n       (2) Air carrier policies that deter or prevent travel \n     agents and other independent sources from offering the public \n     the same or greater concessions, benefits, or services than \n     those offered by air carriers directly to those consumers.\n       (3) Discriminatory collective or joint operation of assets \n     used to offer concessions, benefits, or services to the \n     public while denying comparable access to such concessions, \n     benefits, or services through travel agents and other \n     independent sources, including joint sales activities, denial \n     of competitive tools, and denial of distribution \n     efficiencies.\n       (4) Sharing of competitively significant sales transaction \n     data in violation of the confidentiality interests of the \n     travel agents or other independent sources that generated \n     such data.\n       (5) As the Secretary considers appropriate, any other \n     practices which may impair consumer access to independently \n     distributed unbiased comparative information about air \n     transportation passenger services or fares.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to \n     Congress a report of the conclusions of the study required by \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.\n\n       The Secretary shall, after notice and hearing, order any \n     air carrier or other party engaged in any practice or policy \n     which constitutes a predatory, unfair, or deceptive practice \n     or unfair method of competition which restricts the \n     widespread, convenient, and efficient access by the public to \n     unbiased comparative air transportation passenger service and \n     fare information or the sale, booking, or distribution of air \n     transportation passenger services or products, to cease and \n     desist therefrom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1978. A bill to designate the auditorium located within the Sandia \nTechnology Transfer Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the ``Steve \nSchiff Auditorium''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the steve schiff auditorium designation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a real honor today to introduce \nlegislation, together with Senator Bingaman, to honor Representative \nSteve Schiff. This legislation designates a special auditorium at the \nSandia National Laboratories as the ``Steve Schiff Auditorium.'' Steve \nspoke in this Auditorium on several occasions, as part of his long \nservice to the people of New Mexico.\n  I think everyone knows that Steve Schiff exemplified all that was \ngood about public service: integrity of the highest order, deep and \nfundamental decency, and an acute and open mind. He went about his \nbusiness quietly, but with wonderful efficiency. He was great at \ntelling stories, usually about himself. He was a model for all \npoliticians to admire.\n  Steve came to New Mexico from Chicago, where he was born and raised. \nHe served the people of New Mexico in different capacities since 1972, \nwhen he graduated from the Law School at the University of New Mexico. \nBefore election to Congress in 1988, he served as District Attorney for \neight years.\n  One of Steve's favorite local programs was his Tree Give-Away \nProgram. For eight years, Steve held a Saturday tree give-away day at \nthe Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. He gave away more than 115,000 \ntrees. Through those trees, he shared his own hope, faith, and love. \nThose trees now flourish throughout the Albuquerque area in New Mexico \nas lasting symbols of this man. In a similar way, his legislative \nachievements continue to serve the American people as another reminder \nof this great American.\n  Along with those trees and his legislation, the Steve Schiff \nAuditorium will serve as a lasting memorial. I am happy and honored to \nhave been a part of his life.\n  I think he would be pleased that this major facility at Sandia \nNational Laboratories, an auditorium where many events occur, many \nevents he has sponsored, that he desires that we talk about in our \nFederal Government as it pertains to nuclear weapons and research, that \nit be designated after him.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I feel very honored today to rise with \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici, to introduce legislation to honor \nRepresentative Steven H. Schiff, who died last month. This bill names \nthe Auditorium in the Technology Transfer Center at Sandia National \nLaboratories as the Steven H. Schiff Auditorium. I have visited \nSandia's Technology Transfer Center (TTC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \nIt is a beautiful building dedicated to furthering collaborations \nbetween the fine staff of scientists and engineers at Sandia and their \ncounterparts in American universities and industry.\n  It is altogether fitting that we dedicate the TTC Auditorium to the \nmemory of Steven Schiff. Steve was a strong champion of collaborations \nand making the resources of our national laboratories available to US \nindustry to help us compete in the global economy.\n  Mr. President, Sandia National Laboratories has 6,000 employees. The \nlab is one of the nation's premier national security facilities with \nmajor responsibilities for our nation's energy research and development \nprojects. Part of Sandia's mission includes technology transfer. The \nemphasis is on partnerships between industry and the lab to collaborate \non emerging new technologies.\n  Today, Sandia's vast technical expertise is being applied to solve a \nvariety of technical problems that will benefit working Americans. A \nnumber of exciting collaborations between Sandia's engineers and \nprivate industry have come about as a direct result of Steve's efforts. \nSome of these collaborations include projects to improve \nmicroelectronics and computers, airline and airport safety, lightweight \nmaterials for automobiles, robots for advanced manufacturing, and \nautomobile tires that are safer and provide consumers better fuel \neconomy. Madam President, I could go on and on.\n  Perhaps the one area of Sandia's work that Steve was the most proud \nof was the lab's application of its 20 years of experience in state-of-\nthe-art physical security technologies to the important areas of \nfighting crime and terrorism. Today, Sandia's vital and highly visible \nprograms are helping to assure the safety and security of every \nAmerican. In particular, Steve's efforts were instrumental in creating \na satellite facility of the National Institute of Justice at Sandia. \nThis linkage was especially satisfying to Steve because of his \nleadership positions on both the House Science and Judiciary \nCommittees.\n  In a short time, Sandia's efforts for the Department of Justice and \nthe FBI are helping to combat crime and terrorism. These programs are \nhaving a major impact on the safety and security of all Americans. \nThese efforts are truly one of Steve Schiff's greatest legacies to New \nMexico and the nation.\n  I'd like to cite just a few examples of Sandia's programs for the \nNational Institute of Justice. Because of Steve's efforts, Sandia was \nable to play a vital role in disarming a bomb left in the unabomber's \ncabin. Sandia also has a school safety and security program\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nthat has dramatically increased the safety of high school students in \nBelen, New Mexico. I had a chance to visit the school, and it is truly \nremarkable what Sandia has accomplished there. Another example of \nSandia's innovative technologies is the development of a ``smart gun'' \nthat can only be fired in the hands of someone authorized to use it. \nAnd Sandia is developing explosive detectors for increased airport \nsecurity and new ways of detecting illegal drugs.\n  Perhaps the culmination of Steve's efforts was last August, when 64 \nof the world's top bomb squads came to Operation Albuquerque '97 for \nhands-on experience with the latest science and methods for disabling \nterrorist bombs.\n  Madam President, using our national laboratories' unique resources to \nsave lives and protect the safety of ordinary people is surely a proper \nmemorial for Steve Schiff. Naming the auditorium at Sandia National \nLaboratories in his honor is another. I am proud to co-sponsor this \nlegislation, and I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his \nefforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1979. A bill to ensure the transparency of International Monetary \nFund operations; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n            THE IMF TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``International \nMonetary Fund Transparency and Efficiency Act of 1998.'' When bailing \nout failing economies, the International Monetary Fund often requires \ncountries to make their markets more transparent, efficient and \naccountable. In the wake of the Asian economic crisis, it has become \nclear that the IMF itself also sorely needs the very same increased \ntransparency, efficiency, and accountability that the IMF demands of \nothers.\n  I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues from North Carolina \nand Alabama, Senators Faircloth and Shelby, who are original cosponsors \nof this legislation.\n  On March 17, 1998, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. \n1769, which would provide Supplemental Appropriations for the IMF for \nFiscal Year 1998. Although I voted against the amendment which would \nprovide $18 billion to bail out the IMF, the Senate ultimately adopted \nthis amendment. While S. 1769 contains a few provisions calling for IMF \nreforms, like increased transparency and calling on countries receiving \nIMF loans to end market distorting government subsidies, S. 1769 \ncontains much weaker enforcement mechanisms than those contained in the \nbill I am introducing today. Also, S. 1769 does not curtail the IMF's \nsubsidized interest rates, something this bill will do.\n  Just last week, the IMF itself freely admitted the need for increased \nopenness and accountability. On April 14, 1998, on the eve of the IMF's \nannual spring meeting, Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, promised \nmore openness and accountability at the IMF. Furthermore, during a \nNational Journal interview earlier this month, Deputy Treasury \nSecretary Lawrence Summers was quoted as saying, ``Equally, we cannot \nbe satisfied with the IMF that we now have. And that is why it is \nimportant to build consensus as rapidly as possible on efforts to make \nthe IMF a more transparent institution.'' I believe the American \ntaxpayers deserve no less.\n  We in Congress must act to ensure that just such IMF reforms become \nreality. By sending the IMF's established hierarchy a clear and \nimmediate reason to implement these reforms we will ensure that these \nlong overdue reforms will actually take place.\n  This legislation is also timely. When the IMF bails out failing \neconomies, it regularly calls for increased transparency and \ngovernmental efficiency as a precondition for receiving financial aid. \nThe IMF is right on target in this respect. Increased transparency and \naccountability are crucial to give the American taxpayers reasonable \nassurances that the problems that cause these economic breakdowns are \nbeing directly addressed. Obviously, if these troubled economies had \nbeen transparent, efficient and open to American exports from the \nstart, Congress would not be debating about making another $18 billion \navailable to the IMF. Clearly, the IMF itself should live up to the \nstandards it sets for others.\n  This legislation would withhold U.S. federal funding from the IMF \nuntil the Treasury Secretary certifies that the IMF has met four \nspecific reform requirements, and then Congress enacts a joint \nresolution approving this certification.\n  First, the IMF would be required to make the minutes of its board of \nGovernors or Executive Board available for public inspection within \nthree months of the meeting. Second, the IMF would release copies of \nloan and program documents, written reviews, and other pertinent \ndocuments related to proposed and ongoing programs within three months. \nThird, the IMF would establish an independent board to review the IMF's \noperations, research and loan activities and then issue annual reports \nfor public inspection. Finally, when granting financial assistance, the \nIMF would charge interest rates that are comparable to market interest \nrates rather than the subsidized interest rates it currently charges. \nNaturally, this bill includes special exemptions to protect classified \nU.S. information, information which would disrupt markets, and \nproprietary information.\n  The administration and IMF have requested that the American taxpayers \nmake an additional $18 billion of their hard-earned dollars available \nto the IMF to replenish its fund that has been depleted by the Asian \nfinancial crisis. My bill will bring accountability to an institution, \nfunded in large part by the American people that has--for the last 50 \nyears--eluded true accountability. Increased transparency and \nefficiency will finally enable the American taxpayers to clearly see \nhow their tax dollars are being used by the IMF.\n  For the reasons stated above and more, I introduce this bill as the \nSenate companion to H.R. 3331, recently introduced by our colleagues in \nthe House, Congressman Saxton of New Jersey, the Chairman of the Joint \nEconomic Committee, Congressman Tom Campbell from California, and House \nMajority Leader Dick Armey. The Heritage Foundation has described this \nlegislation as a compromise with a lot of merit. It is time for \nincreased transparency and efficiency at the IMF, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain coins to be acquired by individual retirement accounts and \nother individually directed pension plan accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               individual retirement account legislation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nallowing certain U.S. legal tender coins to be qualified investments \nfor an individual retirement account (IRA).\n\n  Congress excluded ``collectibles'', such as antiques, gold and silver \nbullion, and legal tender coinage, as appropriate for contribution to \nIRAs in 1981. The primary reason was the concern that individuals would \nget a tax break when they bought collectibles for their personal use. \nFor example, a taxpayer might deduct the purchase of an antique rug for \nhis/her living room as an IRA investment. Congress was also concerned \nabout how the many different types of collectibles are valued.\n  Over the years, however, certain coins and precious metals have been \nexcluded from the definition of a collectible because they are \nindependently valued investments that offer investors portfolio \ndiversity and liquidity. For example, Congress excluded gold and silver \nU.S. American Eagles from the definition of collectibles in 1986, and \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took the further step of excluding \ncertain precious metals bullion.\n  My legislation would exclude from the definition of collectibles only \nthose U.S. legal tender coins which meet the following three standards: \ncertification by a nationally-recognized grading service, traded on a \nnationally-recognized network, and held by a qualified trustee as \ndescribed in the Internal Revenue Code. In other words, only investment \nquality coins that are independently valued and not held for personal \nuse may be included in IRAs.\n  There are several nationally-recognized, independent certification or \ngrading services. Full-time professional graders (numismatists) examine \neach coin for authenticity and grade them according to established \nstandards. Upon certification, the coin is sonically-sealed (preserved) \nto ensure that it remains in the same condition as when it was graded.\n  Legal tender coins are then traded via two independent electronic \nnetworks--the Certified Coin Exchange and Certified CoinNet. These \nnetworks are independent of each other and have no financial interest \nin the legal tender coinage and precious metals markets. The networks \nfunction in precisely the same manner as the NASDAQ with a series of \npublished ``bid'' and ``ask'' prices and last trades. The buys and \nsells are enforceable prices that must be honored as posted until \nupdated.\n  Mr. President, the liquidity provided through a bona fide national \ntrading network, combined with published prices, make legal tender \ncoinage a practical investment that offers investors diversification \nand liquidity. Investment in these tangible assets has become a safe \nand prudent course of action for both the small and large investor and \nshould be given the same treatment under the law as other financial \ninvestments. I urge the Senate to enact this important legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN COINS NOT TREATED AS COLLECTIBLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 408(m)(3) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exception for \n     certain coins and bullion) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) any coin certified by a recognized grading service \n     and traded on a nationally recognized electronic network, or \n     listed by a recognized wholesale reporting service, and--\n       ``(i) which is or was at any time legal tender in the \n     United States, or\n       ``(ii) issued under the laws of any State, and''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 1981. A bill to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \nemployees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to our system \nof collective bargaining while preserving the rights of workers to \norganize, or otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under \nthe National Labor Relations Act; read the first time.\n\n\n                      the truth in employment act\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, small businesses are under attack in \nthis country, and the United States government, through the National \nLabor Relations Board and other regulatory agencies, is aiding in this \nunprecedented assault. This battle is being waged against small \nemployers by paid and unpaid union operatives who get access to non-\nunion workplaces by seeking employment in these companies. Because \nemployers are not allowed to refuse to hire union labor, they are \nusually hired. Once on job, these union agents put economic pressure on \ntheir employers by causing workplace disruptions that increase their \nemployer's cost of doing business. This union guerilla warfare against \nemployers is known as ``salting.''\n  The weapon of choice for these union operatives is to file unfair \nlabor charges against their merit shop employers at the National Labor \nRelations Board or to file complaints against their employers at the \nEEOC, OSHA, or other regulatory agencies. Defending against these \ncharges and complaints costs the employers in both legal fees and in \nlost time. As an added benefit, these cases often net union employees \nlarge damage awards or settlements because their employers can ill-\nafford the expense of defending themselves against the barrage of \nfrivolous charges being filed against them.\n  Consider the following examples: Gaylor Electric of Carmel, Indiana \nhas had 96 charges filed against it. While each and every one of these \ncases has been dismissed without merit, Gaylor Electric has had to bear \nthe cost of these cases to the tune of $250,000 per year. Likewise, hth \nCompanies in Union, Missouri has had 48 unfair labor charges filed \nagainst it. Again, while all but one of these cases was dismissed, hth \nCompanies has wasted $150,000 defending itself against these frivolous \ncharges. Bay Electric in Cape Elizabeth wasted over $100,000 defending \nitself against 14 unfair labor charges--each of which was dismissed \nwithout merit. Wright Electric in Delano, Minnesota has lost almost \n$500,000 defending itself against 15 unfair labor charges, 14 of which \nhave been dismissed, and one of which is still pending.\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n  In my home state, Little Rock Electrical, of Little Rock, Arkansas \nhas been flooded with 72 unfair labor cases in just one year, 20 of \nwhich have already been dismissed, and 45 which have been set for \ntrial. Finally, R.D. Goss in Clearfield, Pennsylvania has suffered the \nworst, having been hit with 20 unfair labor cases, all but one of which \nwas dismissed--but which forced them out of business after 38 years.\n  Mr. President, I support the right of workers to organize, and I am \nalways reluctant to propose federal legislation that interferes in \nprivate matters--particularly private contractual relationships between \nemployers and employees. However, in this case, as the above examples \nshow, the federal government, particularly through the National Labor \nRelations Board, is wreaking havoc on merit shop contractors through \nthis unfair, but legal, practice.\n  Evidence as to the true nature and intent of union salting was best \nexplained in the Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers (IBEW), which stated that the true goal of \n``salting'' is to:\n\n       . . . threaten or actually apply the economic pressure \n     necessary to cause the employer to . . . raise his prices to \n     recoup additional costs, scale back his business activities, \n     leave the union's jurisdiction, go out of business, and so \n     on.\n\n  Or, more bluntly, in the words of an IBEW organizing flyer, the goal \nis:\n\n       . . . infiltration, confrontation, litigation, disruption, \n     and hopefully annihilation of all non-union contractors.\n\n  On February 13, 1997, I introduced legislation that addresses the \nissue of salting. This legislation, The Truth in Employment Act of \n1997, would have allowed employers to reject an applicant that has no \nintention of actually working for the company, but who was instead \nsolely interested in organizing and harassing their employer and fellow \nemployees. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed \ntheir own version of the Truth in Employment Act, under the able \nleadership of Chairman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania and Chairman \nHarris Fawell of Illinois, both of whom I had the privilege of serving \nwith when I was a Member of the House.\n  Today, I am introducing new legislation to address this issue of \nsalting. My new bill, the Truth in Employment Act of 1998 is identical \nto the House passed version.\n  Mr. President, the strength of this country rests on the freedom of \nindividuals to pursue their dreams and ideas, and to risk their own \ncapital to open and operate small businesses. Likewise, this country is \nbuilt on the principle that workers are free to sell their labor, and \nif they deem necessary, to join fellow workers to negotiate higher pay \nor better working conditions. This measure will not undermine either of \nthese legitimate rights. This bill only seeks to stop the destructive \npractice of ``salting'' to protect employers who operate non-union \nshops, and to protect employees who freely choose to work for these \nnon-union employers.\n  I would urge my fellow Senators to join our colleagues in the House \nand pass the Truth in Employment Act. The survival of America's small \nbusinesses demand that we act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, the Jewish Community Relations \nCouncil (JCRC) hosted the annual Holocaust Memorial Ceremony starting \non April 19 in remembrance of the six million Jews who died in the \nHolocaust. The theme for this year's ceremony is ``A People Survives: \nFrom the Gates of Hell to the Gates of Jerusalem.'' This memorial \nservice draws over 3,000 people every year to honor the stoicism and \nfaith of all people who were unjustly massacred by the Nazis. The \nHolocaust Memorial Ceremony is one of the most profound events in the \nJewish Community.\n  The JCRC was established in 1938 and works to promote issues of \nJewish communal concern and is driven by Jewish values of \nhumanitarianism, respect for others, and the sanctity of human life. To \nthis day the JCRC has worked to create a society in which there is \nequal opportunity for all, freedom of thought, opinion, religion and \nconstructive, amicable relationships between people of all races and \ncreeds. They pledge to do all this while maintaining the integrity and \ncharacter of the Jewish faith.\n  In 1980 Congress established the United States Holocaust Memorial \nCouncil and mandated it to lead the nation in civic commemorations of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nvictims of the Holocaust (called Days of Remembrance), to sponsor the \nnational annual civic commemoration and to encourage appropriate \nRemembrance observances throughout the country. This year Yom Hashoah \nwas April 23. The Days of Remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust \nare being observed from Sunday, April 19 through Sunday, April 26.\n  Before there was a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Days of \nRemembrance was established and carried out, not only in the Rotunda of \nthe United States Capitol, but all across the nation. This annual, \nnational commemoration program is the United States Holocaust Memorial \nCouncil's longest-running program and is essential to the Council's \nCongressional mandate.\n  We have now reached the time at which many of the Holocaust survivors \nare passing on. It is imperative that all of humanity maintain respect \nfor and never forget the tremendous suffering of the Jewish community. \nIt is true that this event is a wholly Jewish experience, and yet, the \nentire world still reels from its impact. It is the responsibility of \nthe people of the United States and the world to ensure that the memory \nof the Holocaust lives on.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to give their blessings to the \nHolocaust Memorial Ceremony and to praise the efforts of the JCRC in \nmaintaining awareness of the Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3554-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3555-S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AIR SERVICE RESTORATION ACT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I and some of my \ncolleagues on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation introduced the Air Service Restoration Act designed to \nhelp revive air service to those parts of the country that have \nsuffered under deregulation. The revitalization of air service for \nsmall communities is of absolute importance to the economic and social \nwell-being for these communities. While this legislation is no panacea, \nit will hopefully provide some tools to help small communities address \nthe air service deficit that has hit them since deregulation.\n  Some rural states, such as North Dakota, have not enjoyed the \nbenefits of competition and deregulation that other regions of the \ncountry have experienced. In fact, the federal policy of deregulation \nhas led to less service, higher fares, and less competition for my \nstate and other rural areas. Unfortunately, the air service problems \nfacing rural America has gone ignored for too long and we now have an \nair service crisis, in my judgment. This crisis needs immediate \nattention and the Air Service Restoration Act is a modest attempt to \naddress this, the chronic air service deficit facing many small \ncommunities.\n  This legislation is based on three principles.\n  First, it acknowledges that since deregulation some communities have \nindeed suffered and there is a need for a federal role to address this \nsmall community air service deficit. It seems to me that we need to \nmove beyond the broader debate over whether or not deregulation has \nbeen a good or a bad thing. It has been good for some and bad for \nothers--creating an unacceptable circumstance of air service ``have'' \nand ``have nots.'' This legislation does not seek broad-sweeping policy \nchanges that will dramatically alter federal aviation policy. Rather, \nthe Air Service Restoration Act attempts to target some modest \nresources and policy objectives to address the problem areas, i.e., the \n``have nots.'' This legislation will not threaten deregulation. Rather, \nit is an attempt to save it by addressing the casualties of a policy \nthat has left some parts of the country behind. It is time that we \ndevelop ``air service development zones'' and allow all regions of the \nnation to participate in a national air transportation system. This \nlegislation does that by identifying the problem areas and creating \nopportunities to attract new air service.\n  The second principle of this legislation is based on the notion that \nthe initiative and locus of solving air service problems for small \ncommunities must begin at the local level. There is no federal ``silver \nbullet'' and those communities that seek to improve or restore air \nservice must roll up their sleeves and develop sustainable public-\nprivate partnerships that will make air service economically \nsustainable. This legislation is a market-based solution to improving \nair service for small communities. The only way small communities are \ngoing to succeed in attracting new air service is that local officials \nand business leaders will have to get together and identify ways to \nmake it economically viable for carriers to add service.\n\n  Finally, this legislation is based on the notion that there is \nclearly a need for a federal role. The U.S. Department of \nTransportation needs to play an active role by providing a means for \nsmall communities to access the resources and in making the regulatory \nchanges necessary to allow new service to flourish. Under this \nlegislation, a new office would be created within the U.S. Department \nof Transportation whose sole function would be to work with local \ncommunities and provide assistance to help them achieve their goals of \nimproving air service by providing financial assistance to local \ncommunities and addressing regulatory hurdles that inhibit air service \nto small communities.\n  Hopefully, this legislation will help reverse the air service deficit \nin this country. Since 1978, more communities have lost service than \nthe number of communities that have been added to the air service map \nof the United States. Over 30 small communities have lost all air \nservice since 1978 and many more have had jet service replaced with \nturboprop commuter service.\n  Service decline is not the only disturbing trend plaguing small \ncommunity air service. Consolidation is having its toll as well. As the \nairline industry continues its steady trend of consolidation, the major \nnetwork carriers are pulling out of rural areas. Out of a total of 320 \nsmall communities that had scheduled air service in 1978, 213 of those \nwere served by a major carrier. In 1994, only 33 of those small \ncommunities had service from major carriers. Prior to deregulation, \nNorth Dakota was served by 6 major carriers and every major market in \nNorth Dakota had 3 or 4 major carriers in each market, each providing \njet service. Today, North Dakota has only 1 major carrier that provides \njet service.\n  The number of small communities receiving multiple-carrier service \ndecreased from 136 in 1978 to 122 in 1995. Also, the number of small \ncommunities receiving service to only one major hub increased from 79 \nin 1978 to 134 in 1994.\n  In 1938, when the Federal Government began to regulate air \ntransportation services, there were 16 carriers who accounted for all \nthe total traffic in the U.S. domestic market. By 1978 (the year \nCongress passed deregulation legislation) the same 16 carriers (reduced \nto 11 through mergers) still accounted for 94% of the total traffic.\n  Today, those same 11 carriers (now reduced to 6 through mergers and \nbankruptcies) account for 80% of the total traffic.\n  One export estimated in 1992 that since deregulation, over 120 new \nairlines appeared. However, more than 200 have gone bankrupt or been \nacquired in mergers and today, only 74 remain--most small and \nstruggling.\n  Between 1979 and 1988, there were 51 airline mergers and \nacquisitions--20 of those were approved by the Department of \nTransportation after 1985, when it assumed all jurisdiction over merger \nand acquisition requests. In fact, DOT approved every airline merger \nsubmitted to it after it assumed jurisdiction over mergers from the \nCivil Aeronautics Board in 1984. Fifteen independent airlines operating \nat the beginning of 1986 had been merged into six mega carriers by the \nend of 1987. And, these six carriers increased their market share from \n71.3% in 1978 to 80.5% in 1990.\n  These mega carriers have created competition free zones, securing \ndominate market shares at regional hubs. Since deregulation, all major \nairlines have created hub-and-spoke systems where they funnel arrivals \nand departures though hub airports where they dominate traffic. Today, \nall but 3 hubs are dominated by a single airline where the carrier has \nbetween 60 and 90 percent of all the arrivals, departures, and \npassengers at the hub.\n  In a report by the General Accounting Office entitled ``Airline \nDeregulation: Barriers to Entry Continue to Limit Competition in \nSeveral Key Domestic Markets,'' [GAO/RCED-97-4], operating limitations \nand marketing\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\npractices of large, dominate carriers restrict entry and competition to \nan extent not anticipated by Congress when it deregulated the airline \nindustry. The GAO identified a number of entry barriers and anti-\ncompetitive practices which are stifling competition and contributing \nto higher fares. The GAO issued a similar report in 1990 and the 1996 \nreport said that not only has the situation not improved for new \nentrants, but things have gotten worse.\n  The fact is that deregulation has lead to greater concentration and \nstifling competition. The legislative history of the Civil Aeronautics \nAct of 1938 shows that Congress was as deeply concerned about \ndestructive competition as it was with the monopolization of air \ntransportation services. Thus, the CAA sought to ensure that a \ncompetitive economic environment existed. As we can see, deregulation \nis realizing the fears anticipated by the Congress in 1938. Competition \nhas not become the general rule. Rather, competition is the exception \nin an unregulated market controlled largely by regional monopolies.\n  It has been demonstrated that hub concentration has translated into \nhigher fares and rural communities that are dependent upon concentrated \nhubs have seen higher fares. Studies from DOT and the GAO have \ndemonstrated that in the 15 out of 18 hubs in which a single carrier \ncontrols more than 50% of the traffic, passengers are paying more than \nthe industry norm. The GAO studied 1988 fares at 15 concentrated \nairports and compared those with fares at 38 competitive hub airports. \nThe GAO found that fares at the concentrated hubs were 27% higher.\n\n  The difference between regulation and deregulation is not a change \nfrom monopoly control to free market competition. Today, nearly two-\nthirds of our nation's city-pairs are unregulated monopolies where a \nmonopoly carrier can charge whatever they wish in 2 out of 3 city-pairs \nin the domestic market.\n  A January 1991 GAO Report on Fares and Concentration at Small-City \nAirports found that passengers flying from small-city airports on \naverage paid 34 percent more when they flew to a major airport \ndominated by one or two airlines than when they flew to a major airport \nthat was not concentrated. The report also found that when both the \nsmall airport and the major hub were concentrated, fares were 42 \npercent higher than if there was competition at both ends.\n  A July 1993 GAO Report on Airline Competition concluded that airline \npassengers generally pay higher fares at 14 concentrated airports than \nat airports with more competition. The report found that fares at \nconcentrated airports were about 22 percent higher than fares at 35 \nless concentrated airports. The same report found that the number of \ndestinations served directly by only one airline rose 56 percent to 64 \npercent from 1985 to 1992, while the number of destinations served by 3 \nor more airlines fell from 19% to 11% during that same period. This \nreport confirmed similar conclusion reached in previous GAO studies \nconducted in 1989 and 1990.\n  The fact is that deregulation, while paving the road to concentration \nand consolidation, has allowed regional monopolies to control prices in \nnoncompetitive markets. While the entrance of low cost carriers has \nintroduced competition in dense markets, the main difference between \ntoday and pre-deregulation is that the monopolies are unregulated.\n  Deregulation has been both a tremendous success in some aspects and a \ncolossal failure in some circumstances. It's time we started addressing \nthe problems rather than just praising the successes. For hundreds of \nsmall communities, it has meant less service, higher fares, and fewer \noptions.\n  Air transportation in North Dakota is just as important as air \nservice in New York and Denver. It is not in our national interest to \nallow vast regions of our country to become geographically isolated. \nThat would be not only tragic for our rural communities, but bad for \nthe Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and that the \nSenate Commerce Committee expeditiously act on it this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3555-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF COORS BREWING COMPANY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat American company, one that will be celebrating its 125th \nAnniversary next month. The success of Coors Brewing Company is a great \nAmerican story. When Adolph Coors arrived in this country in 1868, he \ndid not speak English, but he did know how to brew a great beer.\n  From 1873 until today, Coors has made its reputation on the lasting \nvalues of its founder. The American values tradition, commitment, \nquality, and innovation have long been a part of this history. Holding \nsteadfast to these values has helped Coors grow from a tiny local \nbrewery in Golden, Colorado into a world-class competitor producing \nmore than 20 million barrels of beer each year. Today, Coors' familiar \nproducts are sold not only across the United States, but in 45 foreign \ncountries as well.\n  Through the years, Coors has been at the forefront of responsible \ncommunity involvement, and today it is recognized as a leader in \ncorporate citizenship. That is why Business Ethics magazine recently \nplaced Coors in the top ten of its ``The 100 Best Corporate Citizens.'' \nCoors also has been cited numerous times for its outstanding record in \nattracting, hiring, and promoting minority Americans. It is what you \nwould expect, given Coors' record of investing hundreds of millions of \ndollars in economic development and other programs designed to \nstrengthen Hispanic and African-American communities.\n  When you do business in Colorado, respect for the environment is, of \ncourse, a must. Coors is a leader in this area as well. Coors launched \nthe aluminum recycling revolution back in 1959 when it began offering a \npenny for every returned can. Since 1990, the Coors Pure Water 2000 \nprogram has provided more than $2.5 million to support more than 700 \nenvironmental programs across the nation.\n  One of its most noteworthy accomplishments has been in developing and \npromoting effective programs to discourage abuse of its products. Coors \nhas a record of encouraging responsible consumption of its products by \nadults--and only adults. Over the years, millions of dollars have been \ndevoted to community-based education and prevention programs. Coors' \n``21 means 21'' message has been one of the elements responsible for \nthe steady decline in underage drinking and drunk driving that we in \nthe United States have been fortunate to see in the recent years.\n  Coors has set the standard for responsible advertising, and has led \nthe industry with policies to ensure that its ads encourage moderation, \nand are directed only to those over the age of 21.\n  We all know of the controversies that can befall consumer products of \nall kinds during the highly politicized times in which we live today. \nBut the record amassed by Coors over the past 125 years is reassuring. \nIt is good to know there are still people and companies dedicated to \ndoing the right thing.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in a toast to the thousands of \nCoors employees in Colorado, Tennessee, Virginia, and at Coors \ndistributorships in every state of the nation: Congratulations on a job \nwell done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3556-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3556-S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL WALLER ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. REED.

He was first \nassigned to the 143rd Special Operations Squadron in July 1967 as a \ntroop carrier pilot. The next year he was assigned as a tactical \nairlift pilot, a duty he performed for the next twenty-three years. \nDuring this time, he also served as a flight leader and instructor \npilot. General Waller is a command pilot who has logged 4,500 flying \nhours.\n  General Waller is noted not only for his piloting skills, but also \nfor his leadership. In 1981, he was selected as commander of the 143rd \nTactical Airlift Squadron. In December 1987, he was reassigned to \nHeadquarters, Rhode Island National Guard and named Deputy Chief of \nStaff. Three years later he became Chief of Staff. The very next year\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nhe was elevated to the position of Assistant Adjutant General, the \nposition he holds today.\n  General Waller chairs the Eastern Region of the Air National Guard \nLong Range Planning Process and serves as the Air National Guard \nAssistant of Strategic Planning to the US Air Force Long Range Planning \nOffice. He is well suited to these positions because during his thirty \nyears in the Rhode Island National Guard, General Waller has witnessed \nand provided leadership through immense change. When General Waller \nfirst joined the Guard in the 1960s, the United States was immersed in \nturmoil both at home and abroad. The goals and role of the military in \nthe states and overseas were confused and conflicted. During the next \ndecade, the United States moved to an all volunteer force, \nfundamentally changing the nature of the Guard. Then in the 1980s, \nmilitary goals and perspectives shifted again during an enormous \nbuildup which peaked in 1985 with a record budget of $300 billion.\n  Now, once again, the Guard is adjusting to new era of reduced force \nstructure, budget constraints, and base closures. Members of the Guard \nno longer train one weekend a month and two weeks each summer. Instead, \nthey participate 110-120 days a year and work side-by-side with their \nactive duty colleagues on missions in countries around the world. \nGeneral Waller has been through it all and has never wavered from the \ncore values of the Guard: integrity first, service before self, and \nexcellence in all that is done.\n  General Waller is clearly an outstanding soldier. His military awards \nand decorations include the Legion of Merit; Meritorious Service Medal \nwith two bronze oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal; Air \nForce Achievement Medal; Outstanding Unit Award; Combat Readiness medal \nwith three bronze oak leaf clusters; National Defense Service Medal \nwith one star; Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon with one silver \nand three bronze oak leaf clusters; Armed Forces Reserve medal with \ngold hourglass; Small Arms Expert Markmanship Ribbon; Air Force \nTraining Ribbon; Rhode Island Star with one oak leaf cluster; Rhode \nIsland Defense Medal; and Rhode Island National Guard Service Medal \nwith eagle and ``V'' device.\n  General Waller is also an outstanding citizen. He is the devoted \nhusband of Carol, the loving father of Wendy, Jay and Jill and the \nproud grandfather of three boys. Throughout the years he has also given \nto his community as a Boy Scout Master and a Sunday school teacher.\n  General Waller rose from the enlisted ranks and has occupied and \nsucceeded at virtually every level of command. He inspired and \nempowered those around him. He cares deeply for the Guard and the \npeople in it. We are honored by the legacy he leaves behind and aspire \nto ensure that General Waller is always proud of the Guard in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3556-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DAY OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today, April 23, as the \nUnited States Congress joins hands with the United States Holocaust \nMemorial Museum and conducts a Day of Remembrance ceremony in the \nRotunda of the Capitol. This ceremony, and those in each of the 50 \nState capitols and in some 200 cities and towns throughout the nation, \nhonors the memory of those 11 plus million Holocaust victims and the \nmillions more who survived but found their pre-WWII lives in shambles \nand in all too many cases, irretrievable.\n  This year's ceremony pays special tribute to the children, those \ninnocent victims of the war and the Nazis' persecution. That they \nsurvived is remarkable. In some instances, they bear the physical \nmarkings of their plight. Others carry their wounds in their hearts and \nheads.\n  That this great nation mandates a Day of Remembrance ceremony is an \nindication of its commitment to historical memory. But an equally \nimportant part of our effort to learn from the past is the presence of \nthe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Its mission is to advance \nHolocaust memory, education and scholarship. This week marks its 5th \nanniversary.\n  Five years ago, no one would have predicted the reaction of the \nUnited States to the opening of the Holocaust Museum. Estimates of \nvisitation, even those most rosy, were low by a factor of more than \ntwo. Expecting 750,000 visitors under the highest estimate, the museum \nwelcomed over 2 million in its first year and every year since. Just \ndrive by the Holocaust Museum any morning and see the line stretching \naround the building.\n  While I reflect on the Holocaust Museum, I feel it appropriate to \nmention the work of a distinguished Vermonter, Professor Raul Hilberg. \nProfessor Hilberg spent many years educating students at the University \nof Vermont about the Holocaust, but few people know how instrumental he \nwas in furthering Holocaust related research as a real serious \nenterprise. It wasn't until Raul Hilberg began his study of this \nimportant subject that historians began to take it seriously, and his \nresearch preceded the concept of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. \nProfessor Hilberg was instrumental in furthering the Museum's research \nprograms and many feel that he serves as a father figure to the \ninstitution.\n  Americans care about the past and want the world they leave to their \nchildren to be a better and safer place. They have learned well the \nlessons from the fall of German democracy and the rise of Nazism. They \nlook around the world today and see acts of genocide and crimes against \nhumanity and rightly worry about our future.\n  They come to the Holocaust Museum because it informs and educates. It \nmakes disregarding the past and even contemporary acts of genocide and \ncrimes against humanity more difficult.\n  We as a nation benefit greatly from this institution which stands as \na testament to the horrors of the past and guards against a \nreoccurrence in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3557-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEBRASKA CULTURAL PRESERVATION ENDOWMENT\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to talk about an \nexceptional, innovative effort in Nebraska; the creation of a $5 \nmillion Nebraska Cultural Preservation Endowment. Last week the \nNebraska Legislature approved, and Governor Nelson signed legislation \nto make Nebraska the first state in the nation to establish a combined \nfunding source for arts and humanities programs.\n  I am very hopeful that this pioneer endeavor will safeguard \nNebraska's cultural programs from the uncertainty of federal funding \nand private donations. And I have high hopes that this permanent state \nresource will provide the Nebraska Arts Council and Nebraska Humanities \nCouncil the flexible, broad-based kind of support that they need to do \nthe best job possible. Moreover, the foresight, diligence and \ncreativity of those who conceived of this venture will undoubtedly \nensure that future generations of Nebraskans will benefit from a \nvibrant cultural life, historical tourism and economic development \nwhich this public-private partnership will foster.\n  At this time, I would like to applaud the efforts of those who made \nthis Endowment possible. Governor Ben Nelson, State Senator LaVon \nCrosby, of Lincoln, Jennifer Severin Clark of the Nebraska Arts Council \nand Jane Hood of the Nebraska Humanities Council are all to be highly \ncommended. Thank you for your leadership, commitment and courage in \nthis endeavor and congratulations on a job very well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3557-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3557-S3558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n150th Anniversary of the Women's Rights Movement of the United States. \nThis courageous movement which began in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York \nat the first Women's Rights Convention ever held, changed the nation \nirrevocably. The Women's Rights Movement had a profound impact on women \nand all Americans. It opened up many new doors and increased \nopportunities for women in all fields. The work to achieve equality for \nwomen that began in 1848, has continued over the course of seven \ngenerations. It is for this reason that this significant movement in \nAmerican history should be increasingly recognized by our nation's \ncitizens, especially our children.\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n  The significance of this year cannot be stressed enough. This 150th \nAnniversary, under the national theme: ``Living the Legacy: Women's \nRights Movement 1948-1998'' should be widely recognized and celebrated \nthroughout the year and into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3557-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO BETSY STEVENS OF THE CAPE COD CHAPTER OF THE RED CROSS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Betsy Stevens, who recently retired as \nDisaster Chairman for the Cape Cod Chapter of the American Red Cross.\n  Betsy Stevens has served with great distinction in this position for \nthe past six years. One of her most impressive achievements was hosting \nthe recent Eastern Disaster Conference. Over 200 Red Cross disaster \nvolunteers from the Eastern United States attended this conference \nhosted by the Cape Cod Chapter.\n  In her capacity as Chairman, Mrs. Stevens did an excellent job \norganizing and training volunteers to provide services to the victims \nof disasters. During her tenure, Red Cross volunteers responded to \ndisasters such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the hurricane in Guam, and \nthe paralyzing ice storm in Maine.\n  On Cape Cod, Betsy Stevens was renowned for her availability to deal \nwith sudden crises at all hours. She responded to fires and airplane \ncrashes, and manned shelters during severe storms. She was skillful in \nrecruiting shop owners to donate goods and services. She found \nemergency housing for victims and served countless holiday dinners. She \ndeserves great credit for the exceptional readiness and high quality of \nthe Red Cross volunteers of the Cape Cod Chapter. Her leadership will \nbe greatly missed, but she has the gratitude of all of us for the job \nshe did so well. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3558-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GIRL SCOUTS OF THE U.S.A. GOLD AWARD\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to salute \nseveral outstanding young women who have earned the Girl Scouts of the \nU.S.A. Gold Award. All are members of the Red Lands Council of Girl \nScouts in Oklahoma City, OK.\n  These outstanding young women will be honored on April 30, 1998, for \nearning the highest achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout \nGold Award symbolizes the outstanding accomplishments in the areas of \nleadership, community service, career planning, and personal \ndevelopment. The Girl Scout Award can be earned by girls ages 14-17 or \nin grades 9-12.\n  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million \ngirls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior \nGirl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the \naward, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: earn four interest \nproject patches, earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl \nScout Challenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award \nProject. A plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award is created \nby the Senior Girl Scout and carried out through close cooperation \nbetween the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.\n  The names and projects of the young women receiving the Girl Scout \nGold Award are as follows:\n  Mary Foster put up a fence, cleaned up and fixed headstones in her \ncommunity cemetery.\n  Laura Hubbard made a camp song book and set up a workshop to teach \nchildren and adults.\n  Taneya Hamlin made a take-home booklet for children to learn about \nnature. She achieved this by designing and drawing an activity/coloring \nbook for young visitors to Martin Park Nature Center.\n  Rebecca Shappie provided a method to raise money for scholarships for \nkids to go to camp.\n  Christina Hammond, Carrie Heaton, and Sara Brannan, designed an \nErosion Control Project at Lake Keystone which will benefit present and \nfuture generations.\n  Patricia Bardick designed a program called ``Babies, Bears and \nBooks.''\n  Jennifer Hall designed a program called ``Boredom Buster and Beauty \nBags'' for the Baptist Children's Home.\n  Parthenia Harding, Erica Hill, Nina Holman, Jamila Jones and Rachel \nLandry-Gators set up and taught a basic American Red Cross course at an \nelementary school.\n  Michelle Lambertus created ``Huggable Gingerbread,'' a puppet show \nfor children in the hospital.\n  Joelle Parrot and Jamie Smith organized and staffed a community blood \ndrive.\n  The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment \nfor these young women, and I believe they should receive the public \nrecognition due them for this significant service to their community \nand their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3558-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATIONS TO C. VIVIAN STRINGER AND THE SCARLET KNIGHTS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe Rutgers University women's basketball coach, C. Vivian Stringer, \nand her team for their excellent success this past season when the \nScarlet Knights made it to the NCAA Tournament.\n  Even though Rutgers didn't make it to the NCAA Final Four, losing to \nthe Tennessee Lady Volunteers 92-60, Vivian and the talented young \nwomen whom she has recruited and cultivated are champions to all New \nJerseyans.\n  Vivian began her career building the fledgling women's basketball \nprogram at Cheyney State in Pennsylvania, bringing the team to the NCAA \nChampionship game in 1982. She moved on to Iowa State, where for nine \nconsecutive seasons she brought her team to the NCAA Tournament. And \nthen she landed at Rutgers.\n  As one most respected head coaches in women's basketball history, \nVivian has been named National Coach of the Year three times by her \npeers, as well as getting Coach of the Year awards from Sports \nIllustrated, USA Today, Naismith and the Black Coaches Association.\n  So Vivian's success at Rutgers, however remarkable, is not \nunexpected. Before this year, the Scarlet Knights had not been to the \nNCAA Tournament since 1994. A recent news article in Newark, New \nJersey's Star-Ledger describes the reasons behind Vivian's thriving \ntenure best, I think. It said that Vivian, now in her third season: \n``pumped Rutgers with fresh talent and a distaste for mediocrity, a \ncombination that has triggered the Scarlet Knights' rise and surge \nthrough the NCAA Tournament.''\n  Vivian has worked hard to recruit gifted women, instill discipline in \npractice and competition, and most importantly, inspire self-confidence \namong the players. The women attracted to the Rutger's basketball \nprogram all excelled in their high school years and have a strong \ndesire to contribute to the game at a college level. The number of \nawards that the players on the team have received individually is part \nof an impressive collection, with honors such as Parade all-American, \nRookies of the Year, Gatorade Player of the Year, and Sports \nIllustrated ``Faces in the Crowd.''\n  Again, I congratulate Vivian on her hard work and the ambitious young \nwomen who play for her. I wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3558-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3558-S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR. WALTER M. HAUK, JR.\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Knights of Columbus recently \nhonored Mr. Walter Hauk, Jr. for his contributions as the State \nAdvocate over the past two years. I rise today to recognize Mr. Hauk \nand to discuss some of his outstanding contributions to his community.\n  A resident of Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, Walter has taken a \nvery active role in local affairs. Over the past 25 years, Walter has \nbeen a cornerstone of the Knights of Columbus. In fact, he has held all \nof the top offices in the organization. In addition, he has served as \nmember of the Conshohocken Zoning Board, assisted in the Conshohocken \nSoap Box Derby, and served as a Scout Master. Furthermore, I would note \nthat he earned a degree in accounting by attending evening classes at \nSt. Joseph's University.\n  By all accounts, Walter is a dedicated husband and father. He and his \nwife, Carol, were blessed with four children--two sons and two \ndaughters. They are also proud grandparents.\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\n  Mr. President, Walter has dedicated his life to his family and his \ncommunity. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's \nbest wishes for continued success to Mr. Hauk and his family. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/23/senate-section/article/S3558-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DONOR AWARENESS WEEK, APRIL 19-25\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to proclaim this \nweek, April 19-25, 1998 as ``Donor Awareness Week.'' Organ and tissue \ndonation is a very important issue. There is a critical need to bring \nthis issue to the forefront. Nationally, nine out of ten individuals \ndie while waiting for a lifesaving transplant. Awareness should be \npromoted at national and local levels.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize some \nindividuals who work very hard to raise organ and transplant awareness. \nThe volunteers at the Lakeshore Transplant Support Group in Muskegon, \nMichigan work on a daily basis to do so. I commend their dedication on \nbehalf of this issue.
