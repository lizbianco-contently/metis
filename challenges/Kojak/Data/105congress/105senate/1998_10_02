Under the previous order, the committee \namendments reported by the Finance and the Commerce Committees are \nagreed to. The bill is considered original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nbeginning debate on S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Shortly, \nSenator Bumpers will come to the floor to propose his amendment, and we \nexpect further amendments following that.\n  Before I summarize the bill, I want to note for the record the \nimportance of this measure. The reality is that this bill could \ndetermine the fate of electronic commerce. Without it, the economic \nrevolution we are hoping for may never take place. Without it, \nelectronic commerce may--and we are in fact seeing this occur--be \nhampered by politicians who see it as not as revolutionary, but as a \nsource of new tax revenue.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Wyden for his extraordinary \nleadership\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\nin moving this legislation forward. He kept all of the interested \nparties at the negotiating table when on many occasions it appeared as \nthough we were at an impasse. After months of hard work and \ndetermination, we have come much closer to appeasing the National \nGovernors' Association and other state and local organizations. Without \nSenator Wyden's assistance, the bill may never have made it this far.\n  This bill will do the following: It would prohibit state and local \ngovernments from imposing any Internet access tax, bit tax or any \nmultiple or discriminatory tax on electronic commerce for a two-year \nperiod.\n  The bill would establish a 16 member Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce comprised of 4 Federal representatives (the \nSecretaries of Commerce, State, Treasury and USTR); 6 representatives \nof State and local government, as well as 6 representatives of \nelectronic industry and consumer groups, all to be appointed by the \nSpeaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, and the Senate \nMajority and Minority Leaders.\n  The Commission would exist for 18 months to study and develop policy \nrecommendations on the appropriate domestic and international taxation \nand tariff treatment of transactions using the Internet, Internet \naccess, and other comparable or international sales. The Commission's \nfindings and any legislative recommendations are required to be \ntransmitted to the Congress within 18 months after the bill's \nenactment.\n  The bill also includes a sense of the Congress that there should be \nno new federal taxes on the Internet; a requirement that electronic \ncommerce be examined as part of USTR's annual trade estimates report; a \ndeclaration that the Internet should be free of foreign tariffs and \nother barriers; and a provision stating that nothing in this bill is \nintended to affect implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n  Mr. President, we find ourselves at a critical juncture in the \nevolution of our economy and our society. The information technology \nindustry, driven by the growth of the Internet, is connecting people \nand businesses around the world in ways we never dreamed possible.\n  At this critical juncture, we are faced with a choice. We can choose \nto hamper the growth of this vital medium by imposing old ways of \nthinking that just do not apply. Or we can seek new principles to \ngovern in this new era of ubiquitous access to information, people, \nproducts, and services.\n  Mr. President, I hope that Congress will take this opportunity to \nestablish new principles and ways of thinking and governing that will \nallow this vibrant medium to grow and flourish.\n  I believe we must embrace three fundamental principles: There must be \nno piecemeal regulation of the Internet, a medium with interstate and \nglobal reach. There must be no discrimination between goods sold over \nthe Internet and goods sold by other means. There must be no tax on the \nright to access information.\n  The vast potential of the Internet can no longer be denied. According \nto one recently released research report, it took radio almost 40 years \nto reach 50 million listeners in the United States, while broadcast and \ncable television took about 13 and 10 years, respectively, to reach \nthat many viewers. The number of Internet users in the U.S. reached 50 \nmillion users in just five years.\n  By the end of 1998, an estimated 100 million users will be connected \nworldwide. Some estimate that the Internet will soon reach 500 million \nusers--nearing universal connectivity and access.\n  According to a recent Business Week article, online sales are \nexpected to reach nearly $5 billion this year--double that of 1997. \nFrom computer software and airplane tickets to cars and investing, \npeople are taking advantage of the Internet in new ways each day.\n  Now is not the time to allow complicated and unadministrable taxes to \nkill the tremendous potential of electronic commerce.\n  The Internet is creating tremendous value for business as well as \nconsumers. The innovative use of the internet enables thousands of \nbusinesses--big and small--to establish internal networks, or \nintranets, that link geographically dispersed workers and information \nwithin an enterprise. Lockheed Martin and Boeing Aircraft collaborating \nover an Intranet developed the Darkstar aircraft in 11 months with 50 \npeople, a process that would normally require hundreds of designers and \nyears of work.\n  But a business need not be the sizer of a Lockheed Martin or a Boeing \nto utilize the advantages of the Internet. With the Internet, even \nsmall local companies can obtain a global reach that would otherwise \nhave been unthinkable. A small supply company in Pennsylvania, the \nLehigh Valley Safety Supply Company, realized a 150 percent increase in \nrevenue when they placed 50 of their items for sale on the Internet.\n  Given the tremendous potential of the Internet, I see no reason for \npartisanship on an issue which is so vitally important to the future of \nAmerica. I know we are in agreement that we want to see the Internet \ngrow and expand. Everyone, including the experts, is astonished at how \nquickly the Internet has grown. Literally, every expert who has studied \nthis industry has underestimated the growth that has taken place in the \npast few years. So it is very likely that they are underestimating the \ndramatic changes and growth that we will see in the future.\n  That is why we need a moratorium on Internet taxation as proposed in \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. This bill will allow the various experts \nfrom industry and government to sit down and do the difficult work of \ndetermining how the Internet is different from other media and under \nwhat circumstances it should be taxed.\n  The time to act is now. Over the last several months, individuals \nrepresenting government, consumers, and industry have been working \ntirelessly to make this a bill that achieves the goal of a temporary \nmoratorium on confusing Internet taxing schemes while preserving the \nstates' rights to continue collecting taxes. Those states that have \nbeen collecting Internet access taxes have been specifically \ngrandfathered in the amendment that Senator Wyden and I offer today so \nthey can continue to collect those taxes during the moratorium.\n  The Commission created by this bill will address the issues of how \nthe Internet and all remote commerce should be taxed. This Commission \nwill make recommendations to Congress on how best to proceed. By \nworking to create a clear taxing scheme for the Internet, we will \ncontinue to set an example for the world on how to nurture this vibrant \nmedium.\n  Mr. President, the Internet Tax Freedom Act will allow the Internet \nto continue to develop and ultimately reach its full potential. Given \nthe importance of this goal to consumers, businesses, and our global \neconomy, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, on September 4, we received ``An Open Letter To \nCongress'' in support of the Internet tax moratorium legislation. It is \npaid for by the National Taxpayers Union, American Conservative Union, \nAmerican Council of the Blind, American Legislative Exchange Council--\nsome 60 organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       An Open Letter to Congress\n\n                           September 4, 1998.\n\n       Congress is considering various versions of Internet tax \n     moratorium legislation. Some Members are attempting to add an \n     issue onto these bills which we oppose. We, the undersigned \n     organizations, oppose efforts to force vendors to collect \n     out-of-state sales taxes when they do not have any physical \n     presence in a state. This position is consistent with the \n     landmark Quill decision by the Supreme Court, which we \n     support.\n       The laudable goal behind Internet tax moratorium \n     legislation is to create a no-new-taxes moratorium for the \n     Internet. It would be ironic, to say the least, if Congress \n     added a provision to this legislation that even raises the \n     possibility for businesses, many of them quite small, to \n     become tax collectors for the government.\n       Americans now pay more in taxes than they do for food, \n     clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. The members \n     of our organizations, like all Americans, already pay enough \n     taxes. Some of our members are home bound, or otherwise lack \n     the ability to visit retail stores. They like to shop at \n     home. We strongly urge you not to add the out-of-state sales \n     tax issue to Internet moratorium legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Taxpayers Union; 60 Plus Association; American \n           Conservative Union;\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n           American Council of the Blind; American Legislative \n           Exchange Council; Americans for Hope, Growth and \n           Opportunity; Americans for Tax Reform; Association of \n           Concerned Taxpayers; Christian Coalition; Citizens for \n           a Sound Economy; Coalitions for America; Council for \n           Affordable Health Insurance; Council for Citizens \n           Against Government Waste; Empower America; Food \n           Distributors International; Independent Insurance \n           Agents of America.\n         Bill Price, Independent Living for the Handicapped; \n           National Association for Home Care; National \n           Association of Manufacturers; National Association of \n           People with AIDs; National Association of Wholesaler-\n           Distributors; National Federation of Nonprofits; \n           National Grange; National Tax Limitation Committee; \n           Seniors Coalition; Small Business Survival Committee; \n           United Seniors Association; Vietnam Veterans of \n           America; Women for Tax Reform.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in an effort to conclude this bill in a \ntimely fashion, and with appropriations bills and other important \nlegislation waiting in the wings for Senate action, I sent a cloture \nmotion to the desk to S. 442, the Internet tax bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     509, S. 442, the Internet tax bill;\n         Trent Lott, John McCain, Wayne Allard, Connie Mack, \n           Gordon Smith, Paul Coverdell, Spencer Abraham, Mike \n           DeWine, Conrad Burns, James Inhofe, Judd Gregg, Rod \n           Grams, Craig Thomas, Olympia Snowe, Rick Santorum, and \n           Larry E. Craig.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the information of all Senators, this cloture vote \nwill occur on Tuesday, or if cloture is invoked on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, then this cloture \nvote will occur immediately following the adoption of the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 10. All Members will be notified as to the exact time.\n  I now ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we expect Senator Bumpers momentarily to \npropose his amendment. We would like to have a vote on that amendment \nas soon as Senator Bumpers is able to describe that amendment \nadequately. We will have a rather brief response.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan for his continued efforts to reach a \ncompromise on some of the differences we have had, as well as Senator \nGraham of Florida and Senator Gregg of New Hampshire. We are close to \nagreement on several issues. I hope we can dispatch this legislation in \nan orderly fashion without having to go to cloture. It is just not \nsomething that we enjoy doing, because it prevents people, over time, \nfrom getting the attention to their amendments that they deserve. So I \nhope we will have an agreement and not have to have a cloture vote, and \nconclude this legislation as soon as possible.\n  Again, I thank Senator Dorgan. I yield the floor knowing that the \nSenator from Oregon has some important comments. I hope all of us \nunderstand as soon as Senator Bumpers gets here we will move to his \namendment as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first let me thank the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator McCain. I introduced S. 442 in March of 1997. \nChairman McCain and his staff have worked almost nonstop with me since \nthat time to try to put together a bipartisan bill. I thank Chairman \nMcCain for all of these efforts. I share his views. We are anxious to \nget to the Bumpers amendment this morning. I have a few brief comments \nand, hopefully, we will be able to move to that expeditiously.\n  If ever there was an issue that called out for treatment as \ninterstate commerce, it is the Internet. The Internet, as we all know, \nknows no boundaries--not Federal boundaries, not State boundaries, in \neffect not even global boundaries. But what we have tried to do in our \nefforts over the last few months, and we have done it through more than \n30 separate changes, is try to be fair to all parties--the States that \nare trying to look thoughtfully at the ground rules for the new economy \nand small businesses who overwhelmingly have endorsed this legislation. \nFor the small businesses, the Internet is a chance to compete with the \nWal-Marts and other big guys because geography becomes irrelevant. So, \nsmall businesses have supported it. I think that is why we have \nfashioned a bill with so much bipartisan support.\n  The essence of this bill is that in the 21st century the new digital \neconomy should be built on the principle of technological neutrality. \nThe Internet should get no preference, nor should the Internet be the \ntarget of selective discrimination. Unfortunately, around the country \nwe have seen instances, for example, where if you purchase a newspaper \nthe traditional way, what is called snail mail, it is sent to you in \nyour home and you pay no tax. But if you subscribe to the same \nnewspaper via the Internet, you pay a hefty tax as a result.\n  Depending on what State you are in, electronic commerce may be taxed \nas a telecommunications service, computer service, information service, \nor some combination, and there are different rates around the country. \nMy concern has long been that if a significant number of the 30,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions in America all decide to take a bite out of the \nInternet, or if we have 50 States going at it individually, the \nInternet is going to look like Dodge City before the marshals showed \nup.\n  Chairman McCain was very right, that Internet growth is going to be \nenormous. There is a fair amount of Internet commerce going on today, \nbut it is going to grow dramatically in the years ahead. That is why in \nour legislation we seek to come up with some ground rules for the new \neconomy, and to do it before we have to react to critical problems.\n  I submit the greatest beneficiaries of this legislation are not the \naffluent and the powerful. The affluent and the powerful have lots of \ntax lawyers and specialists who, if they run up against a crazy quilt \nof taxes on the Internet, they are not going to have any problem using \nall of their legions of tax specialists to deal with that kind of \nsituation. The people who are really going to benefit from this \nlegislation are folks like home-based businesses, one of the fastest \ngrowing sectors of our economy. My home State of Oregon has more than \n100,000 home-based businesses, and in meeting with them, many of them \nhave said that electronic commerce is the key to their survival.\n\n  For rural communities and at-home parents and disabled individuals, \nthe online world is a gateway to economic opportunity. If somebody in a \nrural community has a home-based business, for example, selling fruit \nor jam or something of this nature, I cannot believe that there is a \nsingle Member of the U.S. Senate who would want to subject that kind of \nperson to a score of different taxes. I don't think there is a Senator \nwho would want to do that. That is why we have this legislation before \nthe Senate today, to come up with a set of ground rules.\n  Mr. President, here is the kind of example we are going to be talking \nabout: If the present Senator in the chair wants to send a gift basket \nfrom Harry and David's in Medford, OR, to his cousin, say, in Florida, \npaying for it with a bank card in New York, using America Online in \nVirginia, how many jurisdictions would have the opportunity to impose a \ntax on that kind of transaction?\n  There really are no ground rules for that sort of thing today, and if \nthere were to be a hodgepodge of large, new taxes on electronic \ncommerce, it would be especially punitive on those folks in rural \nStates, like Colorado and Oregon. That is one of the reasons that I and \nSenator McCain and others who have worked on this legislation have \nsought to bring this to the floor expeditiously.\n  I would like to take a minute to explain exactly what is in the bill \nand what is before the Senate.\n  First, the legislation is not going to preempt existing State and \nlocal taxes as long as they are technologically neutral. What that \nmeans is, if the authority is there for someone to pay a 5-percent \nsales tax when they buy a sweater in a particular jurisdiction, under \nthe Internet tax freedom proposal, they will pay exactly the same\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nkind of tax if they order it on the Internet.\n  States that impose and enforce taxes on Internet access in place \ntoday are going to be able to keep them. None of the States that tax \nInternet access today actually has a law on the books that expressly \nauthorizes the taxation of Internet access, but as we heard in the \nhearings before the Commerce Committee, there are a variety of problems \nalready cropping up as a result of administrative rulings and \nreinterpretations of existing law.\n  In fact, there is one major firm, Vertex, which has tried to sort \nthrough the status at the State level of how the Internet is being \ntaxed. In a number of States, they basically said that they couldn't \ngive a clear answer, but if anybody was interested in doing a business \ndeal, a deal involving electronic commerce that touched on that \nparticular State, they would be wise to get a consultation.\n  The legislation will not allow any State to attempt to impose or \nassess or attempt to collect a tax on Internet access after October 1, \n1998, unless it already had done that with a tax in effect.\n  It is very clear that we are trying to be sensitive to the laws in \nplace and the concerns of the States, but at the same time making sure \nthat there is not going to be an opportunity for discriminatory taxes \non electronic commerce.\n  In effect, what this legislation does is it ensures a timeout so that \nthe commission of experts called for in the legislation can study these \ncomplicated questions and make sound policy recommendations to the \nCongress. But during that time, we take steps that we believe will be \ncritically important to the development of electronic commerce as it \nrelates to the smallest concerns in America. For example, the \nlegislation assures that a web site is treated exactly like a mail-\norder catalog for purposes of interstate sales, so the taxing \njurisdiction cannot attempt to impose a tax on a web site with respect \nto an out-of-State computer server.\n  The fact is, the online world is racing past outdated policies. The \nground rules that we seek to establish here are just the beginning of \nwhat I think is going to be needed for the digital economy.\n  We have begun to debate in the Commerce Committee a variety of other \nissues. Yesterday, an important bill of Senator Bryan's was passed \ndealing with online privacy concerns as they relate to children. We may \nhear more about that before the end of the session, but I think that \nwith this legislation we will begin to get the common definitions, the \nmore clearly defined principles and standards, that are going to be \nessential for Internet commerce to go forward.\n  Recently, I was home and met with some small businesses, and one of \nthem said that he was very excited about the work that we were doing on \nthis legislation. He said: ``Just understand that I am not going to be \nable to grow my Internet business if there are 30,000 taxing \njurisdictions all with their hands in our pocket.''\n  The American taxpayers made it clear of late how they regard the IRS. \nIf we were to have thousands of small jurisdictions collecting Internet \ntaxes, I think that the concern we would have with respect to the IRS \nwould be multiplied many times over at the thought of thousands of \nmini-IRS-taxing authorities collecting Internet taxes.\n  I see that Senator Bumpers has arrived. I want to say, as Senator \nBumpers comes to the floor and prepares his amendment, that I have \nagreed with him on a great many concerns over the years. I have agreed \nwith Senator Bumpers about Social Security and the many times that he \nhas led this body to take on spending boondoggles, environmental \nconcerns, and the like. We don't happen to agree on this issue. I think \nit would be a mistake to let each State have its own sales tax \narrangement for the Internet. It would certainly jack up taxes \ndramatically on the 100,000 home-based businesses in my State and the \nthousands of others across the country. I do think that if we have the \nStates going off in their own directions, we do run the real risk of \nhaving the Internet look like Dodge City before the marshals showed up.\n  I will conclude by way of saying that Senator Bumpers has worked very \nclosely with this Senator, knowing that it is particularly important to \nme. We have gotten agreement on a number of key questions, and that was \ncritical to getting the legislation to the floor.\n  I want the Senator to know that he is going to be somebody whom this \nSenator will miss very, very much next year when I cannot look over and \nsee Senator Bumpers and get his counsel on everything from Social \nSecurity to spending boondoggles. I thank him, because he has been \naware that this legislation has been a priority of mine. I know he has \nstrong feelings about it, and he was gracious enough to let it come \nforward and let us get these matters resolved. I express my \nappreciation to Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not made an opening statement on \nthis piece of legislation. I will do that at some future point. I want \nto allow the Senator from Arkansas to proceed with his amendment. I \nwill, at some more convenient time, make an opening statement.\n  I have some very strong thoughts about a whole range of issues, \nincluding the issue that is going to be raised by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  But I think in an attempt to try to move this along--we want to get \nto a first vote on this at some point--I will ask the Senator from \nArkansas to proceed and then at some point in the proceeding I will \nmake an opening statement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3677\n\n(Purpose: To authorize collection of certain State and local taxes with \n respect to the sale, delivery, and use of tangible personal property)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 3677.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, let me thank my very good friend, \nmy distinguished colleague from the great State of Oregon, Mr. Wyden, \nfor his very kind and gracious comments. He talked about how he is \ngoing to miss me. Rest assured, wherever I am, if he will just raise \nthe window, he can probably hear me.\n  But on a more serious note, I consider Senator Wyden to be one of the \nfinest additions to the U.S. Senate in my 24-year tenure here. He is \ntruly becoming a great Senator, but more than anything else he has \ngreat values. Great values are the first thing you have to have to be a \ngood Senator. So while I am prepared to leave at the end of this year, \nSenator Wyden is one of the Senators I will certainly miss.\n  Let me just start off by saying, this amendment deals with the rights \nof States to require mail-order catalog houses to collect sales taxes \non merchandise shipped into their States.\n  L.L. Bean, which does over $1 billion a year, ships a lot of \nmerchandise into my State of Arkansas, as does Lands' End, as does \n6,000 or 7,000 other mail-order catalog houses; and they do not pay one \ncent of tax to the State of Arkansas. They do not pay one cent of tax \nto any State. And I will tell you why.\n  In 1967, the Supreme Court said, in the National Bellas Hess v. \nDepartment of Revenue case, that States may not require mail-order \ncatalog houses to collect use taxes for them because it violates the \ndue process clause in the Constitution, No. 1, and, No. 2, it violates \nthe interstate commerce clause of the Constitution--finis, end of \nstory.\n  In 1992, as mail-order catalogs sales began to mushroom in this \ncountry, and States could see that their tax base was being eroded--\nincidentally, we depend on the sales tax in our State for 50 percent of \nour educational funds--being eroded by this constant stream of catalogs \ncoming into people's homes every day through the mailbox--I have been \nchecking; I have been averaging between 5 and 10 a day\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\nfor the past year--North Dakota said, ``Enough is enough.'' So they \nbrought a lawsuit that resulted in the Quill decision in 1992.\n  They tried to get the Supreme Court to reverse the Bellas Hess \ndecision that prohibited States from making mail-order houses collect \nsales tax. It is called a use tax. It is the same thing, but if it \ncomes from out of State we call it a use tax. And the Supreme Court, in \na very rare remarkable case of sanity, said, ``We hereby reverse the \nNational Bellas Hess case to the extent that we hold that the \nrequirement of a State to make mail-order houses collect sales taxes on \ngoods coming into their States no longer--no longer--violates the due \nprocess clause. However, we are not removing our objection to the fact \nthat we believe the State's right to tax mail-order houses still is a \nviolation of the interstate commerce clause.'' Now because the Commerce \nClause grants Congress exclusive authority over interstate commerce, \nCongress may, if it chooses, grant the states the authority to require \nout-of-state tax collection.\n  So here we are on October 2, 1998, about my sixth year to try to do \nsomething about this patently unfair proposition, asking Congress, \nplease, do not impose a tax. My amendment does not impose a tax on \nanybody; it does not require the States to impose a tax on anybody. It \nsimply does what the Supreme Court said in 1992 we had a right to do, \nand that is to give the States the right to require out-of-state \nsellers to collect sales tax on any goods they ship into that State. \nAnd what is wrong with that?\n  You know, in 1995, I offered this amendment to the unfunded mandates \nbill, stood right here where I am standing now, made the same speech I \nam making today. You remember the distinguished Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Kempthorne, offered the unfunded mandates bill. I never saw as \nmany tears shed in the U.S. Senate in my life as I saw during that \ndebate--crocodile tears, of course--for those poor States and counties \nand municipalities that the Government was always imposing mandates on. \nWe passed laws, and we said to the States and the counties and the \ncities, ``You have got to do this; you must do that.'' And it was \ncosting the States ``gazillions.'' They said, ``Let's get that old, \nmean Federal Government off the backs of the States and local \ngovernments. And in the future, any time Congress passes a law that \nmandates that the States and local governments do anything, we will \nmake a computation of what it is going to cost the States to comply \nwith it, and we will send them the money.'' I did not vote for that. I \ndid not vote for it for a lot of reasons. I am not here to debate that \none all over again. That is a done deal.\n  But the interesting thing is, when I offered this amendment on the \nunfunded mandates bill, I said, ``Here is a mandate that you're \nimposing on the States by doing nothing. If you're so concerned about \nthe States and local governments, why don't you help them with the \nbiggest unfunded mandate of all?'' It is about $4 billion a year we \nimpose on the States by saying, you cannot collect taxes on anybody but \nthe poor old sucker on Main Street who collects the tax on every sale, \nevery bag of groceries, every refrigerator, every automobile, if he \nhappens to live in your hometown or your State.\n  Yes, I was a Main Street merchant as well as a jackleg lawyer. I had \na hardware, furniture and appliance store. And the catalog houses were \nmy biggest competitors, not the guy down the street--the catalog sales. \nI was President of the Chamber of Commerce.\n  I arranged for the annual banquet. I was in charge of the Christmas \nparade. I was on the school board. I did all of those things to make my \ntown a decent place to raise my children. And I made everybody who \nbought a dollar's worth of goods pay 3, 4 or 5 cents in sales taxes. It \nwent to teachers' salaries. It went to law enforcement, police \nofficers, and to sweep the streets. It went to test the purity of the \nwater we drank. That is what we depended on, the sales tax. But only, \nof course, if you happen to live there.\n  Now, think about the fact that mail-order houses in this country are \nselling over $100 billion worth of goods through the mail. There are a \nfew who collect this tax. Do you know why? Because they know it is \nright. Ask Senator Bennett from Utah, a big stockholder and one of the \noriginal finders of a big mail-order house called Franklin Quest about \ncollecting use taxes. Don't take my word for it. Ask Senator Bennett \nwhat they did. I will tell you and let him ratify it. They sat around \nthe table and said, ``Shall we or shall we not collect sales taxes for \nthe States in which we sell merchandise?'' He said they discussed it \nand they concluded that, as good citizens, they should. And they did. I \nsaid, ``Bob, when I was chairing the Small Business Committee and held \nhearings on this subject, they always talked about how complicated and \ndifficult it was because there are 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in this \ncountry.'' He said, ``Don't be fooled by that. Every month we push a \ncomputer button and it is done. It isn't complicated at all.''\n  Now, 7 or 8 years ago when I started this, that was the principal \ndebate--``It is so complicated. It is just so much paperwork, we can't \ndo it.'' You rarely hear that argument anymore, since Senator Bennett \ncame and since I have enlightened this body about what he said. He is \nimmensely respected here.\n  The NFIB--I don't know where they are now--in 1995, they said only \nabout 35 percent of their people wanted Congress to take this action. I \nwas getting ready to say something unkind, but I won't pursue that any \nfurther.\n  I simply want to say to my colleagues, where do you think this \ncountry is headed? The underlying bill is to give all sales on the \nInternet a free ride. The bill before the Senate is a 2-year \nmoratorium. There will be amendments offered here to extend the \nmoratorium to 3 or 5 years.\n  Listen to this, colleagues, because as I say, I am not lambasting \nSenator Wyden's bill on Internet taxes. I am simply fortifying the \nargument I want to make on remote sales. That is, right now in 1997 \nInternet sales were roughly $8 billion. It is now estimated that by the \nyear 2002 Internet sales will be $300 billion. You can buy an \nautomobile on the Internet, no sales tax; you can buy a refrigerator; \nyou can buy your furniture; you can buy anything you want on the \nInternet.\n  Now, if we are looking at Internet sales of $300 billion a year by \nthe year 2002, what will they be at the end of 5 years and how much \nrevenue will the States have lost? I ask my colleagues, why in the name \nof God will you go back home and tell the chamber of commerce your \nheart is in the right place, you are for small business, you are for \nMain Street merchants, and turn right around and put them at a \nhopeless, competitive disadvantage? Why? Why should I organize the \nChristmas parade, pay my taxes to go to the schools, taxes for law \nenforcement, the fire department, while other people ship 4 million \ntons of catalogs into the States for them to dispose of?\n  Ask any mayor, any Governor, what is their biggest headache? Almost \ninvariably, it will come back, ``We need more money.'' Secondly, ``Our \nbiggest headache is the landfill.'' Not only do states have to dispose \nof 4 million tons of catalogs, they also have to handle the boxes and \nthe crates that the merchandise comes in. How can the catalog people \ntell us, ``We don't cause a burden. We are no burden to the local \njurisdictions. Why do you want to tax us? We don't send our children to \nschool in Charleston, AR. Why should we pay sales taxes?''\n  I will tell you precisely why they should. Because the revenue base \nof the States and local jurisdictions of this country is being eroded \nto the point where it will wind up being about half of what it is right \nnow or less. Let me ask you a better question: Why shouldn't they pay a \nsales tax and compete with the people who live in those communities \nthat have to pay taxes? It is a mystery to me.\n  I don't take on these causes that I continue to lose for the fun of \nit. I take them on because I feel strongly about them. In 1995, the \nSenator from Maine, Mr. Cohen--who is now Secretary of Defense--and I \ngot into a debate here. They said the Finance Committee had not even \nheld a hearing. Of course, the Finance Committee hadn't held a hearing, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee doesn't favor this bill.\n  Do you know something else? Somebody else said, let's study this. \nThat is always the way out, ``Let's study it.'' For 7 years on the \nmining laws, they\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\nsaid we need to study this. We have been studying the mining laws since \n1872, and the law is still fully intact, just as crass, just as base, \njust as unfair now as it was in 1872, and we are still studying it.\n  We will study this some more. Somebody will make the suggestion, ``We \nhave to study this. We don't know what the full impact of it is.''\n  Let me shift gears a moment to another item, and this is always \nshocking to anybody you tell it to. Unhappily, most things said on the \nU.S. Senate floor don't get any higher than the dome here. Nobody hears \nit. Forty-five States in this country have a use tax. Arkansas has one. \nIt says to L.L. Bean, if you ship merchandise into Arkansas, the person \nyou sell it to is liable for the Arkansas use tax. It is the same thing \nas a sales tax. In my State, it is 5 percent.\n\n  How many people in Arkansas do you think realize that when they buy \nsomething from a remote seller, they are responsible for that use tax? \nMaybe about 1 in 200,000. Nobody knows it. Yet, 45 States have it. Just \n10 to 15 States--I forget which number--but it was 10 in 1995; so it is \nmaybe 15 or 20 by now--have laws that say you must report on your State \nincome tax whether or not you bought anything from out of State.\n  Now, the State of Maine does something that is really unique and, in \nmy opinion, patently unconstitutional. If you live in Maine, when you \nfill out your income tax return, there is a line that says, ``Did you \nbuy anything from out of State?'' You put in ``yes'' or ``no,'' and if \nthe answer is yes, you put the amount down.\n  Let's assume you bought some furniture for $1,000. I don't know what \nthe sales tax is in Maine, but if it is 5 percent, you are liable for \n$50. ``Please multiply 5 percent times the amount you bought.'' And so \neverybody kind of routinely ignores that because they don't want to pay \nit and they don't have to admit that they bought anything from out of \nState.\n  So do you know what else Maine does? They say that if this line is \nempty and you don't report having bought anything out of State from a \nmail-order house, please multiply .0366 times whatever your income is. \nIf you make $30,000 a year, you put $11 on that line.\n  As I say, in my opinion, that is powerfully unconstitutionally. That \nis a tax that nobody ought to have to pay, and it is the wrong way to \ndo it. A lot of people get rude awakenings. One couple from Florida \nwent up to North Carolina because they saw this big catalog saying, \n``Buy your furniture at the factory in North Carolina and pay no sales \ntax.'' Not many people do this anymore. When I started in on this issue \nyears ago, it was very common. Or, ``Buy your tile or your linoleum for \nyour kitchen from''--such-and-such--``no sales tax.''\n  So this couple went from Florida to North Carolina and bought $25,000 \nto $35,000 worth of furniture. Later on, the North Carolina furniture \ncompany is audited and they find that they have sold this couple in \nFlorida, as well as couples in a lot of other places, $25,000 worth of \nfurniture. They notify Florida, and Florida calls these people up and \nsay, ``You owe us $1,000,'' or whatever it is. Now, that is a rude \nawakening, isn't it? You thought you bought something that was tax free \nand you find out, to your regret, that you didn't.\n  Well, Mr. President, I have just been handed a note that the majority \nleader wants to have a vote. Frankly, I don't like being interrupted in \nthe middle of a debate. It is nothing but a bed check vote. But the \nmajority leader apparently wants the floor by 10:30 and they want me to \nyield the floor. I got a note that I was going to yield so that Senator \nLeahy and somebody else could talk about a judicial nomination. I don't \nsee Senator Leahy here. I don't see Senator Hatch here. Neither one of \nthem is half as entertaining as I am either.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11305-7", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 20 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask \nconsent that following the debate the Senate proceed immediately to a \nvote on the confirmation of the nomination. I finally ask consent that \nfollowing that vote the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is \ndelayed in a committee of conference, but I understand that he has no \nobjection to this side beginning on this nomination. I also notify \ncolleagues that if we reach a point where neither side has further \nmembers wishing to speak on the nomination, it is going to be the \nintention of the managers to yield back whatever time we have. I \nmention that so that people understand that it is possible that this \nrollcall may occur sooner than 20 minutes from now.\n  Mr. President, at long last, this day has finally arrived. Senate \nconfirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor has been stalled for 7 long \nmonths without any explanation or justification. I have spoken on \nbehalf of this outstanding nominee more than a dozen times. In fact, \nthe most recent time was Monday of this week. I hope that now those who \nhave had the secret hold on this nomination will come forth and claim \n``credit'' for preventing this qualified nominee from helping end the \nemergency that has confronted the Second Circuit since March. \nThroughout all the time that there have been secret holds that have \nkept her nomination from going forward, she has been denied her \nrightful seniority on the court as others have gone forward. It has not \nbeen the Senate's finest hour.\n  I recall the glowing statement of support from Senator Moynihan to \nthe Judiciary Committee at her hearing back in September 1997, a year \nago. I appreciate, as well, the strong statement Senator Moynihan made \nto the Senate on behalf of this outstanding nominee this summer when \nher nomination was being stalled. I very much appreciate the efforts he \nhas made on behalf of this outstanding nominee. He has been persistent \nin his support and in seeking to bring this nomination to the floor \nwithout delay. As members of the minority party, that has been a very, \nvery difficult task.\n  Along with a number of Senators, I wrote to the majority leader on \nApril 9, 1998, urging ``prompt and favorable action on the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor.'' We noted then the judicial emergency that \nhad to be declared by Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit. Since \nMarch 23, he has had to cancel hearings and proceed with three-judge \nappellate panels that contain only one Second Circuit judge. That \ncrisis is continuing.\n\n  What is happening is when they have these three-judge panels, only \none of the judges is from the Second Circuit. They have to bring judges \nfrom elsewhere, or retired judges to hear cases. Judge Sonia \nSotomayor's nomination has taken over 15 months in spite of\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\nthe emergency that plagues the Second Circuit.\n\n  We have seen the strong support for this nominee from the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus and from the Puerto Rican Bar \nAssociation, the Hispanic National Bar Association, and many other bar \nassociations around the country. We have received literally thousands \nof letters of support for this nominee.\n  Late this summer, a column in the Wall Street Journal noted that \nJudge Sotomayor was being held up on the Republican side of the aisle \nbecause of speculation that she might one day be considered by \nPresident Clinton for nomination to the United States Supreme Court. \nThis was confirmed by a report in the New York Times on June 14.\n  As I said earlier, this has not been the Senate's finest hour.\n  How disturbing and how shameful: trying to disqualify an outstanding \nHispanic woman judge by an anonymous hold. Here is a highly-qualified \nHispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the \ncrisis in the Second Circuit more than seven months ago.\n  How petty, how mean, how wrong to cost this judge the seniority she \nshould have had on the Second Circuit by someone anonymously holding \nher up on the other side of the aisle.\n  I note very clearly for the Record that every time the question of \nher nomination came forth, it has been made clear that every single \nDemocrat said they were prepared to go forward with her nomination. \nEvery single Democrat said they would vote for her.\n  When she is confirmed as I fully expect she will be, she will be only \nthe second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on \nthe Second Circuit. Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to Puerto \nRican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a highly qualified nominee who was confirmed to \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York \nin 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She rose from a \nhousing project in the Bronx to attend Princeton University and Yale \nLaw School. She worked for over four years in the New York District \nAttorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private \npractice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York.\n  She has been a fine District Court Judge. It was Judge Sotomayor who \nissued a key decision in 1995 that brought an end to the work stoppage \nin major league baseball. She applies the law. In this, as in her other \ndecisions, Judge Sotomayor followed the law. That is what judges are \nsupposed to do. There is no basis for a charge that she is or will be a \njudicial activist.\n  In his annual report on the judiciary this year on new Year's Day, \nthe Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: ``Some \ncurrent nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. * * * ``The Senate is \nsurely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after \nthe necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him \ndown.''\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and \n105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. When those nominees \nare women or members of racial or ethnic minorities, this is especially \ndisturbing.\n  Today, after holding this nomination for seven months on the Senate \ncalendar, the Senate will finally get a chance to vote on the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. I look \nforward to our taking action to confirm this outstanding nominee.\n  Mr. President, obviously I am not going to put this in the Record. \nBut I would just note that this two-foot stack of papers contains some \nof the letters from distinguished lawyers and distinguished bar \nassociations from all over this country--from prosecutors and defense \nattorneys alike; from people who do appellate work and those who do \nnot; from every spectrum of the bar. These are all letters from people \nwho support the nomination of Judge Sotomayor. These are people who can \nnow finally get a response, a response indicating that this superb \ncandidate is finally being considered by the Senate, that the anonymous \nholds are no longer being allowed to restrain her nomination, and that \nthe Senate finally walked out into the daylight to vote. I have every \nconfidence that vote will be a favorable one and that she will finally \nbe confirmed--even though she was unjustly denied the seniority she \nwould have gotten had the confirmation gone forward on schedule.\n  Mr. President, I understand there is no one else seeking to speak on \neither side. And I have been told by the Republican side that I have \npermission to yield back their time. I yield their time. I yield our \ntime. We are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor \nof New York to be the United State Circuit Judge for the Second \nCircuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3677\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues of a very \nsimple fact. Don't vote against this amendment because you want to go \nhome and tell your constituents that it imposes a new tax. It does not. \nFor all of you people, when we talked about unfunded mandates, who \ntalked endlessly about States rights, this is a classic States rights \nissue. If you vote against my amendment, you are saying to the States: \nWe don't trust you; we are not going to let you collect new taxes on \nremote sales; we are going to stand by while your tax base is eroded, \nwhile you try to raise property taxes in order to pay for schools, but \nwe simply cannot trust you and, therefore, we are not going to give you \nthe authority.\n\n  I am telling you--I do not know how I can say it more dramatically, \nmore graphically--as a former Main Street merchant, I can tell you it \nis patently unfair to make the people of my State and your States make \nMain Street merchants collect sales tax on every single dime they take \nin, but if you want to move just across the State line and ship it back \ninto the State, you can do it and not charge any sales tax.\n  I had a cousin who bought a fur coat in New York. The clerk said, \n``You sound like you're southern.'' She said, ``I am. I'm from Little \nRock.'' The clerk said, ``Why don't you let us mail this coat to you? \nThat way you won't have to pay this $100 or $300''--whatever it was--\n``in sales tax.'' She said, ``Fine. Just mail it to me.'' That is the \nkind of thing that is going on, and it is going to continue to go on.\n  On your desk, in about 10 minutes, you will find the list of people \nin this country who strongly favor the Bumpers amendment. You know who \nthey are? They are the Governors; they are the mayors; they are the \ncity councils; they are a whole host of Main Street merchant \norganizations. Look at it before you vote, and figure out what you are \ngoing to say to them the next time you address their organizations on \nwhy you didn't vote for this amendment. Tell the Governors why their \ntax base is being eroded.\n  Mr. President, we exempt in this bill--listen carefully--we exempt \nevery mail-order house in the United States that does less than $3 \nmillion a year. That exempts about 89% of the mail-order companies in \nthe United States. My amendment would make the States put in a 1-800 \nnumber so any mail-order house that is confused can call the State and \nfind out what that State's rule is. We have a blended rate so that the \nmail-order house only has to collect one rate and the States will \ndistribute it between the cities and the counties. We have done \neverything in the world to make this as easy as possible for everybody.\n  Mr. President, here is an article from the New York Times this \nmorning. There is a copy of the article on every member's desk. This \narticle make all the arguments that I have made here this morning.\n  Let me tell you one other argument they make that I have not made, \nand that is that people who buy on the Internet are the wealthiest \npeople in the country. They are the ones who are doing most of the \nbuying, because they have Internet access. So if I am a wealthy person, \nI have a computer in my home, and I am on-line, this sales tax loophole \nfavors me. The guy making $6 to $10 an hour does not have a computer in \nhis house. He does not know what is available on the Internet. It is \nanother way of discriminating against those who have the least.\n  Mr. President, I am really sorry that we are in such a rush. I know a \nlot of people want to catch planes, and I am sympathetic to that. I \nhave been in that situation myself. But I want to say, No. 1, please \nread the New York Times article; please look at the list of people that \nwill be on your desk in about 5 minutes who support this amendment; \nand, finally, if you are going to vote against this amendment, please \nfigure out what you are going to say to the mayors and the Governors \nwho have the responsibility of keeping the schools open, who have the \nresponsibility of funding the fire departments, who have the \nresponsibility of funding the police departments, keeping the streets \nclean, keeping the landfills in compliance with EPA rules, and all the \nother things that cost ``gazillions'' of dollars across the country. \nAsk them why they are not allowed to collect a little tax to at least \nhelp pay the landfill for covering up 4 million tons of catalogs a \nyear, if nothing else.\n  So, Mr. President, I know everybody is in a hurry. And I guess I have \nsaid about all I need to say. I see Senator Dorgan on the floor who \nwants to speak and who has time allocated. So, Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, in just the 10 minutes that I am \nallotted, make a comment about the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers \nand also to comment about the underlying bill.\n  Senator Bumpers offers an amendment that I think is very important \nand one that I intend to vote for and feel is a good amendment. The \nbill brought to the floor of the Senate, in its original form when it \nwas passed out of the Commerce Committee, was totally unacceptable to \nme. I voted against it, worked against it, and felt\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nits provisions were counterproductive. But since that time, the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, Senator McCain, I, and others, have worked \ntogether; and the bill that will now be presented--I believe changed \nalso by the managers' amendment--is a piece of legislation that has \nmerit. But I think the legislation will be improved by the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas as well.\n  This legislation is called the Internet Tax Freedom Act. And all of \nus understand that the information superhighway and new technology mean \nthat commerce in this country is changing. Nowadays, if you want to buy \na book, you can walk down to a bookstore someplace and buy a book. You \nmight be able to look in a mail-order catalog and buy a book, or you \nmight be able to go to your computer and buy a book. In either of those \ncases, you are a consumer purchasing a book.\n  You can do the same with a saddle, if you happen to ride horses. You \ncan do the same with a car. For that matter, you can do the same with \nvirtually all merchandise these days. And the Internet, used for \ncommerce purposes, is exploding all around us.\n  The question is: When people are accessing the Internet or, for that \nmatter, a mail-order catalog, or going downtown to make the purchase at \na local business, what are the tax consequences? What kind of taxes do \nthey pay? To whom do they pay those taxes? These are important issues.\n  I am not someone who believes we ought to impede the use of the \nInternet in any way with punitive taxes. I believe that if there are \npunitive or discriminatory taxes that would impede the ability of the \nInternet to serve this country's commerce interests, then let's stop \nthat, let's prevent the States from doing that. I have always said to \nthe Senator from Oregon, who has been a leader on this issue, you and I \ndo not disagree on that score. If there are taxes imposed that are \npunitive, then I say, stop it. But the other question that is raised by \nthe Senator from Arkansas is a very important question.\n  Someone decides to start a store on the main street of Fargo, ND, or \nLittle Rock, AR, and they decide to open for business. They rent a \nplace, buy a sign and put it out front. They hire some people to work \nin the place, get some inventory in, and then they open the door. And \nthey are proud; they have some flowers around for their grand opening. \nThere they are; they are in business. Then someone walks down the \nstreet, sees their picture window, goes on in, and buys a product.\n  When that person buys that product, in Little Rock or in Fargo, ND, \nthat person is going to pay the local retail taxes that are imposed by \nthat State. That is the way it works. That is the way it always works.\n  Then we see an increase in mail-order sales. What happens with mail-\norder sales is that someone sends a catalog into the home. The person \nsitting in a home orders the same products, does not go down to a store \nto order but just orders it through the mail, and gets those products \nsold without a sales tax attached. If that State has a 6-percent sales \ntax, it means that catalog seller has about a 6-percent advantage over \nthe person who has hired the employees, rented the building, and holds \nhimself open for business on Main Street.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is correct--and I think not many people \nknow this--when the person orders from the mail-order catalog and gets \nthe merchandise, that individual has a responsibility--in almost all \nthe States--to pay a use tax. Most people will never do that because \nthey do not know that requirement exists, don't have the forms to \ncomply in any event, and would not want to fill out a set of forms for \n86 cents or $1.86. So the fact is, it does not happen.\n  Now, add to mail-order catalog sales the question of Internet sales. \nAnd what are the tax consequences there? What will be the impact on the \nMain Street businessperson who is competing with that Internet seller, \ncompeting with the mail-order seller? What will be the impact on that \nMain Street merchant? That is the question that is raised by the \nSenator from Arkansas. It is a very legitimate question.\n\n  I come from the Jeffersonian wing of my political party. The \nJeffersonian wing believes, as Thomas Jefferson did, that this country \nis made strong by broad-based economic ownership. A lot of men and \nwomen across this country are in the market system, opening up for \nbusiness, with a network of small businesses doing business all across \nAmerica. We ought to be mindful of how those folks on Main Street that \nare risking all their savings to open their businesses are treated with \nthe tax system. If you are a real person that has a business on Main \nStreet you are treated one way for tax purposes, but if you have a \ncatalog firm or Internet selling operation you are treated a different \nway.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act, at its roots now, as it has been \nchanged, is an attempt to say we don't want anybody to see this \nInternet system as some huge peach out there that they can take a big \nbite out of for tax purposes in a way that is punitive and impedes or \nretards the growth of Internet. I agree with that.\n  But the Senator from Arkansas raises another question: Do we want the \nInternet and/or mail-order sellers to have an advantage over the folks \nwho open their businesses on Main Street with respect to the imposition \nof State and local taxes? The answer to that ought to be no. This ought \nto be tax neutral. The whole system ought to be tax neutral. No matter \nhow you are selling your product, you ought not be in a circumstance \nwhere you are selling it at an advantage over the person that hired the \npeople, found the location and is open for business on Main Street. \nThat is the point the Senator from Arkansas is making.\n  This is not a new issue, incidentally, for mail-order catalogs, but \nit certainly is a new issue with respect to the Internet.\n  I guess it was probably 7 years ago when I was in the other body \nserving on the Ways and Means Committee, probably 8 years ago, and got \na bill through the subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee to do \njust exactly what the Senator from Arkansas is proposing. It was very \ncontroversial. It never got beyond the subcommittee. I got the \nsubcommittee to vote it out. But then our committee got millions of \npost cards from across the mail-order spectrum saying that the attempt \nhere was to increase taxes. That is not true at all. The Senator from \nArkansas doesn't propose, and I would never propose, we increase taxes \non transactions. That is not the case. There is no proposal here that \nwould increase anybody's tax.\n  The question here is: How do you treat different kinds of commerce in \na way that is fair with respect to the imposition of State and local \ntaxes? Some say let's treat it in this way: Have the Federal Government \nset itself up as the referee and create moratoriums and prohibitions \nand all kinds of mandates with respect to the State and local \ngovernments. I don't happen to favor that. I don't think that is the \nright approach.\n  Others say let us find a way to be helpful to the State and local \ngovernments to do what is necessary to even this out so we don't have \ndiscriminatory taxes imposed on one kind of seller versus another kind \nof seller. That is what I think is addressed by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  I do want to mention with respect to the larger bill that is before \nthe Senate, this is very important. If this is done in a way that is \ninappropriate, in a way that we really don't understand, in a way that \nchanges words sufficient so that we have a blizzard of litigation in \nall the State courts all across the country or in a way that creates \nsafe harbors for certain kinds of people doing certain kinds of \nbusiness or punitive tax treatment because competitors are not faced \nwith the same consequences, then we will have done a disservice.\n  The moratorium that is described in the legislation is a moratorium \nthat I think is appropriate. It says let's take a time out for a few \nyears. We will take a time out and we will evaluate where we are. We \nwill grandfather the States that have certain kinds of taxes, but we \nwon't impose different taxes until we understand what we are doing \nhere. I agree with that.\n  The New York Times in their editorial this morning says the Senate, \nwhich debates this bill today, should resist extending the moratorium \nto 5 years. I agree with that, as well. We will have Members come to \nthe floor and say, ``Gee, the moratorium is a\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\ngreat idea. Let's slap a moratorium on the States.''\n  I support a thoughtful, sensible moratorium to give time regarding \nwhat is happening here, but a 5-year moratorium is far too long. Those \nwho propose that with an amendment--I am sure they will; I am told they \nwill--I hope we can defeat a 5-year moratorium. That is wholly \ninappropriate.\n  Those are the comments I want to make in support of the effort made \nby the Senator from Arkansas. He does the Senate, in my judgment, a \nreal service. As he leaves the Senate, I will miss him walking up and \ndown the aisle telling us about his home State, but I will miss him \nmost importantly for the causes he fights for and the aggressive, \nenergetic manner that he fights for these important things. Sometimes \nhe wins, sometimes he loses, but the prospect of winning and losing \ndoesn't affect the kind of things he knows in his heart are right. He \nis as aggressive as anybody in this Senate in fighting for the things \nhe finds important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas. It meets some basic \ntests. It meets the test of essential fairness.\n  We have today in this country a situation in which if Main Street \nwere divided north and south, all of the stores along the northern part \nof Main Street are meeting their obligations to collect the appropriate \nState and local tax which is levied by their locally elected officials \nwithin that State and which are used to support State and local \ngovernment. But the stores along the south side of Main Street are \ntreated differently because the south side of Main Street is in another \nState, in another jurisdiction. Therefore, the sales that are made on \nthe south side of Main Street are not subject to the requirement of \ncollection by the seller as are the stores on the north side of Main \nStreet.\n  Therefore, if you go into a clothing store on the north side of Main \nStreet and buy a suit, shirt, dress or shoes, you will pay and the \nstore will collect and remit to the State those taxes which have been \nlevied. But if you are on the south side of Main Street and you are \ncommunicating by telephone or through the post office, that seller does \nnot have that obligation to collect the tax.\n  This is fundamentally unfair. It is not only unfair to the retail \nseller on the north side of the street, it is also unfair in that it \ndeprives the community of the resources which are necessary in order to \npay for police, fire, health, and particularly educational services, \nthe most expensive service that most communities provide to their \ncitizens.\n  In his opening statement, the Senator from Oregon and my colleague \nand good friend, Senator Wyden, indicated that the fundamental issue \nhere is to treat commerce in a state of neutrality as it relates to \ntechnology. I think that very appropriately states the destination that \nwe all want to get to, that we want to treat commerce with neutrality \nas it relates to the technology with which the commerce is conducted. \nClearly, that is not the state of the law today.\n  Senator Bumpers gives us an opportunity to achieve that neutrality by \nsaying that all sellers will be responsible for the collection of State \nand local sales tax whether they are on the north or south side of Main \nStreet.\n  In addition to being an issue of fairness, it is an issue of our \nNation's future. If there is one thing that unites Americans in 1998, \nit is a recognition that our future as a nation, our future as a \ncultural leader, as a security leader, and as an economic leader \ndepends, more than any single thing, on the ability of each individual \nAmerican to be able to perform at their highest level of potential. And \nit is to our education system that we look to provide for most \nAmericans that means by which they can achieve their full ability.\n\n  We have decided here in the Congress--and it is a position which I \ngenerally support also as a member of the Jefferson wing of the \nDemocratic Party--that the best government is that government which is \nclosest to the people who are served. We have, in a number of areas, \ndevolved responsibilities to State and local governments. Those \nresponsibilities also carry with them the obligation of State and local \ngovernments to provide the resources to finance those services.\n  We have also, Mr. President, thus far, refused to provide for \nadditional partnerships where the Federal Government could enter into \nprograms to assist State and local responsibilities. One of the most \ndramatic of those has been in the area of school construction. I must \npersonally say, having stated my essential Jeffersonian position, that \nI believe it is appropriate for the Federal Government to assist local \nschool districts and States in seeing that old schools are \nrehabilitated and new schools are constructed to meet an increase in \nstudent population. This is a particular issue in my State of Florida, \nMr. President, as we are entering a state of maturity in Florida in \nwhich we have many schools that are now 40, 50, 60 years old, or more, \nand need substantial rehabilitation. We are also a State that, every \nyear, is adding some 50,000 to 60,000 new students to our public \nschools, therefore requiring new schools to be constructed in order to \nprovide the classrooms and laboratories for those additional students, \nwithout resorting to overcrowded classrooms.\n  I believe that the Federal Government has a role to play in this \narea, and it will be a role that could be played without undue \ninterference with the responsibilities of State and local officials for \nthe management of public education. I point out, however, that none of \nthose efforts to provide for expanded Federal assistance has been \naccepted--other than some items through the Tax Code--and there has \nbeen a limited benefit to a certain number of school districts. But if \nwe are not going to be providing an aggressive partnership to help \nStates meet what today is over a $200 billion unmet need for school \nrehabilitation and new school construction, at least we ought to be \nassisting the States by allowing them to have their own taxes collected \nby remote sellers.\n  According to the New York Times editorial, which was previously \nreferenced, the loophole that exists in today's law that holds that \nremote sellers are not responsible for collecting State and local sales \ntaxes results in a revenue loss of $3.5 billion today. And that number \nwill rise as more commerce is conducted from remote sales. That $3.5 \nbillion, if the States collect it, could finance a significant \nbeginning of States meeting their school construction needs.\n  So as I believe the first principle of the former profession of the \noccupant of the Chair is to ``do no harm,'' at least we ought to do no \nharm to the States by not precluding them from securing the revenue \nwhich they would have gotten had those sales been on the north side of \nMain Street because the decision was made to buy on the south side of \nMain Street from a remote seller.\n  So, Mr. President, this is not only an issue of fundamental fairness, \nit is an issue of States in this era of devolution of responsibility \nand Federal reticence to provide assistance to States carrying out \ntheir most important responsibilities, such as the education of their \nchildren. This will be a step toward our recognizing our \nresponsibilities to our brethren at the State level to be able to \nfulfill these responsibilities.\n  Now, Mr. President, as I conclude, I do so with strong support for \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. Having offered the same \namendment in the Finance Committee and having seen it defeated, and \nknowing this is not the first time that it has been debated on the \nSenate floor with the result being defeat, I am not optimistic that the \nSenate today, regrettably, will adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  We are going to have another debate on a collateral subject, Mr. \nPresident. I alert my colleagues to this. It is the debate on whether \nthe commission, which will be established in Senator Wyden's bill, \nshould have the opportunity to consider the issue of the responsibility \nof remote sellers to collect State and local sales tax. At a minimum, \nif we are not going to adopt Senator Bumpers' very wise proposal today, \nwe certainly should allow the commission to consider this on another\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\nday with even more analysis than we already have, and we will be in a \nposition to do so.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an editorial from the New York Times of October 2, 1998, \nentitled ``Fair Taxation in Cyberspace.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times Oct. 2, 1998]\n\n                      Fair Taxation in Cyberspace\n\n       The rapid growth in sales of goods over the Internet raises \n     hard questions about how states might fairly tax those \n     transactions. The same problem has existed for years in mail-\n     order sales. Consumers are technically liable for sales taxes \n     on all purchases, including out-of-state catalogue purchases, \n     but mail-order companies are required to collect sales taxes \n     only in states where they maintain a physical presence. This \n     loophole costs state and local governments about $3.5 billion \n     a year.\n       The National Governors' Association and local government \n     groups are rightly worried they will lose billions more a \n     year from Internet sales that would otherwise be taxable in a \n     traditional store. That loss--estimated to reach $10 billion \n     a year in the next decade--will have a disproportionate \n     impact on states that depend heavily on sales taxes, \n     providing a tax break mostly for the affluent who have access \n     to the Internet.\n       On-line service providers and electronic commerce lobbying \n     groups, of course, want to make cyberspace tax-free, arguing \n     that taxation would choke off Internet growth. Tax policy \n     should not discriminate against electronic sales. But neither \n     should the Internet be protected from taxes that apply in \n     other realms of commerce.\n       Congress should keep the principle of parity in mind as it \n     works through the proposed Internet Tax Freedom Act. The bill \n     is intended to give state and Federal officials some \n     breathing room to tackle these issues in a coordinated \n     fashion. The House version, approved in June, would establish \n     a three-year moratorium on any new Internet sales taxes and \n     taxes on access to on-line services. It would also create a \n     national advisory commission to examine ways to improve tax \n     collection on all remote sales, including possible changes in \n     Federal law to close the out-of-state-sales loophole.\n       The Senate, which debates the bill today, should resist \n     extending the moratorium to five years, as some senators \n     want. A long moratorium is unnecessary and would be hard to \n     undo as consumers and businesses become accustomed to a tax-\n     free cyberspace. In the meantime, the dozen states that have \n     enacted Internet access taxes should be allowed to keep those \n     taxes in place. Congress has no good reason to truncate state \n     taxing authority, particularly since Internet commerce is \n     thriving.\n\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute from the time \nremaining of the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers.\n  Mr. President, we have talked about catalog sales and the loss of \nfunds. Yesterday, on the DOD authorization bill, we usurped States in \ntheir ability to tax, and now we are turning that around. Yesterday, we \ntold the States that we are going to usurp a tax if we don't think it \nis fair locally or statewide. The residents of Tennessee who work in \nKentucky at a Federal installation, who have been paying taxes--and the \nStates have worked it out--were excluded yesterday. And then my \nresidents in Kentucky are paying the Tennessee sales tax, and they were \nnot exempt because Tennessee goes on a high sales tax and no income \ntax. So, yesterday we said to State and local governments that you \ncan't tax.\n  There are 240 installations around the country. I think you will rue \nthe day that you usurped the Buck Act and you said to the States that \nwe are Big Brother and we will tell you how to tax. Now we have a \ncatalog question before us that says we ought to get the tax. So we \nhave to be very careful what we are doing. Yesterday was a bad day, not \nnecessarily for Kentucky, but for others. Oregon had the same problem \nwith Washington. They passed a law and worked it out and everything is \nfine. That is what we ought to do between States. This was not a \nFederal tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, like my friend from Arkansas, I am \nconcerned about the effect that mail order sales companies have on \nlocal retailers. I have no axe to grind with these businesses, and in \nfact applaud their ability to provide a very important service to many \nAmericans. The convenience of this type of purchasing is good for the \nconsumer.\n  What does concern me is the possibility that mail order and other \ndirect sales companies' popularity is on the rise simply because they \nare not required to collect state sales taxes. I do not know if that is \nthe true reason for their growth, but I would be concerned if they are \ntaking advantage of what may be, in effect, an uneven playing field. \nRemember, local merchants, who compete with direct sales companies for \nbusiness, have no opportunity to avoid collecting sales tax on their \ntransactions.\n  Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas \nraises a very important issue, and I am glad that the Senate has had \nthe opportunity to debate it this morning. But this is a complicated \nissue, and cannot be fully considered over a few hours of debate on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I have several questions about the proposal offered by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. For example, is it reasonable to set the exemption level \nat $3 million of annual sales? Is the per state exemption level of \n$100,000 in annual sales an appropriate level? On whom should this \nobligation be imposed?\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the questions that the Advisory \nCommission should be given the opportunity to explore. It may be that \nwhen this issue is fully reviewed, the Congress will decide that the \napproach proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is the correct one. But \nI don't think we can make that judgment today, and that is why I am \nvoting to table this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of Senator Snowe's time \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak briefly in support \nof the International Religious Freedom Act, which was introduced today.\n  Mr. President, this follows some 2 years of effort. This legislation, \nfirst introduced by Congressman Frank Wolf in the House and then \nintroduced by myself in the U.S. Senate, seeks to put the imprimatur of \nthe United States of America squarely in opposition to the religious \npersecution that is going on around the world. Again, the efforts have \ncontinued for 2 years.\n  Recently, because of certain objections to the tough sanctions \nimposed in the bill introduced by Congressman Wolf and myself, \ncompromise legislation has been crafted with the leadership of Senator \nNickles, Senator Lieberman, Senator Coats, with my participation, which \nstrikes out at religious persecution around the world. Freedom of \nreligion is a basic American value; perhaps along with freedom of \nspeech, the basic American value; perhaps even more important than any \nother value expressed in our Bill of Rights, because freedom of \nreligion is the first item mentioned in the Bill of Rights.\n\n  We have seen around the world egregious religious persecution with \nclerics being mistreated in China; with individuals being sold into \nslavery in Sudan. My own observations and investigation in Saudi \nArabia, illustratively where Christians cannot have a Christmas tree in \ntheir window if it can be viewed by the outside; where Jewish men and \nwomen in the fighting forces in Tent City--where we have some 5,000 \nAmerican personnel protecting the Saudis in the midst of a desolate \ndesert--those Jewish military personnel are afraid to wear their dog \ntags, their identification being just too risky. In the Egyptian press \nCongressman Wolf and I have been vilified and chastised for our efforts \nto fight against religious persecution around the world.\n  You can judge people by their enemies as well as by their friends. It \nis a tribute of a sort--also a tribute of a source--to be so chastised \nfor speaking out against religious persecution.\n  The bill, which was introduced today, Senate bill 1868, candidly, \ndoes not go as far as this Senator would have liked. My own view is \nthat religious persecution ought to be met by very forceful sanctions. \nBut the message was clear and unequivocal that the President's\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nadministration would not sign legislation with tough sanctions.\n  It is regrettable that the almighty dollar continues to rule American \nforeign policy, and has limited the strike and has limited the \nresistance to religious persecution that we have articulated around the \nworld. It would have been better for human rights to have tougher \nsanctions; it would have been a better statement of American values on \nhuman rights and freedom of religion and better to stamp out religious \npersecution to have been quite a lot tougher.\n  But the reality is that we are about to the end of the 105th \nCongress, a week from today. Congressman Wolf and I have pressed this \nstronger, tougher legislation for a lengthy period of time, and if no \naction is taken by the end of the congressional session, then I think \nthat is a signal for open season for those who practice religious \npersecution to keep it up.\n  What has been crafted here is a compromise. We haven't compromised \nthe principle, but we have adhered to the principle of compromise in \ncrafting the legislation. It takes a very significant first step with \nthe declaration by the U.S. Government that religious persecution is \nnot to be tolerated. We will monitor the results, and, if necessary, we \nwill be back with further legislation. I think this is a significant \nstep forward.\n  I compliment Congressman Wolf for his diligence over a long period of \ntime. I compliment Senator Nickles and Senator Lieberman for their \ncraftsmanship of working out this compromise bill, along with our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Coats, who commented at a press \nbriefing a few moments ago that as a final act on a very, very \ndistinguished career in both the House and the Senate, this bill is \nsomething to be recommended.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the bill, to join as \ncosponsors, but to certainly pass it before we end the 105th Congress \nso that it becomes the law of the land and it will strike a real blow \nfor religious freedom around the world.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11315-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11316-S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3677\n\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain and I have 5 minutes to briefly respond \nto Senator Bumpers' proposal. I will use a couple of those minutes of \ntime.\n  First, let me say that Senator Bumpers is such an extraordinary \nperson and such a wonderful orator that anyone who comes to the floor \nto speak after him is sort of in the position of being Tugboat Annie \nafter the Queen Mary has sailed off.\n  I would like to try to briefly respond to Senator Bumpers' proposal, \nand to urge my colleagues to strongly oppose it. First, let us be clear \nabout what this legislation says with respect to those mayors and \nGovernors about whom Senator Bumpers is concerned.\n  This legislation says that if you are liable for a tax today, you are \ngoing to be liable if electronic commerce goes forward. You are going \nto be liable for a tax on an Internet sale just as if it was a \ntraditional sale taking place today.\n  What the debate is all about is that some States believe that because \nthey cannot collect on mail order today, they want to go out and \ncollect taxes with respect to the Internet because they see the \nInternet as the cash cow.\n  Senator McCain and I and others don't feel that the problem in our \ncountry is that mail-order sales aren't taxed enough. We think that \nwhat we ought to do as we look to the next century and the new \neconomy--the digital economy--is to make sure that we have \ntechnological neutrality. This vote that we will be having in just a \nfew moments on the Bumpers amendment is essentially the first \nsubstantive recorded vote that we will have had with respect to the \nInternet.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this. I will oppose it strongly, \nbecause I don't think the problem in our country is that mail-order \nsales aren't taxed enough. I think what we ought to do is go forward \nwith this legislation as it stands now to ensure technological \nneutrality. I and others would be happy to work with Senator Dorgan and \nothers to address this mail-order problem. But at the end of the day, \nlet's not make the mistake with the Internet that was made with mail \norder years ago and create the same kind of fight and brawl.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The proponents of this amendment say it is not a new tax but proper \nenforcement of an existing sales tax. This is not the case. With a few \nexceptions, States do not receive sales taxes from out-of-State mail-\norder businesses, nor can they expect one under current law since this \nis a tax that has never been collected in the past.\n  There is only one way to vote in favor of this amendment. Let's be \nclear. This amendment represents a very large tax increase on the \npublic.\n  Mr. President, this amendment permits states to require out-of-state \nmail order businesses to collect their sales taxes on purchases made by \ntheir residents. The Senate Finance Committee, while reviewing the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, determined by a bipartisan vote of 13-6 that \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act is not an appropriate vehicle for the \nSenate to act on this measure. I agree with the Finance Committee's \nassessment, and I know that were my colleague and chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, present, he would object to the \nconsideration of this measure by the Senate without a full review of \nthis issue in committee hearings.\n  Make no mistake, this is not simply the collection of a standardized \ninterstate sales tax, as troubling as that would be. There exist \nthousands of taxing jurisdictions at the state, county, and local level \nin the U.S. Combined with the different nuances of each of these \njurisdictions, mail order businesses will face an administrative \nnightmare fulfilling their obligations under this amendment. In fact, \nit is the large number and complexity of different tax codes which now \nrequire the Senate to consider a moratorium on taxation of electronic \ncommerce. Certainly we cannot now say that mail-order businesses can or \nshould have to attempt to deal with the same difficulties electronic \ncommerce faces when it comes to sales taxes.\n  Mr. President, in addition to representing an administrative burden \nto industry, this amendment would also place unacceptable burdens on \nconsumers. Mail-order businesses contribute greatly to the quality of \nlife for many Americans. The disabled, the elderly and others rely on \nmail-order businesses for a variety of products. Should out-of-state \nmail-order firms be required to collect sales taxes, it is entirely \npossible that consumers will find themselves having to calculate the \nproper sales tax to be remitted to the mail-order company. Given the \ncomplexity of taxes, it is more than likely that no small number of \nconsumers will find the delivery of their purchases delayed due to \ninsufficient sales tax payments. Not only will this amendment decrease \nmail order business' ability to cater to these Americans, but it will \nreduce the convenience of the mail order industry which is at the heart \nof its success.\n  Proponents of this amendment have cited fairness for small businesses \nas support for passing this amendment. The underlying philosophy is \nthat small businesses cannot compete with tax-free products offered by \nout-of-state mail-order businesses. Mr. President, small businesses \nhave more to fear from retailers in their own communities, such as K-\nMart, Target, and Wal-Mart, than from mail-order businesses, yet small \nbusiness continues to thrive. Most Americans are not spending their \ntime shopping around for good deals on sales taxes, but they will go to \na store two blocks away as opposed to a store a block away if they can \nget a better price on a product.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not necessary for states to collect \nsales taxes on out-of-state mail order purchases as some suggest. Many \nstates have adopted use taxes to make up for supposed losses in sales \ntax revenue on goods purchased out-of-state, which require residents to \nsend in sales taxes on these purchases on their own. Proponents of this \namendment say that\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\nthe public is not aware of these use taxes, and therefore does not pay \nthem. In reality, use taxes have not been effective because many of \nthose states with use taxes are not actively enforcing them. Is this \nreason enough to place the burden of tax collection for Arkansas on \nArizona businesses? Will Arizona businesses be able to take advantage \nof the sidewalks, roads, or public safety services in Arkansas? If \ntaxing authorities are dissatisfied with their receipts from use taxes, \nthey should work to devise alternative methods for informing the public \nabout their existence.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has worked hard to balance the federal \nbudget, and we now have a budget surplus. As a result, Congress is \nworking on a tax cut package the American people have every right to \nexpect. This is not the time to consider new taxes on an American \npublic already being nickel and dimed. Proponents of this amendment say \nit is not a new tax, but merely the proper enforcement of existing \nsales taxes. This is not the case. With a few exceptions, states do not \nreceive sales taxes from out-of-state mail-order businesses, nor can \nthey expect to under current law. Since this is a tax that has never \nbeen collected in the past, there is only one way to view a vote in \nfavor of this amendment. Let us be clear, this amendment represents a \nhuge tax increase on the public.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this new tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Wall Street Journal article of December 23, 1992.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 23, 1992]\n\n              Mail-Order Taxes, Ghost of Christmas Future\n\n                         (By Arthur P. Hall II)\n\n       If many states have their way, consumers could lose lots of \n     shopping flexibility at Christmastime--and all year long. In \n     their increasingly desperate attempts to collect money \n     without upsetting voters, certain states want Congress to \n     help them cash in on their residents' out-of-state mail-order \n     and direct-marketing purchases. But the results would be \n     disastrous--disappointing state treasuries, depriving \n     consumers and ruining many people who depend on mail-order \n     firms for their livelihood.\n       The entire direct-marketing industry exceeds $200 billion \n     annually, and includes charities and political fund-raising \n     groups. States continue to explore the taxation of consumer \n     services and advertising, but the tax assault is aimed \n     primarily at mail-order catalogs, a strong and growing sector \n     of the U.S. economy.\n       A study released in October by the Pennsylvania-based WEFA \n     Group (formerly the Wharton economic consulting group) found \n     that the catalog industry, with sales of $48.8 billion, \n     contributed $39.9 billion (0.6%) to 1991's gross domestic \n     product. (According to Virginia Daly of Daly Direct Marketing \n     in Bethesda, Md., mail-order gifts account for 20% of all \n     Christmas shopping.) In 1991, the catalog industry employed \n     more than 250,000 people and generated a total employment of \n     1.17 million. The WEFA Group projects that these figures will \n     grow substantially between 1991 and 1996, with total \n     employment growing 16.6%\n\n\n                          how to stifle growth\n\n       But taxes could stifle this growth if states persuade \n     Congress to pass legislation enabling them to make out-of-\n     state firms collect what is called a ``use'' tax. It is like \n     a sales tax, but it applies to transactions in which a buyer \n     and seller reside in different states. The U.S. Supreme \n     Court, in a 1967 decision, frustrated state tax collectors by \n     ruling that, without congressional approval, they could not \n     require out-of-state firms to collect the use tax when the \n     firm's only presence (''nexus'') in a state was the shipment \n     of catalogs by common carrier or U.S. mail. In sum, the court \n     required a physical presence within the taxing state.\n       Ever since, tax collectors have tried to find a way around \n     the ruling. These efforts increased in intensity about 1986, \n     and included laws passed by 36 states to broaden the nexus \n     interpretation from a physical to an economic presence. The \n     Supreme Court rejected these efforts and upheld the 1967 \n     precedent in its May 1992 decision on Quill Corp. v. North \n     Dakota. But the court also said that ``Congress is now free \n     to decide whether, when, and to what extent the States may \n     burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to collect \n     use taxes.''\n       Since 1986, most states--with Bill Clinton's Arkansas being \n     among the first--have enacted use-tax statutes, enforcing \n     them with varying degrees of intensity while awaiting clear \n     direction from Congress. Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas) offered \n     such legislation in May 1989. The Brooks bill never passed, \n     but the 1983 political landscape offers promise for revenue-\n     hungry states.\n       The problem with use taxes is that they are a compliance \n     nightmare for everyone--direct marketers, consumers and \n     states. That's why states want Congress to simplify their \n     task by allowing them to force mail-order firms to collect \n     the taxes. But politicians have a bad habit of ignoring the \n     economic, consumer-choice and administrative costs associated \n     with revenue-raising measures.\n       According to a 1986 study by Touche Ross, the accounting \n     firm (now Deloitte Torche), forcing mail-order firms to \n     collect state use taxes will raise their operating costs by \n     10% to 20%. And the costs get more onerous for smaller firms. \n     That's why the Brooks bill exempted firms with annual \n     revenues under $12.5 million. But this threshold still leaves \n     midsize firms ($13 million to $50 million) with huge and \n     potentially crippling costs); it also erects a serious \n     obstacle to growth. Firms surpassing the $12.5 million \n     threshold would have to buy the equipment and hire the staff \n     to comply with 46 different state tax laws, and absorb or \n     pass on the cost of collecting use taxes by mail. These costs \n     would be six times greater than collecting sales taxes at the \n     point of retail sale.\n       The fact that more than 50% of mail-order customers still \n     pay by check means that catalog sellers would have to include \n     consumers in the use-tax compliance process. Having to \n     dedicate a page or more of a catalog to reciting state tax \n     laws would of course be costly. But the problem doesn't stop \n     there. Picture a dear grandmother who gleefully picks out \n     Christmas sweaters for her grandchildren, scattered across \n     several states, and then has to spend the afternoon \n     calculating her tax bill. Ho-ho-ho.\n       Consumer choice and jobs, however, would suffer the most \n     from a federal use-tax law. Midsize mail-order firms \n     increasingly give greater choice and flexibility to rural and \n     elderly consumers. And these firms often establish themselves \n     in market niches, offering unique products that most local \n     markets couldn't support.\n       Moreover, mail-order firms tend to proliferate in rural \n     areas, providing a core economic base. For example, Lands' \n     End employs 3,700 people in Dodgeville, Wis., more than the \n     population of the entire town. L.I. Bean, in Freeport, Maine, \n     employs around 4,000 At both firms, the numbers swell by 25% \n     in the months leading up to Christmas, Orvis Co. (Roanoke, \n     Va.) employs 400, the Collin Street Bakery (Corsicana, Texas) \n     employs 700, and George W. Park Seed Co. (Greenwood, S.C.) \n     employs 600. If federal use-tax legislation passes, says \n     Leonard Park of George W. Park Seed, ``our company is going \n     to get creamed, and a lot of traditional American families \n     will suffer.''\n\n\n                             A Pitiful Sum\n\n       This suffering will occur for the purpose of ``enhancing'' \n     state revenues--but only by a pittance. (With administrative \n     costs included, some states would even lose money.) Total \n     state revenues for 1991 equaled $661.4 billion and revenue \n     from general sales taxes equaled $103.2 billion. The Advisory \n     Commission on Intergovernmental Relations--a study group that \n     monitors taxation on federal, state and local levels--\n     estimated potential 1991 use-tax revenue at only $2.08 \n     billion. And even this estimate is too generous.\n       One should more rigorously adjust the potential tax base \n     for lost jobs, lost mail-order sales, use-tax exemptions, \n     firms that already pay sales taxes because of physical \n     presence in a state, lost revenue from firms that service the \n     catalog industry, services, and state administrative costs. \n     When these adjustments are made, one discovers only about \n     $500 million in potential revenue, about 0.5% of general \n     sales tax revenues. Even Scrooge wouldn't try to collect that \n     pitiful sum.\n       Taxing the thriving mail-order industry is a thoroughly bad \n     idea. Let's hope its time has not come.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, \nbecause I believe it is unnecessary and could prove detrimental to mail \norder companies.\n  For these reasons, I urge that my colleagues reject this amendment, \njust as they rejected it at the start of the 104th Congress by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 73 to 25.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the bill currently before us--\nthe Internet Tax Freedom Bill--is the appropriate place for the Senate \nto consider the imposition of new taxes. This amendment contains major \ncompliance and tax issues that should be properly considered and \nreported from the Finance Committee before being brought to a vote on \nthe floor.\n  In addition, my strong opposition to this amendment stems from my \nbelief that this measure will be detrimental to the mail-order industry \nnationally, as well as posing a stark threat to a company whose quality \ncraftsmanship, durable outdoor products, and legendary commitment to \nexcellence has made it the pride of my home state of Maine--L.L. Bean \nof Freeport.\n  L.L. Bean was established 86 years ago as a small, Maine-based store \ncatering to the surrounding community and a limited number of mail-\norder customers. In 1912, who would have\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nguessed that someday L.L. Bean would rise to become one of the premier \ninternational manufacturers and marketers of outdoor gear and other \ngoods? But by focusing on unquestioning customer satisfaction and \nunparalleled quality products, L.L. Bean succeeded in bringing to our \nstate and the local community many jobs and much pride.\n  In Freeport alone, 4,000 people are employed by L.L. Bean full-time \nwhile over 11,000 are employed part-time during the Christmas holidays, \nmaking it the third largest employer in the State of Maine. At the same \ntime, L.L. Bean's retail store brings to Freeport and its surrounding \ncommunities 4 million customers every year, and attracts an additional \n4 million catalog customers annually--a powerful generator of tourism \nand business for the entire state.\n  Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator \nBumpers, would threaten the present and future job prospects of \nFreeport's residents needlessly, as well as any other community that \nemploys individuals in the mail-order industry.\n  And even as this amendment would prove harmful in Maine and across \nthe nation, the irony is that this amendment is not even necessary to \naccomplish the goal being sought by my friend from Arkansas.\n  Specifically, states already have the ability to collect sales taxes, \njust as Maine has demonstrated, and can easily collect these taxes \nthrough the voluntary income tax.\n  In Maine, taxpayers are given the option on their personal income tax \nform of either stating the actual amount of sales tax due for out-of-\nstate purchases in a given year, or entering a flat tax amount based on \na percentage of the taxpayer's income.\n  The bottom line is that states have the ability to collect these \ntaxes--they do not need Federal legislation to do so.\n  Mr. President, the State of Maine has proven that the legislation \nbeing proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is not necessary. I urge my \ncolleagues join me in opposing this proposal, just as they opposed it \nfour years ago. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on January 19, 1995, this amendment was \nvoted down by a vote of 73 to 25. I anticipate the same vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute left; \n2\\1/2\\ minutes remain for the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have lost this amendment several times.\n  As you have heard me say previously, this is the seventh or eighth \nyear that I have offered this proposal. Every year the specious, \nabsolutely false arguments are made that people don't want any more \ntaxes and that this is a new tax. This is nothing more than a \ncontinuation of the unfunded mandates bill we passed here in 1995.\n  All my amendment does is say to the States, as the Supreme Court in \n1992 said, if Congress gives the States authority to tax sales by mail-\norder catalog houses, the States may take the opportunity to make them \npay it.\n  You are talking about the Chamber of Commerce types who go to work at \n8 o'clock in Little Rock, AR, in Allentown, PA, and Nashville, TN, and \nwork all day long and collect sales taxes on every dime of every \nmerchant on all the merchandise they sell; and some guy has a big \nwarehouse across the State line and can ship that same merchandise into \nTennessee, Arkansas and Pennsylvania without even collecting a sales \ntax. The Governors and the mayors and the municipalities, the council \nof shopping centers, the council of State governments, why do you think \nthey are for this? Because we are saying, if you want to. If you don't \nwant to, fine, don't do it. But we are saying you now have the right \nthat the Supreme Court gave you to require these people who fill your \nlandfills with catalogs to make them collect a tax just like Main \nStreet merchants do.\n\n  Why do you think they are for it? Because they see their tax base \ndisappearing with Internet sales and mail-order sales.\n  I ask every Member of this body before you cast your vote, ask \nyourself this question: What is going to happen to this country when \nthe schools start closing because the tax base is gone? One of the \nbiggest problems mayors have right now is with their police forces, \ntheir fire departments. Community schools are strapped. And all we are \nsaying is if you want to collect a sales tax on out-of-State sales, you \ncan. But this bill doesn't mandate it, doesn't require it. It simply \ngives you the right, and that is the reason all these organizations are \nfor it. That is the reason the New York Times is for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just add to the comments of the Senator from \nArkansas. This is a toothless argument that doesn't even wear well with \nage--that this is a new tax. I have heard that for 8 years. There is \nsimply no demonstration of truth to that argument. It is demonstrably \nuntrue. This is not a new tax. The tax already exists on that form of \ncommerce. It is not now being paid. The Senator from Arkansas does not \npropose to change the fundamental question of whether that transaction \nis taxed or not taxed.\n  So when I hear comments from friends of mine saying that this is a \nnew tax, I say they are wrong, dead wrong and the facts demonstrate \nthat. So I hope Senators will support the Senator from Arkansas. I \nthink he has offered a good amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Bumpers amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Missouri, (Mr. Bond) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr.  FORD. I  announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey), the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Moseley-Braun), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 296, I was recorded as \nhaving voted ``nay.'' It was my intention to vote ``aye.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recorded as a ``aye.'' This would not \naffect the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, let me take just a few minutes to talk about where we \nare with respect to the Internet tax bill and also to express my thanks \nto--who may have left the floor--but to express my thanks to Senator \nBumpers.\n  Senator Bumpers could have filibustered this legislation. He could \nhave insisted on his rights as a Senator to speak at length on this \npast amendment that he feels very strongly about, as do a number of \nSenators, and I want to thank him for not doing that. He has been \nexceptionally kind to me. He knows that I feel strongly about this \nlegislation. And he has been very constructive in working with the \nbipartisan group pursuing the legislation.\n  Let me also just state, as I did, it is our intent--it is clearly \nspelled out in the legislation--that if a firm or a home-based \nbusiness--I have thousands of them in Oregon; I know our colleagues do \nas well--if they are liable for a tax today, they are going to be \nliable under this legislation if that sale is conducted on the \nInternet. It is just that simple.\n  So what it comes down to, is if you have a question from a mayor or a \nGovernor who asks you about this subject at home--any Senator who is \nasked about this issue should simply say that this legislation does no \nharm to the States or to the localities, and it simply treats Internet \ncommerce like any other kind of commerce. That was something that I, as \nthe bill's sponsor, felt very strongly about.\n  With respect to the legislation, I know other Senators wish to speak \nas well, and Senator Dorgan wants to address the Internet issue this \nafternoon as well. I am very hopeful we will be able to resolve the one \nremaining issue, and that is the question of the commission and what \nthey are going to be looking at.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has been very helpful \non this matter in an effort to try to get an agreement--Senator Graham \nhas as well. I am very hopeful that we will be able to, now that we \nhave addressed the major amendment, the Bumpers amendment, I hope that \nwe will be able to get an agreement on exactly the duties of the \ncommission and be able to go forward with the managers' amendment.\n  Senator McCain and myself and others have been anxious to try to \naddress concerns that Senators have had with respect to the length of \nthe moratorium, other issues surrounding the managers' amendment. I \nthink we can do that.\n  So, again, let me say that I very much appreciate, especially on a \nFriday with Senators having a busy schedule, the opportunity to discuss \nthis issue. We made considerable progress. I especially thank Senator \nBumpers who could have spoken at length, filibustered this legislation, \nand he has been especially kind to me. I express my appreciation to \nhim.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota who has worked many, many hours \nin an effort to try to get this issue to the floor, along with me and \nothers, and I express my appreciation to him and say that I especially \nappreciate his effort to bring the parties together with respect to the \ncommission and the issues that they will be pursuing there in an effort \nto make sure that as we look to the digital economy in the 21st century \nthat we have a chance to examine those questions.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to pursue a question at this \ntime?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention--I did not provide an \nopening statement as we brought the bill to the floor. Senator McCain, \nwho is managing the legislation, and I and Senator Wyden and Senator \nBumpers and others talked about the schedule. I wanted the vote to be \nable to occur in a way that would allow Members to cast their vote and \ncatch their airplanes, so I deferred on an opening statement. It is my \nintention to provide an opening statement to discuss the framework of, \nI think, some of the amendments that we will be debating as we continue \nthis legislation this afternoon and also perhaps next week.\n  Let me, if I can, describe the circumstances that brought this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, we are not under a time limit at this moment, are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Oregon yielded the floor? \nHe still has control.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thought the Senator from North Dakota had a question he \nwanted to postulate. I do want to address the concern that he has on \nthe Internet tax bill. He has been very fair in working with the \nsponsors on this matter.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, I would like to provide my opening statement. \nIf the Senator would yield the floor so I might provide the opening \nstatement on this side. There are a number of things I would like to \ndiscuss with the Senator from Oregon, but I think it would be \nappropriate for me to give the statement that I deferred previously.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would that be possible--I would like to accommodate the \nSenator from North Dakota--if I were to yield the floor at this point, \ngiven the fact that he had asked earlier for time to give his opening \nstatement, that he be recognized if I yielded the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is the minority \nmanager of this legislation and does have priority.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, along with Senator McCain, \nwhen we brought the legislation to the floor today, I was interested in \ntrying to accommodate the schedules that Members had. And the second \nvote this morning was able to be held at a time that would allow some \nMembers the opportunity to catch airplanes back to their home States. \nBut I did want to discuss the circumstances that allowed us to get this \nlegislation to the floor. And I would like to review with the Senator \nfrom Oregon some of the provisions of the bill that are yet to be \ncompleted.\n  First, with respect to this general subject of the Internet, my \norientation of this issue is that, like most Americans, I view the \nInternet as something new and exciting and wonderful in a lot of ways \nand troublesome in other ways. The technology without question is \nremarkable and wonderful.\n  Obviously, there are some things on the Internet these days that are \ntroublesome and that is why we struggle with this question of the \nDecency Act that we wrote in the Commerce Committee and was struck down \nby the Supreme Court. I think the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, \nis going to offer an amendment similar to something we have discussed \npreviously with respect to the Internet and decency.\n  But leaving that aside, the Internet itself and the \ntelecommunications revolution that exists in this country, and the \ninformation superhighway that comes from that revolution, is really \nquite remarkable.\n  I come from a town of 300 people. I have a very different background \nthan the Senator from Wyoming or the Senator from Arizona for that \nmatter. I come from a town of 300 people. I went to a very small \nschool. Obviously, a school in a town of 300 people is not going to be \nbig under any circumstance. But my high school graduating class was \nnine students. And we had a library in my high school that was a very \nsmall coat closet, and that contained all of our books. And that was \nit. That is the way life was in my school. Would I trade it for another \nexperience? No. I thought it was a wonderful school, a wonderful \nhometown, and a wonderful education.\n  But now when I go back to my hometown it is slightly smaller than it \nwas\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\nwhen I left. Some of those rural communities are shrinking. I go back \nto that wonderful community and go to the school. The library is not \nmuch larger than it was then except--that school is now connected to \nthe information superhighway. Computers in those small schools can now \naccess the information superhighway.\n  And what does that mean? It means in my hometown of Regent, ND, there \nis a student today who is able to use a computer and access the Library \nof Congress. Now, the Library of Congress has the largest repository of \nhuman knowledge that exists anywhere on Earth. Of all of the \naccumulated knowledge in human history--the largest body of that \nknowledge exists in the Library of Congress. In Regent, ND, that small \nlibrary is now augmented by the largest library on Earth as a result of \nthe information superhighway and the new revolution in \ntelecommunications.\n\n  Is that wonderful? It is more than wonderful. It changes our ability \nto educate. It changes our ability to do a whole series of things. In \nfact, as an aside, I read a while ago that the CEO of IBM Corporation \ngave a speech to shareholders. He said they are on the cusp of \ndiscovery in researching storage density sufficient so that he expects \nwe will soon be able to put all of that information from the Library of \nCongress--14 to 16 million volumes of work, the largest repository of \nhuman knowledge on Earth--on a wafer the size of a penny. Think of \nthat, a computer storage wafer the size of a penny encompassing all of \nthe works of the Library of Congress.\n  What does that mean? It is a wonderful opportunity in our future to \nuse the Internet and to use telecommunications to enhance education and \na whole range of things.\n  I wanted to provide that framework simply to say, especially coming \nfrom a very small community in North Dakota, we understand the wonders \nand the technological marvels that exist in what we are talking about \nhere and how it changes things.\n  My hometown, 120 miles southwest of Bismarck, ND, 50 miles from \nDickinson, and, for those who want to pinpoint it more precisely, 14 \nmiles west of Mott, ND--my hometown is as close to the Hudson River as \ndowntown Manhattan with telecommunications. Just like that, you can \ntransmit data off the Internet. We have erased geography as a \ndisadvantage.\n  Now, in addition to the advantages of education that I have described \nwith respect to the Internet and the information superhighway, there is \nanother entire area of commerce that also provides significant \nadvantages to people in my hometown and people in every hometown in our \ncountry.\n  When I was a young boy, from my hometown we had to drive nearly 60 \nmiles to go to a hospital. We had to drive 60 miles to a sporting goods \nstore. When I was a young boy, that is what I wanted to do when my \nparents took me to the big town, Dickinson, ND, 10,000 people. I wanted \nto go to a sporting goods store. It was a small store with baseball \nmitts and merchandise. In my hometown, we had none. So I would go there \nand get lost in the sporting goods store, picking up the new baseball \ngloves, feeling and nurturing them, and wondering, what if I owned one \nof them? That was a big deal to me.\n  It was true with respect to a Dairy Queen--50, 60 miles to a Dairy \nQueen; 60 miles to a clothing store. That is the way it was.\n  Now, however, in my hometown you can't order a Dairy Queen over the \nInternet, but that sporting goods store is brought to my hometown by \nthe Internet. The Internet changes commerce. Now someone in my hometown \ncan dial up on the Internet a sporting goods store, a clothing store. \nWant to buy some new athletic shoes? That is available. How about a \nbook? Amazon.com--we all know the success story of that company.\n  My point is, we are seeing dramatic new areas of commerce available \nto people around the country, and around the world for that matter, \nwhich will improve their lives. I agree with that.\n  We had a disagreement, the Senator from Oregon and I, about the piece \nof legislation in the Commerce Committee. I felt very strongly that \nwhat was proposed was dead wrong and he felt strongly it was right on \ntarget. We didn't disagree because we differed about the policy of what \nthe Internet could mean to our country and to our people. I fully \nunderstand the full flow of benefits that will come from this. I \nunderstand and recognize that. Members know my interest is not in any \nway, ever, to impede the growth of the Internet or the growth of \nopportunity that people want to take advantage of on the Internet to \nmarket their goods, to build their business, and to do those kinds of \nthings.\n  At the same time, however, I recognize that while the Internet might \nbring a sporting goods store to my hometown, it will also bring some \nmerchandise to my hometown that those few merchants in my hometown sell \nand must now collect a sales tax on when they sell it. I want to make \nsure, relative to the previous amendment and also some other amendments \nwe will discuss, that what we do with respect to this form of new \ncommerce has some relationship to fairness, fairness tied to selling on \nMain Street, sales from mail-order catalogs, selling on the Internet. I \nwant to make sure what we are doing here is fair to all areas of \ncommerce.\n  That is why when Senator Wyden--who has been a leader on this, no \nquestion about that; he was the author in the Senate Commerce Committee \nof the underlying legislation--brought this legislation to the \ncommittee, I felt very strongly that the way it was constructed was \ngoing to cause a lot of problems. I opposed it vigorously, as he well \nknows.\n  Since that time when it was passed out of the Commerce Committee, it \nhas changed substantially. We now, I think, agree on one central \nprinciple, and that principle embodied in the underlying legislation is \nthat we ought to have a moratorium of sorts so that we don't have State \nor local governments creating regimes of taxation here that could be \npunitive or could retard opportunities on the Internet in a punitive or \ndiscriminatory way. We agree with that and we have constructed \nlegislation which I think will accomplish that and doesn't disadvantage \nany State or any local government. If there is a State or local \ngovernment that has plans today to say let me be punitive in the way I \napply a tax or construct a tax dealing with the Internet, I say I am \nnot in your corner. I am not on your side on that. You are wrong; you \nought not do that.\n  I didn't want to snare in the net the kinds of State and local taxes \nthat are applied to virtually all other kinds of commerce and do it in \na way that would say to those who are at home on Main Street that you \nwill be at a disadvantage because we have created a special safe harbor \nor special tax haven for certain kinds of electronic commerce. That has \nalways been my concern.\n  As long as the Senator from Oregon is here, I will engage him in this \nconversation. I think we are coming to the same point, Senator McCain, \nSenator Wyden, myself, and others, with respect to what we want to \naccomplish with this legislation. It is a system which, as we see the \nInternet begin to grow in its infancy--and it still is in its infancy--\nis nondiscriminating with respect to how taxes are imposed among \ndifferent forms of commerce.\n  I yield for a comment from the Senator from Oregon about whether he \nsees us coming to that same point and whether he shares that goal.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his thoughtful \ncomments, as well. I think there has been a considerable effort in the \nlast few months to address this in a bipartisan way.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota is exactly right; what we want \nis technological neutrality. We don't want the Internet to get a \npreference. We don't want the Internet to be discriminated against. We \nwant to be able to say, as we look to the brand new economy, the \ndigital economy, that we don't make some of the mistakes that we made \nas we tried to sort out some of the issues, for example, with respect \nto mail order. I think the Senator from North Dakota has been very \npersistent in terms of trying to work with all the parties in making \nsure that the commission studies these issues fairly. That is certainly \nwhat I want.\n  I was very interested in my friend's comments with respect to his \ntown in North Dakota and how the Internet\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nwould allow, for example, somebody to log on in North Dakota and get \ngoods from a sporting goods store far away and have them shipped to a \nsmall town in North Dakota. That is clearly one of the benefits. But \nwhat we also hope to do with the Internet Tax Freedom Act is make it \npossible to grow small businesses in North Dakota that will be able to \nfurnish some of those goods and services.\n  My friend from North Dakota has many small communities in North \nDakota, as I do in Oregon. I want to make sure that Burns and Wagontire \nand other small towns in Oregon can compete. My view is that sensible \nInternet policies will make those small businesses more competitive \nthan they are today.\n  The reason that Main Street businesses support the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act, the bill that is before the Senate today, is that Main \nStreet businesses, those small stores, recognize right now they are \nhaving a lot of difficulty competing with the Wal-Mart giants and \ncertainly major corporations that are located overseas.\n  And once you make geography irrelevant, which the Internet does, once \nyou get a fair tax policy for a home-based business in Oregon or North \nDakota, rather than those businesses facing discriminatory taxes, as we \nhave been addressing today, I think we will grow more small businesses \nin North Dakota and Oregon on Main Street, and that is the hope of the \nsponsors of this legislation.\n  So let me yield back to the Senator from North Dakota, as this \nSenator has to head off for a 7 or 8-hour flight home. I want to again \nexpress my thanks to the Senator from North Dakota. He and his staff \nhave spent many, many hours toiling over what is arcane language, at \nbest, with respect to the digital economy and these new issues. I think \nthe Senator from North Dakota is right in saying that this is just the \nbeginning of this whole discussion. We had another initiative yesterday \nthat was very sensible--Senator Bryan's initiative dealing with on-line \nprivacy as it relates to children. So we are just at the beginning of \nthese issues.\n  I hope to be sitting next to the Senator from North Dakota on the \nCommunications Subcommittee as we tackle these questions. I think we \nhave made considerable progress. I specifically thank Senator Graham, \nSenator Bumpers, as well as the Senator from North Dakota. They have \nhad strong views on this matter, and they know this bill has been \nimportant to me. They have all been very gracious in helping to move it \nalong. Also, Senator McCain will be back on the floor in a few moments. \nWe simply could not have been here without the support of Senator \nMcCain and his staff. I am looking forward to seeing this legislation \ngo to the President before we wrap up. I thank the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the issues that we have not \ncompletely resolved is extending the moratorium. We have a moratorium \nin this legislation that says to the States that if you have not yet \nadopted or enforced an Internet tax, there is a moratorium; you will \nnot be able to do that during this time out. During that period, a \ncommission will meet and evaluate all of these issues. The Senate \nfinance bill reported out a 2-year moratorium on bit taxes, \ndiscriminatory taxes, and on Internet taxes. The House-passed version \nof this legislation has a 3-year moratorium. My understanding is that \nthere will be an amendment calling for a 5-year moratorium on the bill \nthat is coming to the floor. The version passed out by the Senate \nCommerce Committee had a 6-year moratorium.\n  Keynes used to say, ``In the long run, we are all dead.'' I don't \nknow what the long run is, but when you talk about moratoriums here, 6 \nyears is a large expanse of time. It seems to me that it is wholly \ninappropriate. I would more favor the Senate finance bill, which is a \n2-year time out, or moratorium. We will likely have to agree to \nsomething more than that, but 5 or 6 years, in my judgment, is not \nreasonable. I think there is another amendment that was noticed, or at \nleast will be offered, with a 3-year moratorium, which seems to me to \nbe a more reasonable compromise. I ask the Senator from Oregon about \nthat.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator. He has correctly laid out the various \ntime periods. Let me say again, the Senator from North Dakota knows \nboth the chairman of the Commerce Committee and I are still wanting to \nwork with those who feel that 5 years is too long a period. We are \nanxious to try to get an agreement and, hopefully, this can all be \nresolved as part of a managers' amendment.\n  I think the concern of certainly myself and others is that 2 years is \ntoo short because it is going to take some time to work through a \nsubject as complicated as this, and then there is going to need to be a \nperiod where the States have the chance to address it. I think we can \ncome up with a period that is acceptable. Of course, the moratorium, \nsuch as it is, applies only to Internet access taxes. It does not apply \nto other spheres of economic activity. And with respect to other \nspheres of economic activity, again, Internet will be treated just like \nanything else. If a State and a locality has other means of raising \nrevenue, we want to make it clear that, with respect to the Internet, \nthe business conducted there will be treated like everything else.\n  So let me yield back to the Senator from North Dakota at this time, \nwith an assurance that we are going to continue to try to negotiate on \nthis point an acceptable time period for all parties. We have discussed \n4 years, and we have discussed a variety of options. We are going to \ncontinue to do that. I want it understood that both Senator McCain and \nI feel that the Senator from North Dakota is trying very hard to be \nhelpful here, and we are going to continue to move forward in working \nwith him to get this resolved.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that the way to be \nmost helpful would be to agree with me.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will say, having made 30 changes since we left the \nCommerce Committee, that this Senator, who is a good friend of the \nSenator from North Dakota, has a very high batting average--since we \nhave been talking about baseball--in terms of agreeing with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. We are going to continue to work with him, as he \nknows.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senate bill 442, the Internet access bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak out \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is there any time limit, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Not that I know of.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11319-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11321-S11324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as all Senators are aware, at midnight on \nWednesday, September 30, Fiscal Year 1998 expired. And with the \nexpiration of the fiscal year came some most welcome and almost \nunbelievable news that, for the first time since 1969, the unified \nFederal budget was in surplus for Fiscal Year 1998. We do not know the \nexact figures yet. That will not be known until the Treasury Department \ncompletes its calculations of actual revenues and expenditures that \noccurred up through midnight, September 30, but we do know that the \nlatest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of that unified \nbudget surplus is $63 billion. The President has announced that the \nofficial administration projection of the Fiscal Year 1998 unified \nbudget surplus is about $70 billion. This unified budget surplus, \nwhether it be $63 billion, or $70 billion, or some other figure, is a \nresult of a dramatic turnaround from the massive budget deficits that \nwere projected just a few short years ago.\n  Who should be given the lion's share of the credit for this dramatic \nturnaround in the country's fiscal fortunes? The President wants to \nclaim a large share of the credit. The Republican-led Congress likes to \nsay that things did not really change until they took over\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\ncontrol of the House and Senate, and that they deserve the majority of \nthe credit. Many financial analysts give a substantial amount of the \ncredit to the policies of the Federal Reserve, which have attempted to \nmanage the country's fiscal fortunes through adjustments in interest \nrates.\n  Suffice it to say, credit should be given to all of the above. \nSpeaking from first-hand experience, I believe that Congress does \ndeserve substantial credit for the turnaround from the triple-digit-\nhundred-billion-dollar deficits of the twelve years under Presidents \nReagan and Bush. Those triple-digit deficits accumulated to the point \nwhere the nation's debt rose from just under $1 trillion on the day \nthat President Reagan took office to more than $4,097,000,000,000 on \nthe day that President Bush left office. In other words, in the entire \nhistory of the country, from the day that President George Washington \ntook office to the day that President Reagan took office, the nation's \naccumulated debt amounted to less than $1 trillion. Twelve years \nlater--the day that President Bush left office, it stood at \n$4,097,000,000,000.\n  Throughout the period of the 1980s, Congress attempted to rein in \nthese massive Federal deficits, for example, with the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings sequester mechanism that was part of the 1985 Balanced Budget \nand Emergency Deficit Control Act. This mechanism, Senators may recall, \nrequired an across-the-board sequester of all Federal programs (with \nfew exceptions) sufficient to bring down any deficits that exceeded \nthose provided for in annual budget resolutions. In 1990, it became \nclear that the sequester that would be necessary to achieve the \nrequirements of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings would have decimated the entire \nFederal establishment, including a cut in the budget of the Department \nof Defense ranging between 25 and 35 percent. Rather than allowing \nthose sequesters to proceed, Congress and the Bush Administration had \nno choice but to convene what turned out to be a very lengthy and \ndifficult budget summit. I participated in that summit, as did a number \nof my Senate colleagues who are still in the Senate--Senators Domenici \nand Gramm, for example. After many months, including weekends and \naround-the-clock sessions at Andrews Air Force Base, that summit \nresulted in substantial changes in our budget discipline which have \nplayed a positive role in helping to rein in Federal deficits since \ntheir inception in 1990.\n  Under those mechanisms, sequesters of not only discretionary funds \ntake place when so-called discretionary caps are exceeded, but also, \nfor the first time, mandatory programs are under a pay-go system as \nwell. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, any new mandatory \nspending must be fully offset. That 1990 Act also put in place a \nprocess for considering emergency spending, which is allowed to go \nforward outside the budgetary caps, if such spending is declared an \nemergency by both Congress and the President.\n  By and large, that emergency mechanism, I believe, has been \nbeneficial and has been used in accordance with the intentions of the \nsummiteers. That emergency designation is allowed for spending outside \nthe caps for events that are sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not \npermanent. Such events include natural disasters, military deployments \naround the world, and so forth.\n  The fact that the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act has been successful is \nnot just the opinion of this Senator. It is shared by many, including \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who in \nrecent testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, made the following \nstatement in relation to that legislation, and I quote:\n\n       I think that--frankly, much to my surprise, as I think I \n     have indicated to you over the years, that the budgetary \n     processes, which were put into place by the Congress a number \n     of years ago, have worked far better than I would have ever \n     anticipated them working. And I would be quite chagrined if \n     we abandoned them because when you have a good thing, it \n     seems rather pointless to dismantle it.\n\n  I think those words by Mr. Greenspan are right on the mark.\n  Subsequent to the 1990 changes in the Budget Act and the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings law, I believe that credit should also be given to \nthose who voted for the 1993 budget package which passed each House of \nCongress by a one-vote margin and without a single vote from the \nRepublican side of either body. That package was anathema to the \nRepublicans. Yet, despite the dire predictions of economic doom which \ncame from the Republican side of the aisle at the time, the economy has \nperformed very, very well ever since the enactment of that legislation. \nAll of those who have been involved in reducing Federal deficits can be \njustifiably proud of what is now a unified budget surplus for Fiscal \nYear 1998 in excess of $60 billion.\n  But, while we are basking in the glow of high praise and compliments \nall around, we must also take a heavy dose of realism. For reasons that \nI shall now attempt to explain in some detail, this is not the time to \nabandon the fiscal discipline we have undertaken for a number of years. \nI believe very strongly that any budget surpluses in the coming decade \nshould be used for retiring the Federal debt, rather than for massive \ntax cuts or increases in Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, on July 15, 1998, the Congressional Budget Office \nissued its summer baseline projections for Fiscal Years 1998-2008 for \nthe unified Federal budget. Now, let me stop here and explain what the \nterm ``unified Federal budget'' means. The unified Federal budget \nincludes not only the operating budget of the various departments and \nagencies throughout the Federal government, but it also includes the \nPostal Service and--get this--Trust Fund surpluses, the most important \none of which is--guess what--the Social Security Trust Fund. By \nincluding these Trust Fund surpluses in the unified budget, one ignores \nthe fact that none of the Trust Fund surpluses is available for \nanything other than the purposes for which the Trust Funds \nwere established. In other words, it is to a large extent misleading \nand certainly amounts to budgetary wizardry to count these Trust Fund \nsurpluses when one says that there is an overall unified Federal budget \nsurplus. Nevertheless, for the moment, let us talk about what has \nhappened to the projections of our Congressional Budget Office experts \nas far as they relate to the unified Federal budget between the period \nMarch 15, 1998, and July 15, 1998.\n\n  The unified budget surplus projections for the 11-year period 1998-\n2008 provided to Congress in March of this year by the Congressional \nBudget Office totaled $679 billion.\n  Let me say that again.\n  The unified budget surplus projections for the 11-year period 1998-\n2008 provided to Congress in March of this year by the Congressional \nBudget Office totaled $679 billion.\n  By July 15, 1998, just 4 months after its March 1998 projections, the \nCongressional Budget Office sent to Congress its summer report, which I \nhave. In that report, CBO projects that unified budget surpluses for \nthe period 1998-2008 will total more than $1.6 trillion. That is a \nchange of some $932 billion in surplus projections for the next 11 \nyears. So over a period of just 120 days, from March 15, 1998, to July \n15, 1998, the Congressional Budget Office changed its projections of \nunified budget surpluses for the next 11 years from $679 billion to \n$1.611 trillion.\n  What caused the Congressional Budget Office, our premier independent \nbudgetary experts, to make such a massive change in budget surplus \nprojections in such a short time? The best that we have been able to \ndetermine is that the largest the contributor to the upward revision of \nfuture surpluses resulted in a change in CBO's treatment of revenues. \nPreviously, CBO had argued that there had been a surge of unexpected \nrevenues in the recent past, but that such surge was temporary. Now \nthey argue that there are good reasons to think that this unexpected \nsurge in revenues will continue indefinitely. This results in an ad hoc \naddition of approximately $50 billion each year of the latest 11-year \nbudget forecast.\n  Does this mean, Mr. President, that the Congressional Budget Office \nis inept and that perhaps the Congress should seek the services of \nanother budget prognosticator? Certainly not. Rather, my purpose in \nhighlighting this significant change in estimates is to support my \nbelief that, in all decisions affecting revenue and spending\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nfor future years, we must tread carefully on the planks of budgetary \nestimation. Like an old man crossing a footbridge strung over a chasm, \nonly a small misstep can mean the difference between a successful \ncrossing and spectacular failure.\n  CBO would be the first to tell you that they have consistently missed \nbudgetary forecasts, as has the Office of Management and Budget. That \nis to be expected. No human being can ever predict accurately what \nrevenues will come into the Treasury in a given year, or what \nexpenditures will go out of the Treasury, or what the unemployment rate \nwill be, or what the inflation rate will be, or whether there will be a \nrecession, or the duration and virility of recessions. In short, Mr. \nPresident, there is no reason to believe that the CBO's current \nforecast of the budgetary picture over the upcoming 10 years will be \nany more accurate than have been its previous forecasts. Also, very \nimportantly, Senators should remember that budgetary estimates can \nrapidly change and they can change for the worst, just as they have \nturned for the better in recent years. We saw this firsthand during the \nearly 1990s when we suffered a severe and lengthy recession; there is \nno reason to think that it cannot happen again. There is no reason to \nthink that it will not happen again. Consider the remarks of the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, again, Mr. Alan \nGreenspan, at a recent hearing by the Senate Budget Committee. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       According to CBO's figures, a recession comparable to the \n     1991 downturn would eliminate the unified surplus and create \n     a budget deficit of more than $50 billion within 2 years. \n     Over the next 10 years, more than half of the $1.5 trillion \n     in projected unified surpluses would be eliminated.\n\n  That was Mr. Greenspan talking.\n  With this in mind, we should never underestimate just how \nunpredictable and capricious budget projections can be.\n  In virtually every CBO report, cautionary statements are made, such \nas the following, which is included in the CBO's most recent budget \nupdate:\n\n       . . . there is a risk that future events will cause a \n     significant divergence from the path laid out in the new \n     forecast. The economy could be more adversely affected by the \n     Asian crisis than CBO assumes; the tightness of the labor \n     market could cause a significant jump in the rate of \n     inflation; or the stock market could drop precipitously.\n\n  We have seen that happen all too many times of late.\n\n       Conversely, the Asian crisis could have little additional \n     effect on the United States; productivity growth might remain \n     higher than CBO anticipates, which would permit a \n     continuation of rapid noninflationary growth and stronger \n     profits; or labor force participation rates might again \n     increase rapidly, easing pressures on the labor market for a \n     few years. Such alternative outcomes could have a substantial \n     effect on the budget, increasing or decreasing its bottom \n     line by $100 billion or more in a single year.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation.\n  To this point, Mr. President, I have concentrated my remarks on the \n``unified Federal budget'', which, as I stated earlier, combines not \nonly the operating budget of all Federal departments and agencies, but \nalso the Postal Service and Trust Fund surpluses. In so doing, the \nunified Federal budget hides from view the question of whether, in its \noperations, the Federal budget is in deficit or is in surplus.\n  Let us now look at a couple of other Federal budget calculations that \nare available to us through the Congressional Budget Office. What, for \nexample, are CBO's baseline projections for the next 5 years for on-\nbudget deficits or surpluses? On-budget calculations, it should be \nnoted, exclude Social Security surpluses and the Postal Service, which, \nI might add, are supposed to be treated as off-budget by law. CBO's on-\nbudget calculations project that we will suffer deficits for Fiscal \nYears 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003. In other words, if one leaves Social \nSecurity surpluses and the Postal Service out of the budget \ncalculations, there is no surplus at all until the year 2002, at which \ntime CBO says there will be a $1 billion on-budget surplus.\n  Let me read that again. CBO's on-budget calculations project that we \nwill suffer deficits for Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003. In \nother words, if one leaves Social Security surpluses--we are talking \nabout Social Security surpluses. We are talking about something that \ninterests a lot of people, something that involves millions of people \nin this country, something that is of concern to the great mass of \npeople out there, old and young, women, men, children--if one leaves \nSocial Security surpluses and the Postal Service out of the budget \ncalculations, there is no surplus at all until the year 2002, at which \ntime CBO says there will be a $1 billion on-budget surplus. Deficits \nfor the other fiscal years total $138 billion. Therefore, over the \ncoming 5 budget years, CBO projects that, if we exclude Social Security \nsurpluses and the Postal Service--if we exclude them--we will suffer \ndeficits in 4 of those years totaling $138 billion and a surplus of \nonly $1 billion in one year--2002--making a net on-budget deficit over \nthe next 5 years of $137 billion.\n\n  Hence, it becomes obvious that for the next 5 years, there is no \nFederal budget surplus at all if one excludes Social Security and the \nPostal Service from the calculation. In fact, there is a net deficit of \nover $130 billion.\n  Now, let us take a look at CBO's calculations of what is called, in \nbudgetary terminology, the ``Federal Funds Budget.'' This budget, by \ndefinition, excludes not only Social Security and the Postal Service \nbut all Trust Funds. In other words, the Federal funds budget excludes \nSocial Security, the Postal Service, the Highway Trust Funds, the \nAirport and Airway Trust Funds, the Medicare Trust Funds, the Civil \nService and Military Retirement Trust Funds, the Unemployment Trust \nFunds, and many, many more. CBO's projections are that we will have \nFederal funds deficits for 9 of the next 10 years. For that period, \nFiscal Years 1999-2008, Federal funds deficits are projected to total \n$592.2 billion. Over that period, only the year 2008 is projected to \nshow a small surplus.\n  What this means is that when all obligations of the Federal \nGovernment are taken into account, including the IOUs to all Federal \nTrust Funds, we will not have any surplus until the year 2008--even if \nthese new, rosy CBO forecasts come true, and even if Congress restrains \nitself from spending any of those projected surpluses or cutting taxes.\n  Now, let us shift our attention to a discussion of the National Debt. \nFederal Debt is divided into two categories--namely, Debt Held by the \nPublic and Debt Held by Government Trust Funds. Under present policies, \nCBO's latest projections show that Debt Held by the Public will \ndecrease from $3.7 trillion in 1998 to $2.3 trillion in 2008.\n  This is so because Debt Held by the Public does not include any of \nthe debt owed by the Treasury to Federal Trust Funds. Therefore, if \nCBO's $1.6 trillion in projected unified budget surpluses come to pass, \nthose surpluses will go toward reducing Debt Held by the Public. \nHowever, Debt Held in Government Trust Funds will rise, according to \nCBO, from $1.8 trillion in 1998 to $3.9 trillion in 2008. In other \nwords, the surpluses in the Government Trust Funds that I have \npreviously named will continue to grow and add to the debt owed by the \nU.S. Treasury to those Trust Funds. When one combines both types of \nFederal debt, namely, Debt Held by the Public and Debt Held in \nGovernment Trust Funds, one arrives at what is known as Gross Federal \nDebt. This, to me, represents the truest picture of the debts being \nincurred by the Federal Government that will eventually have to be \npaid. CBO projects that Gross Federal Debt will rise from $5.475 \ntrillion in 1998 to $6.222 trillion in the year 2008. In other words, \neven if all of the projected surpluses of CBO come true over the next \n11 years, and even if all of the $1.6 trillion in projected budget \nsurpluses come true, we will still face a massive mountain of Gross \nFederal Debt which will have grown from $5.5 trillion to $6.2 trillion \nover this same period.\n  Mr. President, I have attempted in these remarks to paint a realistic \npicture of the condition of the Federal budget, including a true \npicture of whether we are incurring deficits or surpluses and whether \nwe are increasing or decreasing overall Federal debt in the coming 10 \nyears. It should be perfectly clear to any rational person that there \nis no real surplus and that, even if CBO's latest 10-year forecast \nproves to be accurate and if Congress restrains itself from cutting \ntaxes--there is a great hue and cry, a great\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\npush for cutting taxes--even if Congress restrains itself from cutting \ntaxes or increasing spending, Gross Federal Debt will continue to rise \nby some $700 billion, even under CBO's rosy scenarios. Furthermore, \nthis could all change massively, as I have pointed out, with one \nrecession like the one suffered by the Nation in the early 1990s.\n  It is against this backdrop that the House recently passed what they \ncall the ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998.'' According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, this House-passed tax cut would reduce Federal \nrevenues by $80 billion over the next 5 years and by $176 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Keep in mind that tax cuts, once enacted, are \npermanent and the loss in revenues to the U.S. Treasury continue not \njust for 5, 10, or 15 years, but forever, unless they are repealed.\n  So, if the Congress lost its collective mind, and if the President \njoined Congress in losing our collective mind and signed such a \nreduction in revenues, those permanent tax cuts would come to pass \nregardless of whether CBO's latest projections of unified budget \nsurpluses come true or not. Furthermore, we should keep in mind that \nover the next 5 years, there is no budget surplus at all--none--if one \nexcludes the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses from the \ncalculations. In effect then, the House-passed tax bill uses Social \nSecurity to pay for its $80 billion, 5-year cost to the Treasury.\n  We should also keep in mind that the Gross Federal Debt is going to \ncontinue to rise even without any tax cut. It follows that such a tax \ncut would increase the Federal debt by $80 billion over the next 5 \nyears; by $176 billion over the next 10 years; and by ever-increasing \namounts each year thereafter.\n  It should be noted, Mr. President, that the House-passed tax cut bill \nis in direct violation of the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act. That Act, as \nI stated earlier in my remarks, requires that any increase in mandatory \nspending or any tax cuts must be fully offset under what is called the \n``Pay-As-You-Go'' rules. Those rules, which have been wisely extended \nthrough the year 2006 by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997, allow for \na point of order against any such un-offset tax cut. This means that \nthe House-passed tax bill when, and if it comes before the Senate, will \nbe subject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  I hope that Senators will come to their senses on both sides of the \naisle and do what they know is right for the American people and vote \nagainst any tax bill that reduces Federal revenues, keeping in mind \nthat even if all of the projected surpluses of CBO come true over the \nnext 11 years, and even if all of those surpluses are applied to the \nFederal debt, we will still have massive Gross Federal Debt, which will \ngrow from $5.5 trillion to $6.2 trillion over this same period. To \nfritter away billions of dollars at this time on massive tax cuts would \nbe the height of irresponsibility and would signal to all the world \nthat we cannot be relied upon to rid this great Nation of not only its \ndeficits, but also its gigantic national debt as well. And that should \nbe our solemn goal. It is ironic that after struggling mightily to \novercome the 12 years of recordbreaking, triple-digit-billion-dollar \nFederal budget deficits under Reagan and Bush, the Republicans are now \ncalling for cutting Federal revenues by huge amounts based on what \ncould turn out to be flimsy projections by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which, even if they come true, will have done little more than \nput a small dent--just a small dent--in overall Federal debt.\n  Mr. President, you do not need any poll to do the right thing here. I \nsay to Senators, this is a no brainer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, these two amendments are not relevant, but \nthey are acceptable to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3678 and 3679) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3678\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss \nlanguage that has been added to this legislation, the ``Government \nPaperwork Elimination Act.'' In May, I introduced S. 2107 to enhance \nelectronic commerce and promote the reliability and integrity of \ncommercial transactions through the establishment of authentication \nstandards for electronic communications. S. 2107 was reported by the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last month.\n  After the bill was reported, it was discovered that the bill was \nerroneously referred to the Commerce Committee and should have been \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. S. 2107 deals with \nFederal government information issues and, according to the \nparliamentarian, falls directly within the jurisdiction of Governmental \nAffairs. I understand a similar bill had been approved by Governmental \nAffairs last Congress.\n  Obviously, this was discovered late in the session. Nevertheless, \nSenator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nworked with me to develop language which combines language from the \nbill reported by his Committee last Congress and S. 2107. I want to \nthank my colleague from Tennessee for his help and insight. He spent a \ngreat deal of time assisting me with this legislation and, in my \nopinion, his language makes many improvements to the original bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nhis hard work on and dedication to information technology issues. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs which I chair has had a long and \ninvolved history with this issue.\n  This language which we are discussing today seeks to take advantage \nof the advances in modern technology to lessen the paperwork burdens on \nthose who deal with the Federal government. This is accomplished by \nrequiring the Office of Management and Budget, through its existing \nresponsibilities under the ``Paperwork Reduction Act'' and the \n``Clinger-Cohen Act,'' to develop policies to promote the use of \nalternative information technologies, including the use of electronic \nmaintenance, submission, or disclosure of information to substitute for \npaper, and the use and acceptance of electronic signatures.\n  The Federal government is lagging behind the rest of the nation in \nusing new technologies. Individuals who deal with the Federal \ngovernment should be able to reduce the cumulative burden of meeting \nthe Federal government's information demands through the use of \ninformation technology. This language hopefully will provide the \nmotivation that the Federal government needs to make this possible for \nour nation's citizens.\n  I thank Senator Abraham for offering us the opportunity to work with \nhim on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11324-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, we are reaching the final days of this \nCongress, and the leadership is deciding about which measures the \nSenate is going to consider during these final few days.\n  As I mentioned previously, we have identified a number of different \npieces of legislation that I don't believe, and I don't think the \nAmerican people believe rise up in importance as to protecting the \nfamilies of this country with the kinds of protections that we would \nhave with our Patients' Bill of Rights. But, we have been unable to \nhave this legislation up before the Senate, to have it debated and \ndiscussed, and to have a resolution by this body in a timely way.\n  As I have mentioned on other occasions, it is Friday afternoon at 2 \no'clock and most Americans are still working. The Senate should be, on \nan issue of this importance, still here and debating these issues and \nresolving these matters in ways which I think, with a full debate and \nan open discussion, resolve these matters in favor of the families, in \nfavor of the patients, in favor of this country.\n  It is a very basic and fundamental issue--whether we are going to \nhave the medical professionals--the doctors and nurses--make the \nultimate judgment in terms of health care, or whether those decisions \nare going to be made by the HMOs, the insurance companies, and their \naccountants.\n  For all Americans who are participating in these HMOs, they have paid \nthe premiums and they expect their medical treatment will be decided by \nmedical professionals, and not accountants in the insurance industry.\n  I doubt very much whether these HMOs--when they are out recruiting \nnew members to join and pay their premiums from their hard-earned money \nwhich they work for every single day--are saying, ``Well, we want you \nto know that the people who are going to be making decisions about your \nhealth care are going to be the accountants, and not the doctors we are \nreferencing in our pamphlets.''\n  Mr. President, this morning in the Wall Street Journal on the front \npage there was a rather ominous report. This is from this morning, \nFriday, October 2nd, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal: \n``Politicians seek to profit from the debate over health-care \npolicies.''\n  This is the debate--the one issue--that is before the U.S. Senate, \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. There are other health care issues. But \nthis is the health care issue that commands the wide-range support of \nover 180 different organizations reflecting all of the various medical \nprofessionals--all the\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\nnurses, all the cancer patient organizations, all of the children's \norganizations, all of the disability organizations, and all of the \nwomen organizations. They have all virtually embraced and endorsed this \nhealth care debate that we have been trying to have. The debate has \nbeen rather one-sided since we have not been able to have engagement \nfrom the other side on this issue.\n  We have the Wall Street Journal saying the following. This is an \nexact quote:\n\n       The GOP's congressional campaign committee invites a \n     ``select group'' of health-care-industry leaders to a meeting \n     Tuesday on the issue. The ticket price: $25,000 each.''\n\n  $25,000 each.\n\n       The meeting ``will last one hour'' only, says an invitation \n     signed by Illinois Representative Hastert and California \n     Representative Thomas. That would exceed $400 a minute per \n     person for the fundraiser.\n\n  These are the two leading Republican House Members that have been \nopposed to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Evidently, Mr. President, we \nhave been unable to get this measure before the Senate of the United \nStates--we find that because of the fact that the legislation has been \nshelved, pigeonholed, the result is that our Republican friends are \nhaving a ``select group'' of health care industry leaders who will pay \n$25,000 to go to a meeting.\n  Mr. President, let us look at the most recent report of last month, a \nnew study by Common Cause, which I saw this morning. I asked my staff \nto get the most recent study by Common Cause about contributions to the \nRepublican National Committee by this industry. They reported that the \nindustry which gave the most soft money to the Republicans of any group \nwas the insurance industry.\n  It is very interesting that here we have the industry paying $25,000 \neach for each of their personnel to go to a fundraiser with people who \nhave been effectively there to sidetrack this legislation. Then, when \nwe look back, we find out the insurance industry has opened up its \ncoffers to the party that is keeping us from debating this and \nresolving this in the U.S. Senate.\n  That is what is happening. The American people do not understand \nthat. If they don't understand very much, they understand this: That \nCommon Cause reported that in the first 6 months of this year they gave \n$5.5 million. This is where they have contributed.\n  I daresay we will find out as we move on through, month by month, and \nthen at the end of the year the reports will come in after the election \nabout what they have done in terms of the various candidates.\n  This is what we are faced with on the one hand. This is what we are \nfaced with: Big money and powerful special interests denying the \nopportunity for the interests of these various organizations and the \npeople they represent--not just Members of the U.S. Senate who favor \nthis position but those who are really the constituencies of these \norganizations. We are talking about the Children's Legal Defense Fund \nthat has represented the interests of the children. We are talking \nabout the range of different groups that have been representing the \ndisabled. We are talking about the medical societies representing the \ndoctors and nurses societies--denying those particular interests the \nopportunity for debate on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, earlier today we heard some very moving testimony. It \nhas been typical of the testimony that we have been hearing over the \nperiod of recent weeks and months.\n  This is by Mr. A.G. Newmyer of The Epilepsy Foundation.\n  I will include the statements in their entirety. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by A.G. Newmyer III, the Epilepsy Foundation, October 2, 1998\n\n       Good morning. My name is Newmyer and I'm here on behalf of \n     the 2.5 million Americans who have seizure disorders, and \n     their families. Some of these folks are well known to you--\n     former Congressman Tony Coelho, Representative Neil \n     Abercrombie, Congressman Hoyer's late wife. Others are total \n     strangers--like me. And a couple hundred people on the Hill \n     either have epilepsy or someone in their family does, but you \n     don't know about it because stigma and fear keep these folks \n     in the closet.\n       The Epilepsy Foundation urges passage of strong patients' \n     rights legislation. Today's health insurance system is a \n     mean-spirited, predatory mess. But it's far worse for people \n     with special medical needs.\n       Those of you who cover this debate may recall that Tracy \n     Buccholz from MN was the first public witness before the \n     President's commission on health care. Tracy has epilepsy and \n     led a rather normal life until her health plan started \n     playing games with her life. She explained to the commission, \n     when she came to Washington to testify, that she had been \n     waiting eight months for permission to see her neurologist, \n     despite the literature and promises of her plan.\n       I'd like to make three brief points this morning:\n       First, the member satisfaction statistics are pure \n     nonsense. If I asked each of you how you like your life \n     insurance, you'd think I was nuts. You'd tell me that you \n     think it's fine--you never had to use it. The same thing's \n     true for the 80 percent of Americans who have no significant \n     medical need in any one year. I urge the press to focus on \n     satisfaction among plan participants who have faced a serious \n     medical need.\n       Second, to those members who say they don't want to \n     interfere in the insurance market, let's be serious. The user \n     isn't the customer. Most patients get insurance at work and \n     have very little choice. When the person making the purchase \n     decision isn't the user of the service, it's not a market. \n     It's an anomaly. And it needs to be fixed. Now.\n       Finally, I know of no other segment of our society where \n     some people elect to engage in predatory behavior knowing \n     that the victims can't go to court. No patients want more \n     lawsuits. Patients want health plans to stop horsing around. \n     Patients want to fix a system where some people prosper by \n     denying care. The key is ERISA reform, which is why it's \n     being fought so hard by for-profit managed care plans.\n       I leave you with this thought. Steve Wiggins, CEO of \n     Oxford, made $29 million before he was fired. Last year, with \n     his company \\1/2\\ way down the toilet, he left with $9 \n     million in severance. The CEO of Aetna-United took home \n     $17,693,000 during the past three years.\n       Do you really think those plans can't afford for people \n     with seizures to have easy access to decent care?\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Don't Let the Clock Run Out on Patient Protections\n\n    (Statement By Debra L. Ness, Executive Vice President National \n                   Partnership for Women & Families)\n\n       Good morning. My name is Debra Ness, and I am executive \n     vice president of the National Partnership for Women & \n     Families. I'm here today on behalf of the leadership \n     organizations working for passage of the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights Act, S. 1890. More than 180 groups--representing \n     patients, doctors, nurses, other health care professionals, \n     women, children, people with disabilities, small businesses \n     and people of faith--support this Patients' Bill of Rights, \n     and I am here to say to Congress: don't let the clock run out \n     on patient protections! Americans deserve better from their \n     elected officials!\n       Today, we are sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott, demanding that the Senate fulfill its \n     responsibility to represent the people's interest. We need a \n     full and fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights Act \n     before the end of this session. Every day Congress delays, \n     patients suffer:\n       Imagine your father being sick, and watching helplessly as \n     his insurance company overrules his doctor about what \n     treatment is best for him.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine your wife being told she can't participate in a \n     clinical trial that might be the only opportunity to save her \n     life.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine your child becoming permanently disabled because \n     your insurance company wouldn't let you go to the nearest \n     emergency room.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine the chronic disease you have managed for years \n     suddenly going awry because your cost-conscious health plan \n     refused to let you continue using the medication that helped \n     stabilize your condition.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       We've talked with women around the country who told us with \n     great passion how they believe the health care industry has \n     abandoned patients for profits. Single women, mothers, \n     grandmothers; corporate executives and Medicaid recipients; \n     Democrats and Republicans, African-Americans, whites, Asians, \n     Hispanics. The consistency of their concerns was \n     extraordinary. And it is clear that women do not trust the \n     industry to fix itself. They desperately want health plans to \n     provide quality care, and they are convinced that government \n     must play a role in setting quality standards.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Just one bill responds to these legitimate and deep-felt \n     concerns, and that is S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights \n     Act. It is the only bill that gives patients real \n     protections, not phony substitutes. Unfortunately, the House \n     has already passed a sham proposal that would actually \n     reverse what little progress has been made so far. But the \n     Senate has an opportunity--and an obligation to Americans--to \n     enact meaningful patient protections by passing S. 1890, the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights Act.\n       The Senate has three choices:\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\n       (1) It can do nothing and ignore the will of the people;\n       (2) It can deliver a bill that pretends to solve managed \n     care's problems; or\n       (3) It can deliver the real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n       There is only one right choice, and there's absolutely no \n     excuse for the U.S. Senate to get it wrong.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The key is ERISA reform, which is why it's \n     being fought so hard by for-profit managed care plans.\n       Do you really think these plans can't afford for people \n     with seizures to have easy access to decent care?\n\n  That is very moving, Mr. President, and clearly all of the \norganizations want us to debate and resolve these issues, because every \nsingle day they know that the lives of their members, like other \nAmericans' lives, are being threatened by the abuses in the HMO system.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is Debra Ness, executive vice president \nof the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\n       We need a full and fair debate on the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights Act before the end of this session. Every day Congress \n     delays, patients suffer:\n       Imagine your father being sick, and watching helplessly as \n     his insurance company overrules his doctor about what \n     treatment is best for him.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine your wife being told she can't participate in a \n     clinical trial that might be the only opportunity to save her \n     life.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine your child becoming permanently disabled because \n     your insurance company wouldn't let you go to the nearest \n     emergency room.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Imagine the chronic disease you have managed for years \n     suddenly going awry because your cost-conscious health plan \n     refused to let you continue using the medication that helped \n     stabilize your condition. [This happens, Mr. President. This \n     happens.]\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       We've talked with women around the country who told us with \n     great passion how they believe the health care industry has \n     abandoned patients for profits. They desperately want health \n     plans to provide quality care, and they are convinced that \n     government must play a role in setting quality standards.\n       And yet . . . Congress delays.\n       Just one bill responds to these legitimate and deep-felt \n     concerns, and that is S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights \n     Act. It is the only bill that gives patients real \n     protections, not phony substitutes. The Senate has an \n     opportunity--and an obligation to Americans--to enact \n     meaningful patient protections by passing S. 1890, the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights Act.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter signed by a number of organizations saying:\n\n       We, the leadership organizations working for passage of the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights. . .ask [the majority leader] to \n     schedule a full and fair debate before the close of the 105th \n     Congressional session.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the letter be printed in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Support The Patients'\n\n\n                                               Bill of Rights,\n\n                                                  October 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lott: As you know, there are only a few weeks \n     left to pass meaningful patient protection legislation. We, \n     the leadership organizations working for passage of the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 1890) ask that you schedule a \n     full and fair debate before the close of the 105th \n     Congressional session. There are now more than 180 \n     organizations supporting S. 1890.\n       Support for patient protection legislation has grown in the \n     last year. In fact, after being presented with arguments pro \n     and con, 65 percent of Americans believe the government needs \n     to pass legislation to protect them from managed care \n     industry abuses, according to a recent survey conducted by \n     Harvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation. People across the \n     country are calling for debate and passage of real patient \n     protections.\n       We urge that the Senate fulfill its responsibility to \n     represent the people's interests. While Congress delays, \n     people are being denied access to the specialists they need, \n     denied coverage for clinical trials that may save their \n     lives, and harmed by bureaucrats making medical decisions \n     based on cost concerns rather than patient care needs.\n       There is an urgent need for this legislation, and because \n     of this urgency we request a meeting with you so that we can \n     personally convey the critical importance of this issue to \n     the people across America that we represent.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter. \n     We look forward to hearing from you soon. Please contact \n     Judith L. Lichtman, President, National Partnership for Women \n     & Families, with your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sandy Bernard, President, American Association of \n           University Women; Peggy Taylor, Director, Department of \n           Legislation, American Federation of Labor-Congress of \n           Industrial Organizations; Charles M.

Mr. President, there is increasing concern within the \nUnited States, and quite properly, for the fate of the people of \nKosovo. I wish to address my concerns, in what I deliver to the Senate \nthis afternoon, in what are entirely my remarks. I take full \nresponsibility for the views and opinions that I express. I have, \nhowever, availed myself of every opportunity to learn firsthand about \nthe critical nature of this problem, including a visit several weeks \nago to this region which included a trip to Bosnia, thence to Belgrade, \nthence to Macedonia, and then into Kosovo. I commend the Ambassadors \nfrom the United States to Macedonia and--he has the rank of DCM--to \nSerbia for their very diligent and hard work in representing the \ninterests of our Government and, indeed, those of our principal allies. \nThat is Ambassador Hill and Ambassador Miles. I spent a considerable \ntime with both.\n\n  Likewise, I was given the opportunity in Kosovo to visit with a group \nknown as KDOM, which is an unusual group constituted following \nnegotiations between our Ambassadors and, as I understand, their \ncounterparts in Belgrade whereby this group of U.S. military and \ndiplomatic, Russian military and diplomatic, Canadian military and \ndiplomatic and, indeed, some of the EU nations, are given the \nopportunity to travel without weapons into certain regions of Kosovo \nfor the purpose of observing--and I repeat--observing the tragic \nunfolding of atrocities throughout that country. I joined them in their \narmored cars for the purpose of this visit and then had the opportunity \nto be debriefed extensively by these individuals.\n  They are doing a remarkable job taking personal risks and providing \nthe free world with an inside examination of this serious and critical \nproblem. I wish to pay them tribute. I also was able, when I returned, \nto visit with the NATO commander, General Clark, to get them some \nadditional equipment to carry out their missions.\n  I have also, like most Senators, availed myself, since 1992, of the \nopportunities to visit in Bosnia and to study the complex issues that \nbrought about that tragic period of hostilities, which hostilities now \nhave been brought to some measure of conclusion, largely because of the \nallied forces that are in there providing the security so that the \nDayton accords can be implemented.\n  In this entire region, referred to as the Balkans, you cannot touch \none spot without affecting, in my judgment, the others.\n  Now NATO, the United Nations, the United States--all of us --are \nfaced with the following situation: Repeatedly in Kosovo atrocities are \ntaking place against innocent human beings, largely innocent. We have \nno way of judging their culpability in the separatist movement \ninitiated sometime ago by the forces known as the KLA, but while I was \nthere, I saw the houses being burned, I saw armed people, I saw the \nhopeless refugees numbering in the hundreds of thousands who had been \ndriven into the hills and wanted to do the right thing, to alleviate \nthe human suffering. That is the main threshold.\n  Also, our Nation and our allies have put a very considerable \ninvestment, first, of the risks taken by our military and diplomatic \npeople and the NGOs--those of nongovernmental organizations who have \nbrought relief to this region--we have put an enormous investment of \ntime and effort to bring about a cessation of those hostilities. In my \njudgment, unless this situation in Kosovo is likewise secured, it could \nundermine such advances, although modest, in my judgment, that we have \nmade collectively as nations in this region. First is humanitarian \nconcern for the people; second is to prevent instability as a \nconsequence of this conflict, erasing some of the gains that we have \nhad there.\n  Lastly, our Nation is proud of the fact that we are the leader, in my \njudgment, in NATO. Only NATO is the only military force that can and, \nindeed, should be employed if it is necessary to bring about the \ncessation of hostilities in Kosovo.\n  The administration has made efforts, I think many bona fide efforts, \nthrough the diplomatic chain--speaking directly with Milosevic in \nBelgrade. We have been joined by other nations, referred to as the \n``contact group.'' I think every effort has been made diplomatically in \nthe past that could have been made, and now that effort is strengthened \nby a degree day by day of the assertion by the United Nations with \nregard to their growing concern about the humanitarian problems taking \nplace in Kosovo.\n  But in no way should the military option, which has to back up \ndiplomacy--diplomacy can be no more effective than the credibility of \nthe willingness of certain nations to back up that diplomatic effort--\nin no way should the United Nations, in my judgment, have any veto over \nthe decision of the collection of nations--the United States being one, \nGreat Britain, France, Germany and others--to take such action as they \ndeem necessary to bring about a cessation of the tragic situation in \nKosovo.\n  I want to repeat that. Never should the United Nations be put in the \nposition, nor NATO allow itself to be put in a position, where the \nUnited Nations has a veto power over the decisionmaking of NATO. But I \nthink the annunciations by the Security Council recently give adequate \ncover for those nations who wish to collectively act, if necessary, to \nback up their diplomacy with military action.\n  That military action, in my judgment, has very severe consequences. I \nwant to make it clear, speaking for myself, that I support the use of \nforce if diplomacy fails, and that is a tough position to take, because \nI have had grave reservations through these many years about our \ncontinued participation and expenditure and deployment of troops in \nBosnia, but in the final resolution of the Dayton accords, I felt that \nI would lend my support, and did, for the putting in of the SFOR and \nIFOR forces. They have, as I say, to some modest degree, achieved the \nmilestones set out in the Dayton accords. But, in my judgment, of \ncourse, we took a step backward, regrettably, as a consequence of the \nrecent elections. Nevertheless, always focus on the considerable \ninvestment we have put in that region and how that investment can be \njeopardized unless the Kosovo situation is stopped in terms of the \natrocities.\n  How do we do it? My concern is the discussion in the open thus far--\nand I have availed myself of classified sources and I will only address \nthe open discussion--is that the use of air power will bring about a \nsituation whereby Milosevic in Belgrade will cease the directions and \ncease sending the Serb Army and the police associated with the Serb \nArmy to stop perpetrating these atrocities. I think if that air power \nwere absolutely and unequivocally of a magnitude that could get that \nattention, then it would work. But, in my judgment, air alone will not \nsatisfy the situation.\n  There is a very interesting fact of Kosovo that is well known: that \nthe Kosovar Albanians number about 90 percent of the population, and 10 \npercent are of Serb ethnicity. Yet, for the past several years, ever \nsince Milosevic I think wrongfully stripped Kosovo province of a \ncertain degree of its autonomy years ago, the Serbians have pretty well \ncontrolled that region. And they have used repressive forces against \nthe Kosovars for years.\n\n  This insurrection did not happen overnight. It has been coming on for \nmany years. I visited Kosovo in 1991 with Senator Dole, with Senator \nNickles, and others. We went into that region. And we saw with our own \neyes the tension that was developing. But the point I wish to make, the \nair operation, I am confident, could be of such a magnitude as to seal \noff and stop the flow of supplies, the professional Army and, indeed, I \nthink many of the supplemental police forces that have come down from \nSerbia to perpetrate these atrocities. That can be done.\n  But then we leave a region which is affiliated largely 90 percent \nwith the Kosovar Albanians pitted against the 10 percent remnants of \nthe Serbian force. And it is my judgment that that situation would \nquickly destabilize and you would experience atrocities of a greater \nmagnitude than are taking place in the recent weeks and, indeed, for \nmany, many months in that region.\n  I want to point out these atrocities, the greater proportion of the \natrocities, I think, are directly linked to Milosevic and the Serbian \ninterests. But there have been instances where the Kosovar Albanians \nhave perpetrated atrocities of a comparable\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\nmagnitude in viciousness, but of course not in a magnitude of totality \nof loss of life in that region. So both sides come to this problem not \nwith clean hands at all, in my judgment.\n  The Kosovar Albanians have as one of their objectives a greater \nAlbania. You have virtual anarchy now in Albania. You have large \npopulations of the refugees that have left Albania in Montenegro. That \nis destabilized. You have some in Macedonia. Indeed, these refugees are \nthroughout this region. And in the event that force has to be used as a \nconsequence of the failure of diplomatic efforts, my concern is that \nthe KLA will view that as the allies, the nations of NATO, coming to \ntheir aid and supporting their long-term goal of a greater Albania. \nThat is very troublesome, Mr. President, very troublesome.\n  That is why I believe--and, again, it is my judgment--that any \nmilitary action to bring about a cessation of the current level of \natrocities in Kosovo has to be associated with what I call a ground \nelement or a stabilizing force that would prevent a greater level of \ninsurrection amongst the populations of predominantly 90 percent \nKosovar Albanians and 10 percent Serbs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has only a few \nseconds left of his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I ask unanimous consent for additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see that my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma is \nhere. I could finish in 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No. Go ahead and finish.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I will resume my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much more time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I go back to the situation and recap \nquickly. As I look at what is in the open, as I say, reported in the \nNew York Times, the Washington Post--and recently we have had some \nexcellent reporting about the military options being examined by NATO--\nthey either intentionally or otherwise leave out any reference to a \nstabilizing force and the need for that force in Kosovo. And that is \nthe basic reason why I take the floor of the Senate today, to express \nmy own professional judgment that any air operation to alleviate the \nsuffering here has to have, very speedily, a follow-up ground presence \nin Kosovo to prevent what I predict would be an increased clash among \nthese peoples with the absence of a stabilizing force.\n  I think it is very important that the President, if he is \ncontemplating the use of force, together with the heads of state of \nother nations, come to the Congress, come to the American people and \npoint out--if I am wrong, point it out. But I have consulted a great \nmany people about this situation. As I say, I saw it myself weeks ago. \nThe hatred between the Kosovar Albanians and the remnants of the Serbs \nthat are still there is incredible. It is beyond the ability of anybody \nreally to explain it. They will fall upon themselves as they come down \nout of these hills.\n  There are maybe as much as a quarter of a million people--refugees--\nin these hills. When they return to their villages and homes, which I \nsaw, which are burned and destroyed, and see the looting and the \ndestruction, both of human beings and property, they will be incensed, \nand I think they will turn to fighting themselves. And that is a \nsituation we cannot allow to happen as a consequence of an air \noperation there and in other areas of that region.\n  It would bring about greater instability, in my judgment, in Bosnia, \nthat sort of insurrection. It could bring it about in Macedonia. It \ncould feed into the instability here. Montenegro is an integral part of \nSerbia. There is a good deal of competition between the head of state \nand government in Montenegro and Milosevic in Serbia. And that \nsituation would be exacerbated.\n  You must always remember, if airstrikes go against the Serbs, Greece \nhistorically has had long relationships with Serbia, as has Russia. \nRussia now has a very important part of the military that is stationed \nin Bosnia. What are the consequences that will flow with those two \nnations if we strike against Serbia?\n  So I basically conclude my remarks by saying that I think that any \noperation will have to explain why it is the judgment of those \npreparing this operation that the ground element is not necessary \nbefore this Senator is going to sign off and lend his support.\n  In my judgment, it is an essential part of any operation to prevent \nwhat I predict would be a greater increase of tragedies there. \nNevertheless, with the absence of the Serbian Army and the police, \nother fighting would quickly fall behind.\n  Furthermore, if you are to help these quarter of a million refugees, \nyou have to bring in food, medicine, supplies and shelter. How could \nthese be brought in if there is a virtual civil war going on? \nTherefore, without a stabilizing force, you are not going to be able to \nget the NGO support and such other support that is essential to be \nbrought to bear in that region in the coming weeks, as weather closes \nin on these hopeless, hapless people who are now confined in the hills.\n  Furthermore, if you start bombing in this region, that will create \nanother group of refugees who will begin to flee from the sites that \neither have been bombed or sites that are likely to be bombed if the \nfirst raid or the second raid doesn't succeed. So the quarter million \ndown here will grow in number by many more refugees in this situation. \nThen they will start, in my judgment, flowing across the borders.\n  I do not believe to the extent this plan has been discussed in the \nopen--largely by the press--that this is a workable operation. At this \ntime I could not lend my support, although I support a plan that would \nbring about the cessation of this tragic killing that is going on in \nKosovo. The likely and precipitous undermining of what progress we have \nmade in Bosnia and the fact that NATO would be viewed as not fulfilling \nits mission under the leadership of the United States are the reasons \ncompelling us to look at this operation.\n  If we are going to do it, let's make certain we do it properly to \nachieve the goals of humanitarian relief and the lessening of the \nkillings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to congratulate and \ncompliment my colleague from Virginia for a very thoughtful speech, and \nalso for his homework in this area, and the fact that he spent some \ntime traveling to this troubled region of the world.\n  I had the pleasure of traveling with Senator Warner and Senator Dole, \nI believe in 1991. We met with Mr. Milosevic and we traveled into \nKosovo. I became convinced that Mr. Milosevic was a tyrant. I still \nbelieve he is. He needs to be stopped. We need to have affirmative \naction to stop him. We have had strong words from this administration. \nWe have had very little action. I am not convinced they have a plan \nthat will fully complement their desires, so I am concerned about that.\n  But I am also working with other colleagues in this body to try to \nsee that the United States and NATO stand up to Milosevic and try to \ndevelop a plan that is workable. I appreciate the fact that my \ncolleague from Virginia is willing to speak out and lend his experience \nand education in this area. Maybe together we can come up with \nsomething that will work and stop the atrocities, but also avoid some \nof the pitfalls that could easily have happened in Bosnia, where some \nof us were concerned about the cost and the expense.\n  Some of us felt misled by this administration when they said we would \nonly be in Bosnia for a short period of time. We stated that wasn't the \ncase. We knew that wasn't the case. We knew we wouldn't be limited to 1 \nyear. Frankly, they misled Congress and they misled the American people \nas far as the commitment in Bosnia. I want to avoid that repetition of \nthat as it pertains to Kosovo.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nfriend. I wish to commend the leadership of Senator Lott and yourself, \nSenator Helms, Senator Thurmond, Senator Domenici, Senator McCain, and \nmany of us who have quietly begun to try to\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\nlook at this situation, to give constructive advice to Senator Lott and \nyourself. I think that, hopefully, that message will get to the \nadministration.\n  At the moment, I am expressing my own view. I am not satisfied with \nwhat I have seen in the open about this plan. I think it has to \nincorporate pieces which will bring about a stabilization of the \npotential conflict that could take place in the aftermath of an \nairstrike.\n  The Senator rightly points out we had the Joint Chiefs before the \nArmed Services Committee the other day seeking additional funds for \ncritical needs in our forces, and we have now expended by our Nation up \nto $9 billion in Bosnia--much of that coming out of the military \nbudget. It is unprogrammed, unbudgeted. We are taking funds out of R, \noperation and maintenance accounts. That has a direct adverse effect on \nthe readiness and the lifestyle of our men and women in the Armed \nForces.\n  We will take steps to correct that, but I think the Senator is \nabsolutely right. I thank the Senator and the distinguished majority \nleader for the work they have done.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to conclude the dialog on Kosovo, the \nadministration gave most Members of the Senate a briefing yesterday, \nbut they have a lot of work to do. They have a lot of work to do if \nthey are going to convince the Congress, if they are going to convince \nthe American people. They have a lot of leveling with the American \npeople as far as the expense, as far as the obligation, as far as what \nthe next step is after the first phase. They haven't answered those \nquestions.\n  That is not exactly what I call ``consulting with Congress.'' Maybe \nwe had a little dialog with the administration, but we have a lot of \nwork to do yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for bringing that up. I \nparticipated, of course, in those briefings.\n  I am not here to advocate the U.S. ground forces in Kosovo. It seems \nto me if there is an air operation that the United States--because of \nits particular type of aircraft and munitions--would have to take a \nlead in that and then the role of the stabilization force should fall \nto other allies, in my judgment. I think you can't have one without the \nother.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11328-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11330-S11333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, earlier today, I, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Specter, Senator Coats, Senator Akaka, as well as Congressman \nWolf, and other leaders of various religious organizations, had a press \nconference discussing the International Religious Freedom Act. We came \nout and spoke in favor of Congress passing the International Religious \nFreedom Act this year.\n  I tell my colleagues, I very much hope and expect we will do that. I \nthink it is one of the highest priorities we have left before we \nadjourn this session.\n  The issue of religious persecution and freedom is an issue that I \nhave been working on, as many others have, for a long time. I very much \nvalue the opportunity and the right and the privilege that I have as an \nAmerican citizen to worship as I please, where I please, how I please. \nIn fact, I believe it is one of the most precious rights that any of us \nhave as a citizen of this country.\n  Unfortunately, too many people in too many countries do not have that \nright. It is unfortunate that in many places all around the world, \nreligious persecution is a common practice. It happens in more \ncountries than we can imagine. There are far too many state laws and \npolicies that restrict religious freedom.\n  For many years, I have worked with my colleagues, Senator Helms, \nSenator Lugar and Senator Nunn, to help win freedom for those around \nthe world who suffer because of religious beliefs. While we have been \nsuccessful on many occasions, sadly, in some cases, we haven't been. \nMost of this work has been done, I might mention, quietly and behind \nthe scenes.\n  In 1996, I was honored to sponsor a Senate resolution on religious \npersecution, which passed by unanimous consent. In that resolution, the \nSenate made a strong recommendation ``that the President expand and \ninvigorate the United States' international advocacy on behalf of \npersecuted Christians, and initiate a thorough examination of all the \nUnited States' policies that affect persecuted Christians.''\n  Unlike the resolution that we helped get through the Senate 2 years \nago, the legislation we are talking about today makes no distinction as \nto the faith of those who are being persecuted. This bill, I believe, \nwill benefit all persons of all faiths who are persecuted for \npracticing their religion.\n  Congressman Frank Wolf and Senator Arlen Specter have done a great \njob during the past year and a half in bringing this issue to the \nattention of the American public. I want to thank my friend, \nCongressman Wolf, for his leadership in the House, and of course all \nthose persons in the House who passed a similar bill with a record \nvote, 375-41. Now, we in the Senate have a historic opportunity to \nfinish the job that was started by the House, by passing the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Specter, for his \nleadership as original sponsor of the resolution. His work on our \nlegislation, I think, has added considerably to the effectiveness of \nthe bill.\n  I also want to thank Senators Grams and Hagel who worked with us to \nmodify the bill to ensure that what we are doing is responsible and it \nis done in a careful way. I think with their efforts we have crafted a \nbill that can be supported by all Senators, as evidenced by the fact \nthat a broad spectrum of grassroots organizations have endorsed this \nbill.\n  We have 29 Senate cosponsors, and I expect we will have more shortly. \nWe have 21 groups that are supporting our bill who are advocating \nreligious freedom. Those organizations include: the Religious Liberty \nCommission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association \nof Evangelicals, the International Fellowship of Jews and Christians, \nthe Christian Coalition, the Episcopal Church, the Anti-Defamation \nLeague, Advocates International, the National Jewish Coalition, \nTraditional Values Coalition, American Jewish Committee, Justice \nFellowship, the Catholic Conference, B'Nai B'rith International, the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church of America, Catholic Conference of Major \nSuperiors of Men's Institutes, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Union \nof American Hebrew Congregations, Union of Orthodox Jewish \nCongregations of America, National Conference of Soviet Jewry, the \nUnited Methodist Church-Women's Division, and the American Coptic \nAssociation.\n\n  The Episcopal Church stated the following about the International \nReligious Freedom Act in a letter to each office on Capitol Hill:\n\n       The Nickles-Lieberman bill is a moderate, flexible response \n     to human rights abuses that strikes the right balance between \n     imposing inflexible sanctions in overlooking serious human \n     rights abuses.\n\n  The Catholic conference stated the following in a letter to my \noffice:\n\n       The bill is a reasonable and thoughtful effort to ensure \n     that religious liberty has its rightful place in U.S. policy \n     while preserving the authority of the Executive to pursue \n     legitimate foreign policy goals. It deserves broad, \n     bipartisan support and should be considered before Congress \n     adjourns.\n\n  B'nai B'rith International, The Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations, and The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of \nAmerica signed a letter to me stating:\n\n       Passage of this bill would underscore our nation's \n     commitment to human rights worldwide and lend hope to \n     millions of religious believers who suffer because of their \n     faith. Failure to act now on this legislation would send a \n     dangerous signal to persecutors that they can act with \n     impunity.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is a tragic reality that literally millions of \nreligious believers around the world live with the terrifying prospect \nof persecution--of being tortured, arrested, imprisoned, or even killed \nsimply for their faith. Millions more around the world are denied, by \ngovernment policy, the ability to practice their religion.\n  I believe that this bill can be an effective tool in helping to \nresolve the problem of religious persecution throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S11331]]\n\n  The International Religious Freedom Act will establish a process to \nensure that on an ongoing basis, the United States closely monitors \nreligious persecution worldwide.\n  International Religious Freedom Act uses a broad definition of \nreligious persecution. This definition ranges in scope from the most \negregious form of religious persecution--imprisonment, torture or \ndeath--to the most common--the inability of one to speak freely about \none's religion, or to change religion. That's right. There are \nprohibitions in certain countries on changing your religion, on talking \nabout your religion, or practicing your religion.\n  This is an important aspect of the bill. If the definition of \nreligious persecution were limited to only torture, imprisonment or \ndeath, the International Religious Freedom Act would only cover about a \nfew countries, and would not include about 80 to 85 percent of the \nreligious persecution that takes place in the world--the ability to \npractice one's religion. We adopted this standard to ensure that we \naddress the problem before it escalates to torture and murder.\n  Under the provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act, the \nPresident is required to take action against those countries that \nengage in religious persecution. However, the President is given a menu \nof options, fifteen items, from which he can choose the most \nappropriate response. In addition, the President is given the \ndiscretion to calibrate that action in response to each country's \nparticular situation.\n  In essence, this allows the President to weigh a variety of factors \nsuch as strategic importance, the historical relationship between the \nUnited States and that country and the severity of the religious \npersecution in that country when determining an action.\n  I believe this flexibility also makes the International Religious \nFreedom Act more effective. We provide the President with a menu of \noptions that makes it make likely that he will take action.\n  We need to keep our eye on the goal. The goal of our bill is not to \npunish countries, but to change behavior, and if it is more likely that \nthe President will take an action, then it is more likely that behavior \nwill change. And that, Mr. President, in my opinion should be the goal \nof any legislation dealing with religious persecution--changing \nbehavior in other countries that persecute people because of their \nfaith.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act, also seeks to promote \nreligious freedom. The bill insists that U.S. foreign assistance should \nplace a priority on developing legal protections and respect for \nreligious freedom, by promoting exchanges and visits of religious \nleaders in the U.S. and abroad, and by making one of the priorities of \nour international broadcast programs the promotion of and respect for \nreligious freedom.\n  This bill is not a classic case of Uncle Sam imposing his views on \nthe world. Although the right to religious freedom undergirds the very \nexistence and origin of this country, the bill only asks other \ncountries to live up to the commitments they have made in international \ndocuments and agreements.\n  For example, article 1, paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United \nNations states one of the purposes of the United Nations is to:\n\n       Achieve international cooperation in . . . promoting and \n     encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental \n     freedoms for all without distinctions as to race, sex, \n     language or religion.\n\n  There are 185 members of the United Nations. Some of the members of \nthe United Nations are the biggest violators of the right to religious \nfreedom.\n  Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\n\n       Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience \n     and religion; this right includes freedom to change his \n     religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community \n     with others and in public or private to manifest his religion \n     or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\n\n  According to a CRS memo, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nwas originally adopted in 1948 at the UN by 48 of the countries that \nbelonged to the UN at that time (eight countries abstained). The \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights is considered as a part of the \nUnited Nations and any country who has joined since 1948 subscribes to \nits principles. No ratification is required.\n\n  Some have suggested that it is inappropriate to elevate religion to a \n``higher'' or ``privileged'' status in U.S. policy on human rights. But \nthe reality is the opposite. We are trying to correct the neglect that \nhas too long existed, where religious persecution has been given a \nlower priority than persecution based on political opinion, labor \nactivities, sexual orientation, what have you. This bill is remedial \nfor years of neglect. Religion must no longer be an afterthought of \nAmerican human rights policy.\n  As the Catholic Conference stated in its letter to me:\n\n       The bill is a reasonable and thoughtful effort to ensure \n     that religious liberty has its rightful place in U.S. policy \n     while preserving the authority of the Executive to pursue \n     legitimate foreign policy goals. It deserves broad, \n     bipartisan support and should be considered before Congress \n     adjourns.\n\n  In June of this year, an Episcopalian Bishop from Pakistan, the Right \nReverend Munawar Rumlash, or Bishop Manno as he is called in the United \nStates, gave gripping testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee about the plight of Christians in Pakistan.\n  Bishop Manno cited the following examples of religious persecution in \nPakistan before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that have \noccurred this year alone.\n  In January, Protestant Pastor Noor Alam was stabbed to death in front \nof his family. Two months before his death, Pastor Alam's church was \ndemolished by a Muslim mob. When he was stabbed to death he was in the \nprocess of rebuilding his church for which he had received several \ndeath threats.\n  On April 27, 1998, Ayub Masih was condemned to death on charges he \nblasphemed the prophet Mohammed by favorably mentioning Salman Rushdie, \nthe author of ``Satanic Verses.'' According to Freedom House, Mr. \nRushdie's book has not been translated into the local Urdu language and \nis unavailable in Pakistan. It is improbable that Ayub Masih ever saw \nor read the book.\n  The blasphemy laws in Pakistan do not just impact Christians. \nAccording to the latest State Department Human Rights Report, the \nAhmadis, a minority sect of Islam that does not accept Mohammed as the \nlast prophet of Islam, also suffer from the religious policies in \nPakistan.\n  Another country in the Middle East imprisoned some 30 Christians for \ndistributing religious material just three months ago. There were \ncredible reports that these people were beaten while in jail.\n  In Nepal, Hinduism is the state religion and it is illegal to \nconvert. Several years ago a gentleman from Oklahoma was arrested for \ndistributing religious material. I worked with our government to get \nhim released from prison.\n  Just recently The American Coptic Association placed an ad in the \nWashington Times highlighting the trials that they are going through. I \nthink there are something like 12 million Coptics in Egypt today.\n  Last summer our Government prepared a report on countries that engage \nin violations of religious freedom. Some 77 countries were listed in \nthat report. I will include that report at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  This is a problem, and we in the Senate have the power to try to do \nsomething to make improvements. That is what this bill is for. I \nbelieve the International Religious Freedom Act has the potential to \nsignificantly improve religious freedom throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, what was a mere resolution in 1996, I hope will become \na reality in 1998. While in 1996 we acted with words, I hope we can act \nnow with deeds by passing the International Religious Freedom Act.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for his leadership, and \nSenator Coats, who has worked on this very, very hard, and the 29 \ncosponsors that we have on this bill. I urge my colleagues to look at \nthis bill, and to work with us to see if we can't pass this bill and \nmake a very positive statement as the United States being a real leader \nto promote religious freedom throughout the world. I thank my \ncolleagues for their patience.\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the countries that were \nincluded in the report on human rights and persecution listed in 1997 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Countries Listed in 1997 Report on Christian Persecution\n\n       1.

Mr. President, during the past 26 years as a U.S. Senator, \nI, like all who sit here, have been confronted with some of the most \nsignificant issues that have faced our Nation in the last quarter \ncentury--issues ranging from who sits on the highest court of the land, \nthe Supreme Court, to whether or not we should go to war. These and \nothers are, obviously, weighty issues. But none of the decisions has \nbeen more awesome, or more daunting, or more compelling than the issue \nof whether to impeach a sitting President of the United States of \nAmerica, a responsibility that no Senator will take lightly.\n  As imposing as this undertaking is, I am sad to say that I have had \nto contemplate this issue twice during my service as a U.S. Senator--\nonce during the term of President Richard Milhous Nixon, and now.\n  While the circumstances surrounding these two events are starkly \ndifferent, the consequences are starkly the same. The gravity of \nremoving a sitting President from office is the same today as it was 26 \nyears ago. And 26 years ago as a much younger U.S. Senator, I took to \nthe floor on April 10, 1974, and said the following:\n\n       In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the \n     American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every \n     newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities \n     throughout the country. The incessant demand for news or \n     rumors of news--whatever its basis of legitimacy--would be \n     overwhelming. The consequential impact on the Federal \n     institutions of government would be intense--and not \n     necessarily beneficial. This is why my plea today [that was \n     1974] is for restraint on the part of all parties involved in \n     the affair.\n\n  It is somewhat presumptuous for any Senator to quote himself. But I \ncite it to point out that my views then with a Republican President are \nthe same as my views today with the Democratic U.S. President. It is \ntime for all parties involved in this affair to show restraint.\n  I rise today because I believe that we are not exercising the \nrestraint as we should. Those words that I said 24 years ago have an \nuncanny ring to them. Furthermore, in 1974, I urged my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate during the Watergate period to learn from the story of \nAlice in Wonderland. I cautioned then that they remember Alice's plight \nwhen the Queen declared, ``Sentence first and verdict afterwards.'' But \nthe need for restraint then is even greater now than it was in 1974.\n  The impeachment question then was not as politically charged as it is \ntoday. In 1974, we were willing to hear all the evidence before we made \nany decision. We had men like Howard Baker and Sam Ervin. We had men \nlike Chairman Peter Rodino. We had Democrats and Republicans. I \nremember a brilliant young Senator from Maine, who was then a \nCongressman named William Cohen, a Republican, and now our Secretary of \nDefense. He was a Congressman from Maine. I remember how serious they \ntook the process, how much restraint they showed, and how bipartisan \ntheir actions were.\n  Today, I hope for our Nation's sake--not the President's, but for our \nNation's sake--that we don't follow the Queen's directive in Alice in \nWonderland to ``sentence first and verdict afterwards,'' and that we \nwill make a wise judgment about the fate of the President after \ndeliberate consideration.\n  My legal training combined with more than a quarter of century of \nexperience in the U.S. Senate, a significant part of that as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, has taught me several important lessons. \nTwo of these are lessons that I believe are appropriate now. First is \nthat an orderly society must first care about justice; and, second, all \nthat is constitutionally permissible may not be just or wise.\n  Let me repeat the latter. All that is constitutionally permissible to \ndo may be not wise to do, or may not be just in the doing.\n  It is with these two very important lessons guiding me that I embark \nupon a very important decision involving our country, our Constitution \nand our President. The power to overturn and undo a popular election by \nthe people for the first time in our Nation's history must be exercised \nwith great care and with sober deliberation.\n  We should not forget that 47.4 million Americans voted for our \nPresident in 1996, and 8.2 million voted for the President's opponent. \nWe should also not forget, as I tell my students in the constitutional \nlaw class I teach on separation of powers, that the entire essence of \nour constitutional system is built upon the notion of the consent of \nthe governed, and when we deign to overturn a decision of the governed, \nwe are on very thin ice.\n  I believe Members of Congress should begin their deliberation with a \nthorough understanding of the impeachment process. They should \nunderstand what the framers of the Constitution intended the standard \nof impeachment to be. I have heard no discussion of that issue thus \nfar. And, further, how the framers of the Constitution intended the \nprocess to work; again, I have heard no discussion of that thus far.\n  Let me say at the outset that what President Clinton did and \nacknowledged to have done is reprehensible. It was, at a minimum, a \nhorrible lapse in judgment, and it has brought shame upon him \npersonally. It has brought shame upon the Office of the Presidency, and \nhis actions have hurt his family, his friends, his supporters, the \ncauses for which he fights, and the country as a whole. I am confident \nthat he fully understands the gravity of what he has done now.\n  Let me also say that I have made no judgment. I have not made any \ndecision on what I think should happen. I have not come to any \nconclusion as to consequences the President should face for his \nshameful behavior, because I believe the oath of office that I have \ntaken on five solemn occasions--four which were right here in the well, \nand one which was in a hospital in Wilmington, DE--on those five \noccasions, the oath that I took I believe precludes me, and I will \nrespectfully suggest any other Senator, from prejudging, as I and all \nother Senators may be required to serve as the Constitution dictates, \nas judge and juror in what may become the trial of this century. I can \nonly make--and I would respectfully suggest\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\nall of us can only make--an assessment after hearing all the evidence, \nevidence against the President and evidence in support of the \nPresident. No one knows, to the best of my knowledge, but the Lord \nAlmighty, how all this will turn out. However, because this is the \nsecond time in my career I have had to face this awesome \nresponsibility, I have given this topic a great deal of thought and \nconsideration and would like to explore, with the indulgence of the \nPresiding Officer, some of the issues that I believe will surely \nconfront responsible Members of Congress and all Americans as we enter \nthis difficult period in our history.\n\n  Mr. President, the framers of the Constitution who met in \nPhiladelphia in the summer of 1787 considered--and this is a fact \nlittle known, at least little spoken to--offering this country a \nConstitution that did not include the power to impeach the President. \nLet me reemphasize that. The founders considered not including in our \nConstitution the power to remove the President from office. After all, \nthey reasoned, any wrongs against the public would be dealt with by \nturning the President out in the next election. To overturn an \nelection, which I will speak to in a moment, would lend itself to \npolitical chicanery.\n  One delegate to the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinckney of \nSouth Carolina, worried that the threat of impeachment would place the \nPresident under the thumb of a hostile Congress, thereby weakening the \nindependence of the office and threatening the doctrine upon which our \nConstitution was built--the separation of powers. According to James \nMadison's notes, Pinckney called impeachment a ``rod'' that Congress \nwould hold over the President.\n  In being reluctant to include any impeachment power, the framers were \nnot trying to create an imperial Presidency. In fact, what they were \nworried about was protecting all American citizens against the tyranny \nof a select group. In their view, the separation of powers constituted \none of the most powerful means for protecting individual liberty, \nbecause it prevented Government power from being concentrated in any \nsingle branch of Government. To make the separation of powers work \nproperly, they reasoned, each branch must be sufficiently strong and \nindependent from the other so that the power of one branch could not be \nencroached upon by the other.\n  The framers were concerned that any process whereby the legislative \nbranch, the branch they deemed ``the most dangerous,'' could sit in \njudgment of a President who would be vulnerable to the abuse of \npartisan faction which, as my friend and Presiding Officer and gifted \nlawyer knows, was one of the overwhelming, recurring concerns of the \nfounders--partisan politics. They feared that this most dangerous \nbranch could sit in judgment of a President who would be vulnerable to \nabuse by partisan factions.\n  Federalist No. 65 begins its defense of the impeachment process which \nultimately was included by warning of the dangers of the abuse--of the \nabuse--of the power. It argues, Federalist 65, that is, that \nimpeachment:\n\n       . . . will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole \n     community, and to divide them into parties, more or less \n     friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will \n     connect itself with the preexisting factions, and will enlist \n     all their animosities, particularities, influence and \n     interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases \n     there will always be the greatest danger that the decision \n     will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the \n     parties than by the real demonstration of guilt or innocence.\n\n  Don't you find it kind of fascinating that the Federalist Papers, \nwhich were the 1787-1788-1789 version of advertising to sell the \nConstitution, don't you think it fascinating, instead of them writing \nabout, warning about the abuse of power by the President requiring \nimpeachment, they wrote about and were concerned about and more debate \nwas conducted about the abuse of power by political factions in the \nlegislative branch to overturn the will of the American people?\n  So the framers were fully aware that the impeachment process could \nbecome partisan attacks on the President--charged with animosities \ngenerated by all manner of trials, prior struggles and disagreements \nover executive branch decisions, over policy disputes, over resentment \nat losing the prior election, and God only knows what else.\n  Federalist No. 65 expresses the view that the use of impeachment to \nvindicate any of these animosities would actually be an abuse of power. \nSo the power that they were at least equally in part worried about \nbeing abused was the partisan power of a legislative body to overturn a \ndecision of the American people--giving too much power to the \nlegislative branch at the expense of the executive branch, thereby \ndiluting the separation of powers doctrine, concentrating it too much \nin one place and thereby jeopardizing the liberty and freedom of \nindividual Americans.\n  This sentiment that I referred to about the abuse of power by this \nbody and the House is as true today as it was when the Constitution was \nbeing written. It was also true when Richard Nixon faced impeachment in \n1974. In fact, it would have been wrong for Richard Nixon to have been \nremoved from office based upon a purely partisan vote. No President \nshould be removed from office merely because one party enjoys a \ncommanding lead in either House of Congress. And I would remind my \ncolleagues that when I arrived here in 1973, and when the Nixon \nhearings were going on in 1974, the Democratic Party--and he was \nobviously a Republican--enjoyed an overwhelming, commanding plurality \nof votes. My recollection is there were roughly 64 Democratic Members \nof the Senate at the time, and a prohibitively large plurality of \nDemocrats in the House of Representatives. In fact, it would have been \nwrong then, as it would be wrong now, to have removed him based upon \nthe power that was in the hands of one party. No President should be \nremoved merely because one party enjoys a commanding lead in either \nHouse of Congress.\n\n  Yet, while the framers knew that the impeachment process could become \npartisan, they needed to deal with the strong anti-Federalist factions \nthat jeopardized the possibility of the Constitution being ratified by \nthe requisite number of States. The anti-Federalists strenuously argued \nthat the Federal Government would quickly get out of step with the \nsentiments of the people and become vulnerable to corruption and \nintrigue, arrogance and tyranny. These charges proved close to fatal as \nthe ratifying conventions in the States took up the proposed \nConstitution.\n  It was with this looming danger in mind, of losing the ratification \nfight, that the Federalists decided to include the impeachment \nprovision in the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution knew \nthat the Constitution would have been even more vulnerable to charges \nof establishing a government remote from the people if the President \nwere not subject to removal except at the next election.\n  James Madison's notes, again, of the Philadelphia Constitutional \nConvention, record his observations of the debate, where he said he:\n\n       . . . thought it indispensable that some provision should \n     be made for defending the community against the incapacity, \n     negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate, [that is, the \n     President]. The limitation of the period of his service was \n     not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after \n     his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a \n     scheme of speculation or oppression. He might betray his \n     trust to foreign powers.\n\n  So, those concerns, those concerns expressed by Madison about whether \nor not the President might lose his ability to lead, might ``pervert \nhis administration to a scheme of speculation or oppression, might \nbetray his trust to a foreign power''--they were thought to be \nsufficient reason to include the power of impeachment in the \nConstitution. So, in the end, the framers of the Constitution risked \nthe abuse of power by the Congress to gain the advantages of \nimpeachment.\n  Once the decision to include the power of impeachment had been made, \nthe remainder of the debate on the impeachment clause focused on two \nissues. The first debate, which we do not even talk about, was whether \nor not to give the power to the Congress to impeach, and weighed the \nadvantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage was, it would lead to \npartisan bickering and abuse of power by the Congress. But that was \noutweighed, ultimately, in their minds, by the process that a President \ncould and might subvert the interests of this country to a foreign \npower or subvert the office to\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\noppress the people or to take advantage of the office in a way that was \ninappropriate in the minds of the American people.\n  Once that decision was made, though, they then focused on, OK, we are \ngoing to include it, but--but--what was supposed to constitute an \nimpeachable offense? Put another way, what was the standard going to be \nthat they expected the Congress to use? And then they said: After we \ndecide that, we have to decide how is impeachment to work? How is the \nprocess to be undertaken? And what were the procedures that should be \nset down as to how to approach such an awesome undertaking?\n  As we shall see, the framers proved unable to separate these two \nissues entirely. Understanding how they are entwined, however--that is, \nthe question of what constitutes an impeachable offense and how is the \nmechanism to work--understanding how these two issues are intertwined, \nI believe, will help us to understand the full implications of the \npower that the Constitution gives those of us who serve in the \nCongress. The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives \nshall have the power to impeach--article I, section 2, clause 5.\n  The framers' decision that the House of Representatives would \ninitiate the charges of impeachment follows the pattern of the English \nParliament, where the House of Lords initiates charges of impeachment. \nBeyond this, the choice--the choice of the House being given this \npower--must have seemed fairly compelled by two related considerations.\n  The first, already mentioned, was the need to provide the people as a \nwhole with assurances that the Government they were being asked to \ncreate would be responsive to the interests and concerns of the people \nthemselves. So what better place to go than the people's house, the \nHouse of Representatives?\n  The second reason for the House being given this power to initiate \nwas the framers' substantive understanding of the impeachment power. It \nwas a power to hold accountable Government officers who had, in \nHamilton's terms, committed ``an abuse or violation of some public \ntrust,'' thereby committing an injury ``done immediately to the society \nitself.''\n  Keep in mind what they are talking about here--at least what Hamilton \nwas talking about--as to what constituted the kind of offense that was \ncontemplated to be impeachable: Something that was an abuse or \nviolation of the public trust and done immediately to the society \nitself.\n  If the gravamen of an impeachment is the breach of public trust, no \nbranch of the Federal Government could have seemed more appropriate to \ninitiate such a proceeding than the House of Representatives, which was \nconceived and defended as the Chamber most in tune with the people's \nsympathies and hence most appropriate to reflect the people's views as \nto whether the society itself was done immediate harm.\n  The Constitution further provides that the President shall be \n``removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \nBribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article 2, section 4 \nof the U.S. Constitution.\n  The Constitution provides that ``the House of Representatives shall . \n. . have the . . . Power of Impeachment.'' Article I, section 2, clause \n5. And the Senate shall remove from office on ``Impeachment for, and \nConviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.''\n  This language, the language about what he should be removed for, went \nthrough several changes during the summer of 1787. In the initial \ndrafts, the grounds for impeachment--once the debate was over as to \nwhether or not to include impeachment as a power--the initial drafts, \nthe grounds for impeachment, were restricted to treason and bribery \nalone, period; nothing else--not another single thing.\n  I remind my friends who call themselves strict constructionists--I \nhave run into them over my 26-year career and, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, have had numerous debates with now Supreme Court \nJustices, and some who are not Supreme Court Justices, on what is the \nproper methodology for interpreting the Constitution. Those who view \nthemselves as strict constructionists say the words, if their plain \nmeaning is clear, control.\n  Initially this debate, once impeachment was decided upon as a power \nthat would be granted to the Congress, included impeachable offenses \nfor only two purposes: Treason or bribery.\n  When the matter was brought up on September 8, 1787, George Mason, of \nVirginia, inquired as to why the grounds should be restricted only to \nthose two provisions. He reasoned that there are other ways the public \ntrust in government can be abused, so why only these two? He argued:\n\n       Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be treason as \n     above defined.\n\n  So, accordingly, he moved to add the word ``maladministration'' as a \nthird ground for impeachment.\n  James Madison objected to Mason's motion, contending that to add ``so \nvague a term''--the term being maladministration--to add ``so vague a \nterm will be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the \nSenate.''\n  Or put another way, if you said ``maladministration,'' the majority \nparty in the House and the Senate could at any time overturn an \nelection by alleging maladministration. So Madison came along and said, \n``I understand what you are trying to do, old George, to Mason''--my \nwords, not theirs--``I understand what you are trying to do here; we \nacknowledge that you can violate the public trust and abuse the office \nto do injury to the American people other than by treason and \nbribery.'' But if you read Madison's notes, if you read the debate, as \nI have, I challenge you to find an interpretation other than \nessentially what I am giving you here, which is this: ``But, George, if \nyou put maladministration on, it will be subject to too much--too \nmuch--abuse. And, George, I acknowledge that something beyond treason \nand bribery can do harm. But, George, let's be careful what we add.''\n  They debated it. James Madison objected to the motion, as I said, \nbecause it was vague and here, again, we see the worry that impeachment \nwould be misused by the Congress to reduce the independence of the \nPresident, allowing partisan factions to interfere at the expense of \nthe larger public good and overturning the election or the consent of \nthe governed being attacked because separation of powers had been \nreduced.\n  The objection on the part of Madison proved effective, because Mason \nsubsequently withdrew the motion and came up with another phrase, and \nyou know what the phrase was. It said: ''. . .or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.''\n  Obviously, the context in which ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' was \nentered was to be something a heck of a lot more than maladministration \nand less than treason or bribery, or at least equal to.\n  What does this phrase mean? It is clear the framers thought it to be \nlimited in scope, but beyond this, constitutional scholars of whom I \nhave inquired and read have been debating the meaning of this phrase \nfrom the very early days of the Republic, and there is not a clear \nconsensus. Despite this ongoing dialog and disagreement, though, I \nbelieve there are two important points of agreement in the minds of \nalmost all constitutional scholars as to the original understanding of \nthe phrase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that his 30 \nminutes have expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, despite this dialog, as I indicated, \nscholars agree on two important points and a third issue where the \nweight of history suggests subtle practice. Let me speak to that.\n  As we already have seen, the framers did not intend that the \nPresident could be impeached for maladministration alone. Second, a \ngreat deal of evidence from outside the convention shows that both the \nframers and the ratifiers saw ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as \npointing to offenses that are serious, not petty, offenses that are \npublic or political, not private or personal.\n  In 1829, William Rawle authored one of the early commentaries on the \nConstitution of the United States. In it, Rawle states that ``the \nlegitimate causes of impeachment . . . can only have reference to \npublic character and official duty.\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In general, those offences which may be committed equally \n     by a private person as a public officer are not--\n\n  Emphasis, not--\n\n       the subjects of impeachment.\n\n  In addition, more than 150 years ago, Joseph Story, as my learned \ncolleague who is presiding knows was a lawyer, Joseph Story and his \ninfluential commentaries on the Constitution stated that impeachment is \n``ordinarily'' a remedy for offenses ``of a political character,'' \n``growing out of personal misconduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, \nor habitual disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the \nduties of political office.''\n  The public character of the impeachment offense is further reinforced \nby the limited nature of the remedy for the offense. In the English \ntradition, which we rejected, impeachments were punishable by fines, \nimprisonment or even death.\n  In contrast, the American Constitution completely separates the issue \nof criminal sanctions from the issue of removal from office.\n  Our Constitution states that, ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment \nshall not extend further than to removal from Office, and \ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or \nProfit under the United States. * * * '' Article I, section 3, clause \n7.\n  The remedy for violations of the public's trust in the performance of \none's official duties, in other words, is limited to removal from that \noffice and disqualification from holding further office; remedies that, \nI might add, correspond nicely to the public nature of the offenses in \nthe first instance.\n  Additional support comes from another commentator, James Wilson, a \ndelegate to the Convention from Pennsylvania. In his lectures on the \nConstitution, Wilson wrote:\n\n       In the United States and Pennsylvania, impeachments are \n     confined to political characters, to political crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and to political punishments.\n\n  All in all, the evidence is quite strong that impeachment was \nunderstood as a remedy for abuse of official power, breaches of public \ntrust, or other derelictions of the duties of office.\n  The third point to make about the scope of the impeachment power is \nthis: To be impeachable, an offense does not have to be a breach of the \ncriminal law.\n  The renowned constitutional scholar and personal friend and adviser, \nthe late Phillip Kurland, the leading constitutional scholar of this \ncentury, I argue, wrote that:\n\n       At both the convention that framed the Constitution and at \n     the conventions that ratified it, the essence of an \n     impeachable offense was thought to be breach of trust and not \n     violation of criminal law. And this was in keeping with the \n     primary function of impeachment, removal from office.\n\n  If you put the notion that an impeachable offense must be a serious \nbreach of an official trust or duty, together with the point that it \ndoes not have to be a criminal violation, you reach the conclusion that \nnot all crimes are impeachable, and not every impeachable offense need \nbe a crime.\n  These points provide important anchors for any impeachment inquiry, \nbut they do not resolve all the questions of scope that may arise. Much \nremains to be worked out, and only to be worked out, in the context of \nparticular circumstances and allegations. As Hamilton explained in \nFederalist 65 impeachment ``can never be tied down by * * * strict \nrules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors or \nin the construction of it by the judges. * * *''\n  After all the legal research, we are still left with the realization \nthat the power to convict for impeachment constitutes an ``awful \ndiscretion.''\n  This brings us directly to the Senate's role. To state it bluntly, I \nbelieve the role of the U.S. Senate is to resolve all the remaining \nquestions. Let me elaborate.\n  The Senate's role as final interpreter of impeachments was recognized \nfrom the beginning of the Republic. For example, to refer again to \nJoseph Story, after he devoted almost 50 sections of his commentaries \nto various disputed questions about the impeachment power, he concluded \nthat the final decision on the unresolved issues relating to \nimpeachment ``may be reasonably left to the high tribunal, constituting \nthe court of impeachment.''\n  I.e., the U.S. Senate, the floor upon which I stand.\n  The court of impeachment, the Senate, similarly was viewed in the \nFederalist Papers and referred to Senators as the judges of \nimpeachment. Speaking of the Senate as the jury in impeachment trials \nis perhaps a more common analogy these days as you turn on your \ntelevision and hear many of us speak. But the judge analogy is a more \naccurate analogy than the juror analogy.\n  In impeachment trials, the Senate certainly does sit as a finder of \nfact, as a jury does. But it also sits as a definer of the acceptable \nstandards upon which the President is being judged, as a judge would \ndo. The Senate, in other words, determines not only whether the accused \nhas performed the acts that form the basis for the House of \nRepresentatives' articles of impeachment but also whether those actions \njustify removal from office.\n  So let's lay to rest this idea that if the President--any President--\nis impeached by the House of Representatives, and specific articles are \nalleged of violations, and we find the President violated the very \ncharge that the House has made--that does not mean we must vote for \nimpeachment, for we can reject the grounds upon which the House \nimpeached in the first instance as being not sufficiently sound to meet \n``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' There is no question about that, and \nyet it seems to be a question in the minds of the press. There is no \nquestion about that.\n  Once again, we find support for this view from our country's history. \nIn two of the first three impeachments brought forward from the House \nto the U.S. Senate, the Senate acquitted the accused. In each of the \ntwo acquittals, however, the Senate did not disagree with the House on \nthe facts.\n  One case involved a Senator, William Blount, the other an Associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court, Samuel Chase. In neither one was there \nany question that the individual had done the deeds that formed the \nbasis of the House's articles of impeachment. Yet in each case the \nSenate concluded that the deeds were not sufficient to constitute valid \ngrounds for impeachment, and so they acquitted.\n  Eventually then, if the current impeachment proceeds, it will fall to \nthe Senate to decide not only the facts but the law and to evaluate \nwhether or not the specific actions of the President are sufficiently \nserious to warrant being thrown out of office--being convicted.\n  The framers intended that the Senate have as its objective doing what \nwas best for the country, taking context and circumstances fully into \naccount.\n  I should try to be as clear as I can about this point because the \nmedia discussions have come close to missing it. It seems to be widely \nassumed that if the President committed perjury, for example, then he \nmust be impeached, and he must be convicted if the Senate concludes he \nperjured himself. Conversely, you may think that unless it can be \nproven that the President committed perjury, or violated some other \ncriminal statute, that impeachment cannot occur. Both sentiments and \nstatements are wrong.\n  Recall what I said earlier: Not all crimes are impeachable offenses \nand not every impeachable offense need be a crime to throw a President \nout of office.\n  The Senate, for example, could decline to convict, even if the \nPresident had committed perjury, if it concluded that under the \ncircumstances this perjury did not constitute a sufficiently serious \nbreach of duty toward removal of the President. There is no question \nabout that either.\n  On the other hand, the Senate could convict a President of an \nimpeachable offense even if it were not a violation of the criminal \nlaw. For instance, if the Senate concluded that the President had \ncommitted abuses of power sufficiently grave, it need not find any \naction to amount to a violation of some criminal statute.\n  Let me give you an example. If there was overwhelming proof that \nevery day the President came to his office, the Oval Office, drunk, \nthat is not a crime, but it is impeachable--it is impeachable--\ncommitting no crime, but is impeachable. Conversely, if the Senate can \nconclude that the President lied\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\nabout whether or not he had an affair, they could conclude that did not \nconstitute an impeachable offense warranting expulsion. Now, again I am \nnot prejudging what we should decide, but I think it is very important \nwe understand what latitude and obligations we have.\n  Let me now stand back from the issue of substance and procedure and \nlook at the impeachment mechanism as it has actually functioned in our \ncountry's history. The proof of the framers' design, after all, will be \nin how the mechanism has worked in practice.\n  I am almost finished, Mr. President.\n  As we have seen, the framers worried that impeaching a sitting \nPresident would most likely be highly charged with partisan politics \nand preexisting factions, enlisting, as they said, all of the \n``animosities, partialities, and influence and interest'' that \ninevitably swirl around a sitting President. History shows, Mr. \nPresident, they had it right from the get-go. They had it right. And \nthey were right to worry about it.\n  Prior to the case of President Nixon, Presidential impeachment had \nonly been used for partisan purposes. History tells us that John Tyler \nwas an enormously unpopular President, facing a hostile Congress \ndominated by his arch political enemy, Henry Clay--one of the several \npeople younger than me when he got here. He was an amazing guy. Here he \nwas, a leader in the House of Representatives before he was 25, and he \nbecame a U.S. Senator before he was 30.\n  During the impeachment effort of John Tyler, what he was facing, \nTyler, was a hostile Congress dominated by the young Henry Clay. After \nseveral years of continual clashes, numerous Presidential vetoes, and \ndivisive conflicts with the Senate over appointments, a select \ncommittee of the House issued a report recommending a formal \nimpeachment inquiry.\n  President Tyler, not being as dumb as everyone thought, reached out \nto his political enemies. How did he do that? He signed an important \nbill raising tariffs, which had been one of the reasons that there was \nsuch animosity between him and Henry Clay and his friends. He raised \ntariffs which he had formerly opposed. And he found other means of \ncooperation with Congress.\n  In the end, even Henry Clay, speaking from the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, urged the slowdown on the impeachment proceedings that he had \nmoved to initiate, suggesting instead a lesser action of a ``want of \nconfidence.'' ``Want of confidence''--does it sound familiar? Does it \nsound at all like the idea of having the President sanctioned in some \nway other than impeachment? Does it sound like censuring the President? \n``Want of confidence.''\n  So Clay suggested that a ``want of confidence'' vote, rather than a \nformal impeachment proceeding, might be better. So in early 1843, the \nresolution to proceed with an impeachment--whether to proceed with the \nimpeachment inquiry, was defeated on the House floor, 127-83. They had \nalready begun the process of inquiry, and along came Tyler, and he \nsaid, ``I'll make peace with you.''\n  In 1868, Andrew Johnson came much closer to conviction on charges of \nserious misconduct. No southerner will be unaware of--I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be able to proceed for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As every southern Senator knows, Andrew Johnson came much \ncloser to conviction on the charges of serious misconduct. Although \nJohnson's impeachment proceedings ostensibly focused on his \ndisregarding the Tenure in Office Act, historians--and not a single \nsoutherner does not understand--but historians uniformly agree that the \ntrue sources of opposition to President Johnson were policy \ndisagreements and personal animosity.\n  The conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post-Civil War \npolicies toward the Southern States and the overwhelming Republican \nmajorities in both Chambers. The Republicans feared dilution of their \nvoting strength if the southerners were seated.\n  Johnson's defenders in the Senate were eventually able to hold on to \nbarely enough votes to prevent his conviction. In Professor Raoul \nBerger's view, ``Johnson's trial serves as a frightening reminder that \nin the hands of a passion-driven Congress, the process may bring down \nthe very pillars of our constitutional system.''\n  Yet, if the cases of Tyler and Johnson substantiate the framers' \nfears, the Nixon situation vindicates the utility of the impeachment \nprocedures. Notice how different the Nixon proceedings were from \nTyler's and Johnson's. As the Nixon impeachment process unfolded, there \nwas broad bipartisan consensus each step of the way. I was there at the \ntime.\n  While it would have been foolish to believe that Members of Congress \ndid not worry about the partisan political repercussions of their \nactions, such factional considerations did not dominate decision \nmaking.\n  Political friends and foes of the President agreed that the charges \nagainst the President were serious, that they warranted further inquiry \nand, once there was definitive evidence of serious complicity and \nwrongdoing, a consensus emerged that impeachment should be invoked. The \nPresident resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted out \narticles of impeachment by a 28-10 vote.\n  For me, several lessons stand out from our constitutional \nunderstanding of the impeachment process and our historical experience \nwith it. Furthermore, I believe that a consensus has developed on \nseveral important points.\n  While the founders included impeachment powers in the Constitution, \nthey were concerned by the potential partisan abuse. We should be no \nless aware of the dangers of partisanship. As we have seen, the process \nfunctions best when there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind moving \nahead. The country is never well served when either policy \ndisagreements or personal animosities drive the process.\n  Many scholars who have studied the Constitution have concluded that \nit should be reserved for offenses that are abuses of the public trust \nor abuses that relate to the public nature of the President's duties. \nRemember, what is impeachable is not necessarily criminal and what is \ncriminal is not necessarily impeachable.\n  The Senate in particular has wide latitude in determining the outcome \nof this constitutional process. Just because the House may initiate an \nimpeachment process does not mean that the Senate will conclude that \nthe process with a vote on articles of impeachment was a correct \nprocess. It is well within our constitutional responsibilities to \nconsider alternatives to impeachment if we find that circumstances \nwarrant these alternatives.\n  I don't know that they will and I don't know that we will get there, \nbut again, the debate is being waged as to whether or not it is in our \nconstitutional power to consider alternatives. Remember Senator Henry \nClay's ``want of confidence.''\n  There is no one-size-fits-all definition of impeachable offenses, \ndivorced from such practical considerations. The Senate in particular, \nhas an obligation to consider the full range of consequences of \nremoving the President from Office.\n  In recent days, some have suggested that because the Starr Report \nprovides a prima facie case and prima facie evidence of what are \narguably impeachable offenses, the House and the Senate have a \nconstitutional responsibility to see the impeachment process through to \nits conclusion.\n  In my view, the constitutional history that I have sketched here and \nmore shows this position is entirely mistaken. Indeed, if anything, \nhistory shows a thoroughly understandable reluctance to have the \nprocedure invoked in the first place.\n  Stopping short of impeachment would not be reaching a solution \n``outside the Constitution.'' It would be entirely compatible and \nconsistent with what the Founders contemplated, if that is what we \ndecide. Again, I am not prejudging what we should decide.\n  The 28th Congress hardly violated its constitutional duty when the \nHouse decided that, all things considered, terminating impeachment \nproceedings after cooperation between the Congress and the President \nimproved was a better course of action than proceeding with impeachment \nbased on his past actions, even though it apparently did so for reasons \nno more laudable than those that initiated the process in the first \nplace.\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\n  Impeachment was and remains an inherently political process, with all \nthe pitfalls and promises that are thus put into play by politics. \nNothing in the document precludes the Congress from seeking means to \nresolve this or any other putative breach of duty short of removing him \nfrom office. In fact, the risky and potentially divisive nature of the \nimpeachment process may counsel in favor of utilizing it only as an \nabsolute last resort where there is no shadow of a doubt that it meets, \nthe criteria of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdeameanors.\n  Of course, impeachment ought to be used if the breach of duty is \nserious enough--what the Congress was prepared to do in the case of \nRichard Nixon was the correct course of action. However, nothing in the \nconstitution precludes the Congress from resolving this conflict in a \nmanner short of impeachment.\n  The critical question--the question with which the country is \ncurrently struggling--is whether the President's breaches of conduct \nand shameful activity, which are now well known and which have been \nuniversally condemned, warrant the ultimate political sanction. Are \nthey serious enough to warrant removal from office?\n  In answering that, we need to ask ourselves, What is in the best \ninterests of the United States of America? That is something that the \nfounders contemplated us asking ourselves if and when faced with this \nquestion.\n  While I have not decided ultimately what should happen, I do want to \nsuggest that it certainly is constitutionally permissible to consider a \nmiddle ground as a resolution of this matter. Such an approach might \nbring together those of the President's detractors who believe there is \na need for some sanction, but are willing to stop short of impeachment, \nas well as those of the President's supporters who reject impeachment, \nbut are willing to consider that some sanction ought to be implemented.\n  As a country, Mr. President, we have not often faced decisions as \nstark and potentially momentous as the impeachment of a President of \nthe United States. On the other hand, we would be wise not to overstate \nsuch claims. Surely we have faced some moments as stark and serious as \nthis one. We have survived those moments and we will survive this one \nno matter how we handle it. As my dad always says, and he is going on \n85 years of age, I remember over the last 26 years going home and \nsaying, ``Dad, this is a catastrophe,'' and he would look at me and \nsay, ``Joe, this country is so good, it is so strong, it is so solid, \nthat it can stand 4 or 8 years of anybody or anything.'' And he is \nright. He is right. So I don't want to exaggerate this.\n\n  Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I'm confident that our \nform of government and the strength of our country present us not with \na constitutional crisis but rather with a constitutional framework and \nflexibility to deal responsibly with the decisions we face in the \ncoming months. My purpose in rising today is to remind all of us of \nwhat that constitutional framework and flexibility mean, what they are.\n  In my closing plea I begin where I started, as a young Senator in \nApril of 1974. This is a time for us to be cautious. This is a time for \nMembers of this body to hold our fire. This is the time to be prepared \nto exercise our responsibility to be judge and jury after, and only \nafter, all of the facts are presented to us. This is not a \nconstitutional crisis but it is a serious, serious business.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11333-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2392.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe tax on commercial aviation to and from airports located on sparsely \npopulated islands, to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        legislation providing relief for certain island airports\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto provide relief to communities for whom air transportation is vital \nto their survival.\n  Last year, Congress altered the structure of the aviation excise tax \nwhich funds the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. As part of the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, the 10% ad valorem ticket tax was replaced with a \ncombination ad valorem/flight segment charge. When fully phased in, the \ntax will consist of an ad valorem tax of 7.5% of the price of a ticket \nand a $3.00 charge per flight segment.\n  This change has dramatically increased the tax imposed on low-fare \nflights. A typical flight to or from the Block Island community located \nin my state costs $28. Prior to last year, the tax on this flight would \nbe 10% or $2.80. When fully implemented, however, the new structure \nwill increase the tax on the same ticket by 82%, to $5.10.\n  This new structure was intended to provide a user-based approach to \npaying for the use of FAA services and facilities. However, short \ndistance flights between islands and a mainland make little demand on \nAir Traffic Control services as these flight segments do not use ATC \ncenters, rarely use departure or arrive control, often operate under \nvisual flight rules and usually are transferred from the departure \ncontrol tower to the destination control tower.\n  Congress recognized that this new tax structure would adversely \naffect rural communities. Consequently, flights to or from rural \nairports are taxed at a rate of 7.5% of the ticket price, with no per \npassenger segment charge. For purposes of this exemption, a rural \nairport is one that is located at least 75 miles away from an airport \nwith more than 100,000 passengers. Unfortunately, this restrictive \ndefinition fails to recognize the unique nature of island communities.\n  Island communities face transportation problems similar to those \nencountered by passengers from rural areas. Air and ferry \ntransportation provide islands with a vital link to the mainland for \nshopping, employment, health care, and other needs. Most commercial \npassenger enplanements at island airports are for short-distance \nflights simply to get off the island. For those communities, air and \nferry service maintain a delicate balance, and both are needed to meet \nthe communities' needs for mainland access.\n  The current excise tax structure provides a disincentive to providing \nservice to remote island communities. This result is contrary to \nCongress' intent to increase air service to these remote communities.\n  My legislation reinstates the prior tax structure for flights to or \nfrom an\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\nisland community. Thus, a passenger flying to or from such a community \nwould pay a tax equal to 10% of the price of a ticket. It is important \nto note that this is less favorable than the exemption currently \nprovided to passengers to and from rural airports.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important \nhealth initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \nan excise tax on persons who acquire structured settlement payments in \nfactoring transactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  structured settlement protection act\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with Senators Baucus, Grassley, Moseley-Braun, Rockefeller, \nand Kerrey of Nebraska, the Structured Settlement Protection Act. \nCompanion legislation has been introduced in the House as H.R. 4314, \ncosponsored by Representative Clay Shaw and Pete Stark and a broad \nbipartisan group of members of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n  The Act protects structured settlements and the injured victims who \nare the recipients of the structured settlement payments from the \nproblems caused by a growing practice known as structured settlement \nfactoring.\n  Structured settlements were developed because of the pitfalls \nassociated with the traditional lump sum form of recovery in serious \npersonal injury cases, where all too often a lump sum meant to last for \ndecades or even a lifetime swiftly eroded away. Structured settlements \nhave proven to be a very valuable tool. They provide long-term \nfinancial security in the form of an assured stream of payments to \npersons suffering serious, often profoundly disabling, physical \ninjuries. These payments enable the recipients to meet ongoing medical \nand basic living expenses without having to resort to the social safety \nnet.\n  Congress has adopted special tax rules to encourage and govern the \nuse of structured settlements in physical injury cases. By encouraging \nthe use of structured settlements Congress sought to shield victims and \ntheir families from pressures to prematurely dissipate their \nrecoveries. Structured settlement payments are nonassignable. This is \nconsistent with worker's compensation payments and various types of \nFederal disability payments which are also non-assignable under \napplicable law. In each case, this is done to preserve the injured \nperson's long-term financial security.\n\n  I am very concerned that in recent months there has been sharp growth \nin so-called structured settlement factoring transactions. In these \ntransactions, companies induce injured victims to sell off future \nstructured settlement payments for a steeply-discounted lump sum, \nthereby unraveling the structured settlement and the crucial long-term \nfinancial security that it provides to the injured victim. These \nfactoring company purchases directly contravene the intent and policy \nof Congress in enacting the special structured settlement tax rules. \nThe Treasury Department shares these concerns as is evidenced with a \nsimilar proposal included in the Administration's FY 1999 budget.\n  Court records from across the country are shedding light on factoring \ncompany purchases of structured settlement payments from gravely-\ninjured victims. Recent cases involve a quadriplegic in Oklahoma, a \nparaplegic in Texas, a person in Connecticut with traumatic brain \ninjuries dating from childhood, and an injured worker receiving \nworkers' compensation in Mississippi. Realizing the long-term risk \nbeing inflicted on these seriously-injured individuals, this \nlegislation has the active support of the National Spinal Cord Injury \nAssociation, as well as the American Association of Persons With \nDisabilities (AAPD).\n  The National Spinal Cord Injury Association recently wrote to the \nChairman of the Finance Committee strongly supporting the legislation. \nThey state: ``[o]ver the past 16 years, structured settlements have \nproven to be an ideal method for ensuring that persons with \ndisabilities, particularly minors, are not tempted to squander \nresources designed to last years or even a lifetime. That is why the \nNational Spinal Cord Injury Association is so deeply concerned about \nthe emergence of companies that purchase payments intended for disabled \npersons at drastic discount. This strikes at the heart of the security \nCongress intended when it created structured settlements.''\n  It is appropriate to address this problem through the federal tax \nsystem because these purchases directly contravene the Congressional \npolicy reflected in the structured settlement tax rules and jeopardize \nthe long-term financial security that Congress intended to provide for \nthe injured victim. This problem is nationwide, and it is growing \nrapidly.\n  Accordingly, the legislation we are introducing would impose \nsubstantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases the \nstructured settlement payments from the injured victim. This is a \npenalty, not a tax increase. Similar penalties are imposed in a variety \nof other contexts in the Internal Revenue Code to discourage \ntransactions that undermine Code provisions, such as private foundation \nprohibited transactions and greenmail. The factoring company would pay \nthe penalty only if it engages in the transaction that Congress has \nsought to discourage. An exception is provided for genuine court-\napproved hardship cases to protect the limited instances where a true \nhardship warrants the sale of a structured settlement.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which is supported by the Treasury \nDepartment, should be enacted as soon as possible to stem this growing \nnationwide problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Stringent excise tax on persons who acquire structured \n         settlement payments in factoring transactions\n       In its analysis of the Administration's proposal, the Joint \n     Tax Committee notes the potential concern that in some cases \n     the imposition of a 20-percent excise tax may result in the \n     factoring company passing the tax along by reducing even \n     further the already-heavily discounted lump sum paid to the \n     injured victim for his or her structured settlement payments. \n     The Joint Committee notes that ``[o]ne possible response to \n     the concern relating to excessively discounted payments might \n     be to raise the excise tax to a level that is certain to stop \n     the transfers (perhaps 100 percent). . .'' (Joint Committee \n     on Taxation, Description of Revenue Provisions Contained in \n     the President's Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Proposal (JCS-4-98) \n     (February 4, 1998), p. 223).\n       Factoring company purchases of structured settlement \n     payments so directly subvert the Congressional policy \n     underlying structured settlements and raise such serious \n     concerns for structured settlements and the injured victims \n     that it is appropriate to impose a more stringent excise tax \n     against the amount of the discount reflected in the factoring \n     transaction (subject to a limited exception described below \n     for genuine court-approved hardships). Accordingly, the Act \n     would impose on the factoring company that acquires \n     structured settlement payments directly or indirectly from \n     the injured victim an excise tax equal to 50 percent of the \n     difference between (i) the total amount of the structured \n     settlement payments purchased by the factoring company, and \n     (ii) the heavily-discounted lump sum paid by the factoring \n     company to the injured victim.\n       Similar to the stuff excise taxes imposed on prohibited \n     transactions in the private foundation and pension contexts--\n     which can range as high as 100 to 200 percent--this stringent \n     excise tax is necessary to address the very serious public \n     policy concerns raised by structured settlement factoring \n     transactions.\n       Unlike the Administration's proposal, the excise tax \n     imposed on the factoring company under this legislation would \n     use a more stringent tax rate of 50 percent and would apply \n     it to the excess of the total amount of the structured \n     settlement payments purchased by the factoring company over \n     the heavily-discounted lump sum paid to the injured victim.\n       The excise tax under the Act would apply to the factoring \n     or structured settlements in tort cases and in workers' \n     compensation. A structured settlement factoring transaction \n     subject to the excise tax is broadly defined under the Act as \n     a transfer of structured settlement payment rights (including \n     portions of payments) made for consideration by means of \n     sale, assignment, pledge, or other form of alienation or \n     encumbrance for consideration.\n     2. Exception from excise tax for genuine, court-approved \n         hardship\n       The stringent excise tax would be coupled with a limited \n     exception for genuine, court-approved financial hardship \n     situations. Drawing upon the hardship standard enunciated in \n     the Treasury proposal, the excise tax would apply to \n     factoring companies in\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\n     all structured settlement factoring transactions except those \n     in which the transfer of structured settlement payment rights \n     (1) is otherwise permissible under applicable Federal and \n     State law and (2) is undertaken pursuant to the order of a \n     court (or where applicable, an administrative authority) \n     finding that the extraordinary, unanticipated, and imminent \n     needs of the structured settlement recipient or his or her \n     spouse or dependents render such a transfer appropriate.\n       This exception is intended to apply to the limited number \n     of cases in which a genuinely extraordinary, unanticipated, \n     and imminent hardship has actually arisen and been \n     demonstrated to the satisfaction of a court (e.g., serious \n     medical emergency for a family member). In addition, as a \n     threshold matter, the transfer of structured settlement \n     payment rights must be permissible under applicable law, \n     including State law. The hardship exception under this \n     legislation is not intended to override any Federal or State \n     law prohibition of restriction on the transfer of the payment \n     rights or to authorize factoring of payment rights that are \n     not transferable under Federal or State law. For example, the \n     States in general prohibit the factoring of workers' \n     compensation benefits. In addition, State laws often prohibit \n     or directly restrict transfers of recoveries in various types \n     of personal injury cases, such as wrongful death and medical \n     malpractice.\n       The relevant court for purposes of the hardship exception \n     would be the original court which had jurisdiction over the \n     underlying action or proceeding that was resolved by means of \n     the structured settlement. In the event that no action had \n     been brought prior to the settlement, the relevant court \n     would be that which would have had jurisdiction over the \n     claim that is the subject of the structured settlement or \n     which would have jurisdiction by reason of the residence of \n     the structured settlement recipient. In those limited \n     instances in which an administrative authority adjudicates, \n     resolves, or otherwise has primary jurisdiction over the \n     claim (e.g., the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund), the \n     hardship matter would be the province of that applicable \n     administrative authority.\n     3. Need to protect tax treatment of original structured \n         settlement\n       In the limited instances of extraordinary and unanticipated \n     hardship determined by court order to warrant relief under \n     the hardship exception, adverse tax consequences should not \n     be visited upon the other parties to the original structured \n     settlement. In addition, despite the anti-assignment \n     provisions included in the structured settlement agreements \n     and the applicability of a stringent excise tax on the \n     factoring company, there may be a limited number of non-\n     hardship factoring transactions that still go forward. If the \n     structured settlement tax rules under I.R.C. Sections 72, 130 \n     and 461(h) had been satisfied at the time of the structured \n     settlement, the original tax treatment of the other parties \n     to the settlement--i.e., the settling defendant (and its \n     liability insurer) and the Code section 130 assignee--should \n     not be jeopardized by a third party transaction that occurs \n     years later and likely unbeknownst to these other parties to \n     the original settlement.\n       Accordingly, the Act would clarify that if the structured \n     settlement tax rules under I.R.C. Sections 72, 130, and \n     461(h) had been satisfied at the time of the structured \n     settlement, the section 130 exclusion of the assignee, the \n     section 461(h) deduction of the settling defendant, and the \n     Code section 72 status of the annuity being used to fund the \n     periodic payments would remain undisturbed. That is, the \n     assignee's exclusion of income under Code section 130 arising \n     from satisfaction of all of the section 130 qualified \n     assignment rules at the time the structured settlement was \n     entered into years earlier would not be challenged. \n     Similarly, the settling defendant's deduction under Code \n     section 461(h) of the amount paid to the assignee to assume \n     the liability would not be challenged. Finally, the status \n     under Code section 72 of the annuity being used to fund the \n     periodic payments would remain undisturbed.\n       The Act provides the Secretary of the Treasury with \n     regulatory authority to clarify the treatment of a structured \n     settlement recipient who engages in a factoring transaction. \n     This regulatory authority is provided to enable Treasury to \n     address issues raised regarding the treatment of future \n     periodic payments received by the structured settlement \n     recipient where only a portion of the payments has been \n     factored away, the treatment of the lump sum received in a \n     factoring transaction qualifying for the hardship exception, \n     and the treatment of the lump sum received in the non-\n     hardship situation. It is intended that where the \n     requirements of section 130 are satisfied at the time the \n     structured settlement is entered into, the existence of the \n     hardship exception to the excise tax under the Act shall not \n     be construed as giving rise to any concern over constructive \n     receipt of income by the injured victim at the time of the \n     structured settlement.\n     4. Tax information reporting obligations with respect to a \n         structured settlement factoring transaction\n       The Act would clarify the tax reporting obligations of the \n     person making the structured settlement payments in the event \n     that a structured settlement factoring transaction occurs. \n     The Act adopts a new section of the Code that is intended to \n     govern the payor's tax reporting obligations in the event of \n     a factoring transaction.\n       In the case of a court-approved transfer of structured \n     settlement payments of which the person making the payments \n     has actual notice and knowledge, the fact of the transfer and \n     the identity of the acquirer clearly will be known. \n     Accordingly, it is appropriate for the person making the \n     structured settlement payments to make such return and to \n     furnish such tax information statement to the new recipient \n     of the payments as would be applicable under the annuity \n     information reporting procedures of Code section 6041 (e.g., \n     form 1099-R), because the payor will have the information \n     necessary to make such return and to furnish such statement.\n       Despite the anti-assignment restrictions applicable to \n     structured settlements and the applicability of a stringent \n     excise tax, there may be a limited number of non-hardship \n     factoring transactions that still go forward. In these \n     instances, if the person making the structured settlement \n     payments has actual notice and knowledge that a structured \n     settlement factoring transaction has taken place, the payor \n     would be obligated to make such return and to furnish such \n     written statement to the payment recipient at such time, and \n     in such manner and form, as the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall by regulations provide.

A bill to enhance homeownership through community \ndevelopment financial institutions; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        the community development and homeownership act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nallow Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and their \naffiliates to borrow from the Home Loan Bank System.\n  Since the 1930's the Home Loan Bank System has provided the nation's \nsavings institutions with advances that can be used to make home \nmortgages. In 1989, the System was opened up to banks and credit \nunions. The Home Loan Bank System is critical for homeownership in the \nU.S. The Bank System has nearly 7,000 members and has outstanding \nnearly $181 billion in housing advances.\n  The membership of the system is reserved for insured institutions. My \nlegislation, however, would permit Community Development Financial \nInstitutions to have ``non-member'' borrowing status. This would allow \napproximately 200 CDFIs to borrow from the System, with the approval of \ntheir regional Home Loan Bank and on the same terms as all other \nmembers.\n  Mr. President, this is a small, but important step toward creating \nmore homeownership opportunities, particularly for low income \nindividuals. CDFIs were created for the purpose of reaching out to \nprovide housing and economic opportunity in distressed areas. My home \nstate of North Carolina is home to more CDFIs than any other state in \nthe United States, except for California, New York and Illinois. North \nCarolina has been a leader in finding new and different ways to foster \neconomic growth and home ownership.\n  Very simply, this legislation will allow CDFIs to have a source of \ncredit to make home loans. These loans will have to meet the normal \ncollateral requirements of any other institution that belongs to the \nHome Loan Bank System. Because CDFIs are chartered to target distressed \ncommunities, however, this could be an important source of credit for \nhomeownership that might not otherwise exist. We know from experience \nthat once an individual has a home--he or she has a stake in the \ncommunity. This can help turn distressed communities into thriving \ncommunities. We have made great\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\nprogress in the last few years. Welfare rolls are at their lowest point \nsince 1969. Homeownership is at its highest level ever. We are no \nlonger running our federal budgets in the red. Now we can begin to take \nnew and creative steps to continue promoting economic growth and \nopportunity.\n  I would urge my colleagues to co-sponsor and support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2546. A bill to establish legal standards and procedures for the \nfair, prompt, inexpensive, and efficient resolution of personal injury \nclaims arising out of asbestos exposure, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           the fairness in asbestos compensation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \n``Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1998''. With me, sponsoring \nthis important legislation are: Senator Dodd, Senator Ascroft, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Sessions and Senator Torricelli.\n  Asbestos litigation is a national crisis. Today, state and federal \ncourts are overwhelmed by up to 150,000 asbestos lawsuits. Over 30,000 \nnew suits are added to the dockets annually. Unfortunately, those that \nare truly sick with asbestosis and various asbestos-related cancers and \nillnesses spend years in court before receiving any compensation, and \nthen lose 60% of that compensation to attorneys' fees and other costs. \nThe best available data show that on average asbestos suits take 31 \nmonths to reach resolution, compared to 18 months for other product \nliability suits. One cause of this extraordinary delay in compensation \nis the large number of lawsuits filed by those who, without any \nsymptoms or signs of asbestos-related illness, bring suits for future \nmedical monitoring and fear of cancer.\n  In a lottery-like system, juries award enormous compensation and \noutrageous punitive damages to non-impaired plaintiffs, while others in \nidentical cases or with actual illness receive little or no \ncompensation. Excessive Damage awards, along with the transaction costs \nassociated with the lawsuits, deplete the financial resources of \ndefendant companies and lead them to file for bankruptcy. As legal and \nfinancial resources are tied up and exhausted, it is increasingly \nunclear whether those who are truly inflicted with asbestos-caused \ndiseases will be able to recover anything at all in the years ahead.\n  Courts have tried unsuccessfully to cope with and alleviate the \nproblems associated with the more than half a million asbestos cases. \nThe major parties involved attempted to compromise on a fair and \nequitable solution that included prompt compensation. The Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals overturned one such compromise, known as the Amchem or \nGeorgine agreement, on civil procedural rule grounds but found the \nsettlement to be ``arguably a brilliant partial solution.'' Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the Supreme Court, upheld the \nAppellate decision and stated, ``[t]he argument is sensibly made that a \nnationwide administrative claims processing regime would provide the \nmost secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims of \nasbestos exposure. Congress, however, has not adopted such a \nsolution.'' The Court accurately recognized that Congress is the most \nappropriate body to resolve the asbestos crisis. That is what we intend \nto do by introducing this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, by virtue of the hundreds of thousands of cases that \nalready have been litigated in the court system, the legal and \nscientific issues relating to asbestos litigation have been thoroughly \nexplored and punishments have been exacted on defendant companies. \nRecognizing the potential dangers of asbestos exposure, we have seen \nasbestos consumption in the United States drop to historic lows since \npeak consumption in the early 1970's. These factors along with the \nrecent court decisions demonstrate that the asbestos litigation issue \nis now ripe for a legislative solution.\n  The bill that I introduce today will correct the asbestos litigation \ncrisis problems. It is crafted to reflect as closely as possible the \noriginal settlement agreed to by the involved parties in the Amchem \nsettlement. This bill will eliminate the asbestos litigation burden in \nthe courts, get fair compensation for those who currently are sick, and \nenable the businesses to manage their liabilities in order to ensure \nthat compensation will be available for future claimants. It is \nimportant to note that no tax-payer money will fund this bill. It will \nbe entirely funded by asbestos defendants.\n  Specifically, the bill reforms asbestos litigation in the judicial \nsystem by establishing a national claims facility to provide fair and \nprompt compensation for persons suffering from asbestos-associated \nillnesses. Eligibility for compensation will be determined by objective \npredetermined criteria. The legislation provides for alternative \ndispute resolution and allows plaintiffs who go through the system \nwithout resolving their claims through the claims facility to use the \ntort system. Again no taxpayer dollars will fund this facility or any \npart of this program.\n  I have carefully crafted this legislation so that it is at least as \nfavorable--and, in many cases, more favorable--to claimants as the \noriginal Amchem settlement. As this bill makes its way through the \nlegislative process, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nfurther refine the language in order to achieve the maximum public \nbenefit from this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD: Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Hatch, to introduce the ``Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act \nof 1998.'' This legislation would expedite the provision of financial \ncompensation to the victims of asbestos exposure by establishing a \nnationwide administrative system to hear and adjudicate their claims.\n  Mr. President, millions of American workers have been exposed to \nasbestos on the job. Tragically, many have contracted asbestos-related \nillness, which can be devastating and deadly. Others will surely become \nsimilarly afflicted. These individuals--who have or will become \nterribly ill due to no fault to their own--deserve swift and fair \ncompensation to help meet the costs of health care, lost income, and \nother economic and non-economic losses.\n  Unfortunately, many victims of asbestos exposure are not receiving \nthe efficient and just treatment they deserve from our legal system. \nIndeed, it can be said that the current asbestos litigation system is \nin a state of crisis. Today, more than 150,000 lawsuits clog the state \nand federal courts. In 1996 alone, more than 36,000 new suits were \nfiled. Those who have been injured by asbestos exposure must often wait \nyears for compensation. And when that compensation finally arrives, it \nis often eaten up by attorneys' fees and other transaction costs.\n  In the early 1990's, an effort was made to improve the management of \nfederal asbestos litigation. Cases were consolidated, and a settlement \nto resolve them administratively was agreed to between defendant \ncompanies and plaintiffs' attorneys. This settlement also obtained the \nbacking of the Building and Construction Trades Union of the AFL-CIO. \nRegrettably, the settlement was overturned by the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals in 1996. Though the Court termed the settlement ``arguably a \nbrilliant partial solution,'' it found that the class of people created \nby the settlement--namely, those exposed to asbestos--was too large and \nvaried to be certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision. In its \ndecision, the Court effectively invited the Congress to provide for the \nexistence of such a settlement as a fair and efficient way to resolve \nasbestos litigation claims.\n  Hence this bill. In simple terms, it codifies the settlement reached \nbetween companies and the representatives of workers who were exposed \nto asbestos on the job. It would establish a body to review claims by \nthose who believe that they have become ill due to exposure to \nasbestos. It would provide workers with mediation and binding \narbitration to promote the fair and swift settlement of their claims. \nIt would allow plaintiffs to seek additional compensation if their non-\nmalignant disease later developed into cancer. And it would limit \nattorneys' fees so as to ensure that a claimant receives a just portion \nof any settlement amount.\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\n  All in all, Mr. President, this is a good bill. I commend Senator \nHatch for his leadership in crafting it. However, it is not a perfect \nbill. My office has received comments on the bill from representatives \nof a number of parties affected by asbestos litigation. I hope and \nexpect that those comments will be given the consideration that they \ndeserve by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate as this \nlegislation moves forward, as I hope it will early in the 106th \nCongress.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of the \nFairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1998 to speak in favor of this \nimportant, bipartisan measure. I support this bill for a simple \nreason--it makes sense. The problems caused by the manufacture and use \nof asbestos are well-documented. Although some companies initially \ndenied responsibility and fought suits to recover for asbestos-related \ninjuries in court, the injuries associated with asbestos and the fact \nthat manufacturers are liable for those injuries are now well-\nestablished.\n  The courts--both state and federal--have done an admirable job of \nestablishing the facts and legal rules concerning asbestos. That is a \njob the courts do well. However, now that the basic facts and liability \nrules have been established, the courts are being asked simply to \nprocess claims. That is not a job the courts do particularly well. The \nrules governing court actions give parties rights to dispute facts that \nhave been conclusively established in other proceedings. All the while \nthe meter is running for the lawyers on both sides. Dollars that could \ngo to compensate deserving victims, instead go to lawyers and court \ncosts.\n  In the asbestos context, these problems are exacerbated by the finite \namount of resources available to compensate victims and the fact that \nlegal rules concerning both punitive damages and what constitutes a \nsufficient injury to bring suit make for jury awards that do not \ncorrespond to the seriousness of the injury. Someone filing suit \nbecause of a preliminary manifestation of a minor injury, i.e., pleural \nthickening, which may never lead to more severe symptoms, may receive \nmore compensation than another person with more serious asbestos-\nrelated injuries. None of this is to suggest that it is somehow wrong \nfor plaintiffs with a minor injury to file suit. To the contrary, some \nstate rules concerning when injury occurs obligate plaintiffs to file \nsuit or risk having their suit dismissed as time-barred. What is more, \nin light of the finite number of remaining solvent asbestos defendants, \npotential plaintiffs have every incentive to file suit as soon as \nlegally permissible.\n  The Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1998 attempts to address \nthese problems by establishing an administrative claims systems that \naims to compensate victims of asbestos rationally and efficiently. The \nAct accomplishes this goal by ensuring that more serious injuries \nreceive greater awards, by securing a compensation fund so that victims \nwhose conditions are not yet manifest can recover in the future, and by \neliminating the statute of limitations and injury rules that force \nplaintiffs into court prematurely. Although I wish I could claim some \npride of authorship in these mechanisms, these basic features were all \npart of a proposed settlement worked out by representatives of both \nplaintiffs and defendants.\n  At the end of last term, the Supreme Court rejected the proposed \nglobal asbestos settlement in Amchem Products versus Windsor. The \nDistrict Court had certified a settlement class under Rule 23 that \nincluded extensive medical and compensation criteria that both \nplaintiffs and defendants had accepted. The Supreme Court ruled that \nthis type of global, nationwide settlement of tort claims brought under \nfifty different state laws could not be sustained under Rule 23. The \nCourt recognized that such a global settlement would conserve judicial \nresources and likely would promote the public interest. Nonetheless, \nthe Court concluded that Rule 23 was too thin a reed to support this \nmassive settlement, and that if the parties desired a nationwide \nsettlement they needed to direct their attention to the Congress, \nrather than the Courts.\n  I believe the Supreme Court was right on both counts--the proposed \nsettlement criteria were in the public interest, but the proposed class \nsimply could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Rules Enabling Act and \nthe inherent limits on the power of federal courts preclude an \ninterpretation of Rule 23 that would result in a federal court \noverriding or homogenizing varying state laws. However, as the Supreme \nCourt pointed out, Congress has the power to do directly what the \ncourts lack the power to do through a strained interpretation of Rule \n23.\n  This bill takes up the challenge of the Supreme Court and addresses \nthe tragic problem of asbestos. The bill incorporates the medical and \ncompensation criteria agreed to by the parties in the Amchem settlement \nand employs them as the basis for a legislative settlement. In the \nsimplest terms, the legislation proposes an administrative claims \nprocess to compensate individuals injured by asbestos as a substitute \nfor the tort system (although individuals retain an ability to opt-in \nto the tort system at the back end). The net effect of this legislation \nshould be to funnel a greater percentage of the pool of limited \nresources to injured plaintiffs, rather than to lawyers for plaintiffs \nand defendants.\n  I want to be clear, however, that I am not here to suggest that this \nis a perfect bill. This bill represents a complex solution to a complex \nproblem. A number of groups will be affected by this legislation, and \nit may be necessary to make changes to make sure that no one is \nunfairly disadvantaged by this legislation. But that said, I am \nconfident that we can make any needed changes. We have a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, and \nthe bill represents a sufficient improvement in efficiency over the \nexisting litigation quagmire that there should be ample room to work \nout any differences.\n  Finally, let me also note that this bill also plays a minor, but \nimportant role in preserving a proper balance in the separation of \npowers. I have been a strong and consistent critic of judicial \nactivism. Judges who make legal rules out of whole cloth in the absence \nof constitutional or statutory text damage the standing of the \njudiciary and our constitutional structure. On the other hand, when \njudges issue opinions in which they recognize that the outcome sought \nby the parties might well be in the public interest, but nonetheless is \nnot supported by the existing law, they reinforce the proper, limited \nrole of the judiciary. Too often, federal judges are tempted to reach \nthe result they favor as a policy matter without regard to the law. \nWhen judges succumb to that temptation, they are justly criticized. But \nwhen they resist that temptation, their self-restraint should be \nrecognized and applauded. The Court in Amchem rightly recognized a \nproblem that the judiciary acting alone could not solve. By offering a \nlegislative solution to that problem the bill provides the proper \nincentives for courts to be restrained and reinforces the proper roles \nof Congress and the judiciary.\n  In short, this bill provides a proper legislative solution to the \nasbestos litigation problem. It ensures that in an area in which \nextensive litigation has already established facts and assigned \nresponsibility, scarce dollars compensate victims, not lawyers. I want \nto thank Chairman Hatch for his leadership on this issue and to thank \nmy co-sponsors for their work on the bill. I look forward to working \nwith them to ensure final passage of this legislation. The courts have \ncompleted their proper role in ascertaining facts and liability. It is \ntime for Congress to step in to provide a better mechanism to direct \nscarce resources to deserving victims.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatch for \nintroducing this important legislation, which I am pleased to co-\nsponsor with him and Senators Dodd, Ashcroft, Sessions, and Torricelli. \nAs Senator Hatch already has explained, this bill addresses an issue--\nasbestos litigation--that has clogged the federal and state courts for \nsome time now. Due to the huge number of these cases and the massive \nverdicts they often yield, it is unclear whether those who have been \nexposed to asbestos, but have not yet become sick, will be able to gain \nfull compensation for their injuries should they become sick in the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\n  To address these concerns, and respond to calls from the courts and \nothers for creating an alternative mechanism for resolving these \ndisputes outside of the court system, a settlement was reached several \nyears ago that, among other things, would have created an alternative \nclaims resolution system for dealing with certain asbestos claims. \nUnfortunately, despite the desire of representatives of the interested \nparties--both victims and defendants--to enter into this settlement, \nand despite the trial court's belief that the settlement was fair, the \nSupreme Court voided it. The Supreme Court acted, however, not because \nit believed that the settlement was in any respect unfair, but instead \nbecause it concluded that only Congress has the authority to sanction \nsuch a settlement.\n  That is the goal of this goal--for Congress to step up to the plate \nand authorize a solution to the asbestos litigation problem that will \nensure that all those who become sick from asbestos are fairly and \nefficiently compensated, as contemplated by the parties' earlier \nsettlement. Because I believe this is a problem crying out for \nCongressional action, and because I believe the settlement reached by \nthe parties was a fair one, I am supporting the bill.\n  With that said, I understand that representatives of some of those \nexposed to asbestos who supported the settlement are not currently \nsupporting this proposed legislation. Because I firmly believe that \nthis should go forward as a consensus bill, I remain open to supporting \nany reasonable changes that would be required to gain the support of \nall parties with an interest in asbestos litigation. I am hopeful that \nwe can gain their support and move forward with and pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 2547. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe memorialization at the columbarium at Arlington National Cemetery \nof veterans who have donated their remains to science, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\nto memorialize veterans at arlington national cemetery who donate their \n                                 organs\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, several months ago, one of my \nconstituents, Ms. Llewellyn Hedgbeth of Arlington, Virginia, contacted \nmy office to request my intervention in a matter which has brought \nconsiderable anguish and frustration to her family.\n  It so happened that Ms. Hedgbeth's father, Mr. Roger A. Hedgbeth, \nSr., a decorated veteran of World War II, and a career civil servant, \nhad recently passed away. Before his death, however, he made two simple \nrequests: one, that his body be donated to science, and two, that his \nashes be placed at Arlington National Cemetery. His widow, now 71, \nhonored the first of those wishes. But in honoring the one, it seemed \nthat the second was precluded.\n  The Hedgbeths learned that due to various legal concerns, no ashes of \norgan donors who donate their bodies to science are returned to the \nrespective families of these donors. This situation presented an \ninsurmountable obstacle for the Hedgbeth family who were informed by a \nregretful staff at Arlington National Cemetery, that current \nregulations prohibit memorializing veterans in the Columbarium unless \ntheir remains were actually inurned there.\n  While I can appreciate that limited space at Arlington has \nnecessitated adherence to strict guidelines for burial and \nmemorialization, I cannot see the virtue in denying appropriate \nrecognition for an entitled veteran simply because he has donated his \nremains to science. In fact, I would like to encourage more veterans to \ndo just that.\n  All of us recognize the great need for viable remains for both \ntransplantation and for medical study. Mr. Roger Hedgbeth and other \nveterans who make this courageous commitment should be suitably \nrecognized and their loved ones should know that a grateful nation has \nmade a place for them at one of our country's most sacred memorials.\n  With that said, I submit this bill which seeks to modify current \nregulations to allow otherwise qualified veterans, who have donated \ntheir remains to science, to be memorialized at the Columbarium in \nArlington National Cemetery, not withstanding the absence of their \ncremated remains.\n  Mr. President, I salute these veterans and their devoted families, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MEMORIALIZATION AT COLUMBARIUM AT ARLINGTON \n                   NATIONAL CEMETERY OF VETERANS WHO HAVE DONATED \n                   THEIR REMAINS TO SCIENCE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Memorialize.--(1) Chapter 24 of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2412. Arlington National Cemetery: memorialization at \n       columbarium of veterans who have donated their remains to \n       science\n\n       ``The Secretary of the Army may honor, by marker or other \n     appropriate means at the columbarium at Arlington National \n     Cemetery, the memory of any veteran eligible for inurnment in \n     the columbarium whose cremated remains cannot be inurned in \n     the columbarium as a result of the donation of the veteran's \n     organs or remains for medical or scientific purposes.''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of that chapter \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``2412.

Res. 284\n\n       Whereas under the Extradition Treaty Between the United \n     States of America and the\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\n     United Mexican States, Mexico refused to extradite murder \n     suspect and U.S. citizen Jose Luis Del Toro to the United \n     States until the State of Florida agreed not to exercise its \n     right to seek capital punishment in its criminal prosecution \n     of him;\n       Whereas under the Extradition Treaty Mexico has refused to \n     extradite other suspects of capital crimes; and\n       Whereas the Extradition Treaty interferes with the justice \n     system of the United States and encourages criminals to flee \n     to Mexico: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Protection Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claiming that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. ____03. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this title.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.--Except as \n     provided in section ____04(d), a State in which both State \n     and local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC. ____04. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     title and shall be collected under this title in the same \n     manner as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this title shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this title to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n       (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n     the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n     amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     title, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes \n     which do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this title determined on \n     the basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this title,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this title, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     title, a State has a State law in effect providing a method \n     for distributing local sales taxes other than the method \n     under this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply \n     to that State until the 91st day following the adjournment \n     sine die of that State's next regular legislative session \n     which convenes after the effective date of\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\n     this title (or such earlier date as State law may provide). \n     Local sales taxes collected pursuant to this title prior to \n     the application of this subsection shall be distributed as \n     provided by State law.\n       (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--\n     Notwithstanding section ____03(b) and subsections (b) and (c) \n     of this section, if a State had in effect on January 1, 1995, \n     a State law which provides that local sales taxes are \n     collected and remitted by a board of elected States officers, \n     then for any period during which such law continues in \n     effect--\n       (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n     under this title of only the State sales taxes and the \n     uniform portion of local sales taxes, and\n       (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this title in accordance with State \n     law.\n\n     SEC. ____05. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this title--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this title, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this title.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this title to collect a local sales tax or in-\n     lieu fee.\n\n     SEC. ____06. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     title shall allow to all persons subject to this title all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. ____07. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) Persons Required To Collect State or Local Sales Tax.--\n     Any person required by section ____03 to collect a State or \n     local sales tax shall be subject to the laws of such State \n     relating to such sales tax to the extent that such laws are \n     consistent with the limitations contained in this title.\n       (b) Limitations.--Except as provided in subsection (a), \n     nothing in this title shall be construed to permit a State--\n       (1) to license or regulate any person,\n       (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business, or\n       (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n     sales of tangible personnel property.\n       (c) Preemption.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, this title shall not be construed to preempt or limit \n     any power exercised or to be exercised by a State or local \n     jurisdiction under the law of such State or local \n     jurisdiction or under any other Federal law.\n\n     SEC. ____08. TOLL-FREE INFORMATION SERVICE.\n\n       A State shall not have power under this title to require \n     any person to collect a State or local sales tax on any sale \n     unless, at the time of such sale, such State has a toll-free \n     telephone service available to provide such person \n     information relating to collection of such State or local \n     sales tax. Such information shall include, at a minimum, all \n     applicable tax rates, return and remittance addresses and \n     deadlines, and penalty and interest information.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a \ngreat American patriot and fellow Montanan, Colonel Sam Roberts, U.S. \nAir Force, retired.\n  Colonel Roberts is a true American hero, who exemplifies the meaning \nof duty, honor and country. Today, in my\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\nhome state of Montana, Colonel Roberts will be honored at the \nUniversity of Montana during an 80th anniversary ceremony for the \nReserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).\n  Colonel Roberts received many honors during his career. These awards \ninclude the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Air Medals \nand Commendation Awards from both the Army and the Air Force. In the \n1960's, Colonel Roberts, who was assigned to the Strategic Air Command, \nbriefed our Nation's leaders about the threats to our country and \npotential targets for the United States during the cold war.\n  Sam Roberts was a great leader of those under his command. His motto: \n``Don't ask any of your men to do anything that you wouldn't do \nyourself or that you wouldn't show them how to do yourself,'' is a \ncornerstone that we should look for in the future leaders of our \nmilitary.\n  I salute Colonel Sam Roberts, and his lovely wife, Kathleen, for the \nsacrifices they made during Sam's career and thank them for a job well \ndone. I consider it an honor and privilege to call Sam and Kathleen \nRoberts my friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11357-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF GENE AUTRY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn of the \ndeath of Gene Autry, a longtime Californian, earlier this afternoon. \nMr. Autry will always be remembered as a singer and performer of \nenormous talent and appeal. First making his way onto the radio \nairwaves in 1928 as a singer, his career quickly broadened to include \nacting. He appeared in such films as ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' in 1935 \nand television series as ``The Gene Autry Show'' between 1951-1954. \nPerhaps his most famous song, ``Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer'' will \nforever remind us of his zest for life and gentle charm each holiday \nseason.\n  Mr. Autry succeeded in everything he undertook--radio, television, \nrecords, songwriting, movies, real estate, and business. In 1961, he \nbought the expansion Los Angeles Angels, renamed in 1965 as the \nCalifornia Angels. He maintained ownership of the team until the Walt \nDisney Company took operating control in 1996.\n  Over the course of his life, Mr. Autry collected Western memorabilia \nand art. In 1988, using much of his own funding, he opened the Gene \nAutry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. I cherish \nevery opportunity I have to visit the Heritage Museum and view \ntreasures from the Old West.\n  My most sincere condolences go out to Mrs. Autry and his entire \nfamily. Gene Autry will be missed by all, especially Californians who \nbenefited tremendously from his works. I know that right now, the \nSinging Cowboy is ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' smiling down on \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11358-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING CHALMERS WYLIE\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmemory of former Representative Chalmers Wylie, who passed away on \nAugust 14, 1998, at the age of 77.\n  Chalmers Wylie was elected to the House of Representatives in 1966, \nand went on to serve thirteen distinguished terms. His career included \nservice as Ranking Member of the House Banking, Finance, and Urban \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. Wylie dedicated his life to public service--and especially to the \nservice of the people of Ohio's 15th district. While serving in the \nArmy during World War II, he received the Purple Heart for wounds \nsustained while aiding fallen soldiers in Germany. In addition, he was \nawarded the Silver and Bronze Star, the Presidential Unit Citation with \ntwo oak-leaf clusters, the French Croix de Guerre and the Belgian \nFourragere.\n  Undoubtedly, Mr. Wylie's war-time service provided him with a special \nunderstanding of the needs of veterans. This experience was \nparticularly apparent in the House Veterans' Committee, where he fought \nfor veterans and was instrumental in improving veteran access to \nmedical care in Columbus, Ohio through the establishment of the \nVeterans' Affairs Outpatient Clinic.\n  Along with my distinguished colleague Senator Glenn, I am introducing \nlegislation today to name the Department of Veterans' Affairs \nOutpatient Clinic, located at 543 Taylor Avenue in Columbus, Ohio, the \n``Chalmers P. Wylie Veterans Outpatient Clinic.'' This is a companion \nbill to H.R. 4602, which was introduced by our distinguished House \ncolleague Deborah Pryce, with the support of the entire Ohio \ndelegation. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will support the \nswift passage of this fitting tribute to our friend Chalmers Wylie, for \nhis years of dedication to veterans, to Ohio, and to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11358-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11358-S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LET'S ENCOURAGE BROWNFIELDS DEVELOPMENT AND GET THE LITTLE GUY OUT OF \n               SUPERFUND LITIGATION AT CO-DISPOSAL SITES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday the Conferees on VA-\nHUD Appropriations decided to amend our nation's Superfund law.\n  At present, Superfund contains a limit on the liability of sureties \nwho issue performance bonds to Superfund cleanup contractors. I was the \nauthor of that provision, which I introduced in 1990 as a free-standing \nSuperfund bill (S. 3187). My bill was broadly supported by labor, \nenvironmentalists, and the American Insurance Association.\n  But, Mr. President, at the time the surety liability legislation was \npassed, certain Senators who doubted the limitation was necessary to \nincrease the availability, and hence, competitiveness, of surety bonds, \nadded a sunset provision.\n  During the VA-HUD Conference yesterday, the Conferees agreed to \neliminate that sunset provision. The deletion has had broad-based, \nbipartisan support, and has appeared in each comprehensive Superfund \nreform bill introduced in this Congress.\n  I supported that amendment, Mr. President, but I want to underscore \nmy distress at the manner in which the Conferees adopted the amendment.\n  Several months ago, I asked Senator Chafee to include two Superfund \namendments on the agenda for an Environment and Public Works Committee \nbusiness meeting before the end of the year--one pertaining to \nbrownfields and the other to municipal solid waste (``MSW''). Senator \nChafee rejected this request, based on his opposition to ``piecemeal'' \nSuperfund reform, that is, anything less than a comprehensive overhaul \nof the entire Superfund statute--something that has eluded this body \nnow for three consecutive Congresses, or six years.\n  I was therefore astonished that the surety amendment made its way \ninto yesterday's VA-HUD Conference Report. I was especially surprised \nthat Senator Chafee, as Chair of the authorizing Committee, signed off \non this piece of Superfund reform on an appropriations bill, despite \nhis repeated opposition to ``piecemeal'' reform, and the fact that this \nprovision had not passed the House or the Senate as a stand-alone bill, \nand was not in either the House or the Senate VA-HUD bills.\n  Some argued that the surety amendment was merely technical in \nnature--that it simply perpetuated the opportunity for sureties to \nenjoy limited liability under Superfund.\n  Using that criterion, a brownfields liability exemption would also \nconstitute nothing more than a technical fix--it would clarify that \nCongress did not intend Superfund liability to deter persons from \npurchasing and cleaning up brownfields properties. Nor would an MSW \namendment--which would confirm that Congress did not intend persons who \ndisposed of only household waste to be liable for cleanup of toxic \nwaste.\n  The surety amendment has also been touted as non-controversial--\nhaving consistently enjoyed broad-based bi-partisan support.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated on many occasions, and my esteemed \ncolleagues must agree, brownfields and MSW liability exemptions can \nboast the same historic consensus. They have appeared in each of the \ncomprehensive Superfund reform bills introduced by Republicans or \nDemocrats since the 103rd Congress. And they have gained the support of \nall stakeholders, the Administration, and the national environmental \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\n  The brownfields and MSW fixes are minor, but they are crucial for \nsuccessful brownfields development, or to relieve those subjected to \nunfair and unintended litigation. And they offer significant economic \nand environmental benefits. The nation's Mayors estimate they lose \nbetween $200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from these \nproperties sitting idle, and that returning these sites to productive \nuse could create some 236,000 new jobs.\n  I am therefore honestly trying to understand what, if any, objective \ncriteria exist for determining which small Superfund fixes will be made \nin this session.\n  When I consider yesterday's surety amendment, along with Senator \nLott's recycling proposal (S. 2180), I can find nothing that \ndistinguishes sureties or recyclers from brownfields or MSW. There is \nvirtually nothing that makes the surety's or recycler's needs more \nurgent than those of our cities in need of brownfields revitalization, \nand their taxpayers and residents, who want cleanup and redevelopment; \nor those of the homeowners and small businesses mired in litigation at \nlandfill sites. And it certainly cannot be argued that brownfields or \nMSW have enjoyed any less broad-based support than have fixes for \nrecyclers or sureties.\n  As a Senator from a state with literally thousands of brownfields \nsites, as well as altogether too many instances of homeowners and small \nbusinesses dragged into Superfund litigation by their corporate peers \n(and not by EPA), it is my responsibility to lobby for those \ncommunities and individuals who don't have lobbyists representing them \nhere in the Congress. We, as their elected representatives, are their \nlobbyists. We are their voice. There is no reason in the world why this \nSenate, and this Congress, should not move forward to make the minor, \nnon-controversial, and eminently sensible changes to Superfund law that \nimpede brownfields development and rob small businesses of their hard \nearned profits.\n  Now, Mr. President, some of my colleagues have claimed that passage \nof brownfields or MSW amendments are anathema to comprehensive \nSuperfund reform. Or some of my colleagues have argued that precisely \nbecause the brownfields and MSW amendments are so popular, and enjoy \nsuch broad ranging support, and provide such significant benefits to \nthe nation, that they should be held hostage to comprehensive Superfund \nreform--that we should see if they will succeed in driving parties back \nto the table to negotiate comprehensive Superfund reform for the fourth \nconsecutive Congress.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect, I think it is wrong to prevent \nenactment of legislation that enjoys broad support, and would reap \nacknowledged benefits, as a tactical matter to achieve unrelated goals. \nThis disserves the public and adds to public cynicism. For a variety of \nreasons, efforts to radically change Superfund, the nation's toxic \nwaste cleanup program, have failed for six years running. Toward the \nend of each of the past two Congresses, many Senators, including this \nSenator, have argued that we should move ahead with achievable reforms \nthat are non-controversial and permit our people, our communities, and \nour economy to benefit from their enactment. Today, as we head into the \nfinal week of this Congress, I make the same plea. Just as holding \nrecyclers or sureties hostage to comprehensive Superfund reform has not \ngotten us any closer to producing an acceptable product that the \nPresident could sign, so holding brownfields development and persons \nwho disposed of household trash hostage to other legislative goals is a \nfailed strategy. It will not mitigate the controversy intrinsic to the \nbroader issues raised by comprehensive legislation. But it will rob \ncommunities across the country of the jobs and tax ratables that flow \nfrom revitalized brownfields and will impose severe penalties on the \nindividuals and small businesses caught up in a litigation nightmare \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my esteemed colleagues to move brownfields \nand MSW amendments before this Congress ends. I believe otherwise we \nwill all have a hard time explaining, when we return to our home states \nin October, why sureties and recyclers merited this body's attention, \nbut our communities and our taxpayers and our small businesspeople were \nsomehow less worthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11358-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE NUTRITION\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations \nto the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which is now \ncelebrating its 25th anniversary.\n  For over a quarter of a century, the members of CRN have been working \nto enhance the public's health by promoting wise dietary choices and \nthe appropriate use of nutritional supplements. CRN's work with federal \nlegislators and policy makers has helped to ensure that consumers have \naccess to a variety of quality nutritional products and to accurate \ninformation about the health benefits of these products.\n  Over 100 million Americans are using dietary supplements daily. There \nis ample--and growing--scientific evidence that dietary supplements can \nhelp promote good health. To cite but one example, for many years, we \nhave known that use of folic acid during pregnancy can reduce the risk \nof birth defects. Now it appears it can help prevent heart disease as \nwell.\n  One of the most significant achievements of which I have been a part, \nas a Senator for the last 22 years, has been the passage of the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. I worked closely \nwith the CRN in passing this bill, and I am extremely grateful to them \nfor their insights and expertise, which were integral to the success of \nthis endeavor.\n  I am pleased to have had such a positive relationship with CRN and \nlook forward to working with this fine Association for many years in \nthe future to help Americans live healthier lives. Again, my \ncongratulations to the Council for Responsible Nutrition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11359-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11359-S11360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last night, after several years of \neffort, the Senate passed S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, and I \nstrongly urge the President to sign this important piece of legislation \ninto law.\n  The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 modifies our existing shipping \nregulatory scheme by bringing it up to date with the industry as it \noperates today. It provides more flexibility for carriers and shippers \nto agree on transportation arrangements. It authorizes the privatized \npublication of rate information. It gives individual carrier conference \nmembers more leeway in taking independent actions and in entering \nservice contracts, and thus makes the current system more competitive.\n  Yet the bill also preserves the basic system and principles of common \ncarriage, and maintains protections for ocean transportation users \nagainst unfair or unreasonable actions by transportation providers. \nImportantly, S. 414 preserves the Federal Maritime Commission as an \nindependent regulatory agency, which is vitally important as that \nagency enforces this program while it additionally ensures that our \ntrades remain free from restrictive foreign shipping practices that \nimpede our oceanborne foreign commerce.\n  The reason this bill was so long in coming is that the Senate took \ngreat care to make the legislative process an open one. I was critical \nof shipping legislation passed in the other body three years ago, \nbecause it did not reflect the diversity of concerns reflected in the \nbroad spectrum of shipping interests. It was, as I noted at a Commerce \nCommittee hearing, ``conceived in darkness.'' By contrast, the \nlegislation ultimately agreed to by both the House and Senate is truly \na compromise, in which all industry interests were heard from and all \nsectors had input. No one got everything they wanted in this \nlegislation, and no one's interests were completely disregarded. This \nlegislation is a carefully crafted balance of the many interests at \nstake. When it was necessary, members of all segments sat down and \nnegotiated a compromise. Not everyone is completely pleased with all \naspects of the legislation, but it is incumbent upon us to move \nforward.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank a number of \nmembers of both the House and Senate for their efforts on this bill \nincluding; Congressmen Shuster, Oberstar, Gilchrest\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nand Clement in the House, and Senators McCain and Hollings, the \nSubcommittee Chairwoman Senator Hutchison and of course, Senator Lott \nin the Senate. I would also like to thank Jim Sartucci of Senator \nMcCain's staff and my counsel, Carl Bentzel, for their long hours of \nhard work and industry constituent service as they pieced this bill \ntogether. Without the efforts of Senate staffers, Amy Henderson, Jeanne \nBumpus and Carl Biersack, and Mark Ashby of my staff, and House \nstaffers John Cullather and Rebecca Dye we would not have been able to \nmove this bill. I would also commend the FMC for its objective \nassessments and contributions to this project, particularly FMC \nChairman Hal Creel, General Counsel Tom Panebianco and Legislative \nCounsel Dave Miles. When we needed expertise, they provided us with \nhelp.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Federal Maritime Commission will \ncontinue its mission as a nonpartisan, independent agency. The \nCommission, under Chairman Hal Creel, and with fellow Commissioners \nMing Hsu, Joe Scroggins and Del Won, has done an excellent job \nadministering our shipping laws in a firm but even-handed manner. I \nurge the FMC to keep up the good work, and to keep Congress informed of \nhow the new legislation is working. I am particularly interested in \nwhether the protections afforded the smaller shippers and \nintermediaries against unreasonable practices prove to be sufficient. \nTo this end, I ask that the FMC pay particular attention to these \nparties' concerns about the new law and advise us of any recommended \namendments to the legislation that may prove to be in order.\n  Again, I encourage the President to sign the Ocean Shipping Reform \nAct of 1998 into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11359-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11360-S11365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMENDMENT TO VARIOUS REGULATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to give notice to \nMembers and staff of the Senate that the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration has approved amendments to four Committee regulations, \nas noted below.\n  A. Committee Regulations Governing Franked Mail were amended by \nadding the following:\n  In section 8 (c), add the phrase ``in excess of 500 notices per town \nmeeting'' after the phrase ``Town meeting notices'', so that it reads \n``Town meeting notices in excess of 500 notices per town meeting may \nnot be sent fewer than 60 days immediately before the date of any \nprimary or general election (whether regular, special, or runoff) for \nany Federal, State, or local office in which a Member of the Senate is \na candidate for election, unless the candidacy of the Senator in such \nelection is uncontested.\n  EXPLANATION: The statutory prohibition on mass mailing (2 USC 3210) \nprohibits mailings in excess of 500 and completely exempts town meeting \nnotices from this restriction. However, Committee regulations \nprohibited the use of town meeting notices during the 60 day period \nbefore a primary or general election regardless of the number of such \nnotices that might be sent. This created the anomaly that a member may \nsend less than 500 letters which include notice of a town meeting but \nmay not send a simple, and less costly, town meeting notice. This \namendment will permit town meeting notices less than 500 in number \nduring the 60 day moratorium period.\n  A copy of the Committee Regulations Governing Franked Mail, as \namended, is at attachment A.\n  B. Committee Public Transportation Subsidy Regulations for the United \nStates Senate were amended by substituting as follows:\n  Substitute $40 for $21 in the first sentence of section 2 of so that \nit reads ``. . .a value not exceeding $40.00 per month.''\n  EXPLANATION: Committee regulations implementing the Tax Reform Act of \n1986 authorize $21 per month as a tax free ``de minimis fringe \nbenefit'' for employees using public transportation. This amount has \nnot been increased since 1992. This amendment increases the benefit to \n$40, which approximates the average subsidy given by federal agencies \nwithin the DC area.\n  A copy of the Committee Public Transportation Subsidy Regulations, as \namended, is at attachment B.\n  C. Committee Regulation For The Display Of Flags and State Seals In \nthe Hallways Outside Senators' Offices was amended by deletion and \nsubstitution as follows:\n  Delete current paragraph one and substitute the following: Two wooden \nflagpoles, 8 feet in heights by 1-5/32'' in diameter, mounted in bright \nbrass finished stands weighing at least 15 pounds, for flying 3 foot by \n5 foot state and United States flags, at the Senator's option, are \npermitted in the hallway outsides a Senator's office. The flagpoles and \nstands must be placed inside the office at night.\n  EXPLANATION: Committee regulations currently permit only one flag, \neither the United States or individual state flag, to be flown outside \na member's office. This amendment will permit the flying of both the \nUnited States and the individual state flags outside a member's office.\n  A copy of the Committee Regulation For The Display Of Flags and State \nSeals In the Hallways Outside Senators' Offices, as amended, is at \nattachment C.\n  D. Committee Regulations Governing Advance Payments were amended by \nadding new section (k) as follows:\n  (k) state office rents, up to 1 year in advance\n  EXPLANATION: Committee regulations permited advance payment of \nnumerous obligations but did not include advance payments for state \noffice rents. This amendment authorizes a 1 year advance payment for \nstate office rents to facilitate the processing of rent vouchers in a \ntimely manner, consistent with good business practices.\n  A copy of the Committee Regulations Governing Advance Payment, as \namended, is at attachment D.\n  I ask that the regulations be printed in the Record.\n  The Regulations follow:\n\n                              ATTACHMENT A\n\n                  Regulations Governing Official Mail\n\n (Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration, United States \n        Senate, October 30, 1997; Amended on September 30, 1998)\n\n\n                              DEFINITIONS\n\n       Sec. 1.

This service converts names and \n     addresses to machine readable media which then may be added \n     to such Senator's mail management system. The Sergeant at \n     Arms has the responsibility for the processing and \n     administrative support for this service.\n       (b) Expenses for work performed in accordance with this \n     section shall be paid from funds from a Senator's Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account and shall be reported to \n     offices with their quarterly mass mail cost reports required \n     by section 5(c).\n\n\n                       CHANGE OF ADDRESS PROGRAMS\n\n       Sec. 10. Offices may have names and address on their mail \n     files processed through the National Change of Address (NCOA) \n     Program. A Senator may use any of the vendors certified by \n     the U. S. Postal Service to provide NCOA service. A current \n     list of vendors can be obtained from the Senate Computer \n     Center. Processing costs charged by the NCOA vendor and \n     transportation costs charged by the delivery service shall be \n     billed to, and paid by, such Senator from his or her Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account.\n       (a) Such Senator shall request the Senate Computer Center \n     to prepare his or her mail file for shipment to the vendor \n     selected by the Senator, using the delivery service selected \n     by the Senator. A Sergeant at Arms ``Request for Assistance'' \n     form shall be used for this purpose, and shall include a \n     statement in the following format:\n\n     Processing and shipping costs will be paid by the Office of \n     Senator ______________ (insert name). Bills are to be \n     submitted to ______________ (insert address).\n\n     ______________________________\n     Senator's Signature\n\n       (b) The Senate Computer Center will provide the Senator \n     with information about the mail file that will assist the \n     Senator in estimating processing costs that will be incurred. \n     Please contact the Sergeant at Arms for other options \n     regarding change of address.\n       (c) The Computer Center will prepare the Senator's file for \n     processing, and arrange for transportation, using the \n     delivery service designated by the Senator. The NCOA vendor \n     and the delivery service will be provided with copies of the \n     ``Request for Assistance'' for their use in billing the \n     Senator for their services. On receipt of the corrected file \n     from the NCOA vendor, the Senate Computer Center will restore \n     it to the Senate Mail File System or provide the updated file \n     to the appropriate vendor.\n\n\n                     PAPER AND ENVELOPE ALLOWANCES\n\n       Sec. 12.

Mr. President, in the remaining days of this \nCongress, we can make a profound difference in the lives of American \nwomen. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, S. 2017, would \nensure that women whose cancer is diagnosed through the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention's screening program have access to the \nmedical care they need. It would give states the option of extending \nMedicaid coverage to low-income, uninsured women who have been \ndiagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC program.\n  Federal legislation is needed because the patchwork of state laws \ndoes not ensure women the treatment they need. In California, the \nhealth care community and breast cancer activists mobilized behind a \nbill to provide breast cancer treatment to uninsured and underinsured \nwomen. The California legislature passed the bill and sent it to the \nGovernor for his signature. Despite the bill's widespread popularity, \nthe Governor vetoed it a few days ago.\n  If we care enough about women's health to provide coverage for \nscreenings, then we should care enough to provide treatment when those \nscreenings find cancer. The last thing a woman should have to worry \nabout when she is diagnosed is how she will pay for her treatment.\n  The heart wrenching experience of one of my constituents shows us how \nimportant the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act is.\n  Two and a half years ago, Edna Harris of Imperial Beach, California \nfelt a lump in her breast. Like so many other women in her position, \nshe feared it was cancerous. But Edna had another reason to worry. She \nwas uninsured, and neither she nor her husband were employed.\n  Under the CDC's Early Detection program, Edna underwent a mammogram, \na fine needle biopsy, and then a full biopsy. When the results came in, \nher worst fear had come true: she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and \ntold she needed surgery. The CDC program that had diagnosed her did not \ncover the costs of treatment. Edna was told that unless she would come \nup with nearly $4,000, she could not receive treatment.\n  Edna's experience reveals a fatal flaw in one of our best-\nintentioned, and indeed most successful, programs. Low income and \nuninsured women who are diagnosed with cancer under the CDC program \nmust scramble to find the money for treatment. Edna was fortunate; she \nultimately was able to come up with the resources to fund her \ntreatment. But others are not so fortunate. I have heard from women who \nhave had to mortgage their homes or hold bake sales to pay for cancer \ntreatment. This is unacceptable.\n  The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act will help ensure that \nall our mothers, daughters, and sisters receive the treatment they need \nat one of the most vulnerable times of their lives. I urge our \nleadership to bring the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to the \nfloor this session. We owe it to the women of this country to pass this \nlegislation before Congress adjourns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11365-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11365-S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE GUN A MONTH FORUM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my \ncolleagues of a forum I held on September 2 on the deadly problem of \ngun trafficking. I am pleased that Senator Robb and Senator Sarbanes \nwere able to join me at the forum.\n  As my colleagues know, I have introduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun \nTrafficking Act. The Judiciary Committee has not held hearings on this \nlegislation, and I thought it was important to gather expert testimony \non the issue. The testimony I heard at the forum has made me even more \ndetermined to pass this sensible legislation and make it more difficult \nfor gun traffickers to obtain and sell their deadly merchandise on our \nstreets.\n  The witnesses at this forum included: Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, \nwho is also the chair of the Conference of Mayor's Task Force on Gun \nViolence; James and Sarah Brady; Captain R. Lewis Vass of the Virginia \nState Police, and Captain Thomas Bowers of the Maryland State Police.\n  We also heard from a panel of youth from right here in our nation's \ncapital who live with gun violence everyday in their communities. They \nwere John Schuler, Kenisha Green and Quanita Favorite.\n  In this statement I will summarize what happened during the forum. \nBut I will also be including, during the next few days, testimony from \nthe witnesses so that my colleagues and the public will have a record \nof their views.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the Brady Act, we have helped prevent \nthousands of guns from getting into the hands of the wrong people. \nSince the Brady Act went into effect in 1994, more than 242,000 handgun \npurchases have been denied to convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts \nand other dangerous persons. The Domestic Violence Gun Ban in the Brady \nAct, which I sponsored and which went into effect in\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\n1996, has prevented more than 6,800 firearms sales to people convicted \nof abusing a spouse or child.\n  However, the Brady Law has not completely stopped the flow of \nhandguns to those who should not have them. Gun traffickers continue to \nsupply an illegal gun market by buying large quantities of guns in \nstates with lax gun laws and then reselling them on the streets--often \nin cities and states with strict gun laws.\n  If these traffickers can not legally buy a gun themselves, or if they \ndo not want to have their name turn up if the gun is later found at a \ncrime scene, they find others to make the purchases for them. The \ntrafficker pays a straw purchaser, in money or drugs, to buy 25, 50 or \nmore handguns at a time and then resells the guns to those who \notherwise could not buy them--such as convicted felons, drug addicts, \nor children.\n  In fact, the Maryland State Police official testified that multiple \nguns purchased by straw purchasers were the source of the majority of \nfirearms used in the commission of violent crime.\n  My bill would make it far more difficult and less profitable for \ntraffickers to conduct their deadly business, by prohibiting an \nindividual from buying more than one handgun a month. We know this \napproach works because three states--Virginia, Maryland, South \nCarolina--have passed one-gun-a month laws and the results have been \ndramatic. Gun trafficking from these states has plunged.\n  For instance, officers from the Virginia State Police testified that \nafter Virginia passed its one-handgun-a-month limit in 1993, the number \nof crime guns traced back to Virginia from the Northeast dropped by \nnearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, Virginia had been among \nthe leading supplier of weapons to the so-called ``Iron Pipeline'' that \nfeed the arms race on the streets of Northeastern cities.\n  In 1995, the Virginia Crime Commission conducted a comprehensive \nstudy of the one-handgun-a-month limit to determine if the law had \nachieved its purpose. That study found, and I quote, ``Virginia's one-\ngun-a-month statute . . . has had its intended effect of reducing \nVirginia's status as a source state for gun trafficking.''\n  Maryland and South Carolina showed similar results. In South \nCarolina, according to the same Crime Commission report: ``Prior to the \npassage of the one-gun-a-month law, South Carolina was a leading source \nstate for guns traced to New York City, accounting for 39% of guns \nrecovered in criminal investigations. Following the implementation of \nthe law, South Carolina virtually dropped off of the statistical list \nof source states for firearms trafficked to the northeast.''\n  Maryland--the most recent state to pass a limit on handgun \npurchases-- passed its law in 1996 and has already seen the results. \nAccording to testimony from the Maryland State Police:\n  ``In 1991 Maryland was nationally ranked second in terms of suppliers \nof crime guns to the City of New York. By 1997, one year after the \npassage of Maryland's one gun a month law, Maryland moved out of the \ntop ten suppliers of crime guns to New York City.''\n  And most significant is the drop in crime that has followed enactment \nof limits on handgun sales. For example, in Virginia, the number of \nmurders, robberies and aggravated assaults committed with a firearm \nsignificantly dropped after 1993 when the limit went into effect. Of \ncourse it should not come as a surprise to anyone that violent crime \nwould drop when it becomes more difficult for criminals to get a \nhandgun. Handguns are the gun of choice for criminals--they are cheap \nand concealable. Of all murders committed with firearm, about 80% are \ncommitted with a handgun.\n  Limits on handgun purchases, while disrupting gun traffickers, have \nlittle or no effect on the sportsman or law abiding citizen because a \nvery small percent of all handgun purchases involve multiple sales. For \nexample, in 1991, Virginia State Police reported only 6% of handgun \npurchases were multiple sales. But of these, nearly 75% were semi-\nautomatic weapons, the weapon of choice among gun traffickers. Mayor \nRendell testified that less than 1% of handgun purchasers in \nPhiladelphia bought more than 12 handguns in a twelve month period.\n  Let me put some human faces on this issue. As I said earlier, kids \nfrom the District of Columbia testified at my forum. And what they had \nto say was terrifying. Guns were an every day part of their lives. For \nthese kids, D.C. does not stand for District of Columbia. It stands for \nDodge City.\n  These young people told us that guns are easy to get in their \nneighborhoods and schools. They call it getting strapped. And if you do \nnot get strapped you might not make it through the day, they said.\n  One young woman put it eloquently: ``It's not fair,'' she said. \n``Other kids get to go to college. We get to go to funerals. These \npeople who sell guns are the real predators. They feed off our pain.''\n  We must shut these predators down.\n  Most sane people would ask, who could possibly need more than one \nhandgun a month? The testimony at my forum gave the clear and obvious \nanswer. Someone who should not have any at all. The only people who \nwould ``need'' more than one gun a month are gun traffickers. It is the \nonly way to make their deadly business profitable.\n  The need for a national limit on handgun sales is clear. I hope this \nCongress has the courage to act in the interests of law abiding \nAmericans. But I have my doubts. This Congress has defeated sensible \nproposals to try to make guns safer through mandated safety locks. This \nCongress has defeated legislation that would require adults to keep \ntheir guns locked and out of reach of children.\n  I look forward to the day when this Congress listens to the American \npeople instead of the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. \nPoll after poll shows that Americans, including gun-owning Americans, \nwant tougher controls on guns. A University of Chicago study in 1996 \nfound 85% support legislation mandating that all new handguns must be \nchildproof, and 80% favors limiting handgun sales to one a month.\n  We have heard a lot from Charlton Heston lately now that he is \npresident of the National Rifle Association. But I sometimes think Mr. \nHeston forgets he is only an actor--not Moses--when he uses that superb \nvoice of his in the service of the National Rifle Association.\n  I would like to remind Mr. Heston of one of the last things Moses \nsaid to the children of Israel before he died.\n  ``I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose \nlife if you and your offspring would live.''\n  Well, Mr. Heston, we choose life--for ourselves and our children. And \nwe are going to fight the curse that gun traffickers have wrought upon \ncities, our schools and our streets.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people; stop turning a \nblind eye to the daily destruction caused by guns in America. I urge my \ncolleagues to have the will to do something to help the youth of \nAmerica live without the daily sound of gunshots in their lives. I ask \nmy colleagues to support this common sense approach to keep handguns \nout of the hands of criminals.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony of Mayor Edward Rendell be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The testimony follows:\n\nTestimony of Mayor Edward G. Rendell, Forum on Handgun Violence and S. \n         466, ``The Anti-Gun Trafficking Act''--Talking Points\n\n\n                      i. the scope of the problem\n\n       We have a crisis in Philadelphia: Gun violence is out of \n     control, and the carnage it has created is unprecedented in \n     our City.\n       The statistics are chilling: Between 1985 and 1995, deaths \n     by firearm rose 66 percent in Pennsylvania, and by 102 \n     percent in Philadelphia. In 1995 there were 432 total \n     homicides in Philadelphia, and gun homicides represented a \n     staggering 77 percent of that number. In 1996, there were 414 \n     total homicides, and killings by gun represented 81 percent \n     of that number. And last year, the gruesome trend continued: \n     of the 410 total homicides in Philadelphia, 339 of them--\n     almost 83 percent--were due to gun violence. These numbers \n     are the highest of any city in the nation.\n       For the City, there is one particularly horrifying element \n     to the growing plague of gun violence: More and more, kids \n     are doing the killing. In almost 15 percent of all \n     Philadelphia gun homicides over the last three years, a child \n     under age 18 was arrested for pulling the trigger. And worst \n     of all, kids are the victims, too: in 1995, 24 children were \n     shot to death; in 1996, the number was 25; and last year, 26 \n     kids were killed by gunfire. Ladies and gentlemen, homicide \n     is now the leading cause of death among youths ages 16 to 21 \n     in\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\n     Philadelphia. Compare this Boston, where no kids--zero--under \n     the age of 18 were killed by gunfire during the same period.\n       The carnage caused by gun violence in Philadelphia doesn't \n     just show up in the murder statistics, either: More than half \n     of all robberies committed in Philadelphia are robberies at \n     the point of a gun. In Philadelphia last year, there were \n     11,938 robberies, and 53.7 percent were gun robberies. Almost \n     one-third of those arrested for these crimes were under the \n     age of 18.\n       Of the 6,198 aggravated assaults in Philadelphia last year, \n     more than 36 percent involved a gun--a total of 2,279 \n     shootings in one year. Almost 17 percent of those arrested \n     for these crimes were juveniles.\n       In one bloody week earlier this year, our newspaper \n     headlines recorded the shooting deaths of eight people in \n     Philadelphia--five in one weekend alone. Among the victims: a \n     22-year-old man killed in a gun battle that erupted outside \n     the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania after a high-\n     school basketball championship game. Three others were \n     wounded in the melee, which took place in the middle of 33rd \n     Street as the crowd was leaving the game. In other cases, two \n     owners of a neighborhood pizzeria were gunned down in their \n     store; an elderly woman was shot to death during a robbery in \n     her own home; and a lawyer and his assistant were robbed and \n     executed in their Center City office.\n       Though that week was particularly grim, it was by no means \n     one-of-a-kind. In fact, the situation is so bad that an \n     absence of murder actually became news last spring: In a \n     story about the Philadelphia murder rate, one local newspaper \n     reported that Philadelphia went 12 days without a homicide, \n     from April 24th to May 5th. As the paper noted: ``There had \n     not been a comparable killing-free stretch for at least 10 \n     years. The next longest streak on record was eight days, in \n     1988.''\n\n\n         ii. we have tried to address the problem in many ways\n\n       Having been a prosecutor for most of my professional \n     career--I was the elected District Attorney of Philadelphia \n     from 1978 to 1986, and before that, I served as the Chief of \n     the Homicide Unit in the DA's office--I know a fair amount \n     about crime and the fear that it generates among good and \n     decent people in our communities. This is not an argument \n     about whether people have the right to own guns or not. \n     Rather, this is about stopping guns from getting into the \n     wrong hands, particularly criminals and children.\n       I understand the need for comprehensive solutions to \n     fighting crime involve more than controlling the flow of \n     handguns in our City. For example, in my first term as \n     District Attorney of Philadelphia, I authored the death \n     penalty law in Pennsylvania, which withstood legal challenge \n     and today is being used with increasing frequency.\n       In 1982, during my second term as DA, I authored \n     Pennsylvania's current mandatory sentencing law, which \n     created tough new mandatory jail terms for criminal \n     offenders, including a flat five-year mandatory sentence for \n     anyone convicted of using a firearm during the commission of \n     a felony.\n       The results have meant longer sentences are being served in \n     Pennsylvania. Last year alone, the number of convictions for \n     gun offenses in Philadelphia almost doubled, and the number \n     of jail terms meted out for these convictions jumped by more \n     than 120 percent. Overall, the number of inmates in \n     Pennsylvania prisons has increased by almost 30 percent \n     since 1993 (26,060 inmates statewide in 1993, up to 34,534 \n     inmates statewide by 1996.)\n       We have tried through the enactment of state legislation in \n     Pennsylvania as recently a 1995. The Pennsylvania Uniform \n     Firearms Act (18 Pa.C.S. Sec. 6111(g)(5)) makes it a felony \n     to ``knowingly and intentionally'' sell or deliver a gun if \n     he or she has ``reason to believe'' that the gun is intended \n     to be used in the commission of a crime. But the problem has \n     been in proving that the seller acted ``knowingly or \n     intentionally,'' with reason to believe that the firearm was \n     intended for use in a crime. Proving intent is always \n     difficult; proving that someone acted knowingly, \n     intentionally and with reason to believe is practically \n     impossible. As a result, a law meant to limit a criminal's \n     access to guns in reality is used only very rarely, and as \n     such has had no practical effect on the effort to keep guns \n     out of the hands of criminals.\n\n\n                      III. And We're Still Trying\n\n       The statistics show the grim toll of gun violence in \n     Philadelphia, and these facts can be repeated in cities all \n     over America. They can be measured in starkly human terms: \n     the number of lives lost to gun violence, and the number of \n     lives ruined by it, either through injury (victims and \n     families) or incarceration (the perpetrators). But for cities \n     like Philadelphia, the cost of gun violence can be quantified \n     in dollars and cents too; Taking into account the enormous \n     burden that guns place on our health services, courts, \n     prisons, police, sheriffs, fire, pension, workers \n     compensation, our public schools, and social services, the \n     City estimates the cost of gun violence in Philadelphia is \n     $58.8 million a year.\n       These statistics underscore the critical importance of \n     doing all we can to eliminate the flow of guns to the wrong \n     people: criminals, children, and those ``straw purchasers'' \n     who sell to them. That is why we pushed for tougher \n     sentences, for the death penalty, and for the construction of \n     new prisons to house those sentenced to longer jail terms.\n       But the grim gun violence statistics keep climbing, showing \n     that what we've done hasn't been nearly enough.\n       That's why we continue to do all that we can to stop the \n     violence, with initiatives like the successful effort to win \n     agreement with gun manufacturers to provide a child safety \n     lock with every handgun they sell. The industry is to be \n     commended for its willingness to act affirmatively to provide \n     child safety locks. They are an easy, affordable way to \n     reduce gun violence, and they are helping.\n       That is why we also have launched a comprehensive public \n     education campaign in Philadelphia, targeting youngsters with \n     a message that focuses on violence reduction (I Can End \n     Violence) and specifically on carrying and using guns. These \n     messages are aimed for distribution through churches, rec \n     centers, and youth centers. In addition, we have launched a \n     public service ad campaign--``What Are You Shooting For?''--\n     that sends that same message throughout the Greater \n     Philadelphia region, and we have garnered the assistance of \n     the local media in supporting this effort by broadcasting \n     these messages.\n       The Philadelphia Police Department has changed the way it \n     does business with respect to handguns. A whole new series of \n     initiatives have been introduced to control the damage done \n     by criminals with handguns. These initiatives include: \n     Standard Interview Protocol for all gun offenders to \n     determine the origin of guns used in crimes; streamlining all \n     gun issues in the Police Department under one command; \n     aggressively serving warrants; zero tolerance for gun \n     offenders in high violent-crime areas; and more aggressively \n     tracing guns used in crimes, and cracking down on second \n     sales, with the help of the ATF.\n       Working together, the ATF and the Philadelphia Police \n     Department have made terrific progress in tracking the \n     origins of guns used in the commission of crimes. Initially, \n     the joint ATF-PPD task force traced firearms recovered in \n     major crimes. Today, they trace all firearms linked to an \n     arrest, and soon, they will have the capability to trace all \n     firearms recovered in Philadelphia.\n       As a result of these initiatives, the task force has \n     increased the number of arrests for gun violation \n     prosecutions by 25 percent, and that number continues to \n     rise. But again, to be successful in prosecuting those who \n     sell guns to criminals, we must prove that the seller \n     ``knowingly or intentionally'' sold the gun to someone he \n     knew was going to use it to commit a crime. In practice, it \n     is a difficult EGR standards to meet, especially since \n     neither the seller nor the buyer has any incentive to \n     testify to that effect. The seller clearly has no interest \n     in testifying that he knowingly sold a gun to a criminal, \n     or that he had reason to expect that it would be used in a \n     crime. And the criminal likewise has little incentive to \n     volunteer any inculpatory evidence whatsoever.\n       As a result, despite the success of these efforts, we must \n     all do more.\n\n\n                    iv. what the gun industry can do\n\n       Gun manufacturers can help, too. Child safety locks were a \n     great move, but more must be done. I have asked the industry \n     to:\n       (1) increase internal security--14,000 guns were stolen \n     from one manufacturer's plant in Southern California;\n       (2) stop selling guns that are attractive to criminals but \n     have no legitimate use except to kill people: Saturday night \n     specials, armor piercing bullets, military assault weapons;\n       (3) stop advertising that incorrectly suggests that people \n     are safer for having a gun in their homes; the New England \n     Journal of Medicine reports that bringing a gun into the home \n     leads to a three-fold increase in risk of homicide in the \n     home;\n       (4) take the lead and oppose senseless restrictions that \n     impede investigation of gun crimes, such as obstruction of \n     the Brady form and multiple purchase form in 20 days, making \n     tracking infinitely more difficult. NOTE: even Ron Stewart of \n     Colt recently called for federalization of state laws \n     requiring a second set of serial numbers on weapons because, \n     as he said, ``isn't that a protective measure that prevents \n     illegal ownership of a firearm?''\n       (5) A 1994 federal law banned further manufacture for \n     civilian use of clips or magazines holding more than 10 \n     rounds of ammunition. Stop producing guns that accept \n     ``grandfathered'' magazines;\n       (6) Develop technology to make illegal use almost \n     impossible, such as the production of ``personalized'' \n     handguns that can only be fired by their rightful owners. \n     This is the ultimate weapon against illegal use of handguns. \n     Last year, Colt unveiled a prototype personalized handgun for \n     police to prevent them from being shot with their own \n     weapons. This system should be developed ASAP for everyone, \n     police and civilians alike.\n       The gun industry, working with the American Shooting Sports \n     Council, has agreed to join mayors from a variety of cities, \n     including Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and St. Louis, in \n     the formation of a joint task force to come with initiatives, \n     by the fall of this year, to reduce handgun violence in \n     American cities. That is the kind of partnership we need to \n     substantively address the problem of handgun violence in our \n     cities.\n       That is why I also urge federal support for Project Exile, \n     a partnership we have created with the National Rifle \n     Association in which Philadelphia would be used as a test \n     city to gauge the impact of federalizing every violation of \n     existing handgun laws. The idea is\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\n     simple: federally prosecute all handgun violations, and mete \n     out tough federal prison sentences for all convictions. It \n     has shown dramatic results in Richmond, Va., and I have no \n     doubt that it will reduce gun violence and the carnage that \n     accompanies it on the streets of Philadelphia. People on both \n     sides of the age-old gun debate have criticized this \n     partnership, but again, this is not about the Second \n     Amendment. This is not about the right to bear arms. We're \n     talking about stemming the flow of guns into the inner city, \n     where they are used by criminals and children to commit \n     crimes and destroy families. Thanks to the support of Sen. \n     Lautenberg and Sen. Specter, Congressional support for this \n     initiative will help us obtain the federal resources needed \n     to make the program a success. I have already been to the \n     White House to discuss Administration support for the \n     initiative, and I believe that it will be successful in that \n     regard.\n       We are engaged in a war to reduce the carnage caused by gun \n     violence. And we must fight this fight on many fronts, and \n     sometimes with unusual allies. We have worked with the gun \n     industry, the NRA and its representatives, for one simple \n     reason: We need their help to reduce gun violence. And we are \n     still considering litigation to force gun manufacturers to \n     join the fight against gun violence if they do not do so \n     willingly.\n\n\n          v. the need for federal one gun a month legislation\n\n       If these initiatives are critical to our fight, then the \n     enactment of legislation is no less essential in the effort \n     to reduce gun violence. And that is why today's forum is \n     critically important: Whatever other initiatives are \n     implemented, we must develop Congressional support for S. \n     466, the federal Anti-Gun Trafficking Act sponsored by Sen. \n     Lautenberg. Because gun trafficking knows no state lines, \n     federal legislation--a uniform national standard limiting \n     handgun purchases--is the only effective way to combat this \n     problem.\n       I have long advocated support for One Gun a Month, because \n     it is a matter of basic common sense. One Gun a Month deals \n     only with handguns, and does not interfere at all with a \n     citizen's right to maintain a firearm for home or personal \n     protection. Instead, One Gun a Month focuses on stopping \n     multiple purchases of handguns, because these are the guns \n     that ultimately wind up being resold on the streets of our \n     cities to criminals and children.\n       Look at the statistics on gun sales in Pennsylvania. In \n     1996, there were 150,000 handgun sales statewide. During \n     roughly the same period, there were 38,338 guns sold in the \n     Philadelphia region alone. Of that number, roughly nine \n     percent of the purchasers bought nearly 30 percent of the \n     guns.\n       What that means is that small numbers of people are buying \n     lots of guns, and our experience shows that is for only one \n     reason: to resell them on the street to people who use them \n     in the commission of crimes.\n       One Gun a Month would limit purchasers to buying 12 guns a \n     year. I also support the so-called ``Collector's Exception,'' \n     which would permit bona fide gun collectors from the \n     legislation. As a result, for the overwhelming majority of \n     gun purchasers, only the 13th gun would be prohibited. Ladies \n     and gentlemen, legislation that proposes to ban handgun sales \n     only at the purchase of 13 guns a year does not affect the \n     average citizen--or the average gun purchaser. As the New \n     York Times pointed out in a recent editorial supporting a \n     federal limit, those who argue that One Gun a Month would \n     limit a citizen's right to bear arms should be forced to \n     ``explain to crime-fearing Americans why a 12-gun-per-year \n     limit would impose any offensive burden on law-abiding users \n     who may want a weapons for target shooting or for personal \n     protection.''\n       Instead, the federal standard proposed in S. 466 simply \n     limits the ability of those who resell guns on our streets. \n     Again, look at just the Pennsylvania numbers. Of the 25,510 \n     purchasers of guns in 1996, One Gun a Month would affect only \n     103 Pennsylvania purchasers (those who bought more than 12 \n     guns in a 12-month period.) That's .4 percent of all \n     purchasers of guns in Philadelphia, and only a total of 5,000 \n     guns out of the 38,000 sold in 1996 in the Philadelphia \n     region.\n       And while One Gun a Month does little to limit purchases by \n     law-abiding citizens in Pennsylvania, it has the potential to \n     crack down on the sales to those who sell to criminals and \n     children. In other words, it has the ability to go after the \n     gun sales that none of us want: not the City of Philadelphia, \n     not any member of Congress, and not even the gun \n     manufacturers or the NRA.\n       The grim reality of these types of sales is inescapable. \n     FACT: At least 20 percent of all multiple gun purchasers can \n     be linked to guns used in the commission of crime, \n     particularly violent crime, in Philadelphia. FACT: A total of \n     608 handguns that were purchased in multiple purchase \n     transactions have been directly linked to a homicide or other \n     violent crime in Philadelphia. And as the tracing of these \n     guns continues, these numbers undoubtedly will continue to \n     rise. FACT: Under One Gun a Month, the sale of guns to \n     ``suspect purchasers'' (those whose purchases suggest \n     involvement in street resale of guns) could be reduced by as \n     much as 54 percent.\n       States have taken the lead in the effort to limit purchases \n     to one gun a month. And as Sen. Lautenberg has made clear, \n     the good news is that One Gun a Month is working in Virginia, \n     South Carolina and Maryland, where it was most recently \n     enacted. In Virginia, the odds of a handgun seized in a crime \n     anywhere along the East Coast has dropped 66 percent since \n     One Gun a Month was enacted in 1993. In Maryland, handgun \n     sales dropped more than 25 percent last year, and as the \n     Washington Post noted sarcastically, that in turn ``is \n     threatening Maryland's position as a leading supplier of \n     handguns seized by police at crime scenes up and down the \n     East Coast.''\n       I urge members of Congress to follow the lead of Sen. \n     Lautenberg and support S. 466, the ``Anti-Gun Trafficking \n     Act.'' I have also urged the gun industry and the NRA to \n     support this important legislation, together with my fellow \n     mayors from cities all over the nation. Again, this is not \n     about whether people have the right to bear arms or purchase \n     weapons. This legislation does not affect them. This is about \n     keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, and out of the \n     hands of children. Gun violence is out of control in \n     Philadelphia, and this legislation can help to stop it. I \n     urge your support.\n       Several years ago, a Florida-based manufacturer of assault \n     pistols which at that time were with a 32-round magazine, \n     said: ``I know some of the guns going out of here will end up \n     killing people, but I'm not responsible for that.'' He was \n     wrong then, and that attitude is wrong now. It is my \n     responsibility, and it is everyone's responsibility, \n     including mayors, state legislators, members of Congress, and \n     indeed, especially the gun industry itself.\n       Back in April, I came to Washington to speak directly to \n     gun manufacturers, thanks to the invitation of the American \n     Shooting Sports Council. It was, I might add, not the \n     greatest reception I've ever gotten. But they were at least \n     willing to listen, and I told them that we very much wanted \n     to be their allies in fighting the growing plague of gun \n     violence. That remains true, but understand, one way or \n     another we will try anything and everything--whether it is \n     partnering with the gun industry or the NRA, or suing gun \n     manufacturers--to end the terrible consequences of gun \n     violence on the streets of Philadelphia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11365-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) Dutch John, Utah, was founded by the Secretary of \n     the Interior in 1958 on Bureau of Reclamation land as a \n     community to house personnel, administrative offices, and \n     equipment for project construction and operation of the \n     Flaming Gorge Dam and Reservoir as authorized by the Act of \n     April 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 105, chapter 203; 43 U.S.C. 620 et \n     seq.); and\n       (B) permanent structures (including houses, administrative \n     offices, equipment storage and maintenance buildings, and \n     other public buildings and facilities) were constructed and \n     continue to be owned and maintained by the Secretary of the \n     Interior;\n       (2)(A) Bureau of Reclamation land surrounding the Flaming \n     Gorge Reservoir (including the Dutch John community) was \n     included within the boundaries of the Flaming Gorge National \n     Recreation Area in 1968 under Public Law 90-540 (16 U.S.C. \n     460v et seq.);\n       (B) Public Law 90-540 assigned responsibility for \n     administration, protection, and development of the Flaming \n     Gorge National Recreation Area to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and provided that lands and waters needed or used \n     for the Colorado River Storage Project would continue to be \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior; and\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\n       (C) most structures within the Dutch John community \n     (including the schools and public buildings within the \n     community) occupy lands administered by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture;\n       (3)(A) the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of \n     the Interior are unnecessarily burdened with the cost of \n     continuing to provide basic services and facilities and \n     building maintenance and with the administrative costs of \n     operating the Dutch John community; and\n       (B) certain structures and lands are no longer essential to \n     management of the Colorado River Storage Project or to \n     management of the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area;\n       (4)(A) residents of the community are interested in \n     purchasing the homes they currently rent from the Secretary \n     of the Interior and the land on which the homes are located;\n       (B) Daggett County, Utah, is interested in reducing the \n     financial burden the County experiences in providing local \n     government support services to a community that produces \n     little direct tax revenue because of Federal ownership; and\n       (C) a withdrawal of the role of the Federal Government in \n     providing basic direct community services to Dutch John would \n     require local government to provide the services at a \n     substantial cost;\n       (5)(A) residents of the Dutch John community are interested \n     in self-government of the community; and\n       (B) with growing demands for additional commercial \n     recreation services for visitors to the Flaming Gorge \n     National Recreation Area and Ashley National Forest, there \n     are opportunities for private economic development, but few \n     private lands are available for the services; and\n       (6) the privatization and disposal to local government of \n     certain lands in and surrounding Dutch John would be in the \n     public interest.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to privatize certain lands in and surrounding Dutch \n     John, Utah;\n       (2) to transfer jurisdiction of certain Federal property \n     between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \n     Interior;\n       (3) to improve the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area;\n       (4) to dispose of certain residential units, public \n     buildings, and facilities;\n       (5) to provide interim financial assistance to local \n     government to defray the cost of providing basic governmental \n     services;\n       (6) to achieve efficiencies in operation of the Flaming \n     Gorge Dam and Reservoir and the Flaming Gorge National \n     Recreation Area;\n       (7) to reduce long-term Federal outlays; and\n       (8) to serve the interests of the residents of Dutch John \n     and Daggett County, Utah, and the general public.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, Clark County has seen phenomenal growth over \nthe past ten years, and is the fastest growing county in the nation. \nThis influx of new residents has put great pressure on the \ninfrastructure of the region, and also the recreational assets. While \nno one thing can solve all the problems associated with the burgeoning \ngrowth rate that has occurred, we can take steps to control and manage \nit. The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act has a long history \nand can trace its genesis back to Congressman Jim Santini, author of \nthe Santini-Burton Act. Former Congressman Jim Bilbray continued this \ninitiative with the public lands task force, a process which Senator \nBryan and I continued. It is from these efforts that the bill before us \nhas evolved, with the input of Congressmen Gibbons and Ensign.\n  This bill takes important steps by providing for the orderly disposal \nof public lands in southern Nevada, providing for the acquisition of \nenvironmentally sensitive lands in the state, and providing a mechanism \nfor local governments to offset the costs associated with development \nof disposed federal lands. The distribution of the proceeds from \nfederal land sales will give the federal government 85% for the \nacquisition of environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada. The State \nwill use its 5% share for general education programs, while the \nremaining 10% will benefit the Las Vegas Valley water treatment \nprograms, water infrastructure development, parks, and trails.\n  Mr. President, as we approach the 21st century, we have to be \ncognizant of our future generations and the legacy that we will leave \nthem. Any growth that occurs in a community must have coordinated \nplanning and this measure will greatly assist with this process by \nproviding for local government involvement. It allows state, county and \ncity governments to manage the costs associated with the development of \nthese lands by adding to the state education fund, as well as assisting \nwith the future development of the southern Nevada water system and \nairport infrastructure. It will also assist us in protecting and \npreserving wild and scenic places for future generations, which are of \nvalue not just to the residents of Clark County, but to all taxpayers.\n  This bill has the bipartisan support of the Nevada Congressional \ndelegation, enjoys broad-based support in Clark County, and support \nthroughout the State. It means a great deal to me personally and I \nbelieve it will be of enormous benefit to the State of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11373-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        GRANITE WATERSHED ENHANCEMENT AND PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (H.R. 2886) to provide for \na demonstration project in the Stanislaus National Forest, California, \nunder which a private contractor will perform resource management \nactivities for that unit of the National Forest System, which had been \nreported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, with an \namendment on page 2 to strike line 20 and insert in lieu thereof \n``prescribed burns in the Granite watershed.''\n  The Committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill was considered, ordered to a third reading, read the third \ntime, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11373-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ROGUE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (H.R. 3796) to authorize \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to convey the administrative site for the \nRogue River National Forest and use the proceeds for the construction \nor improvement of offices and support building for the Rogue River \nNational and the Bureau of Land Management, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, with an amendment \non page 2, line 13 to strike ``provide'' and insert in lieu thereof \n``accept.''\n  The Committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill was considered, ordered to a third reading, read the third \ntime, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11373-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE\n\n  The bill (S. 1016) to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 regarding charter schools, was considered, ordered to be \nengrossed for third reading, read the third time, and passed; as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board \n     of Education, which mandated an end to the segregation of \n     public schools, was one of the most significant Court \n     decisions in the history of the United States;\n       (2) the admission of nine African-American students, known \n     as the ``Little Rock Nine'', to Little Rock's Central High \n     School as a result of the Brown decision, was the most \n     prominent national example of the implementation of the Brown \n     decision, and served as a catalyst for the integration of \n     other, previously segregated public schools in the United \n     States;\n       (3) 1997 marked the 70th anniversary of the construction of \n     Central High School, which has been named by the American \n     Institute of Architects as ``the most beautiful high school \n     building in America'';\n       (4) Central High School was included on the National \n     Register of Historic Places in 1977 and designated by the \n     Secretary of the Interior as a National Historic Landmark in \n     1982 in recognition of its national significance in the \n     development of the Civil Rights movement in the United \n     States; and\n       (5) the designation of Little Rock Central High School as a \n     unit of the National Park System will recognize the \n     significant role the school played in the desegregation of \n     public schools in the South and will interpret for future \n     generations the events associated with early desegregation of \n     southern schools.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to preserve, \n     protect, and interpret for the benefit, education, and \n     inspiration of present and future generations, Central High \n     School in Little Rock, Arkansas, and its role in the \n     integration of public schools and the development of the \n     Civil Rights movement in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has taken \nup and passed S. 1719 and H.R. 3381, the Gallatin Land Consolidation \nAct of 1998. S. 1719, a bill that I have sponsored and that my good \ncolleague Senator Burns has cosponsored, is identical to H.R. 3381, a \nbill sponsored by Montana Congressman Rick Hill that has already passed \nthe House. These bills complete the Gallatin Land Exchange process--an \neffort that began almost ten years ago.\n  In 1993, I had the pleasure of sponsoring the Gallatin Land \nConsolidation and Protection Act that completed phase 1 of this \nexchange. Like S. 1719, that bill was co-sponsored by Senator Burns. \nThe House companion in that case was carried by my good friend and \ncolleague, former Representative Pat Williams from Montana.\n  Together, these bills represent a bipartisan effort where members \nfrom both sides of the aisle have worked in a cooperative spirit for \nthe good of Montana. And these bills represent a broad community \nconsensus in Montana about the needs of the Gallatin area for today and \nfor tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you why these bills are good for Montana \nand good for America. In the early 1990s when we first began this \nprocess, the federal government owned every other section of land in \nthe Gallatin Range. As people in the area were fond of saying, you \ncould play checkers from Bozeman, Montana to the Yellowstone border.\n  And while this pattern might be good for checkers, it was bad for \njust about every other purpose. The Forest Service could not manage \nthis unwieldy land ownership pattern. Imagine the frustration of trying \nto manage every other section of land for elk habitat as houses and \nsubdivisions spring up in the middle of your forest. And this pattern \nkept the public from even being able to access their public lands.\n  Mr. President, this pattern may have made sense when it was created \nas part of the railroad land grants over a hundred years ago, but it \ndoes not make sense today.\n  And that is why I am pleased that we have put our backs into this \neffort and, after ten years, are finally poised to complete this \nproject. The pending legislation is supported by Montanans from all \nwalks of life. Hunters and fishermen support the exchange because it \nwill protect important habitat for elk and moose and will protect \nimportant fisheries. Conservationists support the exchange because it \nprotects important grizzly bear habitat in the Taylor Fork. Loggers \nsupport the exchange because it will help deliver trees to the local \nmill in Livingston, Montana. And local homeowners, from the Taylor Fork \nto Bridger Canyon, all have endorsed this exchange.\n  This consensus did not just happen. It was the result of a lot of \nhard work. I met personally with representatives from each of these \ngroups and walked the lands involved in this exchange. I heard the \nconcerns of Mike Liebleson from the Bridger Canyon Property Owners \nAssociation and I heard the concerns from George and Patricia \nLeffingwell. And we addressed their concerns. And we addressed the \nconcerns of Montana small mills represented by the Independent Forest \nProducts Association. And we met the concerns of the Greater \nYellowstone Coalition, The Wilderness Society and other local \nconservation organizations. And last, but certainly not least, we \nworked closely with the Forest Service and the Administration to try to \nmake sure that this bill reflected their needs.\n  Throughout this process, the private party to this exchange, Big Sky \nLumber Company, has acted in good faith. They have made numerous \nunilateral concessions to increase the environmental benefits of this \nexchange and to address public concerns. Their attorney, Joe Sabol, has \nbeen instrumental in pulling this package together. Without his efforts \nand those of Bob Dennee, Lands Specialist for the Gallatin National \nForest, and Kurt Alt, Wildlife Biologist for the Montana Department of \nFish, Wildlife and Parks, none of this would have been possible.\n  Mr. President, this has been a community effort. And, as a result, it \nreflects a community consensus. This is the way that we should resolve \nissues in the West.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11383-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STAR PRINT--REPORT TO ACCOMPANY S. 1719\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

It's been a long process, but one in \nwhich bipartisan and bicameral cooperation at every step of the process \nserved to create a better and stronger bill to serve the needs of the \nGreat Lakes region.\n  The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act has eight Senate \nsponsors, including myself, and twenty-eight of our colleagues on the \nHouse are also cosponsors. This bill represents the consensus of a \ndiverse collaboration of tribal, state, federal and international \nagencies with jurisdiction over the management of fish and wildlife \nresources of the Great Lakes. The bill also has received favorable \nreview and broad support of organizations throughout the Great Lakes \nregion for the approach it takes toward\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\nrestoration of the ecological integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem.\n  The primary purpose of the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration \nAct is to implement proposals that address recommendations put forth by \nthe Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study. To this end, the \nAct reauthorizes the existing Great Lakes Coordination and Great Lakes \nFishery Resources Offices. The bill also sets up a proposal review \ncommittee under the guidance of the existing Council of Lake Committees \nto review grant proposals and identify projects of the highest priority \nfor the restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the Great \nLakes Basin. The Act encourages, supports, and coordinates Federal and \nnon-federal cooperative habitat restoration and natural resource \nmanagement programs in the Great Lakes Basin.\n  The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act represents a new \ngeneration of environmental legislation, one that recognizes the \ncomplexity and inter-relatedness of ecosystems. This act seeks to \naddress natural resource management in a comprehensive and \nconscientious manner by building partnerships among the Great Lakes \nstates, U.S. and Canadian governments, and native American Tribes. \nThrough regional cooperation, I believe we can address the \nenvironmental and economic concerns of the Great Lakes Basin and \ncontinue on the road towards the recovery of this precious natural and \nnational resource. By passing this legislation, we in the Congress will \nbe taking the right next step toward responsible stewardship of the \nGreat Lakes as we venture into the new millennium.\n  This fall, as I look back on the earth from space, I will be sure to \nlook down on the Great Lakes. I know that they will be a cleaner, safer \nplace for both humans and wildlife to live than they were at the time \nof my last flight because of the efforts we have made over the past \ndecades. With the passage of this legislation, I will also be sure that \nthey will continue to become even cleaner, safer places where fish and \nwildlife communities, and the human communities who enjoy them can \ncontinue to prosper.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to ask the distinguished sponsor of the \nSenate bill if he could comment on whether or not the bill, H.R. 1481, \nis intended to provide Indian Tribes in the Great Lakes region with any \nfish and wildlife management authority beyond that contained in \nexisting treaty provisions and as recognized by Federal courts.\n  Mr. GLENN. The bill's provision appointing tribal representatives to \nthe committee created by the bill is not intended to expand their \nexisting authorities.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Would the Senator from Ohio provide a further \nclarification that the Senate intends that the committee created in the \nbill will provide its recommendations under the guidance and direction \nof the Council of Lake Committees of the Great Lakes Fishery \nCommission?\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator from Michigan is correct. That is the intent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his assistance and, as \nan original cosponsor of S. 659, I applaud his efforts to move this \nimportant legislation expeditiously.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1481) was considered read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11383-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11384-S11385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM MAP CORRECTION\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, yesterday I stood with the President and \nseveral of my Democratic colleagues to call on the Republican \nleadership to focus their attention on the children of America. \nMillions of American children in schools across the United States are \nbeing denied the basic education foundation they need to succeed.\n  In Hawaii, thousands of children waited with anticipation for the new \nschool year. Parents took their children to buy school supplies, new \nclothes, and other back-to-school preparations. However, many of these \nstudents entered or returned to schools that are so inadequate that \nthey cannot receive a quality education. Our children are being asked \nto learn in environments that are not conducive to learning, and may \neven be dangerous. But still, these young, bright-eyed, captivated \nchildren go day-after-day to schools seeking to learn the wonders of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, Congress has the moral responsibility to ensure that \nwe provide our children access to quality education. President Clinton \nrecently called on Congress to enact several education initiatives that \nwill improve education facilities, ensure that the education curriculum \nchallenges and engages our students, and provide teachers and \nadministrators the resources they need to teach and support our \nchildren.\n  These proposals work together to strengthen our nation's schools. \nFirst, we need to build and modernize our nation's schools. We continue \nto demand that our workforce compete in the demanding high technology \nmarketplace, yet we educate children in schools that do not have access \nto the information superhighway, let alone the physical capabilities to \nsupport the demand for access. Many of Hawaii's schools were built over \n50 years ago, before schools required a computer in every classroom. \nFor example, I recently received a e-mail from a concerned parent whose \nchild attends Hickam Elementary School. The parents had decided to hold \na teachers' breakfast for the faculty at the school. They turned on the \nair conditioning in the office and the library and blew the fuses--the \nelectrical wiring was unable to handle the demand for the increased \nenergy required by the air conditioners. If the wiring cannot support \nair conditioners, how can it support the computers and the air \nconditioners needed to cool the rooms which house the computers? \nAlthough Hawaii is facing economic problems, we are not facing these \nproblems alone. Every day 14 million students attend schools that need \nextensive repair and replacement, like Hickam Elementary School. Almost \n60 percent of America's schools reported at least one major building \nfeature in disrepair.\n  As we continue to rely on technological advances to improve education \nfor our children, schools need to be capable of supporting these \nincreasing demands. Hickam is not the only school in Hawaii \nexperiencing this hardship; many schools in Hawaii face this problem. \nAdministrators must choose whether to cool the library so that children \ncan read and learn, or turn on the computers in their labs. This should \nnot be. We need to assist schools in making the investments to improve \nexisting facilities or allow them to build new facilities to meet the \ngrowing technological demands. We must commit ourselves to ensuring \nthat our children are able to learn in a comfortable and safe \nenvironment. That is why I support efforts to rebuild, modernize, and \nreduce overcrowding in more than 5,000 public schools through Federal \nsupport that would pay the interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to \nhelp improve the schools across the country, including Hawaii.\n  But a new school loaded with technology gizmos is not enough. \nEnsuring access to such advancements does not guarantee success. We \nmust also invest in our teachers. We chide teachers for being \nunqualified, but we fail to provide them the support needed to succeed. \nWe lament the teacher shortage, but fail to provide the resources to \nrecruit quality individuals. And, we have a growing problem with \nteacher retention, yet we fail to give teachers the respect they \ndeserve and acknowledge that teaching is a very complex and difficult \nprofession.\n  As my colleagues know, before I came to Congress, I was a teacher. I \ntaught elementary, intermediate, and high school students in Hawaii. I \nknow, firsthand, the difficulties teachers face each day in their \nclassroom. Fortunately, I taught during a time when teachers were \nrespected and appreciated. Today, however, we take teachers for \ngranted. We expect them to be teachers, counselors, and sometimes, even \npart-time parents. We fail to recognize the importance these \nindividuals have in shaping the nature of our nation's future leaders. \nI am not sure when this terrible decline began, but I know that it must \nstop. We must raise our respect for teachers and realize that they are \nnot the source of our education problems, nor are they the only\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\nones that can improve our current situation.\n  We have a responsibility to provide the resources needed to allow our \nnation's teachers to succeed. We need to increase funding for teacher \ndevelopment programs such as technology teacher training, which helps \nteachers learn to use technology effectively to improve classroom \ninstruction and enhance student learning. We need to help communities \nhire 100,000 new qualified teachers to allow schools to reduce there \nclass sizes. We need to reduce the number of out-of-field teachers, \nparticularly for new teachers who are more often assigned to teach \nsubjects outside of their field of training and often do not have the \nsupport and mentoring to assist in their development. The First Lady \nsaid, ``it takes a village to raise a child.'' I believe that, but I \nalso believe that it takes a village to teach a child. Teachers, \nparents, administrators, and communities as a whole must be committed \nto ensuring that our children are provided the assistance they need to \nobtain a quality education.\n  Children are wonderful, forthright, and open individuals, \nparticularly when they are young. It is always a treat for me to meet \nwith young students, they often have a very truthful and direct way of \nputting things into perspective. Just three weeks ago, I participated \nin a satellite conference with third grade students from Queen \nLiliuokalani Elementary School and high school students from Radford \nand Kaimuki High Schools. The high school students are participants in \nE-school, a virtual school which provides on-line and satellite \ndistance learning opportunities to students and teachers. Hawaii's \nDepartment of Education is a national leader in the virtual school \nconcept. Leveraging federal funding through the Technology Literacy \nFund and the Technology Challenge Grants, Hawaii students are able to \nlearn and receive over 21 high school credit courses for on-line \nclasses. Yet, even with these wonderful achievements in Hawaii, more \nneeds to be done. The students who participated shared with me their \nconcerns over the lack of more capable computers, the need for greater \nsecurity for the system, and the desire for more teachers who are able \nto use the system. Students want to learn, it is our responsibility to \nensure that they have the resources available to help them achieve \ntheir goals.\n\n  We know that children learn better in small classes, particularly in \nthe early childhood years, study after study has proven that class size \nmakes a difference in the achievements of our children. President \nClinton has requested $12 billion over 7 years to reduce the class size \nin grades 1 to 3. As a former teacher, I strongly believe that the \nproposal would significantly advance the educational achievements of \nour students. The average class size in the United States for grades 1 \nto 3 is 23. In Hawaii, the average class size for kindergarten through \nthird grade is 21.9. How can we expect our children to be able to learn \nwhen one teacher is required to teach 21 five- to eight-year-olds. I \nchallenge my colleagues to spend a day, just one day, at a elementary \nschool in their State to experience firsthand the challenges in getting \n21 five through eight-year-olds to pay attention to you.\n  Our responsibility should not stop with the school bell. As many as 5 \nmillion children are home alone after school each week. Hawaii was \nfortunate to have the first state-wide after-school care program. This \ninnovative program began in 1990 under the leadership of Governor \nBenjamin Cayetano while he was the Lieutenant Governor. Hawaii's A-Plus \nprogram provides after-school activities to eligible students in grades \nK through 6. The program provides supervised enrichment and physical \ndevelopment activities at 171 public schools. It is available to \neligible children and fees are based on a sliding scale from $6 to $55 \nper month.\n  However, many of our children in other states are not as fortunate. \nOnly one-third of the schools in low-income neighborhood and half the \nschools in affluent areas offer after-school programs. Full funding for \nthe 21st Century Community Learning Centers program would provide \n400,000 children in the United States access to safe learning centers, \nsimilar to those provided in Hawaii.\n  First-rate facilities, quality teachers, students ready and willing \nto learn are important ingredients needed to ensure success for our \nchildren, but that success also needs to be based on high academic \nstandards. We must set significant academic standards for our students \nto ensure that they will be able to compete in the growing global \neconomy. We should increase funding for Goals 2000 to assist states in \nraising and setting academic standards that challenge and motivate \nstudents. We need to expand funding for Title I to provide the means \nfor disadvantaged communities to develop and maintain high academic \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, our schools are in disrepair, our classrooms are \novercrowded, our teachers are overburdened, our children need our help \nnow. We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to provide modern, \nsafe facilities, reduce class sizes, provide the support for children \noutside of the classrooms, and support and help recruit and retain \nwell-qualified teachers. I urge my Senate colleagues to make a \nconcerted effort to address this vital national problem. The \nimplications of ignoring or delaying our obligation may have \nramifications that may not be so easily corrected.\n  Our nation's children are depending upon us to make the sacrifice and \ndo what needs to be done. We must stand up and meet this challenge, if \nwe do not, we will have failed our nation's children--our nation's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11386-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11387-S11388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \ndelivered earlier this afternoon by my friend, the senior Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Nickles) regarding the International Religious Freedom \nAct. I commend him and Senator Lieberman for their leadership in \nadvancing this legislation. I congratulate their willingness to work \nwith the Administration and all interested parties to craft legislation \nthat is inclusive, that preserves many options for the President, yet \nis strong and effective in addressing religious persecution around the \nworld. The revisions suggested and accepted in the spirit of compromise \nhave not weakened the core purpose or value of this legislation.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of foreign relations \nlegislation this Congress will consider during this session. It \nproposes action against religious persecution worldwide, and \nestablishes a structure by which the United States can more effectively \ninvestigate, monitor, and address serious violations of religious \nfreedom, an internationally recognized human right, as well as an issue \nof concern to all people of faith.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act is a necessary step to ensure \nthat religious persecution will not be tolerated in our conduct of \nforeign policy. S. 1868 seeks to promote religious freedom by \nestablishing an Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty, a Special \nAdvisor within the White House on Religious Persecution, and a \nbipartisan Commission on International Religious Liberty. It also \nprovides the President with an array of options, including economic \nsanctions, which he can use to respond to countries that engage in or \ncondone religious persecution. The measure in no way constricts or \nmandates the conduct of American foreign policy.\n  This is not a Republican bill or a Democratic bill, a conservative or \nliberal proposal, or an effort to protect or promote any one faith. It \nis supported by the Episcopal Church, the Christian Coalition, the \nAnti-Defamation League (ADL), Catholic organizations, and other \nreligious and human rights associations across the country. Indeed, it \nis an ecumenical effort supported by a bipartisan group in Congress, \nand it enjoys wide support among all people of faith and supporters of \nhuman rights. This is why I was honored to join Senator Nickles, \nLieberman, Specter, and Coats, Congressmen Wolf and Clement, and a \ndiverse coalition of religious leaders this morning to urge \nCongressional action on the International Religious Freedom Act before \nadjournment.\n  As a longtime supporter of human rights, the defense of the right to \nreligious freedom is as significant as IMF funding and our ongoing \nefforts to deal with the international financial crisis. Sadly, many of \nthe conflicts we are\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\nwitnessing today have religious intolerance at their core. It is my \nstrong belief that if we in the United States, our allies in other \nnations and people of faith around the world speak out about religious \nliberty and call attention to religious persecution, and bring positive \nforces to bear in defense of religious freedom, we can advance \nunderstanding and respect for this basic human right and prevent \nreligious intolerance from festering and exploding into conflict and \nviolence.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11387-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11388-S11389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE QUESTION OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had the opportunity a few moments ago \nto hear the distinguished Senator from Delaware talk about his views \nand his analysis and his historical perspective from his extensive \nresearch on the question of impeachment. I found it instructive, full \nof much good insight and food for thought, and I agreed with the vast \nmajority of it.\n  We ought to be respectful and responsive as we go through this \nprocess. It may be that it will never even get to this body. I \ncertainly don't hear many Senators making speeches about it. We don't \nhave any hearings going on in this body concerning impeachment. It is \nsolely a decision to be made by the House first, and only then would we \nbegin to focus on it. And I think that is the way it should be.\n  So far as I can tell, our attention in this body, the U.S. Senate, \nhas in fact been on appropriations bills and other legislation that is \nimportant for the American people, and I am glad that is what has been \nhappening.\n  I agree that the founders were concerned about the abuse of the \nimpeachment process, and well they should be. They were wise people. \nThey knew there were dangers and they discussed whether or not to have \nimpeachment. But the important thing is they did adopt an impeachment \nprocess and they set it forth in the Constitution with good clarity, \nand it requires a majority vote in the House to impeach and a two-\nthirds vote of the sitting Members of the U.S. Senate, with the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court presiding, I assume in the President's \nchair. He would preside and manage the action on the floor. It would be \na controlled environment with the case being presented by managers from \nthe House following the historical rules of procedure. I believe \nimpeachment proceedings would be handled in a dignified and proper \nmanner. Certainly, that process is part of our Constitution and it is \nsomething we ought not to treat lightly.\n  Now, as to the question of politics, I, and I think every Member of \nthis body, would be careful and very diligent to ensure that any \ndecision they made concerning such a momentous subject as impeachment \nwould be made on the law, on the facts, and on what is fair and just.\n  I do not believe politics will control this process, but, of course, \nto get the 67 votes, the necessary two-thirds, a substantial number of \nDemocrats would have to vote for conviction before such an event could \noccur. So I think the framers thought it out carefully, and they have \ndone a very good job in planning it out.\n  I hope that we do not talk politics in such a way that we create a \npolitical situation. I know the House is dealing with procedure: Some \nwant to do it this way; some want to do it that way and some want to do \nit another way. Often these are legitimate debates. Who knows precisely \nhow some of these procedural steps should be accomplished? Now, if \nevery time you lose a vote you say it is politics and accuse the other \nside of politics, the charge of playing politics can be thrown back on \nthe person making the accusation.\n  I think both groups--the people who are supporting the President and \nwant to see him succeed, and those who are politically opposed to him--\nboth need to be careful to ensure that what they do is fair and is \nperceived as creating a positive environment, as was done by Senator \nHoward Baker during Watergate. He didn't always agree with everyone, \nbut he conducted himself in a way that brought respect to the system.\n  I think both parties, the Republican and the Democratic Parties, and \nMembers of the House and Senate need to be careful about how we conduct \nourselves and avoid politics and try to decide these matters on what is \nright and fair and just.\n  I don't know what others might say, but I was a Federal prosecutor. I \nhad the opportunity over the years to be before grand juries hundreds \nof times. Perhaps, I have presented a thousand cases to a grand jury. I \nhave seen people testify and tell the truth at great pain to \nthemselves.\n  I would agree with Senator Biden that it just may be that as a matter \nof law, we are not in this body compelled to any conclusion because the \nPresident may have committed perjury. At the same time, I want us to \nnot denigrate, not to too lightly respect the obligation of every \ncitizen, when they are called in a civil case or a criminal case and \nplaced under oath, to tell the truth, because when we do not have \ntruth-telling in the judicial system, then the whole legal system is \ncorrupted and can be undermined. That is so fundamental.\n  I have seen witnesses sweat drops of blood, but they told the truth. \nA businessman lately told me: ``I had to give a deposition and it never \noccurred to me I was not required to tell the truth.''\n  A few years ago, I had occasion to prosecute a young police officer \nwho was, basically, I think the driver for the chief of police, a \ncontroversial chief of police, in my hometown. I liked him. He was an \naggressive young African-American officer and made some good community-\nbased changes. There were people with different views about things, and \nthe young officer made some statements that were not true, and a \nlawsuit was filed. He testified in that lawsuit and later admitted what \nhe said was not true.\n  It caused a big controversy in town, and in the newspapers. The \npeople were upset, they didn't know whether the chief deserved to be \nkept in office or not. Finally, we found out it wasn't true. I was U.S. \nattorney then. We returned an indictment against that young officer for \nperjury in a civil case because he abused the legal system. He \ncorrupted the legal system and caused great public damage and turmoil \nin the community.\n  I don't know what the standards are here. I don't expect to be \nprejudging what ought to occur in this body. But I want to say, as \nsomeone who has spent 15 years, really 17 years as a prosecutor, as \nsomeone who has been in court all my life professionally, and having \nseen these kinds of cases, I am telling you, we don't ever want to get \nin a situation in this country where we treat lightly the act of \ntestifying falsely in a court of law. I mean that very sincerely and \nfrom my heart.\n  The President of the United States takes an oath to faithfully \nexecute the duties of the Office of President, and one of those duties \nis to faithfully ``take care that the laws of the United States be \nfaithfully executed''.\n  I think the Senator from Delaware has given us much insight and much \nfood for thought. He said these are stark and momentous decisions, and \nthey are. But at the same time, he said something else that was just \nright. He quoted his father saying, ``This country is so big, so \nstrong, so solid; we can handle an awful lot.'' I really believe that.\n  The process is set out in the Constitution and, as the Senator from \nDelaware said, this is not a constitutional crisis. Some way, we will \nget through it. If we follow what the Constitution says, if we let the \nHouse do its duty, and if they vote impeachment, it will come over \nhere; if they don't vote impeachment, it won't come over here. It is \nset out clearly in the Constitution. I don't think there will be any \ndoubt about the procedure to follow. I am much comforted, as I have \nstudied the Constitution in that regard, that there won't be much \nconfusion or doubt about how this process ought to be handled.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments. They are \ninsightful and important. All of us need to begin to think about this. \nI don't think we are required to be mute and not say anything about \nwhat is obviously taking place around us, never expressing an opinion \nabout anything relating to this matter. This is not that kind of \nprocess. I think we ought to be careful\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\nand respectful and, above all, fair and just as we do this process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11388-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRITIUM PRODUCTION PROVISION IN THE STROM THURMOND NATIONAL DEFENSE \n                 AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on another subject, and the primary \npurpose of my being here this afternoon is to talk about the issue of \ntritium. It was a much debated issue in the Armed Services Committee \nbill.\n  I thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nStrom Thurmond, for his outstanding leadership, his commitment to this \ncountry and his dedication to America. He, at age 40, volunteered to \nfight--he was a judge--he forced his way into World War II, went off to \nEurope and volunteered on D-Day not just to land, he volunteered to get \nin one of the glider planes that they pulled up and let go and flew \nover the enemy lines and landed who knows where, in Belgium or \nsomewhere near, to form commando groups to assist in the invasion \neffort.\n  Senator Thurmond recounted, when they asked him how rough the landing \nwas, ``Well, I'll just say you didn't have to open the door, you could \njust walk out the side of the plane.'' It is kind of hard to land one \nof those things in hedgerows and who knows what else when they are \ncoming down. He served his country.\n  I asked him, ``What happened after the surrender of Germany? Were you \nthere all the way to the surrender, Strom?''\n  He said, ``Yes,'' he was there until the day of the surrender, and \nthen he was put on a train and sent to the Pacific, but Japan \nsurrendered before he reached the battlefront in the Pacific.\n  He is a true patriot and has done an outstanding job on this entire \ndefense bill--the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act. I \ndo appreciate his willingness to work with us as we endeavored to reach \na compromise on the question of tritium.\n  There was a colloquy on the floor of this body yesterday between \nSenator Warner, Senator Kyl and Senator Robert Smith. Due to Hurricane \nGeorges ravaging my hometown of Mobile, AL, I was not able to be \nhere. But I appreciate Senator Warner's expressed concern for the \npeople of our State during that colloquy. I would like to make a few \ncomments, since I was not able to be here at that time.\n\n  First and foremost, tritium is an essential element for maintaining \nthe safety, security and reliability of a national nuclear weapons \nstockpile. Without it, as Senator Jon Kyl alluded to yesterday, we \nplace our ability to meet our stockpile needs under the START I treaty, \nby 2005, in a precarious situation.\n  Therefore, regardless of how passionate we may become in debating the \nmerits of the options on this issue, let there be no doubt that the \ncore of this discussion lies in the U.S. national interests. And we \ncannot compromise that issue. We cannot compromise the national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  For the last several years, the Department of Energy has been \npursuing a dual-track strategy in considering two technologies for \ntritium production: One is a commercial light water reactor and the \nother a proton accelerator. I firmly believe it was premature for the \nHouse of Representatives to engage in a political effort that would \nhave eliminated one of those options; that is, the commercial light \nwater reactor option.\n  I personally believe that the commercial light water reactor option \nwould be the most cost-effective and is the most proven way to produce \ntritium. So, we will have that debate coming up next year. We will go \ninto some detail about it.\n  But beyond my own personal belief in the commercial light water \nreactor option, I continue to be committed to the support of the role \nthat the experts at the Department of Energy and the Department of \nDefense must have to select the best option. We have had a process that \nhas been going on for 2 years to have them analyze the options and make \na selection. I believe they are better suited to deal with these \ntechnological questions than are Members of the House and the Senate.\n  So I worked hard, along with Senator Shelby and Congressman Robert \nAderholt and Bob Riley and Bud Cramer, and other Senate and House \ncolleagues with the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House \nNational Security Committee on this issue.\n  We did what we could to raise the issue. We let everyone who would \nlisten know we were making a mistake to allow the politics of the \nmoment rule the day. The amendment to eliminate the commerical light \nwater reactor option was never debated in the House, but was attached \nto a large defense bill, and boom, passed. There was no discussion or \ndebate on a measure that interrupted and abrogated the almost 2 years \nof study on tritium production by the Department of Energy.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about it. We concluded, according \nto recent CBO studies--that the accelerator option would cost between \n$4 billion and $13 billion more than the commercial light water \nreactor. That is a lot of money. We do not have $4, $5, $6, $7 billion \nor more to waste on that process.\n  So we have not had the final decision. The Department of Energy is \nanalyzing it. They need to be allowed to complete their analysis. And \nthat is what I believe was achieved in this bill. The process was \nallowed to continue. It was delayed somewhat, but I do not think it was \ndelayed too long. But the Department of Energy will make its decision. \nAnd next year I suppose we will make our decision in this body, and \nthen in the other body, as to how tritium should be produced and in \nwhat process.\n  So I am pleased that we have reached this accord. Senator Lott stated \nyesterday that ``we cannot afford to delay this program.'' I cannot \nagree more. And I hope this message is understood as we go forward to \nreaching a final solution on the production of tritium, an essential \ncomponent for our nuclear arsenal.\n  In June, I entered a number of letters in the Congressional Record on \nthis issue. We had letters from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary \nCohen, and from the then Secretary of Energy, Secretary Pena, and the \nWhite House--all expressing grave concern about a political decision on \na scientific, technical and defense issue. And Senator Carl Levin, my \ngood friend from Michigan, was very strong in resisting this effort \nthat had begun in the House of Representatives. So we now find \nourselves on the right path again.\n  Secretary Richardson needs to move forward deliberately and \naggressively in selecting the proper option. The Department's \nimplementation plan must be submitted early next year and should be \ncarefully considered by this body, thoroughly debated and swiftly acted \nupon.\n  The majority leader, Trent Lott, and others have indicated they will \nbe thoroughly engaged in the debate when it comes. This is the next and \nlogical step in the tritium story. Its outcome will provide a roadmap \nto a future guarantee for our Nation's security. I plan to be engaged \nin that important debate. I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11389-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11389-S11399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL SALVAGE MOTOR VEHICLE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, today, I want to talk to my colleagues about \nused cars. No, I don't want to sell one, I want to talk about how my \ncolleagues have worked to protect every American who purchases a used \ncar.\n  Mr. President, the Title Branding Bill that I co-authored with \nSenator Ford passed this chamber by unanimous consent. This significant \nconsumer protection legislation is long overdue. It will protect you \nand other consumers from unknowingly buying a severely damaged auto \nfrom dishonest rebuilders.\n  Our bill will help eliminate the growing fraud of selling rebuilt \nvehicles that have been ``totaled'' and then sold to consumers who are \nnever informed of the vehicle's damage history. This deceptive practice \ncosts Americans nearly $4 billion annually. Today, Congress has helped \nsolve this $4 billion problem.\n  Mr. President, here is another statistic that scares me, and should \nalso scare our colleagues. It is estimated that each year, one million \ncars are totaled, rebuilt, and put back on the roads. As you go home \ntonight try to imagine which car around you is one of the million put \nback this year.\n  Clearly Senator Ford and I have addressed an issue that affects \neveryone--those who buy and drive used cars and those who share the \nroads with them. Remember, that's one million totaled cars per year \nthat are structurally unsafe to drive. These previously totaled cars \nand trucks are put back on our roads here in DC, in my home state of \nMississippi, and all across the nation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that some states require disclosure on a \nvehicle's title to indicate its damage history, however, these \nrequirements vary from state to state. As a result, unscrupulous re-\nbuilders can take advantage of the inconsistencies in state titling \nprocedures to obtain what are known as ``clean or washed'' titles. \nAdopting a uniform federal standard will eliminate this problem by \nclosing the loopholes.\n  In 1992, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a taskforce to study the problems related to motor vehicle \ntitling, and more importantly, the specific problems that have \ncontributed to this serious consumer fraud. The taskforce included all \nstakeholders representing a wide array of interests. This diverse group \nprovided specific recommendations that became the foundation upon which \nSenator Ford and I built S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nConsumer Protection Act. Mr. President, our goal is simple and direct--\nto protect Americans on our roads with a uniform disclosure standard.\n  Mr. President, contrary to what some people believe, our bill is not \na federal mandate on the states. The bill does not restrict the ability \nof states to adopt higher ``damage disclosure'' requirements. Rather \nthis bill provides the basic minimum federal standard while giving \nstates the necessary flexibility to adopt more regulations if they so \nchoose.\n  As a result of our bipartisan effort, we have a bill that I firmly \nbelieve will benefit individuals, state motor vehicle administrators, \nautomobile dealers, insurance companies and policy holders, consumer \ngroups, salvage yards and many others involved in used car commerce.\n  Our bill requires that if a salvage vehicle is rebuilt, it must have \na theft inspection, as well as any required state safety inspection, \nand a branded title must be obtained before the vehicle is considered \nroad-worthy. In addition, all rebuilt salvage vehicles must have a \ndecal permanently affixed to the driver's door jamb, and its window, \nindicating that the vehicle has been rebuilt and specifying whether the \nvehicle has passed an approved safety inspection.\n  In the future, a vehicle's title will disclose the damage history \nwith a uniform minimum standard. A brand from one state will be carried \nforward to any new state in which the vehicle is registered. And, \nirreparably damaged vehicles' Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) will \nbe tracked to help address automobile theft. I would also like to point \nout that while civil damages may be recovered by those who are victims \nof these fraudulent schemes, this bill will not prohibit currently \npermitted private rights of action.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a major step toward reducing motor \nvehicle titling fraud, improving consumer protection and disclosing \nvaluable information to every American, their families and friends \nabout a vehicle's damage history.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this bill has been crafted in \na bipartisan fashion. I want to thank my Commerce Committee colleague \nfrom Kentucky, the Minority Whip, Senator Ford, for co-authoring this \nlegislation with me. This bill is a fitting tribute to protect \nconsumers as my friend retires from the Senate this year.\n  I also greatly appreciate the support and cosponsorship of 57 of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, including the distinguished Minority Leader, \nSenator Daschle. I also appreciate the efforts of Senator McCain for \nhis stewardship as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. \nAdditionally, I want to thank Senator Hollings for his input and \ncontributions to this legislative approach. I also want to commend my \nfriend and colleague from Washington State, Senator Gorton, for his \ndiligent work over the past several months to improve this bill. \nSenators Levin and Feinstein also deserve recognition for their efforts \nto provide states with maximum flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate \nall of my colleagues for passing this important nonpartisan measure by \nunanimous consent. It is another example of how this Congress can put \naside partisan differences and deliver significant legislation for the \nAmerican people.\n  In this particular case, it demonstrates that my colleagues are \nserious about protecting American consumers from fraud. By promoting \nthe use of a uniform disclosure standard, Congress will help put \ndishonest rebuilders out of business, save consumers and automobile \ndealers as much as $4 billion annually, and keep 1 million totaled \nvehicles from being put back on the road each year.\n  I would like to take a moment and recognize a few people who made \nthis legislative effort successful. The first is Mr. Al East of East \nFord in Jackson, Mississippi. Mr. East, a past president of the \nMississippi National Automobile Dealers Association, identified the \nproblem facing consumers and dealers in my home state and across the \ncountry\n  As an automobile dealer himself, Mr. East knows first hand the \ntremendous cost that title washing has on the used car industry. Al \nEast's dedication to his clients, his community and to American \nautomobile industry, and his work on the Board of Directors for the \nNational Automobile Dealers Association has positively effected this \nmuch needed legislation.\n  I also want to recognize Ruddy Dossett, of Dossett Big Four in \nTupelo, Mississippi for his testimony before the Commerce Committee.\n  Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the Congressional staff who \nlabored on the details. They include Clay Williams and Steven Apicella \nfrom my office, Lance Bultena, Jim Drewery and Moses Boyd from the \nCommerce Committee, David Regan from Senator Ford's office, and Jeanne \nBumpus, from Senator Gorton's office. Each made a significant and \ntangible contribution to the bill. Each had the used car consumer in \nmind as they dotted the i's and the t's.\n  As you are aware Mr. President, the House of Representatives took up \na different companion bill last year that passed by an overwhelming \nmajority. I call upon the House to complete the legislative process by \nworking with the Senate's conferees and by ultimately passing this \nimportant automobile titling legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud that members from both sides of the \naisle are continuing to fulfill the peoples' business.\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\n  By passing this title branding bill today, the Senate has taken an \nimportant step toward removing structurally unsafe cars and trucks that \nwould otherwise share the roads with our friends, neighbors, and loved \nones. On behalf of all American motorists, I thank all my colleagues \nfor voting in favor of this important pro-consumer, anti-fraud, anti-\ncriminal legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/02/senate-section/article/S11389-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL 11 A.M., MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
